00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,160
actinflab live stream number 41.1

5
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,360
it's april 6 2022.

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,840
welcome to the actin flap we're a

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,920
participatory online lab that is

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,000
communicating learning and practicing

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,239
applied active inference

10
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,320
this is a recorded and an archived live

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,079
stream so please provide us with

12
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,360
feedback so we can improve on our work

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,120
all backgrounds and perspectives are

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,440
welcome here and we'll be following good

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,920
video etiquette for livestream

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,520
if you want to learn more about any

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,319
actinflab activities head over to

18
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,159
activeinference.org

19
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,119
and you can learn more there

20
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,200
all right today in

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,799
stream number 41.1 we are continuing to

22
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,040
learn and discuss the paper

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,520
extended active inference

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,840
constructing predictive cognition beyond

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,720
skulls by constant clark kirchoff and

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,119
fristen from 2020

27
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,080
and

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,880
today in the dot one we're going to have

29
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,640
some introductions

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,840
revisit the road map and some of the big

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,600
questions of the paper

32
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,840
and then we can have an open discussion

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,399
around the figures formalism anything

34
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,479
else that people think is relevant and

35
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,960
for those who are watching live feel

36
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,000
free to add any questions or comments in

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,119
the live chat

38
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,600
so we can start just by saying hello um

39
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,880
hearing perhaps blue's first thoughts on

40
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,640
uh the paper and from dean and i we can

41
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,000
revisit

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,280
what we've been thinking about

43
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,239
potentially since the dot zero which

44
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,120
i'll save for soon so i'm daniel i'm a

45
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,599
researcher in california and i'll pass

46
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,239
it to d

47
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,920
thanks daniel i'm dean i'm up here in

48
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,440
calgary i'm a little nasally today

49
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,680
because i'm fighting off a bit of a cold

50
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,599
um what i've been thinking about since

51
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,560
we

52
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,879
did the dot zero is the

53
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,640
sort of the

54
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,360
the idea around how cognition is maybe

55
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,480
cultural

56
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,760
and i'll just leave it at that because

57
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,800
maybe we can have a bit of a

58
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,040
conversation about that today i'll pass

59
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,440
it to blue

60
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,280
hi i'm blue i'm an independent research

61
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,680
consultant in new mexico

62
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,640
and i um yeah okay so i'll give some

63
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,879
first thoughts on the paper

64
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,760
um one thing that really stuck out to me

65
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,680
was um the idea of glue and truth

66
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,400
so

67
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,920
um that like gave a whole new like level

68
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,840
like so so in order for you to have like

69
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,599
extended cognition

70
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,599
you have to believe in it and you have

71
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,560
to

72
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,159
you have to be glued to it like you have

73
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,760
to have access to it whenever you need

74
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,599
it and you have to believe that it's

75
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,519
valid right so that that's the glue and

76
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,120
truth idea that they unpacked in the

77
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,879
paper and um

78
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,560
it gave like a whole new

79
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,319
meaning of like being glued to your

80
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,519
phone to me like i was like oh this is

81
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,760
why we're always glued to our phone

82
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,040
there's glue and there's truth right um

83
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,000
so that was kind of interesting and then

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,239
um definitely like

85
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,400
uh to touch on what dean was saying i

86
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,879
think that

87
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,680
the cognition and betting in culture is

88
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,360
a super interesting aspect and like in

89
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,920
the very last section of the paper they

90
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,760
were talking about like the ability to

91
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,400
give like theater like plays without

92
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,959
being able to rehearse just based on

93
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,599
cultural cues and knowing the context

94
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,319
and just being so well versed and how to

95
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,200
cue off of each other or um this kind of

96
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,879
thing and it reminded me like of maybe

97
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,760
like a jazz improv like we know like

98
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,439
what's acceptable or like when you're

99
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,959
playing when you have like a jam band

100
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,400
and you're playing all the time like you

101
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,519
kind of just

102
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,000
know where to pick off or or you know

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,918
daniel and i are constantly leaving

104
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,079
stigmatic traces like like there's like

105
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,160
this extended cognition that i see

106
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,360
happen like we'll both be doing the same

107
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,720
thing at the same time like i was just

108
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,560
doing that like uh it's hard to

109
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,280
eliminate redundancy um in those kinds

110
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,240
of circumstances so so there is like the

111
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,440
shared culture and how like

112
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,520
central like even because culture yes we

113
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,320
have culture as a human society but like

114
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,479
within the elizabethan theater companies

115
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,120
there's their own culture right of

116
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,160
i don't know how many people were in the

117
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,639
theater company 20. so so like there's

118
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,160
that and being able to cue off of each

119
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,520
other and like you know the active

120
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,520
inference lab which is growing every day

121
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,120
um reach out if you haven't yet signed

122
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,199
up to be a participant

123
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,000
um

124
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,840
so like within the active inference lab

125
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,440
like where we have our community and we

126
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,560
have like you know some people we

127
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,080
interact with on a very regular basis

128
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,080
and then others less so and so we're

129
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,919
kind of able to cue off of each other in

130
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,680
that kind of way and so

131
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,320
how does this go out to like your

132
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,840
religious culture

133
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,960
your

134
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,840
state culture like your country culture

135
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,479
like let alone society at large so so

136
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,240
this idea of cultural

137
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,520
cognition i think is very um

138
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,840
like salient uh

139
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,440
and also like

140
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,840
really um speaks to the iq tests or not

141
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,960
not iq tests but even like childhood

142
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,199
development and learning like in some

143
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,280
cultures when you give a child you know

144
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,440
some pieces and do a demonstration for

145
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,199
them of how to like you know stack

146
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,039
blocks together or how to like make a

147
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,919
lego thing um in some cultures like i

148
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,320
mean especially in the west we see like

149
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,479
a child who assembles the blocks like

150
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,360
maybe starts off how the demonstration

151
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,960
happened but then like does some new

152
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,039
innovative stuff like we see a child

153
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,360
like that oh that's so like creative and

154
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,319
what an ingenious way to use these you

155
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,639
know tools in a novel way but in some

156
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,639
cultures like that child must be an

157
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,479
idiot why isn't he just replicating like

158
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,479
what the adults showed him how to do um

159
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,160
and that's a legit like cultural

160
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,080
phenomenon that speaks to intelligence

161
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,039
and um yeah okay sorry i rambled enough

162
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,600
you've got my thoughts

163
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,960
awesome well

164
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,720
at least we know there'll be a lot to

165
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,600
jump

166
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,000
into

167
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,319
let's uh

168
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,440
return to the big question so for more

169
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,520
background of course people can

170
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,960
read the paper or check out the dot zero

171
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,479
but let's just pick up with the big

172
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,160
question and then the road map and then

173
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,840
we'll kind of jump into the more

174
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,960
unstructured slides

175
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,360
as we

176
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,000
framed it here the question of this

177
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,800
paper about extended cognition is about

178
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,440
how cognition is extended

179
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,280
and the way that the authors approach

180
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,520
that is this perspective of the

181
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,560
cognitive niche which they develop from

182
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,800
the perspectives that are focused on

183
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,599
here in this paper with this dialectic

184
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,520
of the cognitive niche consisting of a

185
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,360
psychological habit

186
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,360
from ecological psychology one can think

187
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,720
of as well as a functional behav a habit

188
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,680
like a neuro-behavioral habit and they

189
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,000
also have a selective

190
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,080
ecological evolutionary perspective on

191
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,560
the cognitive niche that axial constant

192
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,960
and others have developed in other work

193
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,880
but in this paper they were focused

194
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,520
mostly on um the psychological and the

195
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,840
functional and the time scale of

196
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,840
behavioral ecology rather than

197
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,680
evolutionary ecology but this is all

198
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
kind of in the background so they focus

199
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,000
on the psychological and functional

200
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,479
dimensions of the cognitive niche

201
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,680
and use that to sort of navigate and

202
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,039
triangulate

203
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,560
cognitive extensions so any other ways

204
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,800
to think about it or just what did other

205
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,599
people think of were just like a big

206
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,440
question that would

207
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,360
maybe mention active inference or not

208
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,800
but what is the kind of question that

209
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,960
leads somebody to want to read this

210
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,400
paper and understand what they're

211
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,878
conveying

212
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
yeah

213
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,919
i think one of the interesting things

214
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,080
here is that if you

215
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,840
encounter something that you don't

216
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,599
believe is an extension or a

217
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,160
continuation of the prior culture

218
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,319
so you're walking into a new habitat

219
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,240
we'll just call it that

220
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,799
what what does that then imply in terms

221
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,958
of your ability to cognit

222
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,159
as a newbie cogni cognitively extend

223
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,159
into that situation

224
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,919
i think that's what this paper is really

225
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,920
interesting uh in terms of discussing

226
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,120
because

227
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,959
not so long ago there were a couple of

228
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,160
um researchers writers glave and wagner

229
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,800
who talked about um experiential

230
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,399
learning and how you could be on the

231
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,680
periphery

232
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
of a of a culture

233
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,279
and you would slowly move your way

234
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,959
closer and closer to whatever the core

235
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,200
of that culture is this doesn't speak to

236
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,160
the

237
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,000
the cultural aspects of cognitive

238
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,080
extension in that way

239
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,360
so

240
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,959
my question is

241
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,360
when you when you walk into a new

242
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,959
culture or something that you don't feel

243
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,720
that you're necessarily

244
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,880
um familiar with

245
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,399
how does how does your

246
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,880
cognitive extension get taken up in that

247
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,600
new culture

248
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,240
yes as opposed to opposed to the

249
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,080
participants in the culture right

250
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,320
there's there's two components to this

251
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,000
it's how the people will treat you for

252
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,240
example but it's how the culture treats

253
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,560
you as well so there's two parts to that

254
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,920
and i just i think that's really

255
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,200
interesting they haven't broken it out

256
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,720
in this paper per se

257
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,480
but they certainly lead to that kind of

258
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,160
question because of the

259
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,600
the research and the argument that

260
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,720
they've been able to put forward

261
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,880
nice um

262
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,680
three researchers walk into a new habit

263
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,000
is it a psychological habit is it a

264
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,079
functional habit and then that makes me

265
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,320
think about like the culture of a music

266
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,839
festival or something when you're at the

267
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,160
periphery there's people who are just

268
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,920
joining like you are or people who are

269
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,839
leaving or people who want a little bit

270
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,560
of a space away from the main action but

271
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,720
using that sort of inner and outer

272
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,839
culture idea

273
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,360
very interesting yep

274
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,399
so

275
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,320
the idea of being like a newcomer is

276
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,640
pretty interesting in in this context

277
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,880
because there has to be some kind of

278
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,640
reciprocity

279
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,519
um

280
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,440
that like you are

281
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,000
expecting the niche to be a certain way

282
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,920
or maybe you learn the ways of the niche

283
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,839
you don't really have an expectation or

284
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,680
you know like how your old niche was and

285
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,880
you carry that forward with some

286
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,519
prediction but as the niche is updating

287
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,920
you you are also updating the niche and

288
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,160
so as the culture is updating you

289
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,200
singular you yeah um you are also

290
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,000
updating the culture and it goes around

291
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,040
and around like that and i think um

292
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,800
or or i wonder

293
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,000
what

294
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
degree we all

295
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,079
update our culture like what is the

296
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,240
single characteristic maybe it's like a

297
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,320
big five personality trait or maybe it's

298
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,440
a

299
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,920
you know some kind of enneagram type or

300
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,760
maybe there's a single

301
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,120
dominating

302
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,600
thing that makes you have a strong

303
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,519
influence on

304
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,320
the culture around you or is it just

305
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,240
like the rate at which you transmit

306
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,000
information or the number of people that

307
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
you transmit information to i mean we

308
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,760
all know that like those nodes that are

309
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,600
hot spots in like you know social

310
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,360
networks are you know like they're the

311
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,279
influential nodes that have the billions

312
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,640
of connections

313
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,079
um so is it just the number of

314
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,800
connections that you have the level of

315
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,320
information that you transmit or the

316
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,600
quantity of information that you

317
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,240
transmit or or is there something like

318
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,160
some personality trait that actually

319
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,120
gives you

320
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,519
the ability to update your culture more

321
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,800
influentially than others

322
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,519
one last quick one last quick point i

323
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,360
want to kind of build on blue's point

324
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,399
there

325
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,279
so part of this and i and i'm i'm using

326
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,200
terminology that's not part of the paper

327
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,600
but i think

328
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,519
we could look at in cult and culturation

329
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,200
as a kind of a form of domestic domestic

330
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,360
would you domesticate

331
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,399
right

332
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,040
and so i'm not sure when a person walks

333
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,639
into a new culture

334
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,399
whether they're perceived as sort of

335
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,639
non-domesticated and then we're going to

336
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,160
get them caught up or brought up to

337
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,320
speed in terms of what the culture is

338
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
and i agree with you blue it is a

339
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,680
circular thing

340
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,200
i just wonder where there's a certain

341
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,880
amount of wildness that's brought in

342
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,560
when somebody new

343
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,720
is sort of thrown into the

344
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,399
the bigger cultural

345
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,800
pot and whether there's an effort to try

346
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,360
to bring them to be more influential on

347
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,519
the on the one than the one being

348
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,079
influential on the many so i always

349
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,680
always i'm always curious about those

350
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,440
things and i don't think that this is

351
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,279
going to get answered right now but i

352
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,959
think that's an important point to sort

353
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,959
of remember especially when we get into

354
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,880
the flipping part here which i can see

355
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,519
daniel's already got the

356
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,959
graph up so let's go there

357
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,200
we will come there

358
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,120
it just made me think about when the

359
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,120
niche is um not other people so going on

360
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,880
a walk through the forest and the niche

361
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,800
is going to be like other

362
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,800
trees or just the path itself

363
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,519
um

364
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,480
this kind of figure two representation

365
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
where there's an active process by which

366
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,639
not just is the entity doing action

367
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,639
selection with respect to the niche but

368
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,399
the niche is basically being agentified

369
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,560
and it is taking some sort of active

370
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,160
process by which it is doing an

371
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,240
inference on the entity and in the

372
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,920
forest it's like whoa are the trees

373
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,079
alive you know is this lord of the rings

374
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,639
but if this is another group of people

375
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,880
and this is your social niche and your

376
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,000
psychological and functional habitat is

377
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,279
other people

378
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,399
then it is like quite literal this could

379
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,800
be two people in conversation or this

380
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,760
could be one versus multiple and so in

381
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,480
the social and cognitive and cultural

382
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,240
niche

383
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,040
it is like less of a um

384
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,519
leap to talk about how there's cognitive

385
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,079
processes on both sides but then that

386
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,839
helps us recognize that actually it is a

387
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,320
continuum it's like okay so if we can

388
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,199
very clearly see how in the conversation

389
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,800
there's this optimization happening on

390
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,680
both sides then what does that look like

391
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,800
when we're in the forest okay cool so

392
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,760
some of those big questions have been

393
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,440
raised and then let's just

394
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,760
revise the road map

395
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,079
and see where they went on their little

396
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,720
forest journey and then we'll jump back

397
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,360
into the slides and um

398
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,120
the go from there

399
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,480
so they introduced the cognitive niche

400
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,480
active inference and extended mind

401
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,760
concepts

402
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,920
and then discussed the argument that

403
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
they're going to lead us down

404
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,519
and the way in which active inference

405
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,360
plays into it

406
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,839
as we mentioned just recently

407
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,639
they're focusing on the functional and

408
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,040
psychological aspects of the cognitive

409
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,000
niche

410
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,560
leaving for later that eco-evolutionary

411
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,839
perspective

412
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,680
and they're using active inference as an

413
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
integrative framework and set of

414
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,519
formalisms to help address that they

415
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,839
go through cognitive psychological and

416
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,320
functional niches provide a case study

417
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,759
with earthworms

418
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,000
and have several figures that we spent a

419
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,959
lot of time in the dot zero looking at

420
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,440
where in figure 1 there was somewhat of

421
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,759
an active entity in a niche

422
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,519
that could have its own dynamics but

423
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,680
then figure 2

424
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,600
introduced the idea that the niche is

425
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,440
also doing something like what the

426
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,720
entity is doing but with a symmetry so

427
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,560
same same but different

428
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,000
and then

429
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,560
after that discussion they

430
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,639
take the full turn towards extended

431
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,160
active inference eai and they recognize

432
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,000
well if the

433
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,680
niche or whatever is on the other side

434
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,040
of the entity in the way that we're

435
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,720
modeling it is doing something cognitive

436
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,759
is that a way in which we can recognize

437
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,680
boundaries and interfaces as well as

438
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,000
distributed or extended cognitive

439
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,279
processes

440
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,639
they approach that from a few different

441
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,519
angles like extension through space

442
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,839
spatial extension as well as extension

443
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,480
through time temporal extension

444
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,720
related to diachronic cognition through

445
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,519
time

446
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,839
and then they also discussed a few

447
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,000
pieces uh related to for example

448
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,759
epistemic actions

449
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,079
and the relevance of how

450
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,320
distributed cognitive systems use

451
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,240
epistemic actions for example knowing

452
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,920
where to look to find some piece of

453
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,240
information in the niche

454
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,160
that's kind of how they went through

455
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,480
this paper any comments on the roadmap

456
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,320
or we can now turn to the blank slides

457
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,160
don't forget about the spiced food

458
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,640
because that was also part of the case

459
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,720
case study

460
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,959
what about it

461
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,480
um i mean that was like there was the

462
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,079
earthworm case but then there was also

463
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,119
like the case of um spicing food as like

464
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,000
a cultural practice and um

465
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,160
how like potentially i mean even the act

466
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,640
of cooking food or how we prepare food

467
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,799
overall like some parts of food are

468
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,880
poisonous or like i mean you're gonna

469
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,520
eat blow fish like that's a very precise

470
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,039
very

471
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,320
mentor mentee transmitted practice

472
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,559
so but but i mean more than that just

473
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,400
also like the spices that we use can

474
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,760
sometimes be like

475
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,000
you know poisonous agents and they're

476
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,760
slightly toxic to us but not in small

477
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,760
amounts and but they also like help to

478
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,200
get rid of any parasites that might be

479
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,960
residing in the meat that we're eating

480
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,919
um but yeah they use that as a as a case

481
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,760
study also not just the earthworm with

482
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,360
the kidney

483
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,840
this is a book that we've been reading

484
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,440
at home recently

485
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,679
much depends on dinner it's kind of in

486
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,480
the culinary writing genre not something

487
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,600
we talk about too much directly here but

488
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,039
it's a very

489
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,880
interesting approach that really does

490
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,679
some deep dives on what we could see

491
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,799
from our actin flab vantage point of

492
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,360
like extended and encultured cognitive

493
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,760
processes and thinking about how food

494
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,240
gets to the table in all of the ways

495
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,840
that it gets the table how do people get

496
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,480
to the table how do we show up and

497
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,160
how does that differ through time so

498
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
it's kind of a cool book

499
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,080
similarly like the omnivore's dilemma

500
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,799
which i just read was also like how does

501
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,080
your food get to the table where does it

502
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,400
come from and yeah that's a whole

503
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
there's a whole set of practices and

504
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,960
like not only that but it's actually um

505
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,559
i mean you go back to thinking about

506
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,880
survival and thinking like a state uh

507
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,640
thinking about thinking like a state

508
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,160
there's a whole set of practices that

509
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,280
actually

510
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,200
construct our society based on the way

511
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,919
that we get food which is really um

512
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,080
pretty remarkable

513
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,880
it's a distributed metabolism with

514
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,600
bringing resources and nutrients

515
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,880
to and from

516
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,440
and um so it is very

517
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,720
related

518
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,520
okay so here's a few of the options

519
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,919
people can um take a quick little vote

520
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,000
or state their preference we can talk

521
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,480
about walking into new cognitive niches

522
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,280
talk a little bit about glue and truth

523
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,120
in the context of extended cognitive

524
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,320
processes and culture

525
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,880
about applying extended active inference

526
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,679
and how that is uh modeled

527
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,559
in its deployment as well as maybe from

528
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,480
a experiential

529
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,799
perspective what does it feel like to be

530
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,240
applying active inference in the

531
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,320
extended way

532
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,480
we have the question from

533
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,679
dave

534
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,400
about uh thinking about partitions

535
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,640
and there's a few other ways we could go

536
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,840
any preferences from these

537
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,200
so when we talk about applying active

538
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,799
inference are we talking about this from

539
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,159
a

540
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,080
realist or instrumentalist perspective i

541
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,480
just need to know

542
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,440
determines my vote

543
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,400
i think you've already said enough what

544
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,559
would it um mean

545
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,000
why does it matter

546
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,320
about realism and instrumentalism if

547
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,559
we're talking about applying extended

548
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,799
active inference like what are those as

549
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,440
you're seeing it now and what would the

550
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,919
um realism flavor or instrumentalist

551
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,720
flavor look like

552
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,880
well are we talking about actually what

553
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,120
is it like to apply active inference in

554
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,360
an extended way like what is that

555
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,600
actually like it takes on a very realist

556
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,480
flavor

557
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,320
when we're thinking about extending

558
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,640
active inference beyond our own

559
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,679
skull

560
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,159
or are we modeling

561
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,600
what are we actually doing here are we

562
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,280
modeling collective cognition collective

563
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,960
predictive processing

564
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,200
as extended active inference or what are

565
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,280
we actually doing here um i i would like

566
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,000
to know what you guys think

567
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,640
yes dean

568
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,280
my

569
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,080
curiosity around this is always

570
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,679
to do with things that have actually

571
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,120
happened but i still think there's a

572
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,159
sort of a

573
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,240
an inter a tool or instrumentalist part

574
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,799
around two when i first joined this

575
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,320
community

576
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,360
i don't know that i could have gotten

577
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,679
become part of whatever the community is

578
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,120
evolving into

579
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,159
without having both a kind of a realism

580
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,159
perspective and an instrumentalism

581
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,679
perspective so

582
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,600
i'm kind of i'm always kind of curious

583
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,360
when people want to break it out into

584
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,840
those two things i'm a minimum of two

585
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,280
thing guy

586
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,760
i think both of them both of them exist

587
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,280
and i don't think we can actually do

588
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,000
anything without having both of them so

589
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,320
let's say we drop one of the other blue

590
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,799
what happens in terms of our ability to

591
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,280
sort of get a real grip on or optimize

592
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,039
or do any of the things that we want to

593
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,600
do in terms of becoming enculturated

594
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,760
like if we drop one of the two

595
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,240
and just put all of our our our

596
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,919
resources in the other

597
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,200
domain

598
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,919
does like do we do that

599
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,000
naturally or do we do that in in those

600
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,400
domesticated situations right if we're

601
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,320
doing it in the wild

602
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,679
if we're truly having to go out there

603
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,240
and forage don't we use both that's my

604
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,240
question

605
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,440
so i will respond to that

606
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,240
um

607
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,679
i do think

608
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,600
we use both i think

609
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,000
i drop the instrumentalist perspective

610
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,039
all the time

611
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:41,840
like

612
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,480
i drop it when i think about

613
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,120
extending my cognition into my niche

614
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,720
environment and and i think about

615
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,960
extending my cognition into my group of

616
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,600
active inference people or or whatever i

617
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,320
drop the instrumentalist perspective

618
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,840
frequently in language in thought like i

619
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,200
think about oh what is it like to

620
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,520
actively infer xyz

621
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,280
but i never

622
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,520
lose sight of

623
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,640
the instrumentalist perspective as the

624
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,960
real way things are

625
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,799
right does that make sense like so the

626
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,480
instrumentalist perspective is the real

627
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,720
way things are like this is a tool i

628
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,799
talk about it as if it's not i think

629
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,960
about it as if it's not but

630
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,159
essentially

631
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,039
in my generative model like from the

632
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,520
realist perspective in my model when i

633
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,679
talk about my model i am modeling my

634
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,039
model and i'm doing it with the

635
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,840
instrument of active inference

636
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,520
yeah well again that's that's where i

637
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,880
find this really interesting if we're

638
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,200
going to extend extend

639
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,720
it's hard enough to

640
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,000
to talk about

641
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,120
building a niche or constructing a niche

642
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,720
without tools

643
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,279
or without realism

644
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,720
but if you're going to do that as an

645
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,360
extended cognition exercise now it's

646
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,640
even more complicated even more complex

647
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,120
how do you drop one of the two

648
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,320
and and and continue to feel like you're

649
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,159
you're accomplishing something

650
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,080
i i don't i don't want to get into

651
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,279
debate well i don't think we're getting

652
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,520
into debates about it's one or the other

653
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,200
but i think when you're trying to figure

654
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,400
things out

655
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,000
to just say okay i'm gonna i'm

656
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,640
automatically gonna blind one eye

657
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,080
just because i want the other eye to

658
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,919
grow bigger the other eye doesn't grow

659
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,279
bigger so

660
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,640
why are you doing that to yourself

661
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,360
that's what i always ask

662
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,440
so we can um

663
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
think about applying extended active

664
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,200
imprints

665
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,400
and as blue initially asked are we

666
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,679
approaching this

667
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,480
in what ways from a realism in what ways

668
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,880
from an instrumentalism perspective so

669
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,480
the realist question

670
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,880
just we're at the dmv right getting our

671
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,720
driver's license renewed

672
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,600
and they ask us to cover one of our eyes

673
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,279
because they actually do want to

674
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,200
understand that one of the eyes has a

675
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,120
certain visual capacity so we're closing

676
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,159
the instrumentalism eye and it's like to

677
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,159
the extent that we can even talk about

678
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,840
the real

679
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,720
cognitive systems actually really

680
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,799
do have functional dependencies that

681
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,360
extend beyond any actual boundary in the

682
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,559
world or that we state so however many

683
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,960
philosophical caveats you need to add

684
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,720
about realism

685
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,919
this eye

686
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,400
has no problem seeing

687
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,120
that

688
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,200
the functional components of cognition

689
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,480
are distributed so that is realism or

690
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,200
really extended active inference so

691
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,039
r e a

692
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,320
i

693
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,480
the instrumentalism i

694
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,240
is how are we going to

695
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,000
utilize actin

696
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,360
in a way that is useful and so

697
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,159
here with this eye we can see that

698
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,760
no matter what we're going to have to

699
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,919
model along with compromises like

700
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,919
accuracy minus complexity

701
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,760
the ways in which

702
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,240
our models of the cognitive systems they

703
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,679
actually do

704
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,080
require in the model the as-if influence

705
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,559
of influences beyond their neural system

706
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,360
so whether those influences beyond

707
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,840
the actual boundaries are real or

708
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,520
whether those influences beyond the

709
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,760
statistical boundaries are statistically

710
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,000
real

711
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,200
we can oscillate and like look at

712
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,360
something because we're the one who's

713
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,039
generating those

714
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,960
visuals and integrating those

715
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,080
perspectives into like a single coherent

716
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,440
generative model

717
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,080
and um one last on this a lot of times

718
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,760
somebody will think well what does a bug

719
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,480
see what does an insect see and it has

720
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,840
like a thousand different views of the

721
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,799
world

722
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,960
but of course we have two eyes and see

723
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,679
just one vision of the world so

724
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,600
there's reason to think that no matter

725
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,640
how many

726
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,360
facets of the insect i there are

727
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,039
they're still having just a single

728
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,320
coherent visual generative model

729
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,880
so maybe there's even other perspectives

730
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,600
but

731
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,400
that

732
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,919
won't mean that we are

733
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,080
not having a singular underlying

734
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,200
coherent generative experience so

735
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,640
okay

736
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,520
that

737
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,480
um

738
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,120
bridge being crossed or burnt depending

739
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,080
on what you think

740
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,840
what are some situations where we would

741
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,559
be applying extended active inference

742
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,720
so and also to distinguish that question

743
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,240
from just like where would we want to be

744
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,720
extending active inference

745
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,200
where would specifically

746
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,520
extended perspectives on active

747
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,919
inference be really important as opposed

748
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,039
to just

749
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,039
non-extended and maybe it'd be helpful

750
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,720
there to look at figure one and two just

751
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,840
to remind ourselves of those differences

752
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,840
so think about the examples while we yes

753
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,399
blue first go for it

754
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,440
um

755
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,960
so

756
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,480
in the spirit of active inference being

757
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,880
a scale-free framework like i think

758
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,240
about extended active inference as

759
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,679
very critical

760
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:00,480
to

761
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,399
this skill friendly slash skill-free

762
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,080
way that we think about active inference

763
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,320
just because as a biological system

764
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,720
were layers and layers and layers and

765
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,799
layers and layers deep so like

766
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,559
i this like

767
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,240
whatever my ego perceives as me blue

768
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,600
i am an embodied

769
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
image of extended active inference i

770
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,320
mean so so i don't see it happening

771
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,720
anywhere i don't see it extended active

772
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,600
inference not happening anywhere like i

773
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,679
see what happens in my skull a function

774
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,080
as of what's happening in my cells and

775
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,720
my tissues and my organs etc

776
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,679
because all of those subunits of blue

777
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,640
are

778
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,320
doing this extended active inference

779
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,760
with one another

780
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,080
um but if we want to look specifically

781
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,520
at like a group

782
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,559
function

783
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,080
um which which may be necessary or or

784
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,000
maybe not i mean to go beyond our skull

785
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,399
are we looking at like how organizations

786
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,880
function uh which maybe dean

787
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,960
wants to talk about more or how you know

788
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,960
states function or how

789
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,760
institutions function at large um so so

790
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,760
do we have to get actually beyond the

791
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,520
physical body to go beyond our skull or

792
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,840
can we go within our physical body to

793
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,840
talk about extended active inference

794
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,640
beyond skulls

795
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,160
yes so um

796
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,960
[Music]

797
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,760
we can think about like

798
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,240
that great point which is that nested

799
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,960
systems of which we often talk about can

800
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,640
actually be thought of as extended

801
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,559
active inference systems

802
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,440
so

803
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,440
we've talked about like ant nest mates

804
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,960
in the ant colony

805
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,279
and so there's the sense in which the

806
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,760
lateral interactions from one nest

807
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,240
mate's point of view

808
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,080
because those lateral interactions are

809
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,880
with other nest mates there's cognition

810
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,559
on both sides of the interaction so it

811
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,080
is like an extended active inference

812
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,279
process

813
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,080
and then also there's the

814
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,520
extended active inference with the

815
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,080
physical substrate and the stigma g and

816
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,760
the building of the nest architecture

817
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,600
and the pheromone deposition

818
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,799
and that kind of physical substrate is

819
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,240
more on the mere active inference rather

820
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,640
than adaptive active inference end of

821
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,279
the spectrum and the physical substrate

822
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,760
reminds us more of figure one

823
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,760
where you have an active cognitive

824
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,720
entity

825
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,960
that's doing some sort of free energy

826
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,279
minimizing process that's helping it

827
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,000
select policy that's the arg min

828
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,480
and then it's feeding into

829
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,039
the dynamics of the external niche which

830
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,960
can be complex and they have their own

831
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,840
endogenous change dynamics which is seen

832
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,159
by the fact that like the rate of change

833
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,159
on the external states

834
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,480
is a function of

835
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,640
something involving the current state of

836
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,440
those

837
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,919
world states plus a noise term

838
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,320
so this can be a complex recursive

839
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,640
non-linear function but that could still

840
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,919
be a mere active entity because it's not

841
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,159
actually engaged in a policy selection

842
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,080
rather just a complex dynamical

843
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,440
unfolding

844
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,399
and then in contrast in figure 2

845
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,880
we see that the external states

846
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,440
are still taking similar arguments

847
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,200
eta and a

848
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,840
so the current states at that time

849
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,600
and actions feeding into it that's

850
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,840
what's influencing external states and

851
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,240
we see those arguments are still here

852
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,320
actions feeding in from the entity and

853
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,600
the current state of the external states

854
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,320
except what it's doing is no longer just

855
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,559
the rate of change is a function of plus

856
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,600
noise

857
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,720
but an active policy selection

858
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,240
more like the kind that the entity is

859
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,720
involved in so maybe figure two is

860
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,120
reminding us more of like two nest mates

861
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,039
interacting with each other in figure

862
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,519
one is more like a nest may interacting

863
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,679
with the physical stigmergic niche

864
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,360
and so in that way it opens up all of

865
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,640
the discussions we've had about

866
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,640
multi-scale active

867
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,559
and nested systems

868
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,559
and thinking about them

869
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,279
as extended active inference dean

870
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,919
yeah in the paper

871
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,519
i'll just read one sentence from the

872
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,519
paper it says here the concept of the

873
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,240
cognitive niche that we refer to

874
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,120
here

875
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,360
is a sort of hybrid

876
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,279
between the concepts of

877
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,880
the selective

878
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,240
developmental

879
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,399
and cognitive niches

880
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,640
it's right near the beginning yeah yep

881
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,240
right there

882
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,840
yeah you got it

883
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,960
so

884
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,880
in the context of what we're in those

885
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,279
two figures there

886
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,200
when we're talking hybrid what are we

887
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,080
really talking about we're talking about

888
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,480
the comparison of say the electric

889
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,480
component of the engine and the internal

890
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,480
combustion

891
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,200
engine that are both in one car

892
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,159
would that be a good analogy in terms of

893
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,640
being able to figure out

894
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,760
what part of this is the um

895
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,519
is the vessel one part of this is the

896
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,679
electric motor and what part of this

897
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,440
is the internal combustion motor would

898
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,360
that be a good um

899
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,719
metaphor for what we're talking about

900
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,200
what's the car

901
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,760
right

902
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,120
well that's

903
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,120
that's the is that the culture piece i'm

904
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,600
not sure

905
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,880
yeah i don't know what a cognitive niche

906
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,559
is here like i don't know if i want to

907
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,519
entail culture with a cognitive niche

908
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,279
because this is what this paper is about

909
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,679
or whether i want to entail cognitive

910
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,519
niche with culture which is something

911
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,279
that we've talked about in a whole bunch

912
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,960
of papers right so that's a good

913
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,840
question i don't know

914
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,799
it reminds me of your earlier um

915
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,279
statements about how like if a pizza is

916
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,519
uh something with toppings on top and

917
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,039
then if you put it upside down is it

918
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,120
still a pizza so

919
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,399
is car

920
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,679
the total functional phenomena involving

921
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,679
vehicular transport

922
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:02,480
or

923
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,799
at what point does that also require

924
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,440
like gravity and a road and all these

925
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,960
other pieces that are part of the

926
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,679
extended process by which cars come to

927
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,679
be like is the factory that made the car

928
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,960
part of the car

929
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,639
i mean it would

930
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,719
be interesting if they just blinked into

931
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,040
existence but because things are part of

932
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,760
process ontologies

933
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,480
how can we

934
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,399
connect this question of extended

935
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,839
function

936
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:30,639
to

937
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,159
the

938
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,159
process and object ontology um angle

939
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,639
okay cool blue i see some stigma g

940
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,040
happening

941
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,839
um

942
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:48,800
okay so

943
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,639
to kind of close this little

944
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,879
thread on

945
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,560
applying extended active inference

946
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,239
though of course we

947
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,800
welcome a thousand more specific

948
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,880
contributions and we hope to continue

949
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,640
building these actual models and

950
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,920
examples and

951
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,520
interactive dashboards and everything

952
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,960
out

953
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,680
there are multiple ways

954
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,480
to think about what is extended

955
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,839
and probably even for consensus on the

956
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,280
same

957
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,440
perspective on the world as it really is

958
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,119
or even on the same choice of models

959
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,560
there would still be a lot of degrees of

960
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,040
freedom in how we actually apply

961
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,599
extended active inference but one

962
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,000
tantalizing cue there from blue was like

963
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,920
connecting it to the scale-free scale

964
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,960
friendly components and potentially

965
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,760
connecting what we've been talking about

966
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
with active inference in nested

967
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,640
multi-scale systems to this perspective

968
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,560
on thinking about their niche as

969
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,839
consisting of other mere figure 1 or

970
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:52,640
adaptive figure 2 active entities

971
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,160
what do we see with the termites

972
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,119
so

973
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,040
i just was thinking about like the

974
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,280
literal um

975
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,640
pushing off

976
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,680
into the niche in in kind of like this

977
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,960
scale-free

978
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,599
slash skill-friendly way

979
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:12,400
i

980
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,599
saw

981
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,920
the last author of

982
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,680
these papers give

983
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,000
a talk at the mathematics of collective

984
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,240
intelligence workshop and it was so cool

985
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,000
like really literally like the termite

986
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,960
mound

987
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,880
and i'm sure that the ants nests do the

988
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,880
same thing daniel but i think that the

989
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,480
they're not very studyable because as

990
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,839
soon as you go in to start to try to

991
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,440
figure them out like they fall apart is

992
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,200
that that's true so we kind of get a

993
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,400
better

994
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,040
um well many termites build

995
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,040
underground and in logs so it can be

996
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,960
hard to assess above ground termite

997
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,920
architecture is of course amazing and

998
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,560
more ant architecture is happening

999
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,640
underground which makes it really hard

1000
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,480
to study unless you have like a high

1001
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,480
resolution land landmine sweeping device

1002
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,200
land mine sweeping devices so like are

1003
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,359
there like images i mean yeah i don't

1004
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,280
see how to do it really without

1005
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,800
destroying it because they're like made

1006
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,800
of sand right so how do you like i mean

1007
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,560
i remember like when we were kids there

1008
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,040
was like the frame the two glass panes

1009
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,200
and you would get some ants and like

1010
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,560
throw them in there and watch them like

1011
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,880
dig tunnels but like other than this

1012
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,440
like very artificial environment

1013
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,760
like the deer on the trampoline right

1014
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,960
other than this very artificial

1015
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,720
environment you know in what way do we

1016
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,800
know about the ant architecture but but

1017
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,119
my point was actually just that that the

1018
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,400
termites um really like you can predict

1019
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
the behavior of the termites based on

1020
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,800
like the velocity of the wind and how

1021
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,280
hot or cool or like they build all these

1022
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,200
different structures and you can predict

1023
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,359
like and they not only build these

1024
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:44,480
different structures but they will

1025
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,240
actually like deconstruct their mound

1026
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,800
and then reconstruct it like based on

1027
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,640
whatever whatever's shifting in the

1028
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,640
environment and so this latest paper is

1029
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,040
called like really shows the um

1030
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,160
it gets into like the math behind

1031
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,160
how termites termite mounds are

1032
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,320
constructed like under what you know

1033
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,040
wind velocity and so forth but um i just

1034
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,119
thought that that was a really neat

1035
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,520
uh example of

1036
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,040
literally putting

1037
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,520
the offloading into i mean we literally

1038
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,119
do that as humans and so we're pretty

1039
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,560
familiar with like you know the

1040
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,240
smartphone and the different ways in

1041
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,520
which we do

1042
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,480
cognitive uploading but this idea of

1043
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,320
cognitive uploading which i've always

1044
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
used cognitive offloading

1045
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,880
cognitive uploading into the niche

1046
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,839
can kind of tell others even future

1047
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,800
others uh what was happening to you in

1048
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,160
your life it's like you're writing your

1049
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,640
own little you know history book as we

1050
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,119
are cognitively uploading these videos

1051
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,280
onto youtube you know this will be here

1052
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,680
after we're gone uh but the termites do

1053
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,079
this too in a very cool like physical

1054
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,200
way

1055
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,040
i just have a scene

1056
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,599
tucker has corrected me in chat it's not

1057
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,000
a landmine sweeping device it's an ant

1058
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,440
mind sweeping device so thank you tucker

1059
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,240
cool

1060
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,119
yes i think um extended active inference

1061
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,520
systems to study could include

1062
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,000
starting with uh

1063
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,119
colony

1064
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:16,720
like systems or various other systems

1065
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,280
what would be another good place to now

1066
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,599
jump in as we sort of walk back to the

1067
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,599
midden pile walk back to the trash sheep

1068
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,760
of ideas and then figure out where to

1069
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,200
repurpose and

1070
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,680
go back in um maybe

1071
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,079
you meant yes dean well i just have a

1072
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,400
question for both of you because so

1073
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,079
when i think of offloading and they give

1074
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,920
the example and i think i put the image

1075
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,320
up there of the brain on top of the of

1076
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,920
the phone

1077
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,599
um

1078
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,760
if we if we upload and we're talking

1079
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,240
about intergenerational stuff

1080
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,640
are we uploading into culture and is

1081
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,240
that the diff is that the primary

1082
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,839
difference between offloading something

1083
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:57,920
so i don't have to remember it

1084
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,480
and uploading something so that

1085
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,119
rules are introduced that you

1086
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,880
will sort of be

1087
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,240
swept up by if you join this culture i'm

1088
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,480
asking because i'm not really sure i i

1089
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,319
was trying to figure that out myself

1090
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,720
what's the is there an arbitrariness to

1091
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,040
this or is it really kind of clear what

1092
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,440
the line is in terms of they tried to

1093
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,640
explain it

1094
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,400
is it yeah they said it's akin to

1095
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,560
cognitive uploading

1096
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,640
but it's different so where did you guys

1097
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,040
come away on that on that question of

1098
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,040
what what's different about it

1099
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,079
yes

1100
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,760
great question thank you dean let's look

1101
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,119
at what they

1102
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,480
wrote and then let's see where we can

1103
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,560
take it so they wrote cognitive

1104
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,319
uploading is akin to cognitive

1105
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,400
offloading in the original theory of the

1106
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,400
extended mind

1107
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,480
however in contrast to the traditional

1108
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,640
notion of offloading

1109
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,640
the notion of uploading refers to the

1110
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,800
creation of novel cognitive functions

1111
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,040
that are taken on board by the cognitive

1112
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,480
niche per se

1113
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,800
instead of being merely managed by the

1114
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,200
cognitive niche a function's offloaded

1115
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,359
when individual agents restructure their

1116
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:06,800
world

1117
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,040
so as to minimize internal processing

1118
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,160
costs and or increase reliability

1119
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,960
so offloading like you could offload

1120
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,960
your heavy heavy backpack and just drop

1121
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,200
it on the floor so offloading has more

1122
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,760
of a sense um at least

1123
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,119
hopefully this is the line with as

1124
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,599
they're describing it of like

1125
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,280
it is allowing the shelves in the world

1126
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,880
to you're offloading what you're

1127
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,440
carrying into places in the world

1128
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,839
and so the cognitive onus

1129
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,119
and the imperative for epistemic action

1130
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,760
is still resting in the entity of

1131
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,720
interest so cognitive offloading could

1132
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,560
be consistent with a world view that's

1133
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,280
like solipsistic like there's just this

1134
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,440
one cognitive entity and they're like

1135
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,280
offloading they're off-gassing it's

1136
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,599
their exhaust thermal waste they're

1137
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,240
offloading cognition to the niche

1138
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,400
cognitive uploading

1139
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,880
takes on more of a sense

1140
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,560
that there's actually something active

1141
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,800
on the other side because like if you're

1142
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,839
gonna upload a file to a cloud folder

1143
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,760
there has to be another server that's

1144
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,560
actually recognizing your packets

1145
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,880
as you're uploading that file

1146
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,599
so

1147
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,640
uploading is more consistent with the

1148
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,040
framing that they have for example in

1149
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,920
figure 2 surprise surprise whereas the

1150
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,480
cognitive offloading

1151
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,800
could be consistent with figure one like

1152
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,520
i'm

1153
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,280
trying to have this cognitive function

1154
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,680
of this symphony of bells being played

1155
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,160
and so i'm gonna set up these dominoes

1156
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,200
and these delays in the niche and where

1157
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,040
to put the sheet music and where to put

1158
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,480
the post-it notes

1159
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,520
offloading the cognitive requirements

1160
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,800
making it extended making it distributed

1161
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,920
in figure 2 it goes even a step further

1162
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,680
and that's what they're trying to

1163
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,359
highlight the distinction with with

1164
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,680
their usage of the word uploading

1165
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,960
because there's actually something

1166
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,599
that's cognitive that's

1167
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:04,960
accepting

1168
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,119
the download

1169
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,280
or the upload from the entity is the

1170
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,920
download from the server so to speak so

1171
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,240
sorry if that's repetitive but i think

1172
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,640
it's a subtle and important point dean

1173
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,000
yeah i think it's a super important

1174
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,440
point too so then

1175
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,079
then for me the question is so

1176
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,160
let's say that i have an academic

1177
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,480
culture that i could upload to and i

1178
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,319
also have a professional culture that i

1179
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:29,839
could upload to let's say they're two

1180
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,760
different things

1181
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,720
right

1182
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,880
so i i've got

1183
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,440
i'm i'm a part-time student and i'm also

1184
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,560
working

1185
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,760
full-time at my job every day is there

1186
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,480
some way of being able to

1187
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,640
find myself or find examples of myself

1188
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,960
not being downloaded on per se by each

1189
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,680
one of those different cultures

1190
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,079
but me uploading into both of those and

1191
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,359
retaining my sort of hybridized sense of

1192
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,440
the world so from a psychological and a

1193
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,839
functional niche perspective

1194
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,240
what does that entail for me as the

1195
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,560
person who's now kind of

1196
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,480
doing this oscillation back and forth

1197
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,480
between these two niche constructions

1198
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,720
right now they again they don't go to

1199
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,400
that length here but i think i think

1200
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,000
it's important based on what you just

1201
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,560
said daniel for us to remember it isn't

1202
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,119
just a single culture

1203
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,200
examination here at the whole point is

1204
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,119
is that there are multiple niche

1205
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,440
constructions happening

1206
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,119
all the time and it's just a matter of

1207
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,599
whether or not we recognize

1208
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,520
the differences

1209
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,440
right so

1210
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,200
i don't again i'm not sure that they

1211
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,280
answer that here but um

1212
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,960
i think we're getting closer to being

1213
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,880
able to find that answer because of what

1214
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,839
they're

1215
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,799
what they're bringing to our attention

1216
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,599
so just on that on that point um

1217
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,480
when i really was thinking about

1218
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,040
cognitive uploading it's like um

1219
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,680
it's like putting something into

1220
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,319
the niche

1221
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,319
for others to use and reuse and maybe

1222
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,960
interact with or like remix and what

1223
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,000
you're saying about like this

1224
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,960
hybridization between academic and

1225
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,160
professional really makes me think about

1226
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,800
complex systems and like the santa fe

1227
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,280
institute where daniel and i met and

1228
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,880
um the

1229
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,000
kind of

1230
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,440
siloed

1231
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,240
academic experience that uh maybe people

1232
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,560
are still having unfortunately but that

1233
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,680
that people have had so if you are in

1234
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,440
you know mechanical engineering versus

1235
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,920
biology versus economics like you have

1236
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,599
very different

1237
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:52,720
knowledge

1238
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,800
acquisition and like a very different

1239
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,160
culture and a very different way of

1240
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,079
interacting with your peers

1241
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,040
and there's this kind of like siloed

1242
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,599
culture even within an academic culture

1243
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,920
so like even subsections of academia

1244
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,480
tend to be siloed and when you bring

1245
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,520
people into a complex systems kind of

1246
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,160
environment there's this amazing like

1247
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,640
ability for new ideas to generate right

1248
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,240
it's like this cross-fertilization or

1249
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,599
cross-pollination people call it

1250
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,359
different things but but when people

1251
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,920
come together with academic expertise

1252
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,920
some you know shared ability to read

1253
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,400
write and do some mathematics so when

1254
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,040
people come together with and intermixed

1255
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,880
their own siloed

1256
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,880
knowledge which is deep like it tends to

1257
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,800
be very very deep like if you've got you

1258
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,560
know phd or bachelor's degree or

1259
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,640
master's degree in in your field like

1260
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,240
you know a whole lot about that field

1261
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,480
and probably not a lot like about the

1262
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,560
other field so when you come together in

1263
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,040
a complex system kind of way it it

1264
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,040
enables people with this deep deep

1265
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,560
knowledge and understanding of their own

1266
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,079
thing to then interact and it's exciting

1267
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,079
and it builds new things like i think

1268
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,920
exponentially like like you know if i

1269
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,240
get together with a bunch of other data

1270
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,319
scientists or a bunch of other

1271
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,720
bio people or narrow people i don't have

1272
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,839
that same kind of

1273
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:12,240
excited brainstormy

1274
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,079
jittery idea

1275
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,599
gush

1276
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,800
like that was so professional um

1277
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,920
but but

1278
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,000
generally i think that that happens in

1279
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,520
this cross fertilization or

1280
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,359
cross-pollination

1281
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,200
way and when i think about cognitive

1282
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,760
uploading i think about like you push it

1283
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,559
in

1284
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,559
so that other people can interact with

1285
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,079
it so that other people so that it can

1286
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,160
do the cross-fertilization thing and

1287
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,160
maybe that's just kind of my naive

1288
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,680
interpretation of what they were saying

1289
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,680
in the paper but that's kind of what i

1290
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,040
got um and then daniel made us slides so

1291
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,559
perfect i talked enough i i totally um

1292
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,599
one slidesworth in kairos time totally

1293
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,440
agreed though like

1294
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,920
uploading as opposed to or as

1295
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,559
distinguished from offloading offloading

1296
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,160
you just need to trust that the shelf

1297
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,599
isn't going to break and someone's not

1298
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,040
going to steal your backpack while

1299
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,000
you're gone but cognitive uploading like

1300
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,920
you got to trust that file is being

1301
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,319
stored and that that is going to be able

1302
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:13,040
to be executed potentially even outside

1303
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,160
of your

1304
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,800
awareness or control so when we're in

1305
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,920
like a interdisciplinary context or just

1306
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,119
sharing like cognition in a team or

1307
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:25,359
getting it done as a team

1308
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:26,960
the uploading brings in this whole

1309
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,960
element of like trust and culture and

1310
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,880
glue that others are going to be able to

1311
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,880
do things that you don't want to do that

1312
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,720
you can't do that you wouldn't see of

1313
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,599
doing

1314
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,599
all these different ways in which their

1315
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,680
active cognitive model

1316
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,040
is different

1317
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,000
and importantly aligned and importantly

1318
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,920
contrasting and complementary it's all

1319
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,359
of those things

1320
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:51,280
so here's a few visualizations of

1321
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,800
borders between

1322
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,720
um or interfaces between entities and

1323
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,680
each other or entities in the niche

1324
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,119
so on the left side it's like the

1325
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,760
overlap between two systems whether we

1326
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,160
think about them as like oh that block

1327
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,960
in the city it's part of um little italy

1328
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,480
and downtown

1329
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,319
so there could be like a block there's a

1330
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,720
border region but it is both included in

1331
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,960
the two sets or it can be a little bit

1332
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,920
more

1333
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,240
blurry or fuzzy around what those orange

1334
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,119
and blue sets are but still there's like

1335
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:27,200
a region that is overlapping and claimed

1336
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,040
by both

1337
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,359
there's another case where

1338
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,680
the border or the interface is something

1339
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,319
that is like overlapping to both but

1340
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,720
also a distinct region

1341
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,599
perhaps like a cell membrane or

1342
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,480
in the full separation case

1343
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,240
it becomes its own

1344
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,000
separate region

1345
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,119
and that entails now this recursive

1346
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,839
boundary setting because now there's

1347
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:56,319
wall street there's the street in front

1348
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:59,440
of the wall and

1349
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,680
so this just

1350
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,319
made me wonder um when we were talking

1351
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:05,599
about

1352
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,680
academic and professional

1353
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,760
what kind of synthesis

1354
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,440
or what kind of integration are we

1355
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,480
looking for

1356
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,960
which one of these setups

1357
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,280
is predisposed towards effective

1358
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,280
extended active inference

1359
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,319
or

1360
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,160
is this something that we determine

1361
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,319
about how it really is in the world

1362
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:25,760
hashtag realism

1363
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,559
is this a model selection choice

1364
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:32,000
from an instrumentalist point of view

1365
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,800
can i just speak to that for a second i

1366
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,720
think this is interesting because

1367
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,040
in in this example and also in the paper

1368
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,359
where they talk about desire lines we do

1369
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,319
have a tendency to sort of see these

1370
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:47,040
things be at the border or the the the

1371
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,079
artifact of the number of

1372
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,960
humans or or animals that walked to the

1373
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,200
watering hole and the result on that and

1374
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,960
they speak to that clearly in the paper

1375
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,079
that

1376
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,960
so sometimes that is is not acting in

1377
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,240
the surprise the environment's not

1378
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,640
acting in a surprising way

1379
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,480
it that's the result of what ends up

1380
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,160
happening with a whole bunch of people

1381
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,079
follow the same path or use the same

1382
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,079
stones to break the nuts that's the

1383
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:14,079
capuchin monkey example

1384
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:16,319
or use the same spices right and in a

1385
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:17,440
particular

1386
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,520
thing one one of the things that we kind

1387
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,079
of just touched on briefly in this dot

1388
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,319
zero was so what if you took all of

1389
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,200
those examples that you had a boundary

1390
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,680
and you used green as a as one of the

1391
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,599
things to sort of show it in the

1392
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,599
rectangular shape but what if you were

1393
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,680
able to twist that

1394
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,760
and and do with it what we have when we

1395
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,280
for example use the um

1396
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,040
the mobius strip in the keywords

1397
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,720
do you have a representation of that

1398
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,800
here and why would that matter because i

1399
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,400
think that actually really does matter

1400
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,319
and i think it's something that we tend

1401
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,559
to overlook

1402
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,160
so if we're talking about i mean if

1403
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,400
we're talking about transdisciplinary

1404
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,280
and blues point i think this fits

1405
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,800
really really well but if you wanted to

1406
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,400
talk about people walking into a

1407
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,599
situation

1408
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:09,520
who are creating a new cognitive niche

1409
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,559
um

1410
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,800
they don't come from a place of knowing

1411
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,640
they basically come from a place of not

1412
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,599
knowing

1413
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:16,839
and they're going

1414
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:20,400
to build that new boundary or that new

1415
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,920
border and they're not going to be

1416
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,440
restricted to the oval shape

1417
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,200
they might be able to put a single twist

1418
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,880
on it and come up with

1419
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,640
like like i said the example that we

1420
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,920
have that we put up as a representation

1421
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,920
behind our keywords or maybe they'll do

1422
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,520
a mandelbrotty in

1423
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,800
two cranks of the system and

1424
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,119
they'll come up with the um

1425
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:44,960
two loops that are

1426
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,520
orthogonal to one another right and and

1427
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,119
what does that mean in terms of a

1428
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,480
representation around uploading as

1429
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,680
opposed to

1430
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,640
offloading and i think that that's yeah

1431
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,480
exactly as you're building it out here

1432
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,680
this is where it actually gets

1433
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,760
interesting because i think that's where

1434
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,480
if again if we always see ourselves as

1435
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,119
where did where does my cognition end

1436
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,720
and begin

1437
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,480
we will get one

1438
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,079
out we'll kick a certain number of

1439
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,839
representations all conforming to that

1440
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,640
pre-desire to keep it the cognition

1441
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,200
contained and framed and stabilized now

1442
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,920
if we look at this from the environment

1443
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,920
position and the argument flipper

1444
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,520
inversion of that

1445
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,319
can we just limit the inversions to

1446
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:31,040
the

1447
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,119
the two sides on either side of the

1448
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:34,640
markov blanket or could we actually look

1449
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,119
at the markup blanket twisting and

1450
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:39,440
reforming itself

1451
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,520
because i mean it opens up the space for

1452
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,440
that possibility now whether we choose

1453
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,599
to give any attention over to that or

1454
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,920
make ourselves available to that

1455
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,440
it gets really really interesting in a

1456
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,760
hurry

1457
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,800
look

1458
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,880
so

1459
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,040
i think it is really interesting and

1460
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,599
where we put the boundary

1461
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,520
um maybe depends on what we feel that we

1462
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,480
are

1463
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,440
uploading or offloading like by us

1464
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,880
uploading

1465
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,160
these video series into

1466
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,480
the niche environment of the internet

1467
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,280
um

1468
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,160
we other people are able to cognitively

1469
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,400
offload like they're offloading

1470
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,760
their need to

1471
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,079
delve into deep read and unpack this

1472
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:27,920
paper like they could just you know

1473
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,440
they've offloaded it to us and they're

1474
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,119
just watching the youtube video not

1475
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:32,720
everybody sorry if you if you're really

1476
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,079
actually reading the paper and really

1477
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,200
into it and just

1478
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,359
want to hear someone else reflect but in

1479
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,000
many ways you know we provide a summary

1480
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,280
that that

1481
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,079
in today's information latent age it's

1482
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:45,760
really impossible to just read all the

1483
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,680
papers even in your own field when

1484
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,680
there's five papers released a day so i

1485
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,200
don't blame you for doing some cognitive

1486
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,599
offloading there but by us uploading

1487
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:56,640
that enables someone else to offload is

1488
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,359
that always the case is there like this

1489
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:01,599
interplay with upload and offload like i

1490
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,680
think about google maps like that is

1491
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,559
the biggest cognitive offload that i've

1492
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,200
seen in technologically in technological

1493
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,680
advancements in my lifetime like i no

1494
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,880
longer remember how to get anywhere like

1495
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,599
maybe if i drive there 15 times

1496
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,680
maybe then but or maybe if i know

1497
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,000
someplace next to it like like but if as

1498
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,599
far as driving to a new place a place

1499
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:24,960
i've never been a new housing

1500
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,400
development for example like i have a

1501
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,599
friend that moves in and i've never been

1502
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,839
there before i'm at their house 15 times

1503
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:31,280
before i remember how to get back and

1504
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,200
forth and i google that myself the whole

1505
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,720
way every time

1506
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,599
it's massive cognitive offloading but

1507
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,839
only because google was so kind to

1508
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:41,040
upload

1509
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,520
the information only due to uploading

1510
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,680
can i then offload and then does that

1511
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,559
also work culturally like in terms of i

1512
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:49,520
think about

1513
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,520
institutional or hierarchical

1514
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,200
organizations or even thinking like a

1515
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,599
state i have someone who will make shoes

1516
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,680
for me i don't need to know how to make

1517
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,160
shoes i just need to know how to access

1518
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,880
shoes i don't know how to make shoes so

1519
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,520
but because someone else is uploading

1520
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,599
that information technology their

1521
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,599
product to our culture

1522
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,359
cognitively but it's like the output of

1523
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:12,640
their cognition

1524
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,480
actually i get it maybe they could

1525
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,160
actually teach someone else how to make

1526
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,880
shoes if they had to but but my point is

1527
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,359
is that there's like this interchange

1528
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,520
does upload somewhat because you upload

1529
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,200
it to someone else download it and then

1530
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,880
they can offload because of their

1531
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,480
ability to download

1532
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,640
sorry if that was rambly no i think that

1533
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,400
that's i think that's perfect and my

1534
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,319
question then is from a learning

1535
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:38,160
standpoint are we more adept at

1536
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,319
accepting other people's

1537
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:42,640
information because that expedites we

1538
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,559
can follow and and

1539
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:46,160
use that

1540
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,839
your first example

1541
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:48,799
right

1542
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:50,079
here's somebody

1543
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:52,079
google i mean for google it's great for

1544
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,240
them they cannot they they went and

1545
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,640
figured out how to become the go-to

1546
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,400
source for uploading

1547
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,559
but what are we doing in terms of giving

1548
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:01,680
people

1549
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,480
a sense of their agency over uploading

1550
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,119
as opposed to simply just following and

1551
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:09,680
being consumed by the googles if we're

1552
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,680
going to invert this we need to ask that

1553
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,920
question around what learning what we're

1554
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,319
giving people in terms of agency and and

1555
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,160
knowing the difference between

1556
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,240
the trade-offs

1557
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,319
that happen with offloading as you

1558
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:24,559
described um you're not building any

1559
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:26,400
desire lines

1560
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,240
your your gps is doing it for you

1561
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,319
now now you feel completely dependent

1562
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:34,799
upon that thing and you don't have to be

1563
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,640
able to make shoes to be able to

1564
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,480
understand the difference between what

1565
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,760
you might need in one set of

1566
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,079
circumstances on your feet and what you

1567
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:44,400
might need on a in another circumstance

1568
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,400
set of circumstances on your feet but

1569
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,559
are we drifting to that place that says

1570
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:50,480
i don't even know what shoes to put on

1571
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,079
today i better go and find out from

1572
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:55,079
google

1573
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,440
yes very interesting um

1574
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,240
keeping with the uh uploading offloading

1575
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,960
desire paths and google thanks youtube

1576
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,799
by the way for the affordance

1577
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:09,520
what if each person were only seeing

1578
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,680
locally which paths were attractive to

1579
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,680
them which search results were appealing

1580
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:14,640
to them

1581
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,920
but then there was uh an eye in the sky

1582
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,000
that could see the statistical

1583
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,559
distributions of everyone else in their

1584
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:24,480
uploading and offloading

1585
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,119
that would actually make that

1586
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,200
a tremendous resource for

1587
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,720
the eye in the sky and so that's a

1588
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,680
little bit of the asymmetry but the

1589
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,440
challenge and opportunity

1590
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,240
um also the caption of figure one

1591
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,799
does explicitly mention like action

1592
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:42,720
perception and learning

1593
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,160
so that's very

1594
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,000
interesting and it does raise the

1595
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,040
question of

1596
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,240
what

1597
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,480
is the difference between perception and

1598
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,040
learning which is discussed a ton in

1599
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,200
active and in the textbook what the

1600
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,119
similarities and difference are like

1601
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:59,119
with perception being over faster time

1602
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,280
scales but being fundamentally similar

1603
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,440
to learning but learning being about

1604
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,200
cognitive parameters and usually

1605
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,160
updating over slower time skills

1606
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,799
and then what does learning look like

1607
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:12,880
in a cognitive offload

1608
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,400
world

1609
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,240
in the no offload world

1610
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,640
then in the cognitive offload world and

1611
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,640
then in the cognitive upload world so

1612
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,960
just to kind of maybe just give one

1613
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,880
example um the no offload world is the

1614
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,400
test where you can't bring any notes in

1615
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,559
yeah in that case it's like what you

1616
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:34,720
know about organic chemistry is in your

1617
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,400
school

1618
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,839
it one could

1619
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,440
go a little bit broader than that but

1620
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,200
you can't take in your notes the

1621
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,440
cognitive offloading

1622
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,119
which is going to beg the question of

1623
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:47,040
like epistemic action is you're allowed

1624
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,200
to bring in your own notes or even the

1625
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,480
textbook so it's a dead artifact in the

1626
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,640
niche it's a mere active entity it's an

1627
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,040
epistemic resource in eos we would call

1628
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,839
an informational entity in the niche and

1629
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:02,640
it can be referenced and you might only

1630
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,960
have to learn where to look

1631
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,960
learn where you put your backpack learn

1632
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,720
which chapter to look to when you want

1633
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,960
to resolve a certain kind of uncertainty

1634
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,640
so it's an affordance you didn't have in

1635
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,359
the no offload case to have the textbook

1636
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:16,720
or the notes

1637
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,960
what's the cognitive upload is it phone

1638
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,319
a friend

1639
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:21,440
is it

1640
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,880
go in with

1641
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,880
the chemicals and have a lab kit like

1642
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,960
what does it look like to go one step

1643
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,440
beyond yes you can take your notes into

1644
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,680
that organic chemistry test

1645
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,200
what is the upload what do you think

1646
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,319
dean

1647
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:37,200
i think the upload is when you are are

1648
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,200
taking the information that you've

1649
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,000
received here and finding yourself

1650
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,280
migrating in

1651
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,040
a completely different culture and

1652
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,400
somebody in that completely different

1653
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,680
culture says

1654
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,559
um i want you to solve this problem for

1655
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,799
me before i can hire you

1656
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:55,280
can you do this this thing first show me

1657
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,240
that you can do this thing or resolve

1658
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,119
this

1659
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:01,359
this issue for me

1660
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:03,760
so it's it's taking information from one

1661
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,119
context

1662
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,720
and finding yourself in a completely

1663
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,400
different context not from the person

1664
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,559
who's decided this is the amount of

1665
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:12,000
material that we've covered in these

1666
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,319
past 13 weeks and now i'm going to

1667
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:16,400
select out the points that i want you to

1668
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,599
as you said load into your into your

1669
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:21,359
bucket and carry into the testing

1670
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:23,680
situation i want you actually now to

1671
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,000
take what you've learned and i want you

1672
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,920
to be able to go out back into the wild

1673
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,880
now

1674
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,000
where

1675
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,680
you're gonna have to be able to solve

1676
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,920
something as a result of you

1677
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,280
loading loading up your your

1678
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,799
quiver or your

1679
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:41,520
your 13 weeks worth of information right

1680
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,160
that's the that's literally finding

1681
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,440
yourself

1682
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,160
now working with a new culture and that

1683
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,680
new culture

1684
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,119
taking on all the properties that

1685
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:54,559
they're talking about in this paper

1686
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,200
another um angle on that oh yes blue

1687
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,559
please

1688
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:01,280
so my take on that would be to

1689
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,440
like say you have all of the material

1690
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,280
that you learned you have all the books

1691
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,480
you have all the notes

1692
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,599
you then go teach it to someone else and

1693
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,359
they go in and take the test for you so

1694
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:12,799
that would be

1695
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:14,079
uploading

1696
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:15,920
awesome awesome is that what you were

1697
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:16,799
gonna say

1698
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:21,039
yeah so we have too much we do too much

1699
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:23,680
i was thinking of a driver's exam it's

1700
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,680
the difference between the no notes

1701
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,640
driver's exam taking the test at the dmv

1702
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,240
can people tell that i just renewed my

1703
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,359
license

1704
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:33,920
and then there's the having the notes

1705
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,319
and then there's the actual driving and

1706
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:38,799
so that is where the functions are no

1707
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:40,880
longer hypothetical and in a testing

1708
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,920
scenario but they're enacted

1709
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,599
and that means that it's different to

1710
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,599
say you should do this when you're

1711
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,440
parallel parking and it is going to be

1712
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,400
15 feet versus the actual enacting of it

1713
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,559
and that cognitive function

1714
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:56,559
really or instrumentally

1715
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:59,359
is happening in this extended way with

1716
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:00,079
the

1717
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:01,920
visual components of the car and the

1718
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,520
proprioception of the car so that is one

1719
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,079
angle is towards the practice bench and

1720
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:09,920
then blue awesome point with taking it

1721
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,000
towards the teaching which is like if if

1722
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,559
you had to send a proxy and what if we

1723
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:18,799
all had to train a proxy tax test taker

1724
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:20,960
um it would take like well you know it

1725
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,280
when you can teach it to another level

1726
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,920
because that would entail

1727
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,280
many many

1728
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,599
aspects of making sure that you could

1729
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,920
upload it in a way where then they could

1730
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,480
offload or um

1731
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,400
not and then of course the infinite

1732
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,240
regress is what if they had to go train

1733
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,960
somebody else and then um you would have

1734
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:44,880
reinvented academia from scratch dean

1735
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,039
yeah i i find that what you got what you

1736
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:48,640
guys are describing i find that kind of

1737
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,559
is an intermediary step where if you can

1738
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:52,480
teach it to somebody else

1739
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,640
you know it and i and i think it does a

1740
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,240
good job of blending sort of the

1741
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,000
procedural knowledge and the declarative

1742
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
part if you can teach it to somebody

1743
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,920
else but i think if you're talking about

1744
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,160
uploading i think you actually need to

1745
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,000
find yourself in a completely different

1746
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
cultural setting

1747
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,079
if as opposed to the offloading aspect

1748
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,680
of it so i think you actually have to

1749
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:12,720
move

1750
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,720
outside of the

1751
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,680
the teaching realm i find i find that if

1752
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,839
you can teach it to somebody else

1753
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:21,200
as a nice

1754
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,920
as a nice sort of middle ground between

1755
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,680
where you would eventually have to go if

1756
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:26,960
you're going to

1757
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,799
niche construct

1758
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:30,880
in the wild

1759
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,359
as opposed to the setting which is

1760
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:36,160
somewhat contained and framed which is

1761
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,240
teaching right learn learning in that

1762
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,119
setting

1763
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:40,799
so i'm not i'm not saying you're you

1764
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:42,000
guys aren't

1765
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,920
moving in that direction i just think

1766
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,720
that the ultimate end game of uploading

1767
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,480
is different than the one that's

1768
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,720
offloading which there's way more

1769
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,760
offloading in the teaching realm then we

1770
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,960
probably care to acknowledge

1771
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:57,920
or

1772
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,799
for the um plot embedding

1773
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:04,000
offloading is more like instructionalism

1774
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,079
you're offloading the recipe

1775
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:09,119
and then interactionism requires the

1776
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,000
other interact ant to be a cognitive

1777
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,680
entity and so that's more like a figure

1778
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,000
two it's more like cognitive uploading

1779
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,280
and the more

1780
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,160
interactionism is at play the more

1781
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,680
figure two like we're in a space of

1782
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,920
the more it is like a question that dave

1783
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,480
has just asked in the chat which is

1784
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,280
isn't the result of offloading

1785
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,520
a new goal seeking self-maintaining

1786
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,359
autopoetic thing

1787
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:38,160
all caps and and telki that's kind of

1788
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,640
aristotelian a little bit i believe

1789
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:43,680
um yes and that's a little bit like um

1790
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,480
our

1791
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,640
progression here here was two things and

1792
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,160
their interface

1793
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,240
and then it got more and more shared or

1794
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,240
delineated or less

1795
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,720
until at some level of interfacing and

1796
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:58,000
interactionism and extended cognition

1797
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,240
from a functional or psychological

1798
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,760
perspective which is what they explore

1799
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,240
in this paper or from an ecological and

1800
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,160
an evolutionary perspective like

1801
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,799
constant at all explore elsewhere it

1802
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:11,039
does become a new kind of thing the

1803
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:12,720
eukaryotic cell

1804
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,119
is a thing and it's a thing that

1805
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:17,680
involves these nested and interfacing

1806
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,400
systems and then i took the colors that

1807
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,319
we had here

1808
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:24,160
and overlaid them

1809
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,039
from

1810
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:25,839
this

1811
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:29,119
abstract space

1812
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:30,079
into

1813
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:31,599
this kind of space that we've seen with

1814
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:34,319
the figure one and two representations

1815
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:36,960
and isn't that interesting

1816
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,680
that the blanket states

1817
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:43,280
are the interface the border states

1818
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,640
and so

1819
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,480
as we discussed

1820
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,880
the dynamics even in the mere active

1821
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:49,920
case

1822
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,079
could be very chaotic or very difficult

1823
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:55,280
for the entity to predict so mere active

1824
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,039
shouldn't be seen as meaning that it's

1825
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:59,280
like simple or it doesn't have rich

1826
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,839
dynamics

1827
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,680
how do we know which of these settings

1828
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,680
we're in or how do we make the best of

1829
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,640
these settings

1830
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,480
wasn't there daniel can you find the

1831
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,799
slide in the 41 deck where we talked

1832
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,680
about the joint

1833
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:26,000
yes there we go the joint

1834
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,119
self-evidencing i think i i guess i'm i

1835
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,520
i guess what i'm saying is is that joint

1836
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,599
self-evidencing on one level of

1837
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:35,799
instructionalism or the joint

1838
01:07:35,799 --> 01:07:37,599
self-evidencing in terms of the

1839
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,440
interaction piece

1840
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,039
um

1841
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:43,520
i think that that's

1842
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,920
you you can decide how big how how how

1843
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,839
sophistic how complicated you want that

1844
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:50,240
joint to be and i think that that's what

1845
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,799
this is essentially saying is can we get

1846
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:54,720
ourselves to a place of

1847
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,960
this closest like

1848
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:59,119
the closing of the circle of causality

1849
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:00,960
part right that sort of circularity

1850
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,720
piece of this

1851
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,640
when do we when do we realize that it's

1852
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,880
circular is it when we're at the

1853
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,559
instructionalist level or when we're at

1854
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:09,760
the

1855
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,079
level

1856
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,160
blue do you have a thought or there's a

1857
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,520
little bit more slide play that could

1858
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,279
happen i think to resolve dean's

1859
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,040
question

1860
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,198
uh go ahead and give it over to dean i'm

1861
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:23,600
just i'm thinking

1862
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,000
let's say that we were in a forest of

1863
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,759
f2s

1864
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:30,080
so we're no longer thinking about just

1865
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,198
nest mates

1866
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:33,198
interacting but now we're thinking about

1867
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:34,080
like

1868
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,759
each one of these

1869
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:36,799
orange

1870
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:38,880
so we're gonna our system of interest is

1871
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,560
gonna be the orange um guys we got f2a

1872
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,560
f2b and f2c

1873
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,560
and they're like different evolutionary

1874
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,198
replicators of a similar kind there are

1875
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:51,198
different organisms

1876
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:54,399
the blue could be the same physical

1877
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:56,479
niche it could be each other in an

1878
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:58,399
adaptive niche they could each be in

1879
01:08:58,399 --> 01:08:59,439
their own

1880
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:00,960
battles

1881
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,520
but their fitness is being relatively

1882
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,399
compared in terms of their success

1883
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:07,198
now

1884
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:09,679
what does it mean when on that side that

1885
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,600
we were just on

1886
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,520
on figure two

1887
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,719
when uh they mentioned

1888
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,799
this closes the circle of causality in

1889
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:20,640
which the niche and phenotypes are

1890
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,960
trying to learn about each other to

1891
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,359
minimize their joint free energy or

1892
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,600
surprise okay yeah so what does that

1893
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,080
mean that the causality has been closed

1894
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,799
so one worldview would be well let's

1895
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,359
just look at how the three orange

1896
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,600
entities are connected and think about

1897
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,439
how they're in competition

1898
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:41,359
and so that might be a totally valid and

1899
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:44,880
important way to look at it but

1900
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:45,839
um

1901
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:48,799
this is kind of like there's various

1902
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:50,560
statements i'm sure various phrasings

1903
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,960
but i won't even try but what is the

1904
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:53,839
good

1905
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:54,719
in

1906
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:57,520
doing so well in the orange

1907
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:00,239
f2a free energy minimization

1908
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:02,800
such that this whole system

1909
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,280
is actually maladaptive

1910
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:08,000
so that would be like this entity

1911
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,600
being greedy

1912
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,960
in this new kind of interaction or thing

1913
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,239
and so

1914
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:15,280
the one

1915
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,040
uh the orange

1916
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,400
a b or c

1917
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,280
that's going to persist the best or have

1918
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,719
the highest fitness

1919
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,040
is going to be involved in the best free

1920
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:28,880
energy minimization of this whole system

1921
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,400
where there's sense and action coming

1922
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,760
both ways

1923
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,400
because just to short term do a free

1924
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,560
energy minimization here

1925
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,880
at the cost of maladaptive actions

1926
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,440
coming in the future back from the niche

1927
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,719
is not a sustainable strategy and so

1928
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:47,280
that's like where they tuck the little

1929
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,040
bit the last thread

1930
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,840
gets tucked back into the ecology and

1931
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,480
evolution and the selective niche which

1932
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:58,080
is the one that actually provides

1933
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,360
at least an adaptive starting point for

1934
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,960
the cognitive functional and

1935
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,640
psychological habitats that they're

1936
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,120
discussing

1937
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:11,280
what do you think dean

1938
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,719
well

1939
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:13,920
so

1940
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,920
so again here's the thing if we're

1941
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,480
talking about just the perception piece

1942
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,080
and we've got three

1943
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,000
three versions of perception is that

1944
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,239
what you're

1945
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:26,800
you're trying to bring out here

1946
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,520
three similar kinds of entities that are

1947
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,600
involved in

1948
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,000
[Music]

1949
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,600
fitness

1950
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,199
okay but we're focusing on that but

1951
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:36,640
we're focusing in on the on the

1952
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,960
perception aspect of that are are you

1953
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,880
not

1954
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,800
or are we looking at the cultural piece

1955
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,120
of this when three perceivers are

1956
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:48,640
proximal to one another in in

1957
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:51,840
in in an environmental cluster or in a

1958
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,360
cognitive niche how do those perceptions

1959
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,360
align with one another and what's the

1960
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,520
time frame right what's the diacronic of

1961
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,320
this

1962
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,760
i just want to make sure i'm clear about

1963
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:02,800
what you're

1964
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,239
what you're trying to show here

1965
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:07,679
there's probably

1966
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:10,480
multiple ways to think about it or show

1967
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,560
it let's let's try to make it one one

1968
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,080
little bit clearer

1969
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,480
okay here's going to be the blue niche

1970
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:19,040
and now we're going to have

1971
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,760
those cognitive entities sharing a niche

1972
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:22,880
so

1973
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,120
so here's going to be a bunch of brains

1974
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,199
that are going to be sharing the same

1975
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:28,960
blue niche

1976
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,480
okay so

1977
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,840
how does this affect what you're

1978
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,400
discussing

1979
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,239
they're all being interfaced with a

1980
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:37,840
common niche

1981
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,520
and so in what way can we say that

1982
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,840
they're involved in joint action

1983
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,760
perception

1984
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,000
loops

1985
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,239
well that's that's what i'm that's where

1986
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:50,159
i'm where i'm curious because i think it

1987
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:51,760
does what this does is it shows that

1988
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,400
there is something called an extended

1989
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,280
and extended

1990
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,760
aspect of this of this

1991
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:02,400
active inference frame but i wouldn't i

1992
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,960
don't know how each one of those

1993
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,480
perceivers

1994
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,320
realizes

1995
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,760
what the others

1996
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,480
are perceiving as well i think

1997
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,040
the environment or the niche itself

1998
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,159
knows

1999
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:18,880
collectively what that is but i don't

2000
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,199
know that each one of those

2001
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:24,239
individual representations of the brain

2002
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:26,000
necessarily does know and i think this

2003
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,760
is where this it trips up a lot of

2004
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,920
people because oh i don't believe in

2005
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,199
extended uh

2006
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:32,880
extended cognition

2007
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,280
because you can't pause daniel you can't

2008
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,600
possibly know what dean's thinking and

2009
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,280
dean can't possibly know what blue's

2010
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:42,640
thinking but eventually as we work out

2011
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,719
together through communication through

2012
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:47,360
some sort of signaling processes

2013
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:50,400
eventually we we kind of land on it on

2014
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,360
some sort of generally agreed to

2015
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,679
sense there's a collective sense around

2016
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:58,560
this as well and so do we stay well that

2017
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:02,080
collective sense isn't cognition

2018
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,600
and we don't know what it is but it's

2019
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,960
not cognition

2020
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,400
but of course it's all based on

2021
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,760
cognition

2022
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,440
but we're not going to call it cognition

2023
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,400
because

2024
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,719
we can't possibly know everything that's

2025
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:15,280
going on in that other perceiver

2026
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,600
cognizer's

2027
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,159
way of looking at blue at this blue

2028
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:22,000
rectangle right

2029
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,080
so sorry sorry blue knight blue

2030
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,199
rectangle

2031
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:28,159
right so i again i this is that's yeah

2032
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:29,600
thinking through other minds i don't

2033
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,600
know how i don't know how

2034
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,440
we

2035
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:36,159
i don't know how we quantify it

2036
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:39,360
but neces but also recognize that it is

2037
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,520
it does exist

2038
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,520
and if we get if we get

2039
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,520
to to

2040
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,159
um concerned that if we can't

2041
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:51,040
measure it it's not a thing

2042
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,280
then we'll just pretend like it's not

2043
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,239
there

2044
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:56,320
but it it's there and not all things are

2045
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,320
necessarily measurable

2046
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,960
the way that we can hook up the the

2047
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,360
cap and make sure that it's

2048
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,120
picking up everything in

2049
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,040
in the whatever it is rather whatever

2050
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,880
the heck of the one is that is the cap

2051
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,400
as opposed to the fmri i don't know

2052
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,920
eeg

2053
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,960
thank you sir yes um i i just looked up

2054
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,000
like

2055
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,880
opposite of extended

2056
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,320
and so there's like retracted reduced

2057
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,520
shrunk

2058
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:29,120
narrowed shortened

2059
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,560
it's interesting how extended cognition

2060
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,800
feels like a reach

2061
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,679
yet

2062
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:36,840
defending

2063
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:40,800
the other position

2064
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,320
is almost too narrow

2065
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,159
yeah

2066
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:48,400
blue

2067
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,080
so i just was

2068
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,880
going back and reading the author's

2069
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,800
definition of

2070
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,080
uploading versus offloading

2071
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,199
um

2072
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:01,760
and they said in contrast to the

2073
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,840
traditional notion of offloading the

2074
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,520
notion of uploading refers to the

2075
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,560
creation of

2076
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,320
novel cognitive functions that are taken

2077
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:11,040
on board by the cognitive niche per se

2078
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,800
instead of being merely managed by the

2079
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,280
cognitive niche a function is offloaded

2080
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,120
when individual agents restructure the

2081
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,880
world so as to minimize internal

2082
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,280
processing costs and or increase

2083
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,960
reliability

2084
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,640
for example by posting a yellow sticky

2085
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,440
note

2086
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,840
as a reminder a function

2087
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,600
for example that a function is uploaded

2088
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,760
when social and technological change

2089
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,440
means that it's now taken of care of by

2090
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,600
the niche rather than the individual for

2091
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,000
example most agents store phone numbers

2092
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,560
in smartphones instead of by memory so

2093
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,640
the whole number storage function has

2094
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,800
been assimilated into the niche

2095
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,800
uh the niche into which the function has

2096
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,280
been uploaded can then be passed on to

2097
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,679
future generations for them to leverage

2098
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:53,920
share and finesse that function and so i

2099
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,080
wonder if the difference between

2100
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,640
offloading and uploading

2101
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,679
is a transgenerational difference

2102
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:04,640
so like i do offloading

2103
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,800
um like you know with my yellow sticky

2104
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,199
note or or like my notes and my little

2105
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:12,560
pad but i do offloading when i you know

2106
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,159
create a publication from those notes

2107
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:16,000
and publish it into something that's

2108
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,600
then archived that the future

2109
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:20,400
generations can access

2110
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,159
that's that's awesome

2111
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:24,000
um here's a thought on that

2112
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,080
uh connecting it to the epistemic

2113
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,719
actions so offloading

2114
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:31,280
just like they describe it says um a

2115
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,360
yellow stick note on the front door to

2116
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,040
remind them to pick up milk next time

2117
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,800
they are out

2118
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,480
it doesn't say

2119
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,280
this means pick up milk they've

2120
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:44,080
offloaded their cognitive backpack but

2121
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,640
only they know their recovery seed only

2122
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,480
they know the password

2123
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,280
to

2124
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,840
speak friend and enter into

2125
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,320
that extended cognitive function

2126
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:57,920
whereas if it were cognitively uploaded

2127
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:01,120
i made an app that reminds people

2128
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:04,239
to get their milk when they're low

2129
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:06,400
that is actually something that because

2130
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:09,840
of its intrinsic and more integrated

2131
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,080
actual cognitive function like the

2132
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,239
ability to assess information like the

2133
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:16,000
level of milk in the fridge and then

2134
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,239
take an action like remind the person or

2135
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:19,440
not

2136
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,040
it's a bonafide

2137
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,040
cognitive entity

2138
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,040
it's more like figure two more like

2139
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,840
uploading than it is like figure one

2140
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,800
offloading and then that app

2141
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,640
can be leveraged and shared and

2142
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,239
intergenerational

2143
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:36,560
in a way where it would be extremely

2144
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:39,040
difficult and only through like implicit

2145
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,520
learning and seeing it many times would

2146
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,280
somebody be like ah yes we put the

2147
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,040
yellow post-it note when we want to

2148
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,920
remind ourselves later so

2149
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,480
interesting example and it's very true

2150
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,080
what they say about future generations

2151
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,360
dean

2152
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:56,080
yeah and i think when we get into that

2153
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,400
that diacronic piece

2154
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,520
we're not just we're not just

2155
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:04,480
offloading remo remember to get milk

2156
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,719
what we're doing is we're

2157
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:08,400
when we're uploading we're talking about

2158
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,239
rules especially if we're talking about

2159
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:11,760
culture it's the old

2160
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,840
that's not the way we do things around

2161
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,760
here kind of thing

2162
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:16,640
so

2163
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,080
i think

2164
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,480
there's there's a there are differences

2165
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,400
between offloading and uploading

2166
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:25,199
and i do believe that

2167
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:27,120
rules because rules are always kind of

2168
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,520
flexible they're always a limit around

2169
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,000
where when we talk about scale

2170
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
friendliness there's an effective

2171
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,560
limit around how a rule will be able to

2172
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:37,520
function

2173
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:38,960
at scale

2174
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,040
so there's there is going to be a

2175
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,040
certain amount of arbitrariness when we

2176
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,520
get up to that rules place and as we

2177
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,520
pass rules down from one generation to

2178
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,440
the next i'm sure both of you can think

2179
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,600
of the times when your parents told you

2180
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,679
this is the rule and you both looked at

2181
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:55,679
them and went

2182
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:56,880
what the

2183
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,640
why is that the rule

2184
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,600
oh okay i'm so now when we're talking

2185
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,440
about rules and we're talking about

2186
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,040
uploaded things

2187
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,560
i think there has to be a certain amount

2188
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,560
of participation in that rule setting

2189
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,400
it's not always the case

2190
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,000
but i think in order for it to be

2191
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,400
adopted and actually to be a part of the

2192
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,560
cognitive niche we're not just talking

2193
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,960
about content here we're talking about

2194
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,360
consequences here as well and so i think

2195
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:22,800
that's where this gets really really

2196
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,800
interesting in terms of building or

2197
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,280
constructing that psychological and

2198
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,120
functional niche but how also

2199
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,800
appreciating that it's kind of

2200
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,960
rules-based and it's joint

2201
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,760
self-evidencing as opposed to well

2202
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,760
daniel just believes in

2203
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,840
in

2204
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,920
jitsi right so everybody's got to follow

2205
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,520
daniel's rule

2206
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,280
but that's not kind of how it works when

2207
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:46,639
you bring a bunch of people together and

2208
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:48,719
you're trying to come up with some sense

2209
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:50,880
of where it is where is where are the

2210
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,159
cognitive

2211
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:53,920
where are the cognitive limits here that

2212
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,960
arbitrariness aspect of it is actually a

2213
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,880
part of the game

2214
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,400
so that

2215
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:01,600
is awesome it connects the

2216
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,320
intergenerational niche inheritance

2217
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:07,040
to the interactionism

2218
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,679
and to that idea of having to teach

2219
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:11,360
somebody else to take your organic

2220
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,440
chemistry test is the point of rule

2221
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,760
following in the short term from the age

2222
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,600
of you know zero to six years old to

2223
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,000
minimize the perceived number of times

2224
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,679
that a rule is violated

2225
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:24,320
or is it to minimize the amount of times

2226
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:27,360
that your grandchildren

2227
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:30,000
violate that rule or for example and so

2228
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,400
the further one looks into the future

2229
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:36,239
the more interactionist it looks and the

2230
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:37,440
more

2231
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:40,080
autonomy potentially provided to the

2232
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,320
recipient and that might also connect

2233
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,560
back to mike levin the discussion on

2234
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,400
training and learning

2235
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,159
because the the trainer

2236
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:49,840
and the trained

2237
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:53,040
that may be a functional dyad but it may

2238
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,760
not be able to result in the trainee

2239
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,280
being able to be

2240
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,880
training somebody else whereas somebody

2241
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,560
who has learned has a generative model

2242
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:01,840
update and so they might be able to

2243
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:02,639
teach

2244
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:06,080
and then also to connect to um

2245
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,560
dean's uh let's uh it was academic and

2246
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,679
professional

2247
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:11,440
settings right and we talked about like

2248
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,280
the hybrid models

2249
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:16,800
and about um okay so we had the

2250
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,719
we had walking into new niches then we

2251
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:21,840
had the professional okay

2252
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,199
here

2253
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:27,600
is us and now we're engaging

2254
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,440
we can think of this in of course

2255
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,040
multiple ways

2256
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:34,719
so one of this would be diachronic

2257
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:37,040
so the diachronic interpretation

2258
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,679
would be grandparent

2259
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:40,639
parent

2260
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:43,040
child

2261
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:46,960
this the synchronic but extended spatial

2262
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,639
interpretation

2263
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:50,560
would be this could all be happening at

2264
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:53,040
the same time here's the academic

2265
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,920
context academic niche

2266
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,480
me in the academic niche

2267
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,080
professional niche

2268
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:03,760
other professionals in the niche

2269
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,000
so we have through space and through

2270
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,600
time

2271
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,840
just like they explored some of those

2272
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,679
dimensions in the paper what do either

2273
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:14,480
of you think about that

2274
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:18,800
the representation i think it's

2275
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,480
like like this extended act of

2276
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:23,520
difference it it grows right it

2277
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,199
it blossoms

2278
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:28,960
so i'm liking where it's going

2279
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:33,679
so it just made me um think about like

2280
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:36,159
so i had brought up the temporal um you

2281
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:38,000
know maybe to be uploading versus

2282
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,920
offloading there's some kind of temporal

2283
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,440
persistence but

2284
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,719
also like what if

2285
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:48,239
to be uploading it has to be accessible

2286
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:50,000
even in the same time because we don't

2287
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
really know if our youtube video is

2288
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,920
going to be around in 10 years or

2289
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,040
watched by anyone else except us or we

2290
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:00,880
don't really know um but but we do uh

2291
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,960
know that it's watched by like tucker

2292
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,360
was watching it i guess and dave and and

2293
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:07,520
so there are some people watching it so

2294
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:10,320
so if uploading just means

2295
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:13,760
beyond personal use would that be fair

2296
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:16,159
like is that is that uploading um versus

2297
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:17,600
offloading

2298
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,840
i don't know um but then if i

2299
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,239
if i remind my daughter like so so it

2300
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:23,360
just makes me think of like but what

2301
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,560
about this but what about this so if i

2302
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,560
remind my daughter like hey don't forget

2303
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,800
your lunch or hey you know you need to

2304
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,800
study for your spelling test if i remind

2305
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:31,600
her

2306
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,080
or if i create a reminder for her is

2307
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,199
that

2308
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:38,559
uploading or offloading

2309
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,760
here's your lunch

2310
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,080
here's a post-it

2311
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,520
to remind

2312
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:48,400
of lunch

2313
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,639
how will you

2314
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:54,840
remind yourself of your lunch

2315
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,880
and it probably there's probably ones

2316
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,960
that we could add above here is your

2317
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,719
lunch

2318
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:07,199
um here's the food in your mouth

2319
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:08,880
here's the airplane flying in in the

2320
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,040
food in your mouth

2321
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,880
or even before

2322
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:13,760
yeah

2323
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,360
well before here's your lunch i need to

2324
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,920
remember to remind my daughter to

2325
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,280
get her lunch

2326
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,960
so there's like how am i gonna remember

2327
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:22,480
to remind my daughter to get her lunch

2328
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:25,360
like there's that whole like second tier

2329
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,839
of that

2330
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:28,960
yeah

2331
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:29,920
yes

2332
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,159
yes um and this is kind of like a

2333
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:34,159
continuum on the um well this is a

2334
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:35,440
preparatory

2335
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,280
uh preamble but then it's like a

2336
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:38,840
continuum again from the more

2337
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,480
instructionalist

2338
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,880
to the more interactionist

2339
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,159
um

2340
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:47,519
and it probably gets more

2341
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:51,040
allegorical and it gets more flexible

2342
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:54,239
it gets more empowering but if you say

2343
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:57,120
and you mean it how um

2344
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,560
i'm gonna let you decide how to remind

2345
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:01,920
yourself of how to get your lunch

2346
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,719
but also if you forget your lunch

2347
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:07,679
you know it's gonna be really bad

2348
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:10,239
then that creates a cognitive tension

2349
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:11,760
and so that's kind of like where it's

2350
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,679
okay to experiment and fail and

2351
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:15,040
interaction

2352
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:18,719
you know to improvise one must

2353
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:22,480
like make some notes they didn't intend

2354
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,639
and then continue to roll with it as

2355
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:26,320
their new

2356
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,719
state and just continue on

2357
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:31,440
like in improv versus if it was just

2358
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:34,239
about playing the sheet music as written

2359
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:36,560
then every time a mistake is made

2360
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:38,239
one could just

2361
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:41,759
push the rails back in

2362
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:45,040
so i think what you're saying is i need

2363
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,280
to let my daughter go hungry when she

2364
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,360
forgets her lunch because right now if

2365
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:50,800
she forgets her lunch it's really bad

2366
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,320
for me because i have to drive like an

2367
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:53,840
extra hour to go home and get the lunch

2368
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,679
or it's either way it's an hour out of

2369
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:56,800
my day i've got to stop at the grocery

2370
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,320
store and assemble lunch it's not just

2371
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,320
lunch it's like lunch plus like six

2372
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:01,440
different snacks that she eats

2373
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,040
throughout the day so she has to bring

2374
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,639
all the food with her every day so it's

2375
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:07,440
really bad for me if she forgets so um

2376
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:08,800
because i end up taking care of it for

2377
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,480
her i should just let her starve and

2378
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:15,120
then i will have uploaded that task

2379
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,239
without getting between mother and

2380
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:21,920
daughter can i just say one quick thing

2381
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:22,800
here

2382
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,679
um i think again if we're if we're just

2383
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:27,920
trying to figure out what the extended

2384
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,679
cognition if

2385
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:31,280
if there's evidence for extended

2386
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,480
cognition

2387
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,320
it's probably in

2388
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:35,600
the rule

2389
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,080
and the consequence so it's to your

2390
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:40,320
point blue if there's a consequence here

2391
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,800
who has to take that consequence on

2392
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:45,040
the older person who

2393
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,600
who who maybe whose prospective memory

2394
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:48,480
didn't

2395
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,480
work out that day and didn't provide all

2396
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:53,760
the reminders or the younger person

2397
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:55,600
who now is

2398
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:58,080
has the effect of not having something

2399
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:00,159
to eat but i think the point here in

2400
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:03,360
terms of can we

2401
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:05,040
the argument because they call it an

2402
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,800
argument this paper is an argument the

2403
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,159
argument for

2404
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:10,159
extended cognition

2405
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:11,679
would be one where

2406
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:14,480
if we upload we're probably going to be

2407
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,400
uploading rules

2408
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,400
and the consequences of those rules are

2409
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:19,760
implied

2410
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:22,480
versus the uploading of content and

2411
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:26,080
material that tends to overwhelm us

2412
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:29,120
and that we use devices then to act as a

2413
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,600
way of being able to store because our

2414
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,239
own memorial capacities are

2415
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:36,159
are somewhat limited like i mean when i

2416
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:38,560
compare my memorial capacity to you and

2417
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:41,199
daniel i i can't hold a candle to that

2418
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:42,960
right so i should be the one using all

2419
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:45,440
of the instruments for that

2420
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,760
but what i do is i have my own way of

2421
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:50,000
sort of compensating for that by

2422
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,880
developing my own rules sooner

2423
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:55,440
and with with a more um

2424
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:58,320
consequential nature to that right so

2425
01:28:58,320 --> 01:28:59,840
that's what one of the things we could

2426
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,840
possibly be teaching six to

2427
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,120
eight-year-olds

2428
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,920
not just here are the rules

2429
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,280
but what can you do in terms of helping

2430
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:12,639
me who's probably got less capacity as i

2431
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:14,880
get older for remembering all the

2432
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:16,480
content

2433
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,960
so there's consequences for me now and

2434
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:21,280
there's consequences for you we both

2435
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,679
suffer a certain consequence in this new

2436
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:24,960
environmental niche that we're

2437
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,400
constructing

2438
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,760
now maybe the eight-year-old doesn't

2439
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,440
give a rat's backside about that she's

2440
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,199
just hangry now but

2441
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:33,120
oh well right i mean so there's going to

2442
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,360
be some learning one way or another and

2443
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,280
it could be through guilt or it can be

2444
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,600
through some kind of a conversation

2445
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,360
where you actually do introduce the

2446
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:45,360
rules and the consequences i don't know

2447
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:51,760
in comparison to memorizing the rgb

2448
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:54,800
values of an image like the pixel colors

2449
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,480
none of us have memories that hold the

2450
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,440
candle to even the smallest jpeg

2451
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,040
so

2452
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:02,960
render onto the jpeg that which is

2453
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:04,320
jpegable

2454
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:07,280
and then what will that leave humans to

2455
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:08,320
do

2456
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,199
and

2457
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:11,679
we hear about cognitive overload

2458
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:13,840
cognitive security of course

2459
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,920
what does that actually mean

2460
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:18,639
for designing informational niches

2461
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:21,679
cognitive niches from the psychological

2462
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:23,600
functional ecological selective

2463
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,719
perspectives that are not overwhelming

2464
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:28,960
or that are accessible or that are

2465
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:32,400
resilient or that do stabilize function

2466
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,960
there's so many awesome

2467
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:37,199
questions that this like brings us

2468
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:38,159
totally

2469
01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:40,239
towards

2470
01:30:40,239 --> 01:30:43,199
daniel i'm sorry but i'm gonna have to

2471
01:30:43,199 --> 01:30:45,520
bounce out now because uh

2472
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,600
i've just kind of used up all my energy

2473
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:50,000
anyway close this swing i hope you guys

2474
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,440
can close this thing off for me and i

2475
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:53,199
look forward to the point too so thanks

2476
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:56,800
thank you dean peace all right all right

2477
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:57,840
cool

2478
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:00,159
blue

2479
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:03,120
let's uh think for a few more minutes

2480
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,440
what could be fun

2481
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:06,000
4.2

2482
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,280
and just how we can

2483
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:11,120
go from

2484
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,679
some of the rhetoric and perspectives

2485
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:16,080
they share towards

2486
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,080
all of these extremely relevant

2487
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,080
scenarios that we've been

2488
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:22,239
discussing

2489
01:31:22,239 --> 01:31:23,920
like

2490
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,280
yeah

2491
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,440
so for me i think i'd like to touch back

2492
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:31,239
on to um

2493
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:35,360
what other situations are like the

2494
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:38,239
elizabethan

2495
01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:39,760
play

2496
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:42,800
people like the elizabethan cast

2497
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:44,320
the theater company that's what it is

2498
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:45,840
sorry uh

2499
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,760
so what other situations are like this

2500
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,639
elizabethan theater company in that

2501
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:52,560
the culture is so

2502
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,320
strong and so

2503
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:57,040
vital to participation

2504
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:59,040
that um

2505
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:01,840
you can just wing it like you can know a

2506
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:04,320
lot of things just by cueing off of

2507
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:05,360
others

2508
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:07,840
so i had mentioned jazz i don't know

2509
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:10,000
what else um what other i'd like to look

2510
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,760
at that a little bit more because is

2511
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:15,199
that that was the example that they gave

2512
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:17,920
right this this diaconic cognition so it

2513
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:19,520
would be cool to look at that

2514
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:22,159
uh a little more deeply

2515
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:23,280
yes

2516
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:26,639
especially in like the kind of online

2517
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:28,090
context um

2518
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:29,840
[Music]

2519
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,000
yes

2520
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,239
um

2521
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:36,320
agreed about that yeah you brought up

2522
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:39,520
music and jazz and about culture where

2523
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,840
does what is culture of different kinds

2524
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:44,239
and where does that fit into

2525
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:45,679
this ability

2526
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:49,280
of people to have a joint action

2527
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,440
in what ways or in what senses is

2528
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:54,840
culture about shared ways of thinking

2529
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:57,440
orthodoxy heterodoxy

2530
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:00,080
in what ways is culture about joint

2531
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:01,120
action

2532
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:05,280
orthopraxis and heteropraxis

2533
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,880
so i was thinking also about action um

2534
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:11,360
and like action off-loading

2535
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:14,320
uh uh because just like in terms of a

2536
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:17,280
scaled system like sure cells do their

2537
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:20,239
own actions like they eat food and they

2538
01:33:20,239 --> 01:33:22,400
you know secrete nutrients and you know

2539
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,000
they like communicate with each other

2540
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,480
and whatever but but in terms of like a

2541
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:28,159
nested system

2542
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:29,040
um

2543
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,800
like the cells don't have to go find

2544
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:33,360
water the water just comes to them

2545
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,600
right like like whereas a human it's

2546
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,199
like one of the most vital things that

2547
01:33:37,199 --> 01:33:39,440
we could ever do is find water like

2548
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:41,920
clean drinking water super necessary for

2549
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:42,800
life

2550
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,239
so

2551
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:45,520
we have to do that i mean we've

2552
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,280
offloaded that into our culture with

2553
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,440
running water but not every human

2554
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,880
but i just think about we're acting on

2555
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:54,560
behalf of organ systems cell systems

2556
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,560
organelles et cetera

2557
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:59,280
so i think about action off-loading so

2558
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:02,000
what does that look like um

2559
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,080
yes and how how akin to cognitive

2560
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:07,760
offloading or uploading is that

2561
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:11,040
yes in what ways is the cognitive

2562
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:12,500
offloading and uploading

2563
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:14,480
[Music]

2564
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:16,719
that of perception

2565
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:20,400
in what ways is it offloading action

2566
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,800
like if you write a script

2567
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,239
that then

2568
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:26,880
does some daily task

2569
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:29,120
that could be seen as like offloading a

2570
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,120
repetitive action

2571
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,840
and that's something that

2572
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:38,320
we're only unlocking with computers

2573
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,639
but it's kind of like a and it's even

2574
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:43,760
referenced in the idea of a daemon

2575
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:44,840
in

2576
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:47,280
computers it's like the magician's

2577
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:48,400
familiar

2578
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:49,440
it's

2579
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:53,360
this little trainable or learning entity

2580
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:54,159
that

2581
01:34:54,159 --> 01:34:56,560
is able to carry things out

2582
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:01,040
according to the will of the magician

2583
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:04,159
in a semi-autonomous way

2584
01:35:04,159 --> 01:35:05,840
it's not just computers though we've

2585
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:08,239
automated some tasks for us

2586
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:09,920
through the years through the ways of

2587
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,600
like even just with running water like

2588
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,760
we you know that's an automated task

2589
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:16,560
that used to be a big portion of your

2590
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,639
daily life as a human like going to find

2591
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:19,600
water

2592
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:20,400
um

2593
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,080
and i mean washing machines dishwashers

2594
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:23,280
we've all all the things i mean we've

2595
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:25,040
been automating life for forever so now

2596
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:27,199
it's just becoming more sophisticated

2597
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:29,119
now perhaps we're automating our

2598
01:35:29,119 --> 01:35:32,159
cognitive life like with gpt3 i think

2599
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:33,920
that that's like a

2600
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:36,320
a different kind of

2601
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,639
yes we're it's um approaching automation

2602
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:41,920
at the semantic and linguistic level

2603
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:43,920
whereas previously it could be like at

2604
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:47,600
the task the physical task performance

2605
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,400
level could be offsourced or uploaded in

2606
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:51,760
a sense

2607
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,760
this is like

2608
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:55,520
rapidly

2609
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:56,800
rising

2610
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:57,840
in its

2611
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:00,210
cognitive complexity

2612
01:36:00,210 --> 01:36:01,360
[Music]

2613
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:03,920
like a typewriter is a mere active

2614
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:06,159
entity it's part of extended cognition

2615
01:36:06,159 --> 01:36:09,119
type type type type type but unless it

2616
01:36:09,119 --> 01:36:11,119
gets jammed one is not going to be too

2617
01:36:11,119 --> 01:36:13,760
surprised by how it performs

2618
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:16,320
um and that's like the famous turing

2619
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:18,400
quote from back in the day and someone

2620
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,800
said like um how can it have

2621
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:23,360
intelligence or um if it can't give a

2622
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,480
surprising answer and uh and then

2623
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,560
turning said something like

2624
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:30,639
computers surprised me every day

2625
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:32,800
so is that going to be your measure how

2626
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:34,639
surprised you are

2627
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:36,639
um

2628
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:39,040
let's see

2629
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:43,520
i want to look at the partition

2630
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,679
question that dave raised and also the

2631
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:48,400
earlier question from dave when he wrote

2632
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:51,040
about the result of cognitive offloading

2633
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,960
it was um it was more about cognitive

2634
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:55,119
uploading he clarified in the chat

2635
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:56,719
but i was thinking

2636
01:36:56,719 --> 01:36:58,480
yeah i was thinking about the partition

2637
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:00,159
too like when i was talking about i

2638
01:37:00,159 --> 01:37:01,679
meant to say partition in there because

2639
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:04,639
it's a temporal partition going from

2640
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:06,480
this generation to the next or is it

2641
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:09,040
like a cognitive or like a

2642
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:11,360
organismal partition between like me and

2643
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:13,440
you or me and my daughter or this group

2644
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:14,719
in that group

2645
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:16,880
the partition is the fuzziness of the

2646
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,440
partition always makes it interesting

2647
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:21,600
okay what else let's let's that's it

2648
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,840
let's read his question

2649
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,600
so in some papers

2650
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:28,639
other than this one

2651
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:30,880
so here's the niche of papers citing

2652
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,880
each other

2653
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,480
we're in an adjacent regime of an

2654
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:38,000
attention but it's it's relevant

2655
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,840
the point comes up and this comes up

2656
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,920
indeed in discussion

2657
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:45,040
anatomical or mechanical blankets

2658
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:46,639
so at the cellular level this would be

2659
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:48,880
like the lipid bilayer cell membrane at

2660
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:50,719
the organismal level this would be like

2661
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:53,520
the epithelial so anatomical gross or

2662
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:54,560
micro

2663
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:56,239
mechanical blankets

2664
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:58,080
sometimes

2665
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:01,199
coincide with functional psychological

2666
01:38:01,199 --> 01:38:04,159
blankets and sometimes not

2667
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:04,880
so

2668
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,639
two brain regions

2669
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:09,760
that are separated but have an interface

2670
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,840
it might be the case that their function

2671
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,760
could be ascribed with a certain

2672
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,360
partition

2673
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,040
that reflected the partitioning

2674
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:19,760
topologically of the anatomical

2675
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:22,719
components or it could totally not be

2676
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:25,119
that way so sometimes

2677
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:27,760
anatomical mechanical blankets coincide

2678
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:29,600
with functional psychological blankets

2679
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:30,960
and sometimes not

2680
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:32,800
insert all the asterisks that we've ever

2681
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,400
had about realism and instrumentalism

2682
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:36,800
but just we're going to plunge ahead

2683
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,320
what is the relation

2684
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:40,159
among

2685
01:38:40,159 --> 01:38:43,360
that distinction

2686
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:46,080
between the two kinds of blanketing

2687
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,719
this one more of a

2688
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:52,320
embodied enacted realist flavor

2689
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:55,040
and this one more of a

2690
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:58,040
functionalist

2691
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,799
flavor

2692
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:03,760
so what is the relation among a b and c

2693
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:06,639
here so what is

2694
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:09,440
it's a relation of relation of relations

2695
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:11,760
as per usual

2696
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:15,280
we're relating a b and c

2697
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:16,480
where

2698
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:17,520
a

2699
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:20,000
is the relationship between these kinds

2700
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,920
of blankets

2701
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:23,280
b

2702
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:26,080
is the hierarchical and hierarchical

2703
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,560
nesting of blankets

2704
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:31,360
and c is the relations

2705
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:34,480
between or among niches

2706
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:36,159
and the particles that upload

2707
01:39:36,159 --> 01:39:40,360
functionality to those niches

2708
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:47,199
what do you think blue about when they

2709
01:39:47,199 --> 01:39:51,280
say that the answer is in the question

2710
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:55,199
like the way that the question is asked

2711
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:58,080
contains the seeds of an answer

2712
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,960
what do you think about that

2713
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:02,159
um i mean

2714
01:40:02,159 --> 01:40:03,840
are you talking about like

2715
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:05,119
how i would

2716
01:40:05,119 --> 01:40:06,080
you know

2717
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:08,400
cognitive offload information as an

2718
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:09,840
undergraduate just because i could tell

2719
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,679
by the way that the question was asked

2720
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:13,440
yeah like i think i did that

2721
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,280
um like i think i looked for i looked

2722
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:16,800
for the answer in the question quite

2723
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:19,040
often as long as it's a multiple choice

2724
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:21,119
question that was pretty simple or if it

2725
01:40:21,119 --> 01:40:22,800
wasn't there was often somewhere else in

2726
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,199
the test in a different question so like

2727
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:28,400
okay so yeah i did that um

2728
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:31,679
but i think here

2729
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:36,320
there's definitely some

2730
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:39,920
answering here happening like that

2731
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:42,400
distinction what is that like i hate

2732
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:44,960
those i hate those words i hate i hate

2733
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:46,960
those words as i use like a the similar

2734
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:48,480
like referential what is the name of

2735
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:50,719
like the part the part of speech that it

2736
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:53,280
is this that those these

2737
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:55,440
you know those those words

2738
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:58,879
words that are um

2739
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:01,040
oh it's an article

2740
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:02,560
it's an article because the pronoun is

2741
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:04,719
like he she it so it's the articles so

2742
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:06,719
the articles really bother me i think

2743
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:07,600
that

2744
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:09,600
um that distinction the distinction

2745
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:11,040
between anatomical and mechanical

2746
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:14,560
blankets or the functional psychological

2747
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:16,880
blankets yes i'll write it out i believe

2748
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,400
it's the distinction between anatomical

2749
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,480
mechanical

2750
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:24,080
and functional psychological

2751
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:28,400
those so it should be a plural article

2752
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,320
that's what was throwing me

2753
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:31,119
um

2754
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:32,880
yeah anyway the nesting of blankets is

2755
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,880
always something like i am down to talk

2756
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,600
about but but here

2757
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:38,480
i don't know

2758
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,800
does the the does the distinction need

2759
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,880
to be drawn if you're talking about

2760
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,560
nesting of blankets

2761
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:46,880
how can you

2762
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,320
make distinctions between different

2763
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,719
types of blankets i don't know

2764
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:53,520
maybe that's just me

2765
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:57,280
we what do you think we explored some

2766
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:59,440
aspects of it

2767
01:41:59,440 --> 01:41:59,930
when

2768
01:41:59,930 --> 01:42:01,840
[Music]

2769
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:04,960
you mention the multi-scale

2770
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:06,639
approach where like we can think of

2771
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:08,000
nesting

2772
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,360
as the bigger nested system whether it

2773
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:13,040
hosts only one

2774
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:14,960
active entity within it or multiple

2775
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:18,560
laterally interacting entities

2776
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:20,880
the bigger nesting

2777
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:23,199
so putting a aside for now

2778
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:25,440
the bigger nested system

2779
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:28,719
can be seen of as the niche for the

2780
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:31,760
subunit or subunits inside of it

2781
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:32,800
and so

2782
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,159
for sure

2783
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:36,159
this

2784
01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:38,880
b and c can be connected

2785
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:39,840
because

2786
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:40,960
the

2787
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:42,480
nested system

2788
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:44,880
its niche its environment what its

2789
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:47,040
actions are going into and what it is

2790
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:49,840
getting sense information from

2791
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:52,320
is the niche and that is like the larger

2792
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:54,239
nested system

2793
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:58,239
now how do nested systems

2794
01:42:58,239 --> 01:43:00,000
using that as a shorthand for both b and

2795
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,520
c

2796
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:04,560
connect to this

2797
01:43:06,159 --> 01:43:10,960
structural and functional perspective

2798
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:13,360
on systems

2799
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:15,520
are nested systems when we talk about

2800
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:17,520
nested systems

2801
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:19,199
in what ways

2802
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:21,360
can be yes and is it a

2803
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:22,840
structural

2804
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:26,000
nesting like the word is inside the

2805
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,719
sentence inside of the paragraph

2806
01:43:28,719 --> 01:43:32,320
or in what ways is it a

2807
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:33,440
functional

2808
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:35,280
nesting

2809
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:36,080
where

2810
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:38,400
the functional nesting of concepts

2811
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:40,880
doesn't necessarily have to follow from

2812
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:42,639
the nesting of like sentences on the

2813
01:43:42,639 --> 01:43:44,960
page

2814
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:47,760
i think that's a very

2815
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:49,679
challenging but important question and

2816
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:50,960
then also when you mentioned like the

2817
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:54,239
undergrad example um and we've been

2818
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:56,239
talking a lot about test taking right

2819
01:43:56,239 --> 01:43:57,119
here

2820
01:43:57,119 --> 01:44:00,560
it made me think about how in undergrad

2821
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:03,280
or potentially even earlier yes it was

2822
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:05,040
possible to like kind of reverse

2823
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:07,600
engineer and so like the answer is in

2824
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:09,679
the seeds of the question is kind of

2825
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:12,000
like a game to play where you're just

2826
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,320
trying to maximize your score on some

2827
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:15,199
test

2828
01:44:15,199 --> 01:44:18,400
but then you get rugged in grad school

2829
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:20,719
where it is still true that the question

2830
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:22,400
that you're asking to nature to the

2831
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:23,440
system

2832
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:25,040
contains the seeds of the answer like

2833
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:26,400
you're only going to get the data for

2834
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:28,000
your experiment

2835
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,920
of the kind that you measure on the

2836
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:31,760
number that you actually measure it from

2837
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:33,040
where the conditions that you set them

2838
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:34,960
up to be in

2839
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:36,239
but

2840
01:44:36,239 --> 01:44:39,119
if one tries to p hack nature

2841
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:42,400
or if one tries to do that sort of

2842
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:45,280
undergrad i'm going to maximize i mean

2843
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:47,040
these two groups must be different right

2844
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:49,199
so i'm going to try to

2845
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:51,679
measure them with a thumb on the scale

2846
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:54,880
so that they come out to be different

2847
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:57,040
that becomes

2848
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:00,840
tantamount to basically non-rigorous

2849
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:02,960
non-reproducible science

2850
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:06,719
so it just shows i think also to

2851
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:07,840
dean's

2852
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:09,520
continued themes

2853
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:11,760
of like in the lab in the classroom and

2854
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:13,040
then out

2855
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:14,320
so

2856
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:16,800
the highest test score

2857
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:19,040
is not necessarily the highest performer

2858
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:20,320
on that

2859
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:21,920
out in the wild that's towards the

2860
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:23,600
application side

2861
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:27,360
nor necessarily the best teacher

2862
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:29,920
as we've been discussing and so it's

2863
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:31,280
sort of like there's like learning and

2864
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:33,679
development and sometimes it feeds back

2865
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:35,679
on itself with teaching

2866
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:38,239
and other times it just plunges ahead

2867
01:45:38,239 --> 01:45:41,040
with application

2868
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:42,800
to all these different

2869
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,960
phenomena of learning teaching and

2870
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:47,199
applying

2871
01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:48,960
do those all

2872
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:51,040
use the same

2873
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:52,800
partitioning

2874
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:54,719
are they featuring or highlighting their

2875
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:56,159
regime of attention on different parts

2876
01:45:56,159 --> 01:45:59,400
of the partitioning

2877
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:01,360
so

2878
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:04,000
that's like where i can't ever close my

2879
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,719
instrumentalist eye

2880
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:09,040
it is in the

2881
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:11,520
partition

2882
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:13,280
point because the partition is just

2883
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:16,080
wherever you put it

2884
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:22,480
yes it's how you see it slash model it

2885
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:27,199
unless one specifically wants to

2886
01:46:27,199 --> 01:46:29,679
make claims about

2887
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:31,360
realism

2888
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:32,960
i see right i mean

2889
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:34,480
but even if you want like when i

2890
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:36,560
investigate realist claims like if i

2891
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:37,840
look for a partition like what

2892
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:40,080
partitions me from the rest of the world

2893
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:42,639
it's like my skin right so like my skin

2894
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:44,960
is the the boundary it's the markov

2895
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:46,800
blanket that holds me in and the world

2896
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,960
out but like i'm losing pieces of my

2897
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,280
skin every day it gets cut open and so

2898
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:54,080
so then am i is my partition broken or

2899
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:56,480
like you know am i somehow not the same

2900
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:58,800
person i don't know so for me finding

2901
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:01,679
this like boundary that's like solid and

2902
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:05,040
never changes is not doesn't sit right

2903
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:06,159
so that's why like i always have to

2904
01:47:06,159 --> 01:47:07,440
remind myself

2905
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:09,600
it's an instrument so i can never ever

2906
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,199
lose my instrumentalist perspective and

2907
01:47:11,199 --> 01:47:12,800
get into full realism when i think about

2908
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,719
the blanket

2909
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:16,639
so

2910
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:19,440
um it's it's non non-separability it's

2911
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:20,880
you know this is goes back to the

2912
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:22,960
quantum chris fields

2913
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:26,239
you know we're non-separable

2914
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:27,119
fun

2915
01:47:27,119 --> 01:47:29,679
times so i think in uh

2916
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:31,199
dot two

2917
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:33,040
let's just write a few notes down and

2918
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:35,040
then close out

2919
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,360
so i think in dot two we can

2920
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:39,920
look over some formalisms and see how

2921
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:43,280
the quake equation is connected

2922
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:48,960
we can think about what we discussed

2923
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:51,280
about the fastest time scale is

2924
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:53,520
perception

2925
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:54,800
action

2926
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,320
learning

2927
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:57,920
teaching

2928
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:59,199
applying

2929
01:47:59,199 --> 01:48:01,119
etc

2930
01:48:01,119 --> 01:48:03,360
how do these different modes of

2931
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:05,199
engagement with extended active

2932
01:48:05,199 --> 01:48:07,040
inference systems

2933
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:09,199
differ

2934
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:11,760
or what about finding

2935
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:14,400
discovering

2936
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:18,880
so like when you're not taught you know

2937
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:20,480
when you don't know the path and you

2938
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:22,239
find the

2939
01:48:22,239 --> 01:48:25,519
tr the stack of rocks

2940
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:30,400
how do we go from a verb ending in ing

2941
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:32,639
to an appropriate

2942
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:36,159
or useful active model

2943
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:39,040
how do we go from

2944
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:41,280
negotiating

2945
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:43,759
trusting

2946
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:45,679
discomforting

2947
01:48:45,679 --> 01:48:46,880
community to

2948
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:50,239
get communicating to

2949
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:52,320
the right

2950
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:54,480
graphical structure of a generative

2951
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:57,040
model that we can use in our standard

2952
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:59,119
academic routines

2953
01:48:59,119 --> 01:49:03,040
as patiently reminded we all are

2954
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:06,480
by carl on those points

2955
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:08,000
very cool

2956
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,280
okay

2957
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:12,080
fun times thanks a lot dean for
