"Unknown","00;00;27;21","00;00;58;27","All right. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining Active Livestream number 41.1 It's April six, 2022. Welcome to the Active Lab. We're a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing and applied active inference. This is a recorded and an archived livestream. So please provide us with feedback so we can improve on our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here, and we'll be following good video etiquette for Livestream."
"Unknown","00;01;00;04","00;01;51;27","If you want to learn more about any active lab activities, head over to active inference dot org and you can learn more there. All right. Today in stream number 41.1, we are continuing to learn and discuss the paper. Extended Active Inference Constructing Predictive Cognition Beyond Skulls by Constant Clark Kirchhoff and Kristen from 2020 and today in the dark one we're going to have some introductions revisit the roadmap and some of the big questions of the paper and then we can have an open discussion around the figures formalism anything else that people think is relevant and for those who are watching live feel free to add any questions or comments in the live chat so we"
"Unknown","00;01;51;27","00;02;37;09","can start just by saying hello. Hearing perhaps Blue's first thoughts on the paper and from Dean and I, we can revisit what we've been thinking about potentially since the dot zero, which I'll save for soon. So I'm Daniel. I'm a researcher in California and I'll pass it to Dean. Thanks, Daniel. I'm Dean. I'm up here in Calgary. I'm a little nasally today because I'm fighting off a bit of a cold, but I've been thinking about since we did the Dodge Zero is the sort of the the idea around how cognition is maybe cultural and I'll just leave it at that because maybe we can have a bit of a conversation about that today, a passage"
"Unknown","00;02;37;10","00;03;12;02","below Hi, I'm Blue. I'm an independent research consultant in New Mexico. And I yeah. OK, so I'll give some first thoughts on the paper. One thing that really stuck out to me was the idea of glue and truth. So that like gave a whole new, like level like so. So in order for you to have extended cognition, you have to believe in it and you have to you have to be glued to it like you have to have access to it whenever you need it."
"Unknown","00;03;12;11","00;03;29;21","And you have to believe that it's valid, right? So that that's the glue and truth idea that they unpacks in the paper and it gives like a whole new meaning of like being glued to your phone to eat. Like, I was like, oh, this is why we're always glued to our phone. If there's glue and there's truth, right?"
"Unknown","00;03;31;02","00;04;03;18","So that was kind of interesting. And then I definitely like to touch on what Dean was saying. I think that the cognition and bedding and culture is a super interesting aspect. And like in the very last section of the paper, they were talking about like the ability to give like theater like plays without being able to rehearse just based on cultural cues and knowing the context and just being so well versed in how to cue off of each other or this kind of thing."
"Unknown","00;04;03;18","00;04;22;19","And it reminded me like of maybe like a jazz improv, like we know, like what's acceptable or like when you're playing, when you have like a jam band and you're playing all the time, like you kind of just know where to pick off or you know, Danny, you're constantly leaving stigma traces. Like, like there's like this extended cognition that I see happen."
"Unknown","00;04;22;19","00;04;46;28","Like we'll both be doing the same thing at the same time. Like, I was just doing that. Like, it's hard to eliminate redundancy in those kinds of circumstances. So so there is like the shared culture and how like central like even because culture, yes, we have culture as a human society, but like within the Elizabethan theater companies, there's their own culture of I don't know how many people were in the theater company."
"Unknown","00;04;46;28","00;05;05;11","20. So like there's that and being able to chew off of each other and like, you know, the Active Infants Lab, which is growing every day, reach out if you haven't yet signed up to be a participant. So like within the acts of infants lab like we have our community and we have like you know, some people we interact with on a very regular basis and then others less so."
"Unknown","00;05;05;11","00;05;50;25","And so we're kind of able to chew off of each other in that kind of way. And so how does this go out to like your religious culture, your state culture, like your country culture, like let alone society at large? So so this idea of cultural cognition, I think is very salience. And also like really speaks to the IQ tests or not not IQ tests, but even like childhood development and learning like in some cultures, when you give a child, you know, some pieces and do a demonstration for them of how to like, you know, stack blocks together or how to like make a Lego thing in some cultures, like, I mean, especially in the"
"Unknown","00;05;50;25","00;06;11;04","West, it's like a child who assembles the blocks, like maybe starts off how the demonstration happens. But then like there's some new innovative stuff, like we see a child like that, oh, that's so like creative and what what an ingenious way to use these tools in a novel way. But in some cultures, like that, child must be an idiot."
"Unknown","00;06;11;04","00;06;52;10","Why isn't he just replicating like what don't certain how to do? And that's a legit, like, cultural phenomenon that speaks to intelligence and yeah, OK, so I rambled enough. You've got my thoughts. Awesome. Well, at least for now, there'll be a lot to jump into let's return to the big question. So for more background, of course, people can read the paper or check out the dot zero, but let's just pick up with the big question and then the roadmap, and then we'll kind of jump into the more unstructured slides as we framed it here."
"Unknown","00;06;52;24","00;07;33;05","The question of this paper about extended cognition is about how cognition is extended and the way that the authors approach that is this perspective of the cognitive niche which they develop from the perspectives that are focused on here in this paper. With this dialectic of the cognitive niche consisting of a psychological habit from ecological psychology one can think of as well as a functional we have a habit like a neurobehavioral habit, and they also have a selective ecological evolutionary perspective on the cognitive niche that axial constant and others have developed in other work."
"Unknown","00;07;33;05","00;08;02;09","But in this paper they were focused mostly on the psychological and the functional and the timescale of behavioral ecology rather than evolutionary ecology. But this is all kind of in the background. So they focus on the psychological and functional dimensions of the cognitive niche and use that to sort of navigate and triangulate cognitive extensions. So any other ways to think about it or just what did other people think of?"
"Unknown","00;08;02;09","00;08;27;24","We're just like a big question that would maybe mention active inference or not, but what is the kind of question that leads somebody to want to read this paper and understand what they're conveying yeah. I think one of the interesting things here is that if you encounter something that you don't believe is an extension or a continuation of the prior culture."
"Unknown","00;08;28;08","00;09;04;00","So you're walking into a new habitat, we'll just call it that. What what does that then imply in terms of your ability to cognition as a newbie, cognitive cognitively extend into that situation? I think that's what this paper is really interesting in terms of discussing because not so long ago there were a couple of researchers, writers, Lavy and Wagner, who talked about an experience of learning and how you'd be on the periphery of a of a culture, and you would slowly move your way closer and closer to whatever the core of that culture is."
"Unknown","00;09;04;06","00;09;25;25","This doesn't speak to the the cultural aspects of cognitive extension in that way. So my question is, when you when you walk into a new culture, something that you don't feel that you necessarily miliar with, how does how does your cognitive extension get taken up in that new culture?"
"Unknown","00;09;28;20","00;09;53;14","Yes. As opposed to that. And most of the participants in the culture right there, there's there's two components to this. It's how the people will treat you, for example. But it's how the culture treats you as well. So there's two parts to that. And I just I think that's really interesting. Never broken it out in this paper per se, but they certainly lead to that kind of question because of the research and the argument that they've been able to put forward nice."
"Unknown","00;09;55;02","00;10;18;11","Three researchers walk into a new habit. Is it a psychological habit? Is it a functional habit? And then that makes me think about like the culture of a music festival or something. When you're at the periphery, there's people who are just joining like you are or people who are leaving, or people who want a little bit of a space away from the main action, but using that sort of inner and outer culture idea."
"Unknown","00;10;20;02","00;10;47;15","Very interesting. You have Philip so the idea of being like a newcomer is pretty interesting in this context because there has to be some kind of reciprocity of that. Like you are expecting the niche to be a certain way, or maybe you learn the ways of the niche. You don't really have an expectation or you know, like how your old niche was and you carry that forward with some prediction."
"Unknown","00;10;47;22","00;11;27;06","But as the niche is updating you, you are also updating the niche. And so as the culture is updating you singular, you yeah, you are also updating the culture and it goes around and around like that. And I think or I wonder what degree we all update our culture. Like what is the single characteristic? Maybe it's like a big five personality trait, or maybe it's, you know, some kind of enneagram type, or maybe there's a single dominating thing that makes you have a strong influence on the culture around you."
"Unknown","00;11;27;13","00;11;50;08","Or is it just like the rate at which you transmit information or the number of people that you transmit information to? I mean, we all know that like those nodes that are hotspots in like, you know, social networks are, you know, like they're the influential nodes that have the zillions of connections. So those are just the number of connections that you have, the level of of information that you transmit or the quantity of information that you transmit."
"Unknown","00;11;50;17","00;11;58;29","Or is there something like some personality trait that actually gives you the ability to update your culture more influentially than others?"
"Unknown","00;12;01;04","00;12;36;15","Just one last one last quick one last quick point. I want to kind of build on Lou's point there. So part of this and I and I'm I'm using terminology that's not part of the paper, but I think we could look at Enculturation as a kind of a form of domestic domestic domesticate. Right. And so I'm not sure when a person walks into a new culture whether they're perceived as sort of non domesticated and then we're going to get them caught up or brought up to speed in terms of what the culture is."
"Unknown","00;12;36;15","00;12;57;02","And I agree with you, blue, it is a circular thing. I just wonder where there's a certain amount of wildness that's brought in when somebody new is sort of thrown into the, the bigger cultural pot and whether there's an effort to try to bring them to be more influential on the on the one than the one being influential on the many."
"Unknown","00;12;57;17","00;13;13;04","So I always, always I'm always curious about those things. And I don't think that this is going to get answered right now. But I think that's an important point to sort of remember, especially when we're getting into the flipping part here, which I can see Dan has already got the graph up. So let's go there."
"Unknown","00;13;15;06","00;13;47;20","We will come there. It just made me think about when the niche is not other people. So going on to walk through the forest and the niche is going to be like other trees or just the path itself this kind of figure to representation where there's an active process by which not just is the entity doing action selection with respect to the niche, but the niche is basically being identified and it is taking some sort of active process by which it is doing an inference on the entity."
"Unknown","00;13;47;27","00;14;21;01","And in the forest, it's like, Whoa, are the trees alive? You know, is this Lord of the Rings? But if this is another group of people and this is your social niche and your psychological and functional habitat, is other people, then it is like quite literal. This could be two people in conversation, or this could be one versus multiple and so in the social and cognitive and cultural niche, it is like less of a leap to talk about how there's cognitive processes on both sides."
"Unknown","00;14;21;10","00;14;50;05","But then that helps us recognize that actually it is a continuum. It's like, OK, so if we can very clearly see how in the conversation there's this optimization happening on both sides, then what does that look like when we're in the forest? OK, cool. So some of those big questions have been raised and then let's just revise the roadmap and see where they went on their little forest journey and then we'll jump back into the slides."
"Unknown","00;14;50;05","00;15;19;12","And the governor. So they introduced the cognitive niche, active inference and extended mind concepts and then discussed the argument that they are going to lead us down and the way in which active inference plays into it as we mentioned just recently, they're focusing on the functional and psychological aspects of the cognitive niche leaving for later that echo evolutionary perspective."
"Unknown","00;15;20;00","00;15;57;27","And they're using active inference as an integrative framework and set of formalisms to help address that. They go through cognitive, psychological and functional niches, provide a case study with earthworms and have several figures that we spent a lot of time in the zero looking at where in figure one there was somewhat of an active entity in a niche that could have its own dynamics, but then figure to introduce the idea that the niche is also doing something like what the entity is doing, but with a symmetry so same, same but different."
"Unknown","00;15;58;21","00;16;37;04","And then after that discussion they take the full turn towards extended active inference Eroi and they recognize well if the niche or whatever is on the other side of the entity in the way that we're modeling it is doing something cognitive of is that a way in which we can recognize boundaries and interfaces as well as distributed or extended cognitive processes and they approach that from a few different angles like extension through space spatial extension as well as extension through time temporal extension related to diachronic cognition through time."
"Unknown","00;16;37;21","00;17;00;21","And then they also discussed a few pieces related to, for example, epistemic actions and the relevance of how distributed cognitive systems use epistemic actions, for example, knowing where to look to find some piece of information in the niche that's kind of how they went through this paper. Any comments on the roadmap? Or we can now turn to the blank slides."
"Unknown","00;17;02;16","00;17;09;13","Don't forget about the spiced food because that was also part of the case case study. What about it?"
"Unknown","00;17;11;15","00;17;36;03","I mean, that was like there was the earthworm case, but then there was also like the case of spicing food as like a cultural practice and how like potentially I mean even the act of cooking food or how we prepare food overall, like some parts of food are poisonous or like I mean, you're going to eat blowfish. Like that's a very precise very mentor mentee transmitted practice."
"Unknown","00;17;36;12","00;17;54;09","So but but I mean, more than that, just also like the spices that we use can sometimes be like, you know, poisonous agents and they're slightly toxic to us, but not in small amounts. And but they also like help to get rid of any parasites that might be residing in the meat that we're eating. Yeah, they they use that as a as a case study."
"Unknown","00;17;54;09","00;18;27;08","Also, not just the earthworm with the kidney. This is a book that we've been reading at home recently. Much depends on dinner. It's kind of in the culinary writing genre, not something we talk about too much directly here, but it's a very interesting approach that really does some deep dives on what we could see from our active lab vantage point of like extended and and cultured cognitive processes and thinking about how food gets to the table in all of the ways that it gets the table."
"Unknown","00;18;27;08","00;18;44;02","How do people get to the table? How do we show up and how does that differ through time? So it's kind of a cool book. Similarly like The Omnivore's Dilemma, which I just read, was also like, how does your food get to the table? Where does that come from? And yeah, that's the whole there's a whole set of practices."
"Unknown","00;18;44;02","00;19;12;04","And like, not only that, but it's actually I mean, you go back to thinking about survival and thinking like a state thinking about thinking like a state. There's a whole set of practices that actually construct our society based on the way that we get food, which is really pretty remarkable. It's a distributed metabolism with bringing resources and nutrients to and from and so it is very related."
"Unknown","00;19;12;27","00;19;45;14","OK, so here's a few of the options. People can take a quick little vote or state their preference we can talk about walking into new cognitive finishes, talk a little bit about glue and truth in the context of extended cognitive processes and culture, about applying extended active inference and how that is modeled in its deployment as well as maybe from an experiential perspective."
"Unknown","00;19;45;14","00;20;19;02","What does it feel like to be applying active inference in the extended way we have the question from days about thinking about partitions, and there's a few other ways we could help any preferences from these so when we talk about applying active inference, are we talking about this from a realist or instrumentalist? Perspective? I just need to know determine my vote I think you've already said enough."
"Unknown","00;20;19;28","00;20;36;25","What would it mean? Why does it matter about realism and instrumental ism? If we're talking about applying extended active inference, like what are those as you're seeing it now? And what would the realism flavor or instrumentalist flavor look like?"
"Unknown","00;20;39;03","00;21;06;10","Well, are we talking about actually, what is it like to apply active inference in an extended way? Like what is that actually like? It takes on a very realist flavor when we're thinking about extending active inference beyond our own skull, or are we modeling what are we actually doing here? Are we modeling collective cognition, collective predictive processing as extended active inference, or what are we actually doing here?"
"Unknown","00;21;06;27","00;21;40;26","I would like to know what you guys think. Yes, Dean, my my curiosity around this is always to do with things that actually happen. But I still think there's a sort of a an in a tool or instrumentalist part around it, too. When I first joined this community, I don't know that I could have gotten this become part of whatever the community is evolving into without having both a kind of a realism perspective and an instrumental ISM perspective."
"Unknown","00;21;40;26","00;22;18;28","So I'm kind of I'm always kind of curious when people want to break it out into those two things. I'm a minimum of two things, guy. I think both both of the mixes and I don't think we can actually do anything without having both of them. So let's say we drop one or the other blue. What happens in terms of our ability to of get a real grip on or optimize or do any of the things that we want to do in terms of becoming Enculturated like if we drop one of the two and just put all of our are our resources in the other domain, just like do we do that naturally or do"
"Unknown","00;22;18;28","00;22;32;09","we do that in those domesticated situations? Right? If we're doing it in the wild, if we're truly having to go out there and forage, don't we use both? That's my question. So I will respond to that."
"Unknown","00;22;34;10","00;23;13;12","I do think we use both. I think I drop the instrumentalist perspective all the time. Like I drop it when I think about extending my cognition into my niche environment and I think about extending metacognition into my group of active instance people or whatever I drop the instrumentalist perspective frequently in language, in thought. Like I think about, Oh, what is it like to actively infer X, Y, Z, but I never lose sight of the instrumentalist perspective as the real way things are right."
"Unknown","00;23;13;12","00;23;34;25","Does that make sense? Like so? Yeah, it's much less perspective is the real way things are like, this is a tool. I talk about it as if it's not. I think about it as if it's not, but essentially in my generative model, like from the realist perspective, in my models, when I talk about my model, I am modeling my model and I'm doing it with the instrument of active inference now."
"Unknown","00;23;36;02","00;24;05;24","Well, again, that's that's where I find this really interesting. If we're going to extend extend, it's hard enough to to talk about building a niche or constructing a niche without tools or without realism. But if you're going to do that as an extended cognition exercise now, it's even more complicated, even more complex. How do you drop one of the two and and then continue to feel like you're you're accomplishing something?"
"Unknown","00;24;06;11","00;24;22;12","I don't I don't want to get into a debate where I don't think we're getting into debates about it's one or the other. But I think when you're trying to figure things out to just say, OK, I'm going to I'm automatically going to blind one eye just because I want the other eye to grow bigger. The other eye doesn't grow bigger."
"Unknown","00;24;22;12","00;24;56;19","So why are you doing that to yourself? That's what I always ask. So we can think about applying extended active inference. And as Blue initially asked, are we approaching this in what ways from a realism, in what ways? From an instrument of some perspective? So the realest question just we're at the DMV rather getting our driver's license renewed and they ask us to cover one of our eyes because they actually do want to understand that one of the eyes has a certain visual capacity."
"Unknown","00;24;56;19","00;25;26;05","So we're closing the instrumental, as am I. And it's like to the extent that we can even talk about the real cognitive systems actually really do have functional dependencies that extend beyond any actual boundary in the world or that we state. So however many philosophical caveats you need to add about realism, this I has no problem seeing that the functional components of cognition are distributed."
"Unknown","00;25;26;09","00;26;04;12","So that is realism or really extended active inference. So RDA, II, the instrumental ISM, AI is how are we going to utilize actin in a way that is useful? And so here with this eye, we can see that no matter what, we're going to have to model along with compromises like accuracy minus complexity, the ways in which our models of the cognitive systems they actually do require in the model, the as if influence of influences beyond their neural system."
"Unknown","00;26;04;23","00;26;34;08","So whether those influences beyond the actual boundaries are real or whether those influences beyond the statistical boundaries are statistically real, we can oscillate and like look at something because we're the one who's generating those visuals and integrating those perspectives. Into like a single, coherent, generative model. And one last on this, a lot of times somebody will think, Well, what does a bug see?"
"Unknown","00;26;34;08","00;27;05;28","What does an insect see and it has like a thousand different views of the world. But of course we have two eyes and see just one vision of the world. So there's reason to think that no matter how many facets of the insect eye there, are there still having just a single coherent, visual generative model. So maybe there's even other perspectives, but that won't mean that we are not having a singular, underlying, coherent generative experience."
"Unknown","00;27;06;05","00;27;37;10","So, OK, that bridge being crossed or burnt, depending on what you think what are some situations where we would be applying extended active inference? So and also to distinguish that question from just like where would we want to be extending active inference, where would specifically extended perspectives on active inference be really importance as opposed to just non extended and maybe it'd be helpful there."
"Unknown","00;27;37;10","00;27;44;25","So look at Fig. one and two just to remind ourselves of those differences. So think about the examples while we use blue first, go for it."
"Unknown","00;27;47;14","00;28;23;16","So in the spirit of active inference being a skill free framework, like I think about extended active inference as very critical to this skill friendly slash skill free way that we think about active inference just because it's a biological system where layers and layers and layers and layers and layers deep. So like I this like whatever my ego perceives as me blue, I am an embodied image of extended active inference."
"Unknown","00;28;23;16","00;29;06;22","I mean, so so I don't see it happening anywhere. I don't see it extend to that active inference not happening anywhere. Like I see what happens in my skull, a function as of what's happening in my cells. And my tissues and my organs, et cetera. Because all of those subunits of blue are doing this extended active inference with one another but if we want to look specifically at like a group function which which may be necessary or maybe not, I mean, to go beyond our skull, are we looking at like how organizations function, which maybe Dean wants to talk about more, or how states function or how institutions function at large."
"Unknown","00;29;07;13","00;29;34;04","So so do we have to get actually beyond the physical body to go beyond our skull? Or can we go within our physical body to talk about extended active inference beyond the skulls? Yes. So we can think about like that great point, which is that nested systems of which we often talk about can actually be thought of as extended active inference systems."
"Unknown","00;29;34;20","00;30;05;09","So we've talked about like Aunt Ness mates in the ant colony. And so there's the sense in which the lateral interactions from one ness mates point of view, because those lateral interactions are with other ness mates, there's cognition on both sides of the interaction. So it is like an extended active inference process. And then also there's the extended active inference with the physical substrate and the stigma and the building of the nest architecture and the pheromones deposition."
"Unknown","00;30;05;22","00;30;51;14","And that kind of physical substrate is more on the beer active inference rather than adaptive active inference end of the spectrum. And the physical substrate reminds us more of figure one where you have an active cognitive entity that's doing some sort of free energy minimizing process that's helping it select policy. That's the triggermen and then it's feeding into the dynamics of the external niche, which can be complex, and they have their own indigenous change dynamics, which is seen by the fact that like the rate of change on the external states is a function of something involving the current state of those world states plus a noise term."
"Unknown","00;30;52;00","00;31;21;12","So this can be a complex recursive nonlinear function, but that could still be a mere active entity because it's not actually engaged in a policy selection, rather just a complex dynamical unfolding. And then in contrast in figure two, we see that the external states are still taking similar arguments, ETA and a so the current states at that time and actions feeding into it, that's what's influencing external states."
"Unknown","00;31;21;26","00;32;08;10","And we see those arguments are still here, actions feeding in from the entity and the current state of the external states, except what it's doing is no longer just the rate of change is a function of plus noise, but an active policy selection more like the kind that the entity is involved in. So maybe figure two is reminding us more of like two estimates interacting with each other and figure one is more like a nest may interacting with a physical stick merging and each and so in that way it opens up all of the discussions we've had about multi scale active and nested systems and thinking about them as extended active inference then yeah, in"
"Unknown","00;32;08;10","00;32;40;13","the paper I just read one sentence from the paper. It says here the concept of the cognitive niche that we refer to here is a sort of hybrid between the concepts of the selective developmental and cognitive niches. So right near the beginning. Yeah. Yep. Right there. Yeah, you got it. So in the context of what were those two figures there, when we're talking hybrid, what are we really talking about?"
"Unknown","00;32;40;13","00;33;05;13","We're talking about the comparison of, say, the electric component of the engine and the internal combustion engine that are both in one car. Would that be a good analogy in terms of being able to figure out what part of this is the bridge? Is the vessel one part of this is the electric motor and one part of this is the internal combustion motor."
"Unknown","00;33;05;13","00;33;09;05","Would that be a good metaphor for what we're talking about?"
"Unknown","00;33;12;23","00;33;40;00","What's the car right. Well, that's that's the is that the culture piece? I'm not sure it is. I think it's yeah. I don't know what a cognitive niche is here. Like, I don't know if I want to entail culture with a cognitive niche because this is what this paper is about or whether I want to entail cognitive niche with culture, which is something that we've talked about and a whole bunch of papers."
"Unknown","00;33;40;00","00;34;14;18","Right. So that's a good question. I don't know. It reminds me of your earlier statements about how like if a pizza is something with toppings on top and then if you put it upside down, is it still a pizza so is car the total functional phenomena involving vehicular transport or at what point does that also require like gravity and a road and all these other pieces that are part of the extended process by which cars come to be like is the factory that made the car part of the car?"
"Unknown","00;34;15;04","00;34;46;00","I mean, it would be interesting if they just blinked into existence, but because things are part of process, ontology is how can we connect this question of extended function to the process and object ontology? See Angle. OK, cool blue. I see some stigma happening ok."
"Unknown","00;34;48;04","00;35;38;09","So to kind of close this little thread on, I'm applying extended active inference though of course we welcome a thousand more specific contributions and we hope to continue building these actual models and examples and interactive dashboards and everything out there are multiple ways to think about what is extended and probably even for consensus on the same perspective on the world as it really is, or even on the same choice of models, there would still be a lot of degrees of freedom in how we actually apply X and active inference but one tantalizing cue there from Blue was like connecting it to the scale free scale friendly components and potentially connecting what we've been talking about with"
"Unknown","00;35;38;09","00;36;11;03","active inference in nested multi scale systems to this perspective on thinking about their niche as consisting of other mere figure one or adaptive figure two active entities what do we see with the termites? So I just was thinking about like the literal pushing us into the niche in, in kind of like this scale free slash scale friendly way."
"Unknown","00;36;11;22","00;36;33;14","I saw the last author of these papers gives a talk at the Mathematics of Collective Intelligence Workshop, and it was so cool, like really literally like the termite mound. And I'm sure that the ants nests do the same thing, Daniel. But I think that the they're not very steady about because as soon as you go into start to try to figure them out like they fall apart."
"Unknown","00;36;33;14","00;36;58;23","Is that that's true. So we kind of get it better. Well, many termites build underground and in logs so it can be hard to assess above ground. Termite architecture is of course amazing and more ant architecture is happening underground, which makes it really hard to study unless you have like a high resolution landmine sweeping device landmines, sweep things, devices."
"Unknown","00;36;58;25","00;37;15;14","So like are there like images? I mean, yeah, I don't see how to do it really without destroying it because they're like made of sand, right? So how do you like I mean, I remember like when we were kids, there was like the frame, the two glass panes, and you would get some ants and like throw them in there and watch them like dig tunnels."
"Unknown","00;37;15;14","00;37;51;10","But like other than this, like, very artificial environment, like the deer on the trampoline, other than this very artificial environment, you know, in what way do we know about the architecture but but my point was actually just that, that the termites really like, you know, predicts the behavior of the termites based on like the velocity of the wind and how hot or cool or like they build all these different structures and you can predict like and they not only build these different structures, but they will actually like deconstruct their mound and then reconstruct it like based on whatever is shifting in the environment."
"Unknown","00;37;51;10","00;38;21;09","And so this latest paper school, like really shows that it gets into like the math behind how termites, termite mountains are constructed, like under what, you know, wind velocity and so forth. But I just thought that that was a really neat example of literally putting the offloading into the I mean, we literally do that as humans. And so we're pretty familiar with like, you know, the smart phone and the different ways in which we do cognitive uploading."
"Unknown","00;38;21;21","00;38;44;13","But this idea of cognitive uploading, which I've always used cognitive offloading, cognitive uploading into the news, can kind of tell others, even future others, what was happening to you and your life. It's like you're writing your own little, you know, history book as we are cognitively uploading these videos on YouTube. You know, this will be here after we're gone."
"Unknown","00;38;44;28","00;38;59;05","But the termites do this too, and a very cool, like physical way. It's something Tucker has corrected me in chat. It's not a landmine sweeping device. It's an anti mind sweeping device. So thank you, Tucker."
"Unknown","00;39;01;18","00;39;32;22","Cool. Yes, I think extended act inference systems. The study could include starting with Colony like systems or various other systems but would be another good place to now jump in as we sort of walk back to the midden pile, walk back to the trash heap of ideas and then figure out where to repurpose and go back in. Maybe you meant Justine."
"Unknown","00;39;33;13","00;39;56;01","I just have a question for both of you. So when I think of off loading and they give the example and I think I put the image up there of the brain on top of the of the phone if we if we upload and we're talking about intergenerational stuff, are we uploading into culture? And is that the exact the primary difference between offloading something?"
"Unknown","00;39;56;01","00;40;21;12","So I don't have to remember it and uploading something so that rules are introduced that you will sort of be swept up by if you join this culture? I'm asking because I'm not really sure I was trying to figure that out myself. What's the is there an arbitrariness to this or is that really kind of clear what the line is in terms of they tried to explain it, is it there?"
"Unknown","00;40;21;12","00;40;43;21","They said it's akin to cognitive uploading but it's different. So where did you guys come away on that? On that question of what what's different about it? Yes, great question. Thank you, Dean. Let's look at what they wrote and then let's see where we can take it. So they wrote cognitive uploading is akin to cognitive offloading in the original theory of the extended might."
"Unknown","00;40;44;16","00;41;17;22","However, in contrast to the traditional notion of offloading, the notion of uploading refers to the creation of novel cognitive functions that are taken on board by the cognitive niche persay instead of being merely managed by the cognitive niche functions, offloaded when individual agents restructure their world so as to minimize internal processing costs and or increase reliability. So offloading like you could offload your heavy, heavy backpack and just drop it on the floor."
"Unknown","00;41;18;04","00;41;53;07","So offloading has more of a sense, at least hopefully this is aligned line with, as they're describing it, of like it is allowing the shelves in the world to you're offloading what you're carrying into places in the world. And so the cognitive onus and the imperative for epistemic action is still resting in the entity of interest so cognitive offloading could be consistent with a worldview that's like solipsistic, like there's just this one cognitive entity and they're like offloading they're off gassing."
"Unknown","00;41;53;07","00;42;25;03","It's they're exhaust thermal waste, they're offloading cognition to the niche. Cognitive uploading takes on more of a sense that there's actually something active on the other side because like if you're going to upload a file to a cloud folder, there has to be another server that's actually recognizing your packets as you're uploading that file. So uploading is more consistent with the framing that they have, for example, in figure to surprise, surprise."
"Unknown","00;42;25;14","00;43;11;20","Whereas the cognitive offloading could be consistent with figure one, like I'm trying to have this cognitive function of this symphony of bells being played. And so I'm going to set up these dominoes and these delays in the niche and where to put the sheet music and where to put the Post-it notes off, loading the cognitive requirements, making it extended, making it distributed, in figure two, it goes even a step further, and that's what they're trying to highlight the distinction with with their usage of the word uploading because there's actually something that's cognitive that's accepting the download or the upload from the entity is the download from the server, so to speak."
"Unknown","00;43;11;20","00;43;32;06","So sorry if that's repetitive, but I think it's a subtle and important point. Yeah, I think it's a super important point too. So then and for me the question is, so let's say that I have an academic culture that I could upload to, and I also have a professional culture that I could upload to and let's say there are two different things, right?"
"Unknown","00;43;32;23","00;43;59;27","So I've got I'm a part time student and I'm also working full time at my job every day. Is there some way of being able to find myself or find examples of myself not being downloaded on per se by each one of those different cultures that me uploading into both of those and retaining my sort of hybridized sense of the world?"
"Unknown","00;43;59;27","00;44;36;01","So from a psychological and a functional needs perspective, what does that entail for me as the person who's now kind of doing this oscillation back and forth between these two niche constructions right now? Again, they don't go to that length here, but I think I think it's important based on what you just said, Daniel, for us to remember, it isn't just a single culture examination here at the whole point is, is that there are multiple niche constructions happening all the time, and it's just a matter of whether or not we recognize the differences, right?"
"Unknown","00;44;36;11","00;45;20;12","So I don't again, I'm not sure that they answer that here, but I think we're getting closer to being able to find that answer because of what they're what they're bringing to our attention live. So spin up some slides for you, Dean. So just on that on that point when I really was thinking about cognitive uploading, it's like hmm, it's like putting something into the niche for others to use and reuse and maybe interact with or like remix."
"Unknown","00;45;20;12","00;45;57;12","And what you're saying about like this hybridization between academic and professional really makes me think about complex systems and like the Santa Fe Institute where Daniel and I met and the kind of siloed academic experience that maybe people are still having, unfortunately, but that people have had. So if you are in, you know, mechanical engineering versus biology versus economics, it's like you're very different knowledge acquisition and like a very different culture and a very different way of interacting with your peers."
"Unknown","00;45;57;29","00;46;27;25","And there's this kind of like siloed culture even within an academic culture. So like even subsections of academia tend to be siloed. And when you bring people into a complex systems kind of environment, there's this amazing ability for new ideas to generate, right? It's like this cross-fertilization or cross-pollination. People call it different things, but but when people come together with academic expertize, some, you know, share the ability to read, write and do some mathematics."
"Unknown","00;46;28;05","00;47;04;02","So when people come together with and intermix their own siloed knowledge, which is deep like it tends to be very, very deep. Like if you've got, you know, Ph.D. or bachelor's degree or master's degree in in your field, like, you know, a whole lot about that field and probably not a lot like about the other field. So when you come together in a complex system kind of way, it enables people with this deep, deep knowledge and understanding of their own thing to then interact and it's exciting and it builds new things like I think exponentially like like, you know, if I get together with a bunch of other data scientists or a bunch of other"
"Unknown","00;47;04;12","00;47;36;07","bio people or know people, I don't have that same kind of excited brainstorming, jittery idea gosh, like that was so professional. But but generally I think that that happens in this cross-fertilization or cross-pollination way. And when I think about cognitive uploading, I think about like you put it in so that other people can interact with it so that other people so that it can do the cross-fertilization thing."
"Unknown","00;47;36;07","00;48;03;20","And maybe that's just kind of my naive interpretation of what they were saying in the paper, but that's kind of what I got and then Daniel me the slides. So I totally agree. One slides worth in Cairo time totally agreed though. Like uploading as opposed to or as distinguished from offloading. Offloading. You just need to trust that the shelf isn't going to break and someone's not going to steal your backpack while you're gone."
"Unknown","00;48;04;05","00;48;38;08","But cognitive uploading like you've got to trust that file is being stored and that that is going to be able to be executed potentially even outside of your awareness or control. So when we're in like a interdisciplinary context or just sharing like cognition in a team, we're getting it done as a team. The uploading brings in this whole element of like trust and culture and glue that others are going to be able to do things that you don't want to do, that you can't do, that you wouldn't see of doing all these different ways in which they're active."
"Unknown","00;48;38;08","00;49;12;02","Cognitive model is different, and importantly, aligned, and importantly, contrasting and complementary. It's all of those things. So here's a few visualizations of borders between or interfaces between entities and each other or entities in the niche. So on the left side, it's like the overlap between two systems, whether we think about them as like, Oh, that block in the city, it's part of Little Italy and downtown."
"Unknown","00;49;12;21","00;49;47;13","So there could be like a block, there's a border region, but it is both included in the two sets, or it can be a little bit more blurry or fuzzy around what those orange and blue sets are. But still there's like a region that is overlapping and claimed by both. There's another case where the border or the interface is something that is like overlapping to both, but also a distinct region, perhaps like a cell membrane or in the full separation case, it becomes its own separate region."
"Unknown","00;49;48;04","00;50;23;23","And that entails now this recursive boundary setting, because now there's Wall Street, there's the street in front of the wall. And so this just made me wonder when we were talking about academic and professional, what kind of synthesis or what kind of integration are we looking for? Which one of these setups is predisposed towards effective extended active inference or is this something that we determine about how it really is in the world?"
"Unknown","00;50;24;14","00;50;30;02","Hashtag realism? Is this a model selection choice from an instrumentalist point of view?"
"Unknown","00;50;33;00","00;51;03;28","Can I just speak to respect and I think this is interesting because in this example and also in the paper where they talk about desire lines, we do have a tendency to sort of see these things be at the border or that the artifact of the number of humans or animals that walked to the watering hole and the result of that and they speak to that clearly in the paper that so sometimes that is not acting and the environment's not acting in a surprising way."
"Unknown","00;51;05;01","00;51;44;07","That's the result of what ends up happening when a whole bunch of people follow the same path or use the same stones to break the nuts. And that's the captured monkey example or use the same spaces. Right. And a particular thing, 11 of the things that we kind of just touched on briefly in this got zero was so what if you took all of those examples that you had a boundary and you used green as a as one thing to sort of show it in the rectangular shape, what if you were able to twist that and do with it what we have when we, for example, use the the Mobius Strip in the key words."
"Unknown","00;51;45;05","00;52;12;10","Do you have a representation of that here? And why would that matter? Because I think that actually really does matter, and I think it's something that we tend to overlook. So if we're talking about I mean, if we're talking about transdisciplinary Blue's point I think this fits that really, really well. But if you wanted to talk about people walking into a situation who are creating a new cognitive niche, they don't come from a place of knowing."
"Unknown","00;52;12;29","00;52;46;15","They basically come from a place of not knowing. And they're going to build that new boundary or that new border and they're not going to be restricted to the oval shape. They might be able to put a single twist on it and come up with like like you said, the example that we have that we put up as a representation in our keywords, or maybe they'll do a Mandelbrot and two cranks of the system and they'll come up with the two loops that are orthogonal to one another."
"Unknown","00;52;46;15","00;53;20;24","Right. And and what does that mean in terms of representation around uploading as opposed to offloading? And I think that that's yeah, exactly. As you're building it out here, this is where it actually gets interesting because I think that's where, again, if we always see ourselves as where, where does my cognition end and begin we will get one outlook, a certain number of representations, all conforming to that tree desire to keep it, the cognition contained and framed and stabilized."
"Unknown","00;53;21;03","00;53;42;17","Now, if we look at this from the environment position and the artman flip or inversion of that, can we just limit the inversions to the, the two sides on either side of mark up like it? Or could we actually look at the mark up blanket twisting and reforming itself? Because, I mean, it opens up the space for that possibility."
"Unknown","00;53;42;17","00;53;49;26","No. Whether we choose to give any attention over to that or make ourselves available to that it gets really, really interesting in a hurry."
"Unknown","00;53;52;21","00;54;31;21","But so I think it is really interesting. And where we put the boundary maybe depends on what we feel that we are uploading or offloading like by us uploading these video series into the niche environment of the Internet. We other people are able to cognitively offload like they're offloading their need to delve into deep read and unpack this paper like they could just you know, they've offloaded it to us and they're just watching the YouTube video, not everybody."
"Unknown","00;54;31;21","00;54;51;27","So if you if you're really actually reading the paper, and really into it, just want to hear someone else reflect. But in many ways, you know, we provide a summary that that into this information laden age it's really impossible to just read all the papers, even in your own field when there's five papers released today. So I don't blame you for doing some kind of offloading there."
"Unknown","00;54;51;27","00;55;20;27","But by us uploading that enables someone else to offload, is that always the case? Is there like this interplay with upload and offload? Like I think about Google Maps like that is the biggest cognitive offload that I've seen in technologically in technological advancements in my lifetime. Like I no longer remember how to get anywhere. Like maybe if I drive there 15 times, maybe then but or maybe I know someplace next to it."
"Unknown","00;55;20;27","00;55;34;10","Like, like, but as far as driving to a new place, a place I've never been a new housing development, for example, like I have a friend that moves in and I've never been there before. I'm at their house 15 times before. I remember how to get back and forth and I Google that myself. The whole way every time."
"Unknown","00;55;34;24","00;55;58;03","It's massive cognitive offloading, but only because Google was so keen to upload the information only due to uploading. Can I then offload and then does that also work culturally? Like in terms of I think about institutional or hierarchical organizations or even thinking like a state? I have someone who will make shoes for me. I don't need to know how to make shoes."
"Unknown","00;55;58;03","00;56;28;00","I just need to know how to access shoes. I don't know how to make shoes. So but because someone else is uploading that information technology, their product to our culture cognitively, but it's like the output of their cognition actually, I get it. Maybe they could actually teach someone else how to make shoes if they had to. But but my point is, is that there's like this interchange does upload somewhat because you upload it to someone else, download it, and then they can offload because of their ability to download."
"Unknown","00;56;28;19","00;56;53;11","Sorry if that was rambly. No, I think that that's I think that's perfect. And my question then is, from a learning standpoint, are we more adept at accepting other people's information because that expedites we can follow and use that. Your first example, right? Well, here's somebody which Google I mean, for Google, it's great for them. They can update."
"Unknown","00;56;53;11","00;57;29;14","They went and figured out how to become the go to source for uploading. But what are we doing in terms of giving people a sense of their agency over uploading as opposed to simply just following and being consumed by the Googles? If we're going to invert this, we need to ask that question around what learning what we're giving people in terms of agency and knowing the difference between the trade offs that happen with offloading, as you described, and you're not building any desire lines, you're your GPS is doing it for you."
"Unknown","00;57;30;10","00;57;50;29","Now, now you feel completely dependent upon that thing, and you don't have to be able to make shoes to be able to understand the difference between what you might need in one set of circumstances. On your feet and what you might need on another in another circumstance set of circumstances on your feet. But are we drifting to that place that says, I don't even know what shoes to put on today?"
"Unknown","00;57;50;29","00;58;30;11","I better go and find out from Google yes. Very interesting. Keeping with the uploading, offloading desire paths and Google. Thanks. You too, by the way, for the Affordance. What if each person were only seeing locally which paths were attractive to them, which search results were appealing to them. But then there was an eye in the sky that could see the statistical distributions of everyone else in there uploading and offloading that would actually make that a tremendous resource for the eye in the sky."
"Unknown","00;58;30;11","00;59;02;03","And so that's a little bit of the asymmetry. But the challenge and opportunity also the caption of Figure one does explicitly mention like action, perception and learning. So that's very interesting. And it does raise the question of what is the difference between perception and learning, which is discussed a ton in active and in the textbook, what the similarities and differences are like with perception being over fast or time scales, but being fundamentally similar to learning."
"Unknown","00;59;02;10","00;59;29;26","But learning being about cognitive parameters and usually updating over slower time scales. And then what does learning look like in a cognitive offload? World in the no offload world, then in the cognitive offload world and then in the cognitive upload world. So just to kind of maybe just give one example, the no offload world is the test where you can't bring any notes in."
"Unknown","00;59;30;17","00;59;49;28","Yeah. In that case, it's like what you know about organic chemistry is in your school, it one could go a little bit broader than that, but you can't take in your notes the cognitive offload thing, which is going to beg the question of like epistemic action, is you're allowed to bring in your own notes or even the textbook."
"Unknown","00;59;50;09","01;00;10;25","So it's a dead artifact in the niche. It's a mirror active entity, it's an epistemic resource in what we would call an informational entity in the niche. And it can be referenced and you might only have to learn where to look, learn where you put your backpack, learn which chapter to look to when you want to resolve a certain kind of uncertainty."
"Unknown","01;00;11;05","01;00;32;19","So it's an affordance you didn't have in the no offload case to have the textbook or the notes. What's the cognitive upload? Is it phone a friend? Is it go in with the chemicals and have a lab kit? Like, what does it look like to go one step beyond? Yes, you can take your notes into that organic chemistry test what is the upload?"
"Unknown","01;00;32;25","01;01;00;12","What do you think? I think the upload is when you are taking the information that you've received here and finding yourself migrating in in a completely different culture and somebody in that completely different culture says, I want you to solve this problem for me before I can hire you. Can you do this this thing first? Show me that you can do this thing or resolve this this issue for me."
"Unknown","01;01;01;13","01;01;22;06","So it's it's taking information from one context and finding yourself in a completely different context, not from the person who's decided this is the amount of material that we've covered in these past 13 weeks. And now I'm going to select out the points that I want you to, as you said, load into your into your bucket and carry into the testing situation."
"Unknown","01;01;22;17","01;01;56;23","I want you actually now to take what you've learned, and I want you to go out back into the wild now, where you're going to have to be able to solve something as a result of you loading loading up your your quiver or your your 13 weeks worth of information. Right. That's that that's literally finding yourself now, working with a new culture and that new culture taking on all the properties that they're talking about in this paper another angle on that."
"Unknown","01;01;56;23","01;02;16;14","Oh, yes, please. So my take on that would be to like, say, you have all of the material that you learned you have all the books, you have all the notes. You then go teach it to someone else and they go in and take the test for you. So that would be uploading awesome. Awesome. Is that what you were going to say?"
"Unknown","01;02;16;26","01;02;40;08","Yeah. So we have too much we do too much I was thinking of a driver's exam. It's the difference between the no notes driver's exam, taking the test at the DMV. Can people tell that I just renewed my license? And then there's the having the notes and then there's the actual driving. And so that is where the functions are no longer hypothetical."
"Unknown","01;02;40;08","01;03;03;15","And in a testing scenario, but they're enacted. And that means that it's different to say you should do this when you're parallel parking and it is going to be 15 feet versus the actual enacting of it. And that cognitive function really or instrumentally is happening in this extended way with the visual components of the car and the proprioception of the car."
"Unknown","01;03;03;24","01;03;34;28","So that is one angle is towards the practice bench and then blue awesome point with taking it towards the teaching, which is like if you had to send a proxy and what if we all had to train a proxy text test taker it would take like, well, you know it when you can teach it to another level because that would entail many, many aspects of making sure that you can upload it in a way where then they could offload or not."
"Unknown","01;03;35;10","01;04;00;11","And then of course the infinite regress is what if they had to go train somebody else? And then you would have reinvented academia from scratch. Dean Yeah. I find that what you got, what you guys are describing, I find that kind of is an intermediary step. If you can teach it to somebody else, you know it. And I, and I think it does a good job of blending sort of the procedural knowledge and the declarative part, if you can teach it to somebody else."
"Unknown","01;04;00;11","01;04;36;21","But I think if you're talking about uploading, I think you actually need to find yourself in a completely different cultural setting. If as opposed to the offloading aspect of it. So I think you have to really have to move outside of the the teaching realm. I find that I find that if you can teach it to somebody else as a nice as a nice sort of middle ground between where you would eventually have to go if you're going to nick construct in the wild as opposed to the setting which is somewhat contained and framed, which is teaching."
"Unknown","01;04;36;21","01;05;03;10","Right. Learn it learning in that setting. So I'm not I'm not saying you guys are moving in that direction. I just think that the ultimate end game of uploading is different than the one that's offloading, which there's way more offloading in the teaching realm than we probably care to acknowledge for for the plot embedding offloading is more like instructional ism."
"Unknown","01;05;04;03","01;05;40;03","You're offloading the recipe and then interaction ism requires the other interact ant to be a cognitive entity. And so that's more like two figure two, it's more like cognitive uploading and the more interaction ism is at play, the more figure to like we're in a space of, the more it is like a question that Dave has just asked in the chat, which is, isn't the result of offloading a new goal seeking self maintaining order, poetic thing, all caps and tell me that's kind of Aristotelian a little bit, I believe."
"Unknown","01;05;41;10","01;06;08;11","Yes, and that's a little bit like our progression here. Here was two things and there interface and then it got more and more shared or delineated or less until at some level of interfacing and interaction ism and extended cognition from a functional or psychological perspective, which is what they explore in this paper or from an ecological and an evolutionary perspective of like constant at all explore elsewhere."
"Unknown","01;06;08;22","01;06;42;24","It does become a new kind of thing. The eukaryotic cell is a thing, and it's a thing that involves these nested and interfacing systems. And then I took the colors that we had here and overlaid them from this abstract space into this kind of space that we've seen with the figure one and two representations. And isn't that interesting that the blanket states are the interface, the border states."
"Unknown","01;06;43;11","01;07;06;29","And so as we discussed, the dynamics even in the mirror active case could be very chaotic or very difficult for the entity to predict. So mere active shouldn't be seen as meaning that it's like simple or it doesn't have rich dynamics how do we know which of these settings we're in or how do we make the best of these settings?"
"Unknown","01;07;12;11","01;07;48;22","Wasn't there Daniel, can you find the slide in the 41 deck where we talked about the joint yes, there we go. The joint self evidencing. I think I I guess I'm I guess what I'm saying is, is that joint self evidencing on one level of instructional ism or the joint self evidencing in terms of the interaction piece I think that that's you could decide how big, how, how, how, how complicated you want that weight to be."
"Unknown","01;07;49;03","01;08;10;09","But I think that that's what this is essentially saying is can we get ourselves to a place of this closeness like the closing of the circle of causality part, right? That's sort of circular already piece of this. When do we when do we realize that it's circular? Is it when we're at the instructional level or when we're at the interaction level?"
"Unknown","01;08;11;26","01;08;36;16","Live, do you have a thought or there's a little bit more slide play that could happen, I think, to resolve the question. OK, go ahead and give it over to Jean. I'm just thinking, let's say that we were in a forest of F twos, so we're no longer thinking about just nest mates interacting, but now we're thinking about like each one of these orange."
"Unknown","01;08;37;02","01;09;05;29","So we're going to our system of interest is going to be the orange guys. We are F to a F to be an F to C, and they're like different evolutionary replicators of a similar kind that are different organisms. The blue could be the same physical niche. It could be each other in an adaptive niche. They could each be in their own battles, but their fitness is being relatively compared in terms of their success."
"Unknown","01;09;06;17","01;09;39;02","Now, what does it mean when on that side that we were just on, on figure two when they mentioned this closes the circle of causality in which the nation phenotypes are trying to learn about each other to minimize their joint free energy or surprise. OK, so what does that mean? That the causality has been close? So one worldview would be, well, let's just look at how the three orange entities are connected and think about how they're in competition."
"Unknown","01;09;39;20","01;10;12;16","And so that might be a totally valid and important way to look at it. But this is kind of like there's various statements, I'm sure, various phrasings where I won't even try, but what is the good in doing so well in the orange after a free energy minimization such that this whole system is actually maladaptive so that would be like this entity being greedy in this new kind of interaction or thing."
"Unknown","01;10;13;03","01;10;43;24","And so the one, the orange, A, B, or C that's going to persist the best or have the highest fitness is going to be involved in the best free energy minimization of this whole system where there's sense and action coming both ways because just to short term do a free energy minimization here at the cost of maladaptive actions coming in the future back from the niche is not a sustainable strategy."
"Unknown","01;10;44;05","01;11;32;22","And so that's like where they took the little bit. The last thread gets tucked back into the ecology and evolution and the selective niche, which is the one that actually provides at least an adaptive starting point for the cognitive, functional and psychological habitats that they're discussing we think. Do well, so so again, here's the thing. If we're talking about just the perception piece and we've got three, three versions of perception, is that what you're you're trying to bring out here, three similar kinds of entities that are involved in fitness."
"Unknown","01;11;34;02","01;11;58;02","We're focusing on that because focusing in on the on the perception aspect of that. Are you not are we looking at the cultural piece of this when three procedures are proximal to one another in in and in in an environment or cluster or in the cognitive niche, how do those perceptions align with one another? And what's the time frame?"
"Unknown","01;11;58;02","01;12;21;20","Right? What's the diachronic of this I just want to make sure I'm clear about what your what you're trying to show here. There's probably multiple ways to think about it or show it. Let's let's try to make it 11 little bit clearer, OK? Here is going to be the blue niche. And now we're going to have those cognitive entities sharing a niche."
"Unknown","01;12;21;29","01;12;32;15","So so here's going to be a bunch of brains that are going to be sharing the same blue niche, OK? So how does this affect what you're discussing?"
"Unknown","01;12;34;22","01;13;01;12","They're all being interfaced with a common niche. And so in what way can we say that they're involved in joint action perception looks well, that's that's what I'm that's where I'm where. I'm curious because I think this what this does is it shows that there is something called an extended and extended aspect of this of this active inference frame."
"Unknown","01;13;01;21","01;13;35;00","But I wouldn't I don't know how each one of those procedures realizes what the others are perceiving as well. I think the environment or the niche itself knows collectively what that is. But I don't know that each one of those individual representations of the brain necessarily does know. And I think this is where it trips up a lot of people because, oh, I don't believe in extended extended cognition because you can't possibly extend that."
"Unknown","01;13;35;00","01;14;00;19","You can't possibly know what Dean's thinking and Dean can't possibly know what Blue's thinking. But eventually, as we work out together, through communication, through some sort of signaling processes, eventually we kind of land on it on some sort of genuinely agreed to sense. There's a collective sense around this as well. And so do we say, well, that collective sense isn't cognition."
"Unknown","01;14;02;17","01;14;27;29","We don't know what it is, but it's not cognition. But of course it's all based on cognition, but we're not going to call it cognition because we can't possibly know everything that's going on in that other perceiver codon is Isaiah's way of looking at blue at this blue rectangle right so sorry. Sorry. Blue light blue rectangle. Right. So again, this is that."
"Unknown","01;14;27;29","01;15;13;04","Yeah. Thinking through other minds. I don't know how I don't know how we I don't know how we quantify it but but also recognize that it does exist and if we get if we get to to concern that if we can't measure it, it's not a thing then we'll just pretend like it's not there, but it, it's there and not all things are necessarily measurable the way that we can hook up the the cap and make sure that it's picking up everything in can they whatever they have, whatever the heck the one is that is the cap as opposed to the ephemeral EEG."
"Unknown","01;15;14;01","01;15;27;12","Thank you, sir. Yes, I just looked up like opposite of extended. And so there's like retracted, reduced, shrunk, narrowed, shortened."
"Unknown","01;15;29;23","01;16;10;11","It's interesting how extended cognition feels like a reach, yet defending the other position is almost too narrow. Yeah. Yeah, blue. So I just was going back and reading the author's definition of upload versus offloading. And they said in contrast to the traditional notion of offloading, the notion of uploading refers to the creation of novel cognitive functions that are taken on board by the cognitive needs."
"Unknown","01;16;10;11","01;16;35;08","Persay instead of being merely managed by the cognitive niche, a function is offloaded when individual agents restructure the world so as to minimize internal costs and or increase reliability, for example, by personnel sticking out to as a reminder, a function, for example, that a function is uploaded when social and technological change means that it's now taken care of by the needs rather than the individual."
"Unknown","01;16;35;16","01;17;01;11","For example, agents store phone numbers in smartphones instead of by memory. So the whole number of storage function has been assimilated into the niche the niche into which the function has been uploaded can then be passed on to future generations for them to leverage, share and finish that function. And so I wonder if the difference between offloading and uploading is a transgenerational difference."
"Unknown","01;17;01;27","01;17;26;29","So like I do offloading like with my yellow sticky note or like my notes in my little pad, but I do offloading when I, you know, could create a publication from those notes and publish it into something that's been archived that the future generations can access. That's that's awesome. Here's a thought on that. Connecting it to the epistemic actions."
"Unknown","01;17;26;29","01;17;53;24","So offloading, just like they describe it, says a yellow sticky note on the front door to remind them to pick up milk next time they're out. It doesn't say this means pick up milk. They've offloaded their cognitive backpack but only they know their recovery seed. Only they know the password to speak friend and enter into that extended cognitive function."
"Unknown","01;17;54;13","01;18;28;23","Whereas if it were cognitively uploaded, I made an app that reminds people to get their milk when they're low that is actually something that because of its intrinsic and more integrated actual cognitive function, like the ability to assess information, like the level of milk in the fridge and then take an action like remind the person or not, it's a bonafide cognitive entity it's more like figure two, more like uploading than it is like figure one offloading."
"Unknown","01;18;29;04","01;18;52;07","And then that app can be leveraged and shared and intergenerational in a way where it would be extremely difficult and only through like implicit learning and seeing it many times would somebody be like, oh yes, we put the yellow Post-it note when we want to remind ourself later. So interesting example, and it's very true what they say about future generations."
"Unknown","01;18;52;29","01;19;22;07","Yeah. And I think when we get into that, that Diachronic piece, we're not just we're not just offloading remote, remember to get milk. What we're doing is we're in, we're uploading, we're talking about rules, especially if we're talking about culture. It's the old that's not the way we do things around here kind of thing. So I think there's there's this there are differences between offloading and uploading."
"Unknown","01;19;22;17","01;19;58;05","And I do believe that rules because rules are always kind of flexible. There's always a limit around where when we talk about scale friendliness, there's an effective limit around how a rule will be able to function at scale. So there's there is going to be a certain amount of arbitrariness when we get up to that rules place. And as we pass rules down from one generation to the next, I'm sure both of you can think of the times when your parents told you this is the rule and you both looked at them and went, what the why is that the rule?"
"Unknown","01;19;58;25","01;20;17;24","Oh, OK. So now when we're talking about rules and we're talking about uploaded things, I think there has to be a certain amount of participation in that rule setting. It's not always the case, but I think in order for it to be adopted and actually to be a part of the cognitive niche, we're not just talking about content here."
"Unknown","01;20;18;04","01;20;53;24","We're talking about consequence is here as well. And so I think that's where this gets really, really interesting in terms of building or constructing that psychological and functional niche, but also appreciating that it's kind of rules based and it's joint self evidencing as opposed to what Daniel believes in in Jesse. Right? So everybody's got to follow Daniel's rule, but that's not kind of how it works when you bring about people together and you try to come up with some sense of where it is, where it is, where are the common, where are the cognitive limits here?"
"Unknown","01;20;53;25","01;21;29;28","That arbitrariness aspect of it is actually a part of the game. So that is awesome. It connects the intergenerational inheritance to the interaction ism and to that idea of having to teach somebody else to take your organic chemistry test. Is the point of rule following in the short term from the age of, you know, zero to six years old to minimize the perceived number of times that a rule is violated, or is it to minimize the amount of times that your grandchildren violate that rule or for example?"
"Unknown","01;21;29;28","01;22;01;01","And so the further one looks in the future, the more interaction ist it looks and the more autonomy potentially provided to the recipient. And that might also connect back to Mike Love in the discussion on training and learning, because the trainer and the trains, that may be a functional dyad, but it may not be able to result in the trainee being able to be training somebody else, whereas somebody who has learned has a generative model update."
"Unknown","01;22;01;01","01;22;30;14","And so they may be able to teach and then also to connect to deans. Let's it was academic and professional settings, right? And we talked about like the hybrid models and about OK, so we had the we had walking into new niches and then we had the professional, OK, here is us and now we're engaging we can think of this in of course multiple ways."
"Unknown","01;22;31;03","01;23;11;04","So one of this would be Diachronic. So the Diachronic interpretation would be grandparent, parent, child, the the synchronic but extended spacial interpretation would be this could all be happening at the same time. Here's the academic context academic teach me in the academic niche. Professional niche, other professionals in the niche yeah. So we have through space and through time, just like they explored some of those dimensions in the paper."
"Unknown","01;23;11;07","01;23;12;21","What do you think about that?"
"Unknown","01;23;15;24","01;23;46;17","The representation? I think it's like like this extended active inference. It grows, right? It, it blossoms so I'm like, and where it's going so it just made me think about like so I have brought up the temporal, you know, maybe to be uploading versus offloading there's some kind of temporal persistence. But also, like, what is to be uploading?"
"Unknown","01;23;46;26","01;24;06;29","It has to be accessible even in the same time because we don't really know if our YouTube video is going to be around in ten years, are watched by anyone else except us or we don't really know. But but we do know that it's watched by like Tucker was watching it. I guess and Dave and and so there are some people watching it."
"Unknown","01;24;07;08","01;24;29;29","So so if uploading just means beyond personal use, would that be fair like is that is that uploading versus offloading? I don't know. But then if I if I remind my daughter like so so it just makes me think of like but what about us? What about this? If I remind my daughter, like, hey, don't forget your lunch or hey, you know, you need to study for your spelling test."
"Unknown","01;24;30;07","01;24;52;11","If I remind her or if I create a reminder for her is that uploading or offloading here's your lunch. Here's a Post-it to remind of lunch how will you remind yourself of your lunch?"
"Unknown","01;24;59;06","01;25;22;19","And it probably there's probably ones that we could add above. Here is your lunch here's the food in your mouth. Here's the airplane flying in the food in your mouth or the way or here's. Yeah, well, before here's your lunch, I need to remember to remind my daughter to get her lunch. So that's like, how am I going to remember to remind my daughter to get her lunch?"
"Unknown","01;25;22;19","01;26;06;29","Like those that whole, like, second tier of that yeah. Yes, yes. And this is kind of like a continuum on well, this is a proprietary preamble, but then it's like a continuum again from the more instructional list to the more insurrectionist. And it probably gets more allegorical and it gets more flexible, it gets more empowering. But if you say and you mean it, how I'm going to let you decide how to remind yourself of how to get your lunch but also, if you forget your lunch, you know it's going to be really bad."
"Unknown","01;26;07;26","01;26;52;21","Then that creates a cognitive tension. And so that's kind of like where it's OK to experiment and fail and interaction, you know, to improvise. One must like make some notes. They didn't intend and then continue to roll with it as their new state and just continue on like in improv versus if it was just about playing the sheet music as written, then every time a mistake is made, one could just push the rails back in so I think what you're saying is I need to let my daughter go hungry when she forgets her lunch, because right now, if she forgets her lunch, it's really bad for me because I have to drive like an extra"
"Unknown","01;26;52;21","01;27;04;11","hour to go home. I get the lunch or it's either way, it's an hour out of my day. I have to stop at the grocery store and assemble a lunch. It's not just lunch. It's like lunch, plus like six different snacks that she eats throughout the day. So she has to bring all the food with her every day."
"Unknown","01;27;04;16","01;27;37;01","So it's really bad for me if she forgets. So because I end up taking care of it for her, I should just let her starve and then I will have uploaded that task oh, yes, yes. Without getting between mother and daughter. Can I just say one quick thing here? I think again, if we're if we're just trying to figure out what the extended cognition is, if there's evidence for extended cognition, it's probably in the rule and the consequence."
"Unknown","01;27;37;07","01;28;06;26","So it's to your point, blue, if there's a consequence here, who has to take that consequence on the older person? Who, who, who, maybe whose prospect of memory didn't work out that day and didn't provide all the reminders or the younger person who now is has the effect of not having something to eat. But I think the point here in terms of can we we the argument because they call it an argument, this paper is an argument."
"Unknown","01;28;06;26","01;28;35;13","The argument for extended cognition would be one where if we upload, we're probably going to be uploading rules and the consequences of those rules are implied versus the offloading of content and material that tends to overwhelm us and that we use devices then to act as a way of being able to store because our own memorial capacities are are somewhat limited."
"Unknown","01;28;35;13","01;28;57;14","Like, I mean, when I compare my memorial capacity to you and Daniel, I can't hold a candle to that. Right. So I should be the one using all of the instruments for that. But what I do is I have my own way of sort of compensating for that by developing my own rules sooner. And with with a more consequential nature to that."
"Unknown","01;28;57;14","01;29;26;25","Right. So that's one of the things we could possibly be teaching. 60 year olds not just here are the rules, but what can you do in terms of helping me, who is probably got less capacity as I get older for remembering all the content. So there's consequences for me now and there's consequences for you. We both suffer a certain consequence in this new environmental niche that we're constructing now."
"Unknown","01;29;26;25","01;29;54;23","Maybe the eight year old doesn't give a rat's backside about that. She's just hangry now. But oh, well, right. I mean, there's going to be some learning one way or another, and it could be through guilt or it can be through some kind of a conversation where you actually do introduce the rules and the consequence is, I don't know in comparison to memorizing the RGV values of an image like the pixel colors."
"Unknown","01;29;54;29","01;30;32;01","None of us have memories that hold the candle to even the smallest JPEG. So render onto the JPEG that which is JPEG packable and then what will that leave humans to do? And we hear about cognitive overload, cognitive security, of course. What does that actually mean for designing informational niches, cognitive niches from the psychological functional ecological selective perspectives that are not overwhelming or that are accessible or that are resilient or that do stabilize function."
"Unknown","01;30;32;14","01;30;53;29","There's so many awesome questions that this like brings us totally towards. Daniel, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to bounce out now. Because I've just kind of used up all my energy. Anyway, close this thing. I hope you guys can close this thing off for me, and I look forward to that point to. So thanks. Thank you, Dean."
"Unknown","01;30;54;09","01;31;43;23","Peace. All right. All right. Cool blue let's think for a few more minutes. What could be fun for dot two and just how we can go from some of the rhetoric and perspectives they share towards all of these extremely relevant scenarios that we've been discussing. Like, yeah. So for me, I think I'd like to touch back on to what other situations are like the Elizabethan play people like the Elizabethan cast, the theater company."
"Unknown","01;31;43;23","01;32;12;08","That's what it is. So so what other situations are like this Elizabethan theater company in that the culture is so strong and so vital to participation that you can just wing it like you can know a lot of things just by cuing off of others. So I had mentioned jazz. I don't know what else, what other I'd like to look at that a little bit more because there's that."
"Unknown","01;32;12;15","01;32;30;12","That was the example that they gave us this diachronic cognition. So it would be cool to look at that a little more deeply. Yes. Especially in like the kind of online context yes."
"Unknown","01;32;34;25","01;33;24;16","Agreed about that. Yeah. You brought up music and jazz and about culture where just what is culture and of different kinds and where does that fit into this ability of people to have joint action? In what ways or in what sense is this culture about shared ways of thinking? Orthodoxy, Heterodoxy In what ways is culture about joint action or the praxis and hetero praxis so I was thinking also about action and like action offloading because just like in terms of a scaled system like serve, cells do their own actions, like they eat food and they, you know, secrete nutrients and you know, they like communicate with each other and whatever."
"Unknown","01;33;24;16","01;33;48;28","But but in terms of like a nested system, like the cells don't have to go find water. The water just comes to them, right? Like, like whereas a human it's like one of the most vital things that we could ever do is find water like clean drinking water, super necessary for life. So we have to do that. I mean, we've offloaded that into our culture with running water, but not every human."
"Unknown","01;33;49;17","01;34;19;27","But I just think about we're acting on behalf of organ systems, cell systems or canals, et cetera. So I think about action offloading. So what does that look like? Yes. And how how akin to cognitive offloading or offloading is that yes. In what ways is the cognitive offloading and uploading that of perception in what ways is it offloading action?"
"Unknown","01;34;20;18","01;34;59;03","Like if you write a script that then does some daily task that could be seen as like offloading a repetitive action. And that's something that we're only unlocking with computers but it's kind of like a and it's even referenced in the idea of a of a demon in computers. It's like the magicians are familiar. It's this little trainable or learning entity that is able to carry things out according to the will of the magician."
"Unknown","01;35;01;06","01;35;24;28","In a semi autonomous way. It's not just computers, though. We've automated some tasks for us through the years, through the ways of like even just with running water. Like we, you know, that's an automated task. That used to be a big portion of your daily life as a human, like going to find water and I mean washing machines, dishwasher, we've all all the things I mean, we've been automating life for forever."
"Unknown","01;35;24;28","01;35;59;14","So now it's just becoming more sophisticated. Now perhaps we're automating our cognitive life like 53. I think that that's like a different kind of. Yes, where it's approaching automation at the semantic and linguistic level, whereas previously it could be like at the task, the physical task performance level could be off source or uploaded. In a sense, this is like rapidly rising in its cognitive complexity."
"Unknown","01;36;01;19","01;36;30;02","Like a typewriter is a mere active entity. It's part of the extended cognition type type type type type. But unless it gets jammed, one is not going to be too surprised by how it performs. And that's like the famous Turing quote from back in the day. And someone said like, how can it have intelligence? Or if it can't give us surprising answer and then turn he said something like Computers surprise me every day."
"Unknown","01;36;30;22","01;36;34;04","So is that going to be your measure, how surprised you are?"
"Unknown","01;36;36;18","01;36;58;23","Let's just say you want to look at what do you want to look at, though? And then I want to look at I want to look at the partition question that Dave raised and also the earlier question from Dave when he wrote about the results of cognitive offloading, it was it was more about cognitive uploading. He clarified in the chat but I was thinking, yeah, I was thinking about the partition too."
"Unknown","01;36;58;23","01;37;18;29","Like when I was talking about I meant to say partition. And there because of the temporal partition going from this generation to the next, or is it like a cognitive or like a organismal partition between like me and you or me and my daughter or this group in that group the partition is the fuzziness of the partition always makes it interesting."
"Unknown","01;37;19;21","01;37;48;27","OK, let us let's let's that's it. Let's read his question. So in some papers other than this one so here's the the Nisha papers citing each other. We're in an adjacent regime of inattention, but it's relevance. The point comes up and this comes up indeed in discussion, anatomical or mechanical blank. It's so at the cellular level, this would be like the lipid bilayer cell membrane."
"Unknown","01;37;48;27","01;38;23;11","At the organismal level, this would be like the epithelial. So anatomical gross or micro mechanical blankets. Sometimes coincide with functional psychological blankets and sometimes not so two brain regions that are separated but have an interface. It might be the case that their function could be ascribed with a certain partition that reflected the partitioning. Topological of the anatomical components, or it could totally not be that way."
"Unknown","01;38;23;26","01;39;04;06","So sometimes anatomical mechanical blankets coincide with functional psychological blankets and sometimes not insert all the asterisks that we've ever had about realism and instrumental ism, but just we're going to plunge ahead. What is the relation among that distinction between the two kinds of blanketing this one more of a embodied, enacted realist flavor and this one more of a functionalist flavor so what is the relation among A, B and C here?"
"Unknown","01;39;04;23","01;39;38;00","So what is it's a relation of relation of relations as per usual or relating A, B and C where A is the relationship between these kinds of blankets, B is the hierarchical and heterosexual nesting of blankets, and C is the relation is between or among nations and the particles that upload functionality to those niches."
"Unknown","01;39;45;24","01;40;11;26","What do you think blue about when they say that? The answer is in the question like the way that the question is asked contains the seeds of an answer. What do you think about that? I mean, are you talking about like how I would, you know, cognitive offload information as an undergraduate just because I could tell by the way that the question was asked?"
"Unknown","01;40;11;26","01;40;38;17","Yeah, look, I think I did that. Like, I think I looked for I looked for the answer in the question quite often, as long as it's a multiple choice question that was pretty simple or is it wasn't. There was often somewhere else in the test in a different question. So like, OK, so yeah, I did that, but I think here there's definitely some answering here happening."
"Unknown","01;40;38;29","01;41;00;08","Like that's distinct. What does that like? I hate those I hate those words. I hate I hate those words since I use like the similar like referential. What is the name of like the the part of speech that it is this that those these you know, those those words words that either it's a person or it's an article."
"Unknown","01;41;01;06","01;41;27;11","It's an article because a pronoun is like he or she it. So it's the articles. So the articles really bother me. I think that that distinction, the distinction between anatomical mechanical blankets or the functional psychological blankets, yes, I'll read it out. I believe it's the distinction between anatomical, mechanical and functional psychological those. So it should be a plural article."
"Unknown","01;41;28;19","01;41;51;20","That's what was doing me. Yeah. Anyway, the nesting of blankets is always something like I don't talk about. But, but here I don't know. Does the, does the distinction need to be drawn? If you're talking about nesting of blankets, how can you make distinctions between different types of blankets? I don't know. Maybe that's just me."
"Unknown","01;41;55;02","01;42;31;08","We. What do you think? We explored some aspects of it. When you mentioned the multi scale approach where like we can think of nesting as the bigger nested system, whether it hosts only one active entity within it or multiple laterally interacting entities, the bigger nesting. So putting a aside for now, the bigger nested system can be seen of as the niche for the sub unit or sub units inside of it."
"Unknown","01;42;31;29","01;43;15;00","So for sure this B and C can be connected because the nested system, it's niche, it's environment, what its actions are going into and what is getting sense information from is the niche and that is like the larger nested system. Now how do nested systems using that as a shorthand for both B and C connect to this structural and functional perspective on systems are nested systems?"
"Unknown","01;43;15;00","01;43;49;22","When we talk about nested systems, in what ways can you guess? And is it a structural nesting like the word is inside the sentence, inside of the paragraph, or in what ways is it a functional nesting where the functional nesting of concepts doesn't necessarily have to follow from the nesting of like sentences on the page? I think that's a very challenging but important question."
"Unknown","01;43;49;22","01;44;14;25","And then also when you mentioned like the undergrad example and we've been talking a lot about test taking right here and maybe think about how in undergrad or potentially even earlier. Yes, it was possible to like kind of reverse engineer. And so like the answer is in the seeds. So the question is kind of like a game to play where you're just trying to maximize your score on some test."
"Unknown","01;44;15;10","01;44;33;27","But then you get rugged in grad school where it is still true that the question that you're asking to nature, to the system contains the seeds of the answer, like you're only going to get the data for your experiment of the kind that you measure on the number that you actually measure it from, where the conditions that you set them up to be in."
"Unknown","01;44;34;28","01;45;21;07","But if one tries to hack nature or if one tries to do that sort of undergrad and I'm going to maximize I mean, these two groups must be different, right? So I'm going to try to measure them with a thumb on the scale so that they come out to be different. That becomes tantamount to basically non rigorous, non reproducible science so it just shows, I think also to Dean's continued themes of like in the lab, in the classroom and then out so the highest test score is not necessarily the highest performer on that out in the wild."
"Unknown","01;45;21;07","01;46;05;04","That's towards the applications side, nor necessarily the best teacher as we've been discussing. And so it's sort of like there's like learning and development and sometimes it feeds back on itself with teaching and other times it just plunges ahead with application to all these different phenomena of learning, teaching and applying to those all use the same partitioning are they featuring or highlighting the regime of attention on different parts of the partitioning so that's like where I can't ever close my instrumentalists."
"Unknown","01;46;05;04","01;46;41;18","I it is in the partition points because the partition is just wherever you put it yes. It's how you see it slash model it. Unless one specifically wants to make claims about realism. I see. Right. I mean, but even if you want like when I investigate realist claims, like if I look for a partition, like what partitions me from the rest of the world, it's like my skin, right?"
"Unknown","01;46;41;18","01;47;04;26","So like my skin is the, the boundary. It's the markup blanket that holds me in and the world out. But like, I'm losing pieces of my skin every day. It gets cut open. And so, so then my is my partition broken or like, you know, my somehow not the same person, I don't know. So for me, finding this, like, boundary that's like solid and never changes is not doesn't sit, right?"
"Unknown","01;47;05;08","01;47;34;17","So so I like I always have to remind myself it's an instrument so I can never, ever lose my instrumentalist perspective and get into surrealism when I think about the blanket so it's it's nonsense severability. It's you know, this is goes back to the quantum cross feels you know we're not inseparable on time so I think in dot two let's just write a few notes down and then close out."
"Unknown","01;47;35;08","01;48;34;10","So I think in dot two we can look over some formalisms and see how the equations connected we can think about what we discussed about the fastest time scales perception action learning, teaching, applying, et cetera. How do these different modes of engagements with extended active inference systems differ? Or what about finding discovering so like when you're not taught, you know, when you don't know the path and you find the the stack of rocks how do we go from a verb ending in I-n-g to an appropriate or useful active model?"
"Unknown","01;48;36;17","01;49;20;02","How do we go from negotiating, trusting discomforting, communicating, communicating to the right graphical structure? Of a generative model that we can use in our standard active routines? As patiently reminded, we all are by Carl on those points OK, cool. OK, fun times. Thanks a lot, Dean, for joining. Yeah, you feel better? Yeah, absolutely. And blew. Thanks a ton was a fun discussion."
"Unknown","01;49;20;02","01;49;39;19","Thanks, everybody. Who's in on live chat. Dave and Tucker and Stephen and everybody is welcome to join us next week for 41.2 on 13th and in the papers beyond so thank you all see you later yes bye."
