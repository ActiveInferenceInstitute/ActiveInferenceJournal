1
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:13,747
All right.

2
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:16,683
Hello and welcome, everyone.

3
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:20,186
It's ActInfLab Livestream number 46.0

4
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:23,223
and it's June 10th, 2022.

5
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:26,793
Welcome to the ActInfLab, everyone.

6
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:29,062
We're a participatory online lab

7
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:30,063
that is communicating,

8
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:31,831
learning and practicing applied

9
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:33,033
active inference.

10
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,300
You can find us at the links

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,735
here on the slide.

12
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:36,870
This is a recorded

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,438
and an archived livestream,

14
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,140
so please provide us with feedback

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,542
so we can improve our work.

16
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,343
All backgrounds

17
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:44,844
and perspectives are welcome

18
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:46,046
and we'll be following

19
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,748
video etiquette for livestreams.

20
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:50,984
Head over to ActiveInference (dot) org

21
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:51,351
if you want

22
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,253
to learn more about livestreams

23
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,255
at the lab or other projects

24
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,689
that are ongoing.

25
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,291
All right.

26
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,660
We are here in the first discussion,

27
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,262
the .04 background

28
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:05,732
and context in stream number 46.0.

29
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,935
We are learning and discussing the paper

30
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:09,969
"Active inference

31
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,405
models do not contradict folk psychology"

32
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,474
by Ryan Smith,

33
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,743
Maxwell Ramstead, and Alex Kiefer.

34
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,945
And video, just like all

35
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:21,214
the videos are, is an introduction

36
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,850
and contextualize her and an appetizer

37
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,752
for some of these ideas.

38
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,121
It's not a review or a final word.

39
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,256
We're going to say hi

40
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,958
and give introductions.

41
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,427
Then we'll be covering the roadmap

42
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,663
and abstract claims and aims,

43
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:37,530
and then we'll head through

44
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,933
some of the core sections of the paper

45
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,935
and just get some of the key

46
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,536
arguments down.

47
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,038
And during the dot one, in the dot

48
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:46,906
two, in the coming two weeks,

49
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,842
we'll have open space

50
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,643
for asking a lot of questions

51
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,045
for those who want to participate,

52
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,180
live and ask questions as well.

53
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,382
So on we go.

54
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:58,118
We'll start

55
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:58,852
just by

56
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,620
introducing ourself as much

57
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,788
or as little as we'd like.

58
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,690
And if we want to, mentioning

59
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,492
something that we're excited

60
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:08,261
about in the paper, like what brought us

61
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,763
to want to contribute to this zero

62
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,899
and all start.

63
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:13,700
I'm Daniel,

64
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,969
I'm a researcher in California

65
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,671
and I think the title says

66
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:19,239
it all, though

67
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,373
there's still more to add,

68
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:24,043
and it speaks to many of the hottest

69
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:25,879
and brightest debates

70
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,147
in active inference,

71
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:27,914
which is

72
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,750
the rubber hitting the road with mind,

73
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:31,918
brain and body

74
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:32,852
and psychology

75
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,155
and previous and different conceptions

76
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,725
all pass it to Dean.

77
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,094
I standing on Dana up here in Calgary,

78
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:43,463
I think.

79
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,364
Well, a couple of things.

80
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:44,831
First of all,

81
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,599
one of the first act of interest

82
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,834
that I was on

83
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,335
was a paper that Ryan had written.

84
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,270
And so

85
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,838
I was kind of impressed with that paper.

86
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,139
And I knew that

87
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,208
if I sort of invested some time

88
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:55,742
in this one,

89
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:57,210
that's that

90
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,213
I would become

91
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:00,880
previous.

92
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,783
And the primary

93
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,552
premise was looking at

94
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:06,252
active inference

95
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,588
from the decisioning and

96
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,124
at the movement standpoint,

97
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:14,360
sort of seeing that

98
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,729
looked at from a higher order

99
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,799
and the lower order type of processing.

100
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,668
And that when I,

101
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,102
I got into the paper

102
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,471
and started looking at the mind, world

103
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:25,972
and world

104
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,942
mind piece and, and seeing where the,

105
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,845
the potential connectors were between

106
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:33,913
sort of coming in to it,

107
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,648
not necessarily

108
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:36,182
knowing that

109
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,217
there would be different things

110
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,952
that active inference,

111
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:39,385
much like

112
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,019
I didn't realize

113
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,121
it was an extended active imprints

114
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,090
teller redox actually constance paper

115
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,225
that was kind of helpful

116
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,260
and I'll pass it to Jake.

117
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,096
Everyone Jaco

118
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,232
students from the Czech Republic

119
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,568
and I'm excited to

120
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,505
reduce my uncertainty about the

121
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,576
new formulation that that

122
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,079
was introduced in this paper.

123
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:06,512
Or at least

124
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:07,480
it was the first time

125
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,649
I came across it in the active

126
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,684
inference literature,

127
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,552
as you mentioned,

128
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,588
about the different higher order and

129
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,458
lower order descriptions

130
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,994
and how do they conceptually map

131
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,831
to the different mathematical

132
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,133
mathematical formulation and also

133
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,969
to the psychological

134
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:33,740
ontology and

135
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,010
overall, just discuss

136
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,113
what that what that means and

137
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,482
what it might mean for

138
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,251
other applications as well.

139
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,720
And I'll pass on to Ryan.

140
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:50,657
I mean, I think so.

141
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:51,924
I'm I'm Ryan Smith.

142
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:52,892
I have some

143
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:53,426
research

144
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,360
Associate Professor

145
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,862
at the Laureate Institute

146
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,330
for Brain Research.

147
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,633
And so I'm the first author of this,

148
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:01,768
this paper.

149
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,437
So obviously I was definitely excited

150
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,606
about the ideas to write about it

151
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:07,907
or sufficiently motivated

152
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,242
at least to try to clarify

153
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,610
some things that I,

154
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:10,810
you know,

155
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,544
from my perspective

156
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:15,448
or sort of common misconceptions.

157
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:15,748
Yeah.

158
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:16,849
I mean, I'm,

159
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:17,617
I'm probably more going

160
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,618
to sit in the background here.

161
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,653
I'll just be here to answer questions

162
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,954
or clarify anything.

163
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:22,221
You know,

164
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,123
if something comes up where

165
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:25,625
something in the paper wasn't

166
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,093
wasn't especially clear because I didn't

167
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,428
I didn't do my job well enough.

168
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,762
So I'm. Yeah.

169
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,731
So I appreciate you guys being

170
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,166
willing to to talk about it.

171
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,734
Thanks.

172
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,302
Well, an overall comment

173
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,637
was we really appreciate

174
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,205
the clarity of the argument

175
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:40,239
and the writing

176
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,875
and the weaving together of the math

177
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:43,743
and the formalism

178
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,078
with the argument,

179
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,713
the rhetoric and the ontology.

180
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,248
That's that's prime time.

181
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,917
So I'll just jump right in.

182
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,385
And of course, anyone is

183
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,420
welcome to share their comments.

184
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,956
So, Dean, would you like to help us

185
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,092
contextualize with a big question?

186
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,526
Yeah.

187
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,462
So I think that there's

188
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,596
some questions surrounding

189
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:04,831
and I'm just going to take

190
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,866
some of the important quotes that I

191
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,667
left you from the paper,

192
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,769
the concern that activity

193
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,004
books psychology, because

194
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,140
they do not explicitly include terms

195
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,441
for desires

196
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,744
or other cognitive constructs

197
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,146
at a mathematical level of description.

198
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,015
So given that distinction

199
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,351
that there are active inference

200
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,219
motor control

201
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,087
which need not have desires

202
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,122
and are both psychology

203
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:33,726
and active inference models,

204
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,395
you have desires with them

205
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,295
for psychology.

206
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,998
That phrase that allows

207
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:43,770
constructs.

208
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,004
In could you

209
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,506
I think when you're talking and you like

210
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,473
turn away a little bit

211
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:48,674
or move back, it kind of cuts

212
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,576
the audio somewhat.

213
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,210
Yeah,

214
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,746
we'll try to continue from the given.

215
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,514
Thank you.

216
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:55,314
Okay.

217
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,049
So given the

218
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,050
there's a distinction

219
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:58,651
and active

220
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:01,821
inference models of motor control

221
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,456
which do not have desires

222
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:03,856
under folks

223
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,358
psychology and active interest,

224
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,959
models of decision processes

225
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,596
which do have desires with that culture.

226
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,565
So it's argued here.

227
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:13,466
Then the worry is that

228
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,467
if active inference models

229
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,702
can explain cognition

230
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,438
without appealing to constructs

231
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,005
can be mapped

232
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,808
onto the commonsense notion of desires.

233
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,744
Now to explain what that is

234
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:25,545
then that could be seen

235
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,946
as threat are intuitive folks.

236
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,047
I call like,

237
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:32,418
okay, my sense of ourselves as agents.

238
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,986
Such a situation

239
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,087
would also pressure

240
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,089
the traditional belief desire

241
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,791
intent model

242
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,126
of folk psychology

243
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,128
that is prominent in philosophy.

244
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,563
The body model

245
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,631
is a model of human agency

246
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,632
that explains what it means

247
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,000
to act intentionally.

248
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,003
So for me, I was introduced to the VDI

249
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:51,504
model as.

250
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,208
Yes, great.

251
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,142
And one

252
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:56,542
way that

253
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:57,376
I kind of saw

254
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,278
this big question, even pulling back

255
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,480
a layer is like

256
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,848
is active inference

257
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:04,083
recontextualizing, reframing,

258
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:06,319
augmenting, building on

259
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,087
what is already familiar.

260
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,055
In a sense

261
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,057
though, there are many folk psychologies

262
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,358
and I think that could be something

263
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,426
we go into.

264
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,461
Or is this the displacement

265
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,830
of some cherished framework

266
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,233
for some other construct

267
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,801
and the way that people speak like,

268
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,169
I want the cup of coffee

269
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,337
or something like that,

270
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:24,904
are we going to need

271
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,172
like a different word

272
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,840
for an active, compatible

273
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,942
folks, psychology and linguistics.

274
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,212
So Yaacov, any thoughts on that?

275
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:38,251
Well, I guess

276
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,587
one question I've

277
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:44,590
had was like

278
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,392
this even this formulation

279
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:46,826
of the

280
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,828
of the initial of the initial statement,

281
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,931
like given this distinction of motor

282
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:52,565
control, active

283
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,000
inference and

284
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,402
decision processes, active inference,

285
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,004
then we have this,

286
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,672
then we have this issue.

287
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:00,439
Well,

288
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:00,907
one thing

289
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,909
that I was a bit uncertain about was

290
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,343
whether this distinction

291
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:08,147
was made to fit the distinction.

292
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,383
That's within folk psychology.

293
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,552
There is some kind of ontology

294
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,953
for motor control

295
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:17,256
and an ontology for decision processes.

296
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:20,526
So therefore we try to split

297
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,695
active inference into these two parts

298
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,730
or whether there is actually

299
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:26,732
whether this

300
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,833
is distinction

301
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,703
follows directly from the same

302
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,706
mathematical formulation of

303
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,475
active.

304
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:37,076
Great.

305
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,612
I think there I think I think one thing

306
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,647
one thing to

307
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:42,582
to clarify as I think

308
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,583
I think the way that

309
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,484
this kind of given the distinction

310
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,653
followed by that here

311
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:48,187
I think

312
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,689
could be leading to a little bit

313
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,891
of a misunderstanding in a city.

314
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,826
The idea that there's a concern

315
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:56,062
about about a threat to folk psychology

316
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,998
comes not from that distinction.

317
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,600
It comes from

318
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,500
the fact

319
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,835
that there is

320
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:03,970
at the mathematical level

321
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,037
of description,

322
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:06,038
it doesn't look like there's

323
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,406
anything in there

324
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,809
that that's that's desire ish.

325
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:10,810
Right.

326
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,277
I mean, that's

327
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,212
where the worry comes from.

328
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:13,913
It doesn't really

329
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:14,880
the worry doesn't come

330
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,715
from the distinction

331
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:16,949
between motor control

332
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,552
and decision processes. Right.

333
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:20,419
The distinction between

334
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,887
motor control and decision process

335
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:22,922
is actually one thing

336
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,925
that by making that more explicit,

337
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:29,762
it actually helps to resolve the concern

338
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:30,363
or it shows

339
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,664
why it's not really a concern,

340
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:32,765
or that part of the concern

341
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,300
stems from

342
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,368
a failure to make that

343
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,569
distinction explicitly

344
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,137
so.

345
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,206
So just to kind of clarify that,

346
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:40,473
so that

347
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,807
I think the order

348
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,075
of the of the thought process

349
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,210
here is a little bit different

350
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,578
then than the way

351
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,446
the way it is in the paper.

352
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,383
Thanks helpful time.

353
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:51,717
And we'll clarify

354
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,587
and go through the argument in order to

355
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:58,958
so briefly, just the aims of the paper

356
00:10:58,958 --> 00:10:59,659
as they present

357
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,495
it are to provide a brief review

358
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:03,963
of the historical progression

359
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:04,664
from predictive

360
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,032
coding to current octave

361
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,733
inference models

362
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,300
and show

363
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,403
that despite a superficial tension

364
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,471
when viewed at the mathematical level,

365
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:13,239
the active inference

366
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,240
formalism contains

367
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,275
terms that are readily identifiable

368
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,977
as desires and related

369
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,278
cognitive constructs

370
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:20,880
at the psychological level,

371
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,381
which is downstream

372
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,883
of that clarification

373
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,251
of the distinction

374
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,053
that Ryan just mentioned.

375
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,554
And then they discuss

376
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:29,588
the additional insights

377
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,123
offered by active inference

378
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,458
and the implications

379
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,392
it has for current

380
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:37,263
debates about active inference.

381
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,497
Any other names you'd want to add?

382
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:43,169
One, I think this is fine at the moment.

383
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,837
I mean, I'm sure things will come up

384
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,472
great.

385
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:47,673
And then

386
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,375
claims,

387
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:52,378
Jakob, could you read the claims?

388
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,012
Yeah.

389
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:56,716
So firstly that the apparent problem

390
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,751
posed by purely

391
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,653
diagnostic looking can't start

392
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,555
simply is not a problem.

393
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,023
There do not appear to be cases

394
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:04,924
where the phenotype

395
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:08,160
consistent prior expectation in data

396
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:09,228
often called

397
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,563
prior preferences

398
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,497
will ever conflict

399
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,299
with or existing predictions.

400
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,401
Then a traditional full cycle

401
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,802
psychological account

402
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,537
in which beliefs and desires

403
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,240
are integrated. Two point intentions.

404
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,941
The second claim

405
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:22,842
is that

406
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:23,609
what we have

407
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:26,645
referred to as the partially observable

408
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:27,847
mark of decision process

409
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,949
formulation of actin

410
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,684
is a corollary of the CEP

411
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:32,852
and it can be implemented

412
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,854
using prediction error minimization.

413
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,756
But there are many other aspects

414
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,790
of the FP

415
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,058
and many other theories

416
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,292
that fall under the umbrella

417
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,061
of predictive processing.

418
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,829
And in some

419
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,765
there are beliefs and desires

420
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,333
and the active inference framework.

421
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:48,901
Thanks.

422
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:49,502
And those are just a

423
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,470
few claims that we pulled out.

424
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,606
But many other declarative sentences

425
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:58,210
will also be claims.

426
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,745
I wouldn't necessarily call those

427
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,547
the primary claims of the paper.

428
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:01,814
I mean, they're

429
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,249
certainly statements that we make.

430
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,284
But I think I think the idea

431
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,352
that there isn't

432
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,553
I think the idea that

433
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,021
the apparent problem isn't a problem,

434
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,990
I think that's a claim.

435
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,793
And that it doesn't

436
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,262
that there won't be a conflict with

437
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,429
with an account

438
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,631
where you're combining beliefs

439
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,099
and desires to form intentions.

440
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,968
That's true.

441
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:23,702
This idea

442
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,271
about about what

443
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,306
falls under the predictive processing

444
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:31,410
umbrella with them,

445
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,311
I wouldn't necessarily say that's

446
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,279
something we're arguing

447
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,046
for in the paper.

448
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,482
It's just it's just something that

449
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,150
that matters

450
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,351
when you're trying to correctly frame

451
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:40,052
this kind of

452
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,620
this kind of debate, because,

453
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:43,389
you know,

454
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,490
predictive processing

455
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,193
is just a very generic term.

456
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:47,760
Right.

457
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,294
Like like

458
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,162
it doesn't refer to any particular

459
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,363
mathematical formalism.

460
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:54,099
It just refers to a really broad idea

461
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:54,934
that in some way

462
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:55,568
the brain's doing

463
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,536
some sort of predicting,

464
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:58,404
either with respect

465
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,239
to resolving problems

466
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,373
in perception or problems

467
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,375
in decision making or motor control.

468
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,578
And so so there really isn't

469
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,180
there's not enough

470
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,481
there's really just not enough

471
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,783
mathematical specificity

472
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,051
associated with predictive

473
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,519
processing as a term

474
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,420
to really even test

475
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,155
any predictions that it would make.

476
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:16,488
Right.

477
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:17,723
So I mean, I mean, what you

478
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:18,591
what you need to do

479
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,392
is take whatever

480
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,094
specific mathematical formalism,

481
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,429
what actual hypothesis

482
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,164
you're talking about

483
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:28,500
and evaluate and test claims to that.

484
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:29,168
Right?

485
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,070
So this that there just aren't

486
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,271
this aren't clear

487
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,974
like what even

488
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:36,442
it's just

489
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,142
pretty depressing

490
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:37,877
is just too general

491
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,778
and vague as the point.

492
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,947
So we can only really say

493
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,382
look under under

494
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,150
the current models used that are called

495
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,352
active inference, right?

496
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,119
So there's

497
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:47,987
a partially observable

498
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:51,223
markup decision process models

499
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,625
that minimize expected

500
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,092
free energy

501
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,994
as a way of making decisions. Right.

502
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:55,961
Those,

503
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,297
those arguably count as one particular

504
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,900
right theory or class of models

505
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,035
under the predictive

506
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,536
processing umbrella.

507
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:05,838
And we can evaluate claims

508
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,440
with respect to that model.

509
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,276
But you know what's true?

510
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,378
That doesn't need to be true of

511
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,212
the other

512
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,281
20 things out there that might,

513
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:15,814
you know,

514
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:16,548
might also fall

515
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,183
under a predictive processing umbrella.

516
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:18,817
So, I mean,

517
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,152
the main point is just

518
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,354
we need to evaluate

519
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,956
claims and predictions

520
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:24,623
and things like that

521
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,959
with respect to a specific model,

522
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:27,693
not with respect

523
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:28,527
to a kind of vague

524
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:31,864
general category of models.

525
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:35,701
Thank you.

526
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:36,235
Okay.

527
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,737
So just

528
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,273
rapidly through the abstract,

529
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,508
active inference offers

530
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,343
a unified theory of perceptions.

531
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:45,177
Learning and decision

532
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:45,711
making are

533
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,379
computational and neural levels

534
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,781
of description.

535
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,049
In this article,

536
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,016
we address the worry

537
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:51,951
that active inference

538
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,918
may be intention

539
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,153
with the belief desire,

540
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,988
intention by model

541
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,256
within folks psychology

542
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,757
because it does not include terms

543
00:15:58,757 --> 00:15:59,858
for desires

544
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,894
or other cognitive constructs

545
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,362
at the mathematical level

546
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,563
of description.

547
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,065
To resolve this concern,

548
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,766
we first provide a brief review

549
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,034
of the historical progression

550
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:09,635
from predictive

551
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,370
coding to active inference,

552
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,272
enabling us to distinguish

553
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,640
between active inference

554
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,910
formulations of motor control and AI,

555
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,712
which need not have desires

556
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,046
under folk psychology

557
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:21,981
and active inference.

558
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,616
Formulations of decision processes

559
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:27,286
ie which do have desires under

560
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,688
or which are within folk psychology.

561
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:30,756
We then show that despite

562
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,257
a superficial tension,

563
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,459
when viewed at the mathematical

564
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,693
level of description,

565
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:35,461
the active inference

566
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:36,962
formalism contains terms

567
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,497
that are readily identifiable

568
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,666
as encoding both the objects of desire

569
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,900
and the strength of desire.

570
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,402
At the psychological level

571
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,536
of description,

572
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,804
we demonstrate this

573
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,006
with simple simulations

574
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,073
of an active inference

575
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:48,607
agents

576
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,509
motivated to leave a dark room

577
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,111
for different reasons.

578
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,612
Despite their consistency,

579
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,280
we further show how active inference

580
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:55,914
may increase

581
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:56,815
the granularity

582
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,184
of psychological descriptions

583
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,452
by highlighting distinctions

584
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:01,387
between drives

585
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:02,654
to seek information

586
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:04,089
versus reward,

587
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,091
and how it may also offer

588
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,059
more precise,

589
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,595
quantitative psychological predictions.

590
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,063
Finally,

591
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,698
we consider how the implicitly

592
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,866
quantitative components

593
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,167
of active inference

594
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,169
may have partial analogs, i.e.

595
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,871
as if desires

596
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,406
in other systems, describable

597
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,807
by the broader free energy

598
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:25,344
principle to which it conforms.

599
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,813
Here's the road map. So

600
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:29,748
the dot

601
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,717
zeros, all of them in the world,

602
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,219
wouldn't be enough to hit every stop.

603
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,656
So we will go through roughly

604
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,958
in order of these sections

605
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,861
and the section titles are listed here.

606
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,330
But Ryan, what was the thought

607
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,799
going into the ordering

608
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,133
or the structuring

609
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:51,570
and why there is such a comprehensive,

610
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,771
historical

611
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:57,009
and preliminary consideration section?

612
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,744
I mean, I mean, a lot of it

613
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,278
I mean, the vast

614
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,679
majority of these sections

615
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,881
are just kind of building up background.

616
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:03,248
Right.

617
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,017
I mean, especially in background,

618
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,251
kind of see. Right.

619
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,221
Where where the you know, both both

620
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:09,455
I think

621
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,856
historically where, you know,

622
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,024
potential misunderstandings

623
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,392
might come from,

624
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,260
you know, and also and also

625
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,995
just enough of the providing,

626
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,464
enough of the formalism.

627
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:18,864
You know,

628
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:19,832
one part of the formalism

629
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,834
does kind of build on another writer

630
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,669
to see why them,

631
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:23,936
you know,

632
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,437
to see whether the

633
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,840
the apparent problem just isn't there.

634
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,173
Right.

635
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:28,907
So, I mean, the vast

636
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:29,908
majority of these sections

637
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,176
are just very preliminary,

638
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,544
just kind of building up

639
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,113
so that the reader has the information

640
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:34,980
necessary to

641
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,482
understand the argument, mainly

642
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:37,850
only the last couple of sections

643
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,817
that really,

644
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,486
really are the meat of the

645
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,020
argument itself.

646
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,523
I mean, so for example, just section

647
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,592
two, you know, the

648
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:47,426
ah what we just said

649
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,560
from the predictive coding

650
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,461
act of inferences,

651
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,330
just kind of highlighting how you know,

652
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,598
these initial is a

653
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:54,633
phase in brain

654
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,400
as implemented

655
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:55,901
or predictive

656
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,470
coding was purely a model of perception,

657
00:18:59,037 --> 00:18:59,338
right?

658
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,473
So then, you know, so not people

659
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,407
but a lot of times you'll see,

660
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,976
especially in the

661
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:04,843
older literature

662
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,679
and in some philosophy literature,

663
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,982
you know, predictive processing somehow

664
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,683
both refers to predictive coding,

665
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:12,985
but then also is talked

666
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,287
about as though it's

667
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:15,921
as though it's

668
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:19,024
the same thing as active inference.

669
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,693
Or they'll be these kinds of ideas where

670
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:22,461
if you just extend

671
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,530
predictive coding as kind of a

672
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,464
for the way it's talked about

673
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,699
as a kind of way of thinking about what

674
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,067
the whole brain does,

675
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,303
you know, then all of a sudden,

676
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,539
you know, controlling the body

677
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,040
ends up also just being something

678
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,342
about predicting what the body will do.

679
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,112
But but and

680
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,613
especially when described that way.

681
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:41,947
Right.

682
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,016
It sounds like something like

683
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,652
desire and motivation and goals

684
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:47,419
and things like that

685
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:48,587
are just kind of completely out

686
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:49,054
the window.

687
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:49,655
It's very hard

688
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:50,822
to make sense of what

689
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:51,456
how a system like

690
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,792
that would even work right.

691
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,994
And so it's and part of that,

692
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,030
I think, is because there's some,

693
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,332
you know, some

694
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,234
the way that certain things are written

695
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,168
and some of the literature

696
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,603
can be a little bit

697
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:08,207
confusing or it's not it's not too hard

698
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,575
to understand why,

699
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,310
you know, these sorts of you know,

700
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,444
these sorts of misunderstandings

701
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,480
could, you know, could happen.

702
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,183
But but but the section

703
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,686
really, really is to show how,

704
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,120
you know, initially, right,

705
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,055
when you're trying to move

706
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,656
from predictive coding again,

707
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,491
which is purely a model of perception,

708
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:27,759
it's not about decision making.

709
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,528
It's not about action selection.

710
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,029
It's not even about motor control.

711
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:31,263
Right.

712
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:31,763
It's just it's

713
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:32,764
just a Bayesian,

714
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:34,132
just a theory of how the brain

715
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:35,200
can do approximate Bayesian

716
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,301
inference and perception.

717
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:37,636
Yeah.

718
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,304
How that was initially

719
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:40,839
just extended to say,

720
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,341
hey, like if the brain works

721
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,543
this way, then, you know, how do you

722
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:45,611
how do you get a system

723
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,412
that actually controls the body

724
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,781
using the same generic architecture?

725
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:50,182
Right.

726
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:50,716
And so that,

727
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,918
you know, the story that then, you know,

728
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,686
and you know,

729
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:55,854
some other people

730
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:56,088
started

731
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,856
trying to put together was

732
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:58,323
the story

733
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:01,326
about how you can use predictions,

734
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:03,362
you know, descending predictions

735
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,063
if weighted appropriately.

736
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:05,397
Right.

737
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:06,098
As a way of

738
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,065
essentially setting

739
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,001
the target states of the body.

740
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:09,401
Right.

741
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,202
Like like

742
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,837
is this kind of the way I see

743
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:12,904
it talked about is,

744
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:13,171
you know,

745
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,140
I predict that my arm will be here,

746
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,408
but really it's down here.

747
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,643
But if I wait there correctly,

748
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,044
that it'll kind of like,

749
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,012
you know, you'll kind of control

750
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,080
the set point in a reflex arc.

751
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,382
So your arm kind of moves up

752
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,284
and transition, right?

753
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,685
But but that's

754
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,620
just a theory about how you can use

755
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,821
a descending prediction signal

756
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:30,756
to essentially act

757
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,724
as a motor command signal. Right.

758
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,259
There's nothing in that at all

759
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,261
that that's deciding

760
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,897
what that prediction ought to be.

761
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:39,264
Right.

762
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:40,532
There's nothing deciding what that

763
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,301
what which motor command

764
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,869
should should be the one

765
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,137
that's getting sent down.

766
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,571
And in a

767
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:50,409
and the with the form of a prediction.

768
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:50,709
Right?

769
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:51,576
So, so again,

770
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:52,744
so even there, it's

771
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:53,412
just a theory

772
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,713
about how you can use predictions

773
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,315
as motor currents, right?

774
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,382
Like there's now

775
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,518
a very big distinction between that

776
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,286
and whatever the system

777
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,487
is on top of that.

778
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,622
Right, is deciding, okay,

779
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:04,923
what motor command

780
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:07,025
but what motor prediction. Right.

781
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,460
Do I send?

782
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,828
And so does making,

783
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,195
you know,

784
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:11,863
making making that clear, right?

785
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:14,232
Because around 2015,

786
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,901
there was this big shift

787
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:18,203
right from this from this act

788
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,504
where from active inference

789
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,006
being talked about as a

790
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,574
a just kind of a motor control process.

791
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:22,808
Right?

792
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:23,175
Like a

793
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,543
like a story about how you can extend

794
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,445
predictive coding to

795
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,614
know also do motor commands, right?

796
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,817
Like from that to,

797
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:32,584
you know,

798
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:34,419
this larger, more comprehensive decision

799
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:35,954
making models

800
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:39,224
which are the current on the based

801
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:42,294
and those which was all aim to show

802
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,697
very explicitly you have something that

803
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,367
you know in the mathematics.

804
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,634
It just does, right?

805
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,037
It specifies the goals of the system.

806
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,338
It's pretty hard to get around

807
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,374
the fact that you need something,

808
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,942
a system need something like goals.

809
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:57,209
Right.

810
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,410
Because it has to evaluate

811
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,511
somehow

812
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:00,645
why one decision

813
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,447
is going to be better than another.

814
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:02,881
Right.

815
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:03,915
The only way it can really do

816
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,550
that is with respect

817
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,451
to how likely it is

818
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,721
to get whatever the system wants.

819
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,922
So so it's just

820
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:11,223
I mean,

821
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,525
in my in my view,

822
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:14,993
it's it's very difficult to see how

823
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,797
how you could ever get

824
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,298
a system to be able to evaluate

825
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:20,732
one action

826
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,600
as better than another

827
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,467
without having some sort of

828
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:23,602
target state.

829
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:27,072
And and so you can

830
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:31,042
call, right, like the target states,

831
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,111
an active inference,

832
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:34,813
a type of prior belief.

833
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:35,614
But at the end of the day,

834
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,416
it's functional role is to specify

835
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,950
what what observations

836
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,619
are better than what. Right.

837
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:40,952
So I mean,

838
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:41,520
you can really think

839
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,988
of active inferences

840
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,290
as using this kind of trick

841
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,658
in a certain sense, right?

842
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,093
Of specifying

843
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,494
desired outcomes

844
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:50,162
in the form

845
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,564
of a probability distribution,

846
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,332
because that helps keep everything

847
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,401
fully, fully, fully Bayesian.

848
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:57,803
Right.

849
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,404
But it's not it's not sampling

850
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,139
functional belief, right?

851
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,275
It's encoding in a higher probability

852
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,576
just means right.

853
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,813
Like the better, more rewarding outcome.

854
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,514
So so a lot of it is just

855
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:11,716
kind of

856
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:12,717
working step by step

857
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,052
through of kind

858
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,954
of the historical progression.

859
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:16,621
So you can see where

860
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,390
the misunderstanding could come from

861
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,324
and then also through

862
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,092
the current formalism

863
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,161
so that you can see exactly where those

864
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:23,762
where the,

865
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:24,062
you know,

866
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,831
the goal states are encoded

867
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:26,731
in terms of something

868
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:27,833
with the form

869
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,335
of a probability distribution.

870
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:33,271
Thank you.

871
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:37,142
The keywords are active inference,

872
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:40,078
folk psychology, predictive processing,

873
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,281
Bayesian beliefs and desires.

874
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:45,584
So now we're going to jump in

875
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,252
and some of the slides

876
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,888
have a lot of text topically arranged,

877
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,324
so we won't need to read all of the text

878
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,292
on many of the slides,

879
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,260
but especially

880
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,561
if somebody wants to pull out

881
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,463
like one of the highlighted sections

882
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,765
and like bring it to our attention.

883
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:02,734
That would be awesome.

884
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:03,635
So

885
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:04,803
and also, Ryan,

886
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:05,937
thanks a lot for that great

887
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,172
historical overview.

888
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,273
And I think there's there's

889
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,008
so much more to be

890
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,042
going into

891
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,211
about what happened before 2015

892
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:14,613
and what happened

893
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:17,916
in the last seven years.

894
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:18,550
In fact,

895
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,384
I think you covered

896
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:21,219
many of the key points

897
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,388
in what you just described here,

898
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:24,289
which had to do

899
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,257
with the development

900
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,592
of the predictive coding framework

901
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:31,563
into understanding brain and body.

902
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:32,731
Is there anything that anyone else

903
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:37,769
wants to add about these points?

904
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:38,737
Great. Then

905
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:44,175
all discussions and

906
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,144
zeros are like a two way street

907
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,880
where some people with active inference

908
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:52,217
familiarity are learning about new ideas

909
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,118
and frameworks.

910
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,252
And also people

911
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:55,654
who might have familiarity

912
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,889
with of a broadly

913
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:58,790
used area

914
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,058
outside of active

915
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,293
are learning about active.

916
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:04,696
So for both directions on that freeway,

917
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,231
it's important to understand

918
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,532
what is the target

919
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:09,200
non active framework

920
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,469
that's being juxtaposed and found.

921
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,738
Concordance is with active inference.

922
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,174
So the article is addressing the worry

923
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,976
that active models

924
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:18,944
may be in tension

925
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:21,913
with the belief desire, intention model,

926
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,682
and there are some consequences

927
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:26,117
to that worry.

928
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:27,152
In other words,

929
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:31,289
given some priors, it's a founded worry.

930
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,258
Would anyone like to summarize

931
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,626
what the belief, desire,

932
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:37,462
intention model is?

933
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,331
And you should, Daniel, because you

934
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:44,069
I think you put this slide together.

935
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,204
Ryan What led you to select

936
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:47,939
the BVI model?

937
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,941
And I wondered about

938
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,843
almost this tension or paradox

939
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:52,611
with like it's

940
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,778
folk psychology, it's

941
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,680
about what the people think.

942
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,515
But we're going to do a citation

943
00:26:57,515 --> 00:27:00,018
and one specific academic acronym

944
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:01,453
for what people think.

945
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,456
So is this like the main game in town

946
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,291
for folk psychology

947
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,659
from an academic perspective,

948
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,127
or what is the PDI

949
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,496
and what led you to select that

950
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:13,765
rather than like a small portfolio

951
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,367
of alternate folk psychologies?

952
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,771
I think that, you know,

953
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:20,372
our intention

954
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:24,142
model is just a very kind of generic,

955
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,078
but also widely known

956
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,914
account of trying to capture

957
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:31,983
folk psychology.

958
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,152
And it's it's kind of a

959
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:37,055
it's a it's a it's a major

960
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,392
sort of target of a lot of discussion

961
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,661
within philosophy of mind.

962
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:44,729
But but I mean, it's

963
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,064
just very generic, right?

964
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,499
I mean, just this idea of,

965
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,133
you know, what

966
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:48,800
what are the

967
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,302
what are the necessary ingredients

968
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:52,771
to make a decision?

969
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:53,471
Well, you know,

970
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:54,572
I have to have some beliefs

971
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:55,440
about how the world is

972
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,541
and about some desires

973
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:57,509
about how the world

974
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,943
I would like it to be.

975
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:00,478
And my intention involves

976
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,113
integrating those two things. Right.

977
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:02,681
And then

978
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,049
and then if all goes

979
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:04,516
if all goes

980
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,551
well in terms of translating intention

981
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,086
into controlling the body,

982
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,387
then I'll act out,

983
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:11,823
know something according to my intention

984
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,525
right then in simple,

985
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,660
like the example that you'll often hear

986
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,162
is just something like,

987
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,497
you know, I desire some ice cream.

988
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:19,898
You know,

989
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:20,532
I believe that

990
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,400
there's an ice cream truck,

991
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,302
you know, down the road,

992
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,404
you know, given those two things and

993
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,307
and necessarily those two things, right.

994
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,408
I can inform, interpret

995
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:31,109
and form

996
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,243
an intention to go,

997
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:32,477
you know,

998
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:33,344
walk over to the ice cream

999
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,246
truck and buy some ice cream.

1000
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:36,047
So how many questions,

1001
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,382
how else you know,

1002
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,117
are you going to explain why

1003
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:39,951
I went over to the truck

1004
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:40,952
to buy the ice cream?

1005
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:42,320
Literally just is

1006
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,688
that is the general sort of thing

1007
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,356
that when we're reasoning

1008
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:46,791
about other people's

1009
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:47,859
decisions, other people's

1010
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:49,928
behavior, and

1011
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:50,729
trying to figure out, okay,

1012
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,697
why did this person do what they did?

1013
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:53,031
You know,

1014
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:55,200
we're assuming it's a voluntary action

1015
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,834
or assuming it's

1016
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:58,136
not because there are arm spasms or,

1017
00:28:58,169 --> 00:28:58,570
you know,

1018
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,337
because they have some

1019
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,106
like really highly ingrained habit

1020
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:02,741
or compulsion or something like that.

1021
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:02,941
Right.

1022
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:03,541
I mean, we're talking

1023
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,243
about voluntary behavior

1024
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,212
and that is just the way. Right.

1025
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,813
That we tend to reason

1026
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:10,915
about how people do what they do.

1027
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:11,883
You know, either once I

1028
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,118
when somebody does something that's

1029
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,986
we think is weird, right,

1030
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:16,454
then usually we have to explain that

1031
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:17,355
in terms of, okay, well,

1032
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:18,523
they just believe something

1033
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,492
that was incorrect, right?

1034
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,894
Or they had some really funny desire.

1035
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:25,497
Right? That I don't really

1036
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,999
you know, it's it's tends to be

1037
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,101
one of those sorts of things, right?

1038
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:30,802
I mean, I mean,

1039
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,104
I don't know a lot of other,

1040
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,739
you know, separate

1041
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:36,007
folks, psychological models

1042
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:37,075
that would entail

1043
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:38,243
anything different than us

1044
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:42,280
at a very generic level.

1045
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,183
And it's also exactly the sort of thing

1046
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:49,220
that that people try to contrast

1047
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:49,954
active inference

1048
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,957
with where where instead of, you know,

1049
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,759
belief, desire

1050
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:55,794
and desires coming together

1051
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:56,795
to form intentions.

1052
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,363
Instead it'd be something like

1053
00:29:58,363 --> 00:29:59,164
one kind of belief

1054
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:00,098
in another kind of beliefs

1055
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,267
come together to form an intention,

1056
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:06,137
which again, for a lot of reasons is,

1057
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:09,240
you know, confusing and rightfully so

1058
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,377
when it's presented that way.

1059
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:13,611
Makes yes.

1060
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:15,079
This QUESTION

1061
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,214
So Brian,

1062
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,483
when we've had some conversations

1063
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,852
with other authors in other papers

1064
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,253
where we've talked about the scale

1065
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:23,888
three formalism

1066
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:25,223
and we've also talked a little bit

1067
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:28,126
about the sort of scale friendly

1068
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,228
times when you have defined that history

1069
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:31,396
and that context.

1070
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:31,796
What you just

1071
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,965
mentioned was sort of the generic

1072
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:37,101
generalized sense that the BDA

1073
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:38,203
umbrella provides.

1074
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,839
You're not saying that scale three

1075
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,508
Quantifying creation and a generic

1076
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,443
way of modeling

1077
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:46,711
something are the same thing.

1078
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:48,279
But what I think I'm like,

1079
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,681
without putting words in your mouth,

1080
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,950
are you saying that the scale freeness

1081
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,651
as it moves to something

1082
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:56,588
more scale friendly, sweeps up

1083
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,389
some of that generic

1084
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:01,593
big tent idea or model and now

1085
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,229
moves it along, allows you to sort of

1086
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,830
parse and be specific

1087
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,232
and precise, precise,

1088
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,167
but also be able to generalize

1089
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,501
as you move through those

1090
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:12,003
you know, quantification

1091
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,638
of the distribution

1092
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,206
and density and such,

1093
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:15,940
because that's kind of

1094
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,475
what I was reading into it.

1095
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:18,676
I just want to make sure that I got

1096
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:20,612
it was kind of

1097
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:21,613
maybe you can help me clean

1098
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:24,182
that up a bit.

1099
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,350
I mean, I really don't know that

1100
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,885
anything that we're saying

1101
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,186
really depends on our even

1102
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:28,920
gets into a lot

1103
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,622
of those sorts of specifics.

1104
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:31,322
I mean, really

1105
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:32,423
and really all we're saying

1106
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,259
is, is that, you know,

1107
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,260
if you want to take

1108
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:37,629
a model

1109
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,031
like the current pack of insurance

1110
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:40,832
formulas in the current

1111
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:43,401
kind of like vanilla formalism, right?

1112
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,936
So in terms of interest,

1113
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:48,573
the standard one or scaled up claim,

1114
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,541
it doesn't really matter.

1115
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,577
It is if you want to use

1116
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,647
the vanilla active inference framework

1117
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:56,514
to actually model

1118
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:57,815
some sort of voluntary decision

1119
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:00,084
process in a human rights in.

1120
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,520
A lot of my work has to do with people

1121
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,888
modeling behavior on decision

1122
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:05,223
making tasks

1123
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:08,259
right then have to do with the person.

1124
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,528
The person has the goal of maximizing,

1125
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:12,063
you know, how much money they want

1126
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,231
or maximizing

1127
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:14,499
some sort of social reward.

1128
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,534
Something like the idea is

1129
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,603
just that when you're trying to

1130
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,837
if you're going to take an active

1131
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:20,772
inference model

1132
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,107
and you're going to use it to model,

1133
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,544
successful model actual human behavior

1134
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,846
when they're making decisions, then

1135
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,582
there's always going to be

1136
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:34,252
a mapping between the different elements

1137
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,721
in the active inference model

1138
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:39,891
of voluntary behavior that for the

1139
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:42,026
whatever the prior prior

1140
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:44,095
preference distribution is,

1141
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:47,031
you just set that so that it just to

1142
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,066
the level of reward

1143
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:49,867
and

1144
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,737
so so there's really

1145
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,106
nothing about any super scale

1146
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:56,040
or anything like that.

1147
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,108
This is much more generic.

1148
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:57,976
It's just

1149
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,344
if you're going to use active inference

1150
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:02,547
to model voluntary choice, then

1151
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,850
it will always be something analogous

1152
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,552
to a belief and a desire

1153
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:09,954
because that's just what you need

1154
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:12,256
to model to model voluntary behavior.

1155
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:14,759
It's true that, you know,

1156
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:15,860
that's probably

1157
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,260
if you're

1158
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:16,894
if you actually

1159
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:19,163
were going to try to capture something

1160
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:20,398
kind of

1161
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,166
like more of the actual architecture

1162
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:22,734
on the brain,

1163
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,002
as opposed to just

1164
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:24,335
this kind

1165
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,170
of like voluntary decision

1166
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,105
process aspect.

1167
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:27,805
I mean, I'm

1168
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:28,940
sure there's a lot of

1169
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,074
kind of hierarchy below

1170
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,209
that under that, right,

1171
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,677
that's translating

1172
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,513
or abstracts, policy selection processes

1173
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,814
into whatever

1174
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:38,182
the dynamic signals are that

1175
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,151
that end up controlling

1176
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:41,819
moment by moment, muscle movements and

1177
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:42,487
things like that.

1178
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,323
But the point is, is that below

1179
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:47,158
a lot of this kind of top level

1180
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:49,761
where you're doing policy selection

1181
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:52,296
at that point,

1182
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:53,531
you don't really need the desires

1183
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,165
anymore, right?

1184
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:56,467
You just need the policy to specify

1185
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:57,502
whatever though

1186
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,070
motor commands are going down

1187
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,973
that can take the form of predictions.

1188
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:02,974
So I don't

1189
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,142
I don't know if that helps,

1190
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:04,876
but it's just, it's

1191
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,811
just that in a certain level,

1192
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:09,080
in any kind of hierarchy of a model

1193
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,015
that's going to actually

1194
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:12,617
be applicable successfully

1195
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:13,651
to human behavior

1196
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:17,655
and at the level of policy selection and

1197
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,557
prior preferences

1198
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,793
will just inform the desired outcomes.

1199
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:22,693
They'll just encode

1200
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:23,194
the goals

1201
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,529
that the agents are trying to reach.

1202
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:25,296
And the policy

1203
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:26,531
that's chosen

1204
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,866
will be evaluated

1205
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,569
as being the most likely policy, because

1206
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,471
it's the thing that's predicted to

1207
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:34,672
have the highest probability of

1208
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:37,942
getting the desired

1209
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:42,713
generating the desired observation.

1210
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:43,514
I'm

1211
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,184
if I may also comment on that,

1212
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,319
and I'm not sure if this is

1213
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,521
answering your question, Dean,

1214
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:51,889
but the way I thought about it

1215
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,758
when I was reading the paper

1216
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,761
was that part of the reason why

1217
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,228
the believe,

1218
00:34:57,228 --> 00:35:01,532
desire, intention model kind of works?

1219
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,568
It works well for for mapping

1220
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:04,368
the active inference

1221
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:07,271
ontology to the full psychology ontology

1222
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:10,308
is because it's the discrete model in

1223
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:11,175
that it separates

1224
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:12,710
these, these different,

1225
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,411
these different parts.

1226
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:14,745
And, and,

1227
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:16,481
and I think that also

1228
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,649
might have motivated the choice to

1229
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:21,052
consider mainly this preplanned piece

1230
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,155
and describe the decision

1231
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,791
this decision active inference in that

1232
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:31,095
in that way as well,

1233
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:33,397
because then this discrete model

1234
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:34,832
can be more easily

1235
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:37,468
mapped to say the discrete model of

1236
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:41,038
the MVP that that's described like a,

1237
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:42,306
like a factor graph.

1238
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:46,344
I'm, I'm not sure I,

1239
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:49,514
I was wondering how this would map to

1240
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,150
continuous tasks as well and.

1241
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,018
Well, I mean, I mean,

1242
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:56,521
I think the I mean part of the I mean,

1243
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:58,723
part of the part of the reason

1244
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,858
why you need something discrete,

1245
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:04,662
right, is as actions discrete, right?

1246
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:05,396
I mean,

1247
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,765
there's either one or this powerful view

1248
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,267
or this model, right?

1249
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,067
So those,

1250
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,603
those just are sort of necessarily

1251
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:13,037
right.

1252
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:14,639
I mean, you get in

1253
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,273
a continuous

1254
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:16,607
database is worthwhile

1255
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:19,076
or are appropriate

1256
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:20,811
at lower levels in a hierarchy.

1257
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:21,012
You know,

1258
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:21,546
when you're talking

1259
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:22,914
about kind of dynamics

1260
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,248
and motor movement,

1261
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:24,815
then you mix

1262
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,984
in a set point of some reflex ARCore

1263
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:29,620
or when you're trying to estimate

1264
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,721
something in perception

1265
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:31,756
that just

1266
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,558
just as a continuous quantity, right?

1267
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,860
Like brightness or orientation

1268
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,761
or things like that.

1269
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,297
But, but the level of,

1270
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,532
at the level of decision making

1271
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,603
and models are necessarily discrete.

1272
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:48,206
I mean I mean, there is

1273
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:48,472
you know,

1274
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:48,873
there are

1275
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,341
there are kind of hybrid models, right,

1276
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,910
that are out there in the literature.

1277
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:53,644
For example,

1278
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:53,978
you know,

1279
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:55,012
Hezbollah, several papers

1280
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:57,148
using these sorts of models where the

1281
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,250
the kind of policy

1282
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,751
at the higher level,

1283
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,120
which is which is in a discrete model

1284
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,755
and generates

1285
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:06,991
some observation, then sets that point.

1286
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,126
Right, for some continuous

1287
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,262
or some continuous low level model

1288
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:14,131
that then can end up in a, in a way

1289
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,533
that's kind of like this kind of

1290
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,002
story, you know,

1291
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:18,402
like move

1292
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,737
the eyes around the car

1293
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,738
to different locations

1294
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,306
and things like that.

1295
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:26,143
So, so I, I kind of think that

1296
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:29,580
the discrete ness is the, or the, the,

1297
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,049
the reason why

1298
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:33,384
things move to a discrete size

1299
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:34,051
based architecture

1300
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,220
is just because of the necessary

1301
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,522
what's necessary with respect

1302
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:40,858
to a model of policy collection,

1303
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:43,261
because it it's kind of all or none.

1304
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:48,232
Just to keep the .00 ish,

1305
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:50,568
we're going to move a lot faster

1306
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,570
through the following slides.

1307
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,872
And there's many important questions

1308
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,375
in the chat and, and also arising.

1309
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,443
So we'll just kind of carry on

1310
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,144
more rapidly

1311
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:01,612
so people can

1312
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,581
pick up on these key points in the zero.

1313
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:04,849
And we have a lot of

1314
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,117
time to explore soon.

1315
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,120
Section two

1316
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:09,687
from predictive

1317
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,222
coding to active inference

1318
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,458
traces the history and the developments

1319
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:17,094
from various fields.

1320
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:20,131
And just one sentence here

1321
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:20,731
that the

1322
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:22,400
Dean and I both highlighted on at

1323
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,168
then Dean, let you describe the button.

1324
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:25,436
Was that

1325
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:27,004
crucially, for the purposes

1326
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:28,072
of this paper,

1327
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,073
the first generation

1328
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:29,940
active inference

1329
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,376
was not a theory of decision making.

1330
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,912
It did not explain how we decide or plan

1331
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:35,813
where to move our body.

1332
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:36,714
It only explained

1333
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,816
how body movements can be executed

1334
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,951
using the predictive coding apparatus.

1335
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:43,254
Once a decision has been made.

1336
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,155
So how did you connect

1337
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,324
that to the bottom? Right.

1338
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:46,624
Yeah.

1339
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,859
So if you're on a if you're on a

1340
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:49,994
some sort of a website

1341
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,329
and you have

1342
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,630
to pass through to something.

1343
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,466
My question was based on that statement,

1344
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:56,934
when the expectation

1345
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:58,202
is to know

1346
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:00,237
that you've actually crossed

1347
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:01,505
the threshold, you've moved

1348
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,606
beyond one page,

1349
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:04,408
and there's an expectation that there's

1350
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,410
something that you've validated

1351
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,079
or confirmed or whatever.

1352
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,081
Is the feedback that you received.

1353
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:10,681
Does that have

1354
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:12,917
how how does the

1355
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,286
person who's actually expecting that

1356
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:16,787
they're on the other side?

1357
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,556
What kind of feedback mechanism

1358
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:20,958
do they need to for that confirmation?

1359
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,127
Is tactile feedback enough?

1360
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:23,861
Do they need

1361
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:24,395
some sort of a

1362
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,030
visual confirmation as well?

1363
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,165
Like what is the what's the

1364
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,468
it is there

1365
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,503
because we're talking about thresholds.

1366
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:33,204
Is that different

1367
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,472
for every single person

1368
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,574
or is it sort sort of expectations built

1369
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,709
in depending upon the kind of situation

1370
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,444
that you're dealing with?

1371
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:41,946
I do know that with that,

1372
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:42,513
the idea

1373
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:44,515
that like changes are saved

1374
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:45,816
or links are copied,

1375
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,218
sometimes the click isn't enough

1376
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,319
to give people confidence

1377
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,387
that in fact

1378
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,156
that process is carried through.

1379
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:52,857
I mean, I would

1380
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:53,357
I would say

1381
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:53,624
that I mean,

1382
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:54,492
a lot of those questions

1383
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,659
are really empirical,

1384
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:58,162
empirical questions, modeling questions.

1385
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,731
You know, I mean,

1386
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,565
in terms of in terms

1387
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,333
of how you would model

1388
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,033
that sort of thing

1389
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:04,835
or get you to specify what observations

1390
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:05,636
kind of tactile

1391
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:06,937
you specify, what observations

1392
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,205
counts at all.

1393
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:11,175
And what ends up being thresholds

1394
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,209
for inspection evidence

1395
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:12,877
and things like that.

1396
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:16,046
Just that's not the way it processes,

1397
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:17,148
just how the dynamics

1398
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:19,717
naturally unroll in the model

1399
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,652
under whatever the model parameters

1400
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:24,422
action is. So, so

1401
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,023
you'll hit a threshold faster

1402
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,025
if the mapping between observation,

1403
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:29,026
whatever observations

1404
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:31,629
and states is more precise, for example,

1405
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,799
I mean there's,

1406
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:35,065
you know,

1407
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:35,666
in relation

1408
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:36,734
to in relation to that

1409
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:37,535
when we're doing

1410
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:38,869
policy selection right,

1411
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,571
we also have to check and see

1412
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:41,872
whether things are actually going

1413
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:42,840
as we expected them

1414
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,942
to go under a choice of policy.

1415
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:46,343
Right. That's possible.

1416
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:47,611
That you choose

1417
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,679
policy one

1418
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,014
and you start

1419
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,515
to get the subsequent observations

1420
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:52,483
and they are actually match for

1421
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:53,451
you expected,

1422
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,351
you know, given that you've

1423
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:55,352
chosen policy one,

1424
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,222
in which case

1425
00:40:58,355 --> 00:40:59,824
you'll update your beliefs

1426
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:01,025
or perceptual inferences

1427
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,226
that might influence

1428
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:04,762
how you act going forward.

1429
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:07,064
So, so but the specifics about,

1430
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:07,364
you know,

1431
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:08,265
what's enough,

1432
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:08,999
whether it's visual

1433
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:10,267
or tactile or anything like that,

1434
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:11,101
I mean, those are

1435
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:11,702
those are really just

1436
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:13,304
empirical questions

1437
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,171
that would have to be answered

1438
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,272
in studies as opposed to

1439
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:17,241
something about model choices.

1440
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:17,508
Okay.

1441
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:18,476
So there was really not a

1442
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,143
good enough thing

1443
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,579
when you did the darkroom aspect of it,

1444
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:23,881
like the reading about

1445
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,950
prepared to take on, right?

1446
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:26,517
Like somebody

1447
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:27,751
was prepared to take on the risk

1448
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,487
because they really urgently

1449
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,322
wanted the ice cream versus

1450
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,390
the person who was like,

1451
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,993
yeah, I'm agnostic, right?

1452
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:36,727
So that's

1453
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:38,829
maybe that's kind of what I was

1454
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:39,997
because this was on the second

1455
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:40,998
reading of your paper, right?

1456
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,467
So I was kind of now back

1457
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:44,869
from further down in the paper.

1458
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,404
So well I into that.

1459
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:48,939
Yeah, we'll go in order

1460
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:49,940
because we're mentioning things

1461
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,075
that we haven't brought up yet,

1462
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:52,142
but let's continue on

1463
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:53,143
and we'll return to that.

1464
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:54,211
And Ryan, I,

1465
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:54,979
I also

1466
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:57,181
agree that in any specific case, it's

1467
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,383
going to be a model parameter position.

1468
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:00,651
Some of these are very difficult

1469
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,620
to answer in the abstract

1470
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,921
model selection setting

1471
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:08,492
here, the

1472
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,160
distinction between motor

1473
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,061
active inference

1474
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:12,162
and decision active

1475
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:16,800
inference is introduced and all allow

1476
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,703
Jacob to just convey one pass.

1477
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:20,871
What is the difference

1478
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,573
between motor active inference

1479
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:26,944
and decision active inference?

1480
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:27,811
So I'm not sure

1481
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:29,213
whether I can

1482
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,815
say much that hasn't been said yet.

1483
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:35,819
But in a briefly, the motor

1484
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:39,523
active inference is does well.

1485
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,225
As already mentioned

1486
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,693
it does not consider

1487
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:45,663
design desires in the in

1488
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:46,931
both the active inference

1489
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:50,467
and psychological sense as

1490
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,337
was then connected in the bit

1491
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:53,971
in the paper.

1492
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:54,805
But

1493
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,807
also it is my understanding

1494
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:58,208
that the motor control

1495
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:01,145
version of active inference is modeled

1496
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:04,081
continuously, like the models of

1497
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:08,018
of the movement of individual muscles,

1498
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:10,054
which does not entail decision making.

1499
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:12,756
So it's modeled with

1500
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,325
a continuous time

1501
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,360
rather than in discrete time,

1502
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,829
and that's decision making.

1503
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:19,430
And if, as

1504
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:23,200
Ryan already said as well,

1505
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,202
is all about decision making.

1506
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:28,238
So it describes the discrete

1507
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,874
process of decision making with

1508
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:35,145
prior beliefs and preferences.

1509
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:37,581
And it can I

1510
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:38,415
and it can be model

1511
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:41,118
at different, different

1512
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:44,588
levels of cognition as well is one thing

1513
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:46,123
that I'm still a bit uncertain

1514
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,658
about how we can move

1515
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:49,593
through these different layers

1516
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:50,761
while still keeping

1517
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:53,964
the same mathematical formulation,

1518
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,466
but I think we'll probably get to

1519
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,202
that in the other slides.

1520
00:43:58,569 --> 00:43:59,103
Yep.

1521
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,305
We're going to continue with this

1522
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,841
distinction of am I for motor active

1523
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:07,177
inference and I for the decision

1524
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:11,281
active inference.

1525
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,884
Here we're showing some key sections

1526
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:21,458
from the paper and some citations.

1527
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,594
I think we will continue on

1528
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:26,397
without going into this in depth,

1529
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,698
but it describes

1530
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:30,834
some of the specific model quantities

1531
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:33,237
that are being

1532
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:35,739
described in active inference formalism,

1533
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:36,640
and we're going to come to them

1534
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,842
when we look at some equations

1535
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:39,777
in the coming slides

1536
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:45,015
in section

1537
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,418
three, preliminary considerations,

1538
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:52,189
two broad points are introduced

1539
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,757
and we might show

1540
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:59,096
a second one on a later slide.

1541
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:00,464
How can we think, Ryan,

1542
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:01,131
about what

1543
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:01,999
is said here

1544
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,134
that decision making models

1545
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:05,769
are largely taken to describe

1546
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:08,806
sub personal non conscious processes?

1547
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:12,376
And also it was asked in the chart,

1548
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,477
not that we have to address it

1549
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:15,179
now by doing it

1550
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:15,746
has active

1551
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:16,513
inference produced

1552
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:19,083
a single reasonable model of a qualia.

1553
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,785
So when we're thinking about this

1554
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:24,288
first broad point that was made here,

1555
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:26,090
where is experience

1556
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,291
and what is the distinction

1557
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:28,092
between the personal

1558
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:31,261
and the sub personal in I

1559
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:32,663
um.

1560
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:33,897
Well, I mean, so

1561
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:34,631
there's a couple

1562
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:35,733
different questions

1563
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:36,333
you asked there

1564
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,501
and I don't necessarily

1565
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:38,902
think they're synonymous.

1566
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:39,670
So, you know,

1567
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:40,204
when you said,

1568
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:41,105
I think the first question you

1569
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:42,206
asked for something about

1570
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:44,675
has active

1571
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:45,676
inference provided

1572
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:48,579
some sort of explanation or model of

1573
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:50,948
of qualia that would be satisfactory?

1574
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,450
And I'm in a strong stance on the sense

1575
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:54,718
another in the sense of quality

1576
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:55,652
as an explanation

1577
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:57,521
for the hard problem of consciousness,

1578
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:59,356
then I think active inferences

1579
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:00,057
in the same place

1580
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:01,024
as anyone else

1581
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:02,059
and that no one

1582
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:03,260
has a good explanation

1583
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,129
for, for

1584
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:05,496
how to deal

1585
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:06,997
with the hard problem of consciousness.

1586
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:07,297
Right?

1587
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:08,365
I mean, like it's

1588
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:09,533
massive literature out there,

1589
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,301
but I think everyone thinks it's

1590
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:14,037
just as mysterious as ever.

1591
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:15,739
So so no. Right.

1592
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:18,242
I mean, on the other hand,

1593
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:20,644
I mean, know myself and others

1594
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:22,312
have published multiple papers

1595
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:23,881
showing how you can successfully

1596
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:24,381
use active

1597
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:25,682
inference models

1598
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:28,485
to to model conscious access processes.

1599
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:28,919
Right.

1600
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:30,487
So the distinction between

1601
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:31,622
when the brain is representing

1602
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,157
something unconsciously versus

1603
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:33,991
when it's representing

1604
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:35,592
something consciously,

1605
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,461
you know, in that it can

1606
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,896
self-report, right?

1607
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,697
What it's representing.

1608
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:41,732
Can you use the information

1609
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:44,101
to make voluntary choices?

1610
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:44,701
And we've shown that

1611
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:45,636
those sorts of models

1612
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,071
are able to reproduce

1613
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:50,073
like empirical results

1614
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:52,476
and like EEG studies and MRI studies

1615
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,178
and things like that.

1616
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:56,413
That and that also can make novel

1617
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,182
neurophysiological predictions,

1618
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:00,150
some of which seem like they,

1619
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:00,417
you know,

1620
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:02,186
in some subsequent work,

1621
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:03,120
we have

1622
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,089
empirical support for those predictions.

1623
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:08,458
So so in terms of providing a,

1624
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:10,294
you know, a

1625
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:11,929
what seems like a useful account

1626
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:13,163
of the processes

1627
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,398
associated with

1628
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:16,133
what people self-report

1629
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,035
that they consciously experience

1630
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:19,770
and, and the brain basis for that.

1631
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:22,272
I think active inference as the

1632
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:24,374
least the starting, you know, a starting

1633
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,076
starting point for

1634
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:26,810
for being useful

1635
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,078
and explaining those sorts of things.

1636
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:31,081
But you know why one little posterior

1637
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:32,115
and set of model versus

1638
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:32,850
another posterior

1639
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:33,283
in a model

1640
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:34,151
actually corresponds

1641
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:35,452
to like the experience

1642
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:36,854
of red versus blue or something.

1643
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,088
I mean, no, I don't.

1644
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:40,357
I think active inferences is

1645
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,859
not any better than anyone else.

1646
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,627
Know any other model for that question.

1647
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:45,329
The

1648
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:46,864
I guess

1649
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,198
the second thing

1650
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,634
that you asked had to do with

1651
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,102
it's kind of a related question of

1652
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:52,803
why it's the case

1653
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:53,737
that one model has to do

1654
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:55,305
with a conscious process

1655
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:56,740
for his unconscious process.

1656
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:57,574
And

1657
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:00,077
the best never really got there.

1658
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:00,577
And you know

1659
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:01,278
what, what falls

1660
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:03,547
out of the models that we have

1661
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,414
shown really

1662
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:06,550
this has to do with temporal scale,

1663
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,117
you know,

1664
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:07,818
so there's still

1665
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:08,852
there will be a certain level

1666
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:09,753
of temporal

1667
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:12,289
representation in a hierarchical model

1668
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,458
that that integrates enough

1669
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:15,726
and represents regularities

1670
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:16,994
over a long enough timescale

1671
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:18,795
that I can contribute to

1672
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:21,431
in a sort of prospective.

1673
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:23,200
And it will be sufficiently compact

1674
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,167
to generate things

1675
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:25,469
like self-reports, right?

1676
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:26,103
So I mean, think about

1677
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:28,138
how complicated and temporally extended

1678
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:29,806
we're performing and

1679
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:31,775
choosing to report something like,

1680
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:32,276
you know,

1681
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:34,111
I see something green in

1682
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:35,045
front of me, right?

1683
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:36,613
I mean, it's a very complicated

1684
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:37,681
and really deep

1685
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:38,749
and narrow

1686
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:39,917
type of policy to select

1687
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:40,617
and it requires

1688
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:42,953
integrating a bunch of information

1689
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,721
from stuff at lower levels

1690
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:47,524
that's happening over faster timescales.

1691
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:48,992
So at a minimum, right,

1692
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:50,260
you just need to be

1693
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:50,794
at a level

1694
00:48:50,794 --> 00:48:51,895
of representation

1695
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:54,131
or the regularities are sufficiently

1696
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:56,700
sufficiently long and

1697
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:57,968
especially temporally deep

1698
00:48:57,968 --> 00:48:58,635
and then have access

1699
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:00,270
to all the relevant information

1700
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:00,938
you need to integrate

1701
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,372
to be able to generate

1702
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:04,107
records like that.

1703
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,276
Whereas, whereas much of the other

1704
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,878
kind of little pieces in the model,

1705
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:09,212
right, like

1706
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:11,615
the generated

1707
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,016
say like expected error

1708
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:14,351
for like variational for energy

1709
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:16,486
gradients and things like that that

1710
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,221
people like all like surprise, right?

1711
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:20,057
I mean, no one's claiming

1712
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:20,824
that and often

1713
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:22,392
they will not relate in any way

1714
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:23,593
to people's conscious reports

1715
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:24,695
about the like surprise

1716
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,229
because conscious reports about feeling

1717
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:26,997
surprise will have to do

1718
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:28,365
with representations

1719
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,000
of surprises states.

1720
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,301
Right, as opposed to

1721
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:35,672
some sort of prediction error like

1722
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:37,341
gradient minimization process.

1723
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:37,741
So

1724
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:45,182
thanks.

1725
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:47,017
Also in Section three,

1726
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:49,152
there are several clarifications

1727
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:54,191
and some seeds that are planted,

1728
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:57,361
namely if computational

1729
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:57,794
and folk

1730
00:49:57,794 --> 00:50:00,430
psychological predictions converge

1731
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:01,798
and no other available theory

1732
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:03,967
can account for behavior equally well,

1733
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:04,935
this could entail

1734
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:07,070
the mathematical structure of AI

1735
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:09,573
as more than a convenient tool,

1736
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:10,941
instead that it corresponds

1737
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:12,209
to the true information

1738
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:13,944
processing structure

1739
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:15,512
underlying in enabling

1740
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:18,482
folk psychology and related abilities.

1741
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:21,251
And this is really nicely put here that

1742
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:22,719
the crucial point remains

1743
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:23,520
that one should not

1744
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,788
conflate mathematical

1745
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:26,923
and psychological levels of description.

1746
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:29,192
However, dry models

1747
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,293
might nonetheless offer

1748
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:31,595
more detailed information

1749
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:32,829
about the true form

1750
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:35,098
of folk, psychological categories

1751
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:38,668
and processes, and then they add that

1752
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:41,138
their aims are to demonstrate

1753
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:43,306
that there's a clear ice morph ism

1754
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:45,375
between the elements of DIY models

1755
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,477
and those of the body model,

1756
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,813
and then show how

1757
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:51,181
provided one does not assume

1758
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:52,716
probability distributions

1759
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,017
in computational models

1760
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:55,619
must be identified with beliefs

1761
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,320
at a psychological level,

1762
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,488
there will be no tension

1763
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:02,692
between DJI and VDI, and that comparison

1764
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:04,227
or or juxtaposition

1765
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:07,697
is clarified by separating

1766
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:10,500
AI from DJI has been mentioned.

1767
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:11,868
Anything else

1768
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:13,570
before we start to jump

1769
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,272
into some of the formalism

1770
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:20,977
and keeping all of this in mind?

1771
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:23,847
I guess I had one question on

1772
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:27,551
our on the

1773
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:30,620
on which

1774
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:32,989
ontology we're working with.

1775
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:33,790
When we say there's

1776
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:34,825
a isomer present

1777
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:36,860
between the elements of die models

1778
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,597
and those of the VDI model,

1779
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,898
because I think there are multiple ways

1780
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:44,901
to interpret this one.

1781
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:46,570
One thing that I'm wondering about

1782
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,138
is whether this means

1783
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:49,873
that we can basically construct

1784
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:51,374
a mathematical formulation

1785
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:53,643
of the of the BD model

1786
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:54,611
that is like a

1787
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,379
subset of active inference.

1788
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:57,481
Or maybe

1789
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:00,684
maybe there are certain certain elements

1790
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:04,020
of the BD model that aren't necessarily

1791
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,056
encapsulated by the Nocturnes

1792
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:08,125
that weren't discussed in this paper.

1793
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,726
And what

1794
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,895
that would

1795
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:15,332
mean in terms of formulating

1796
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:19,202
this mathematical,

1797
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:20,370
mathematical formulation

1798
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:23,740
of, of the BD model.

1799
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:26,476
So I mean, what the isomer as I'm just

1800
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,611
means is

1801
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,479
tell me the description at one level

1802
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:30,947
and I'll be able to translate it for you

1803
00:52:30,947 --> 00:52:31,515
very quickly

1804
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:32,149
and directly

1805
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,183
into whatever the description

1806
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:34,151
as of the other level

1807
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,852
in both directions.

1808
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:36,253
Right.

1809
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:37,554
I mean, so that just means,

1810
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:39,923
you know, tell me tell me what?

1811
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,925
Now tell me what it is that you want.

1812
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:42,225
You know,

1813
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:43,360
if I say,

1814
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,261
do you want ice cream

1815
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:46,196
or do you want a pizza? Right.

1816
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:47,831
Tell me tell me that you like.

1817
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,232
If you tell me that you like

1818
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:49,866
you want pizza

1819
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,935
twice as much as you like ice cream,

1820
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:53,770
then it's very easy to just put

1821
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:56,773
a four

1822
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,242
in the, you know, in the distribution,

1823
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:00,377
in the preference

1824
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:00,944
distribution

1825
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:02,646
over the observation of pizza

1826
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:04,514
and the two for ice cream

1827
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:07,083
and then soft mac it and log it.

1828
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:09,219
Right and then like,

1829
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:09,986
you know,

1830
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:12,322
there's that's the description, right?

1831
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:13,757
So just in a very direct way,

1832
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:15,525
it just encodes relative desires

1833
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:16,993
for one thing versus another.

1834
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:19,029
Now tell me your beliefs are right.

1835
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:19,729
I mean,

1836
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:20,997
do you believe the pizzas to the left

1837
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:22,065
or to the right?

1838
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:23,133
I can put that in

1839
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:24,568
as the different categories of it

1840
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:24,968
and states

1841
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:25,368
that are going in

1842
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,170
for a distribution over. Right.

1843
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,972
So like it's just

1844
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:29,339
the point

1845
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,341
is, is that in either direction, right?

1846
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:31,975
Give me the full

1847
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:33,810
psychological description.

1848
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:34,578
I can translate it

1849
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:36,479
very straightforwardly

1850
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:38,148
using the same elements every time

1851
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:40,083
as being desires or beliefs.

1852
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:42,185
Give it to me.

1853
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:44,888
At the at the mathematical level,

1854
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:46,890
I can translate that into description

1855
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,658
in terms of beliefs and desires. Right.

1856
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,894
I mean, it's just it's just 1 to 1.

1857
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,029
I can't think of an example offhand

1858
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:55,532
where

1859
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:57,100
there would be any kind

1860
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,368
of like mismatch or an ability

1861
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:00,203
for one to account for the other.

1862
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:01,871
But, you know, it's

1863
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:03,273
kind of hard to prove a negative, right?

1864
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:04,140
So I mean, maybe

1865
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,141
you can give me an example,

1866
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:08,144
but I can't think of one.

1867
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:10,814
Awesome. Yeah.

1868
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:11,114
Yeah.

1869
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:11,848
I was just going to say

1870
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:12,716
that I can really

1871
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,851
think of an example right now.

1872
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:18,188
I, I, I just,

1873
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:18,888
I find it

1874
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:21,224
really interesting with the usage of,

1875
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:24,060
of just the word is more pleasant

1876
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,862
because that like,

1877
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:26,196
as you,

1878
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:27,897
as you said, it's just

1879
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:30,400
a by by direction and subjective map.

1880
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,801
So it's basically equivalent.

1881
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:34,104
It's just set in a different way.

1882
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,006
So I can imagine that

1883
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:38,642
meaning that we can basically

1884
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:40,076
instead of the Wikipedia page

1885
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:40,777
where the body I'm

1886
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:44,247
all using all of these terms

1887
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:47,951
like believe, desire, intention,

1888
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:49,886
it could just be a set of active

1889
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:51,821
inference equations and that's the body.

1890
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:54,024
I'm also because it's an exorcism.

1891
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:56,226
Right?

1892
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:58,328
I mean, literally your your beliefs

1893
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:00,230
or just your cues. Right.

1894
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:03,333
And your and your desires are just

1895
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:06,336
your right.

1896
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:07,737
I mean I mean, and,

1897
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:10,206
you know, the way that we've

1898
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:10,774
we and others

1899
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:12,642
have tended to write it now.

1900
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:12,976
Right.

1901
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:13,176
Is to

1902
00:55:13,176 --> 00:55:14,711
literal is just explicitly to say

1903
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:15,145
like that

1904
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,946
desires are or the preference

1905
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:19,149
distribution is to have a given C

1906
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:19,883
right or C

1907
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:20,750
is just a matrix

1908
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,419
that defines your preferences, right?

1909
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:24,721
So I mean, it's a lot clearer to do that

1910
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:26,756
than to just

1911
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:28,491
just leave and just plow, right.

1912
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,759
I think that's part of the confusion

1913
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:30,994
it says, is that

1914
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:31,561
it's not clear

1915
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:32,862
where the preference come from,

1916
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:33,997
but there just is just because

1917
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,365
the conditional on this other thing.

1918
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:35,965
See

1919
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,369
and C can be fixed or learned.

1920
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:40,537
But that's the basis

1921
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:42,739
of the calculation there.

1922
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:43,340
Yeah.

1923
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:46,876
Here we get into section four,

1924
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:48,278
variational and expected

1925
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:50,313
free energy considerations

1926
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:52,315
and in large script

1927
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:54,317
we see the variational

1928
00:55:54,317 --> 00:55:57,287
free energy equation.

1929
00:55:57,287 --> 00:56:00,056
Then what is the skydiver doing?

1930
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:02,826
And during the one in the two,

1931
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:03,960
we'll unpack

1932
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,895
more about the exact terms

1933
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:08,098
and and what is coming into

1934
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:09,599
and coming out of this equation.

1935
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:10,266
But just

1936
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:11,234
as an appetizer

1937
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:14,237
here, what's the skydiver doing?

1938
00:56:14,237 --> 00:56:15,939
Well, then I've got the order here.

1939
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:17,173
I just put through that endeavor

1940
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:19,309
because I like the the

1941
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:20,377
I don't think it's a metaphor,

1942
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,612
but the analogy of how

1943
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:23,580
so how do you respond

1944
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,647
when you jump out of the airplane

1945
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:25,048
and, you know,

1946
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,883
your parachute is not to work?

1947
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:27,817
Do you

1948
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:29,119
do you go ahead first

1949
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,154
and really attack it? Or like what now?

1950
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:33,523
What are you doing in terms of

1951
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:35,191
what your expectations are?

1952
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:36,726
So maybe, maybe

1953
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:39,696
that that was a good analogy.

1954
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:40,330
Ryan Maybe.

1955
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:41,464
But what like so what were you

1956
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:42,632
where were you going with that?

1957
00:56:42,632 --> 00:56:45,001
Because yeah.

1958
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:46,202
Well, I mean, I think the point

1959
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:46,870
the point of

1960
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,004
those sorts of examples

1961
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:51,241
are just to just to

1962
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,709
sort to put this to

1963
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:55,345
to show why it's not

1964
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:58,681
it's not really correct

1965
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:02,018
to think about them like prior,

1966
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:03,420
you know, this prior

1967
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,587
preference distribution,

1968
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:05,522
even though it's,

1969
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:05,989
you know,

1970
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:08,024
it's again, it's cast as our belief.

1971
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:09,058
Right.

1972
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:10,794
And it's not really appropriate

1973
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:13,430
to think about that as a as a

1974
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:16,533
a a belief, right?

1975
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:18,001
I mean, a

1976
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:19,402
or an expectation

1977
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:20,003
at a any

1978
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:22,672
at a psychological level description.

1979
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,607
So you can and the way to contrast that.

1980
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:24,974
Right, is

1981
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:25,708
you can say like

1982
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:28,144
like the person in a model

1983
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:30,480
where they don't want

1984
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,415
to fall to the ground and die.

1985
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:32,682
Right.

1986
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:34,017
That would be

1987
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:37,253
the end of that would be the right.

1988
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:38,254
It's your preference

1989
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:39,923
not to have the observation

1990
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:42,192
of hitting the ground and dying,

1991
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:43,092
but where you are.

1992
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:45,228
Right.

1993
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:47,997
Is is your cue about given high, right.

1994
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,699
It's what do I expect to observe

1995
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:51,534
given that I choose this policy versus

1996
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:53,036
that policy. Right.

1997
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:54,270
So that's the that's the,

1998
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:56,039
you know, the belief part. Right.

1999
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:56,739
So what I expect,

2000
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:58,274
given that I do this or that

2001
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:01,377
and how close is that to

2002
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:03,780
how much does that diverge from what I

2003
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:04,814
what I want? Right.

2004
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:05,548
Which for me,

2005
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:07,317
all that's just a

2006
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:07,917
it's just a clear

2007
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:10,253
example of how your your belief,

2008
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:11,888
the expectations that your desire,

2009
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:14,791
the expectations come apart

2010
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:17,293
and and it just doesn't work conceptual

2011
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:17,861
to think one

2012
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:20,463
is think of one as like the same kind of

2013
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:23,933
kind of thing as the other.

2014
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:24,300
Yeah.

2015
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,635
I just saw it as if I'm not

2016
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:27,237
going to get a soft landing.

2017
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:29,706
How big of a crater can I can I create?

2018
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:31,708
Well, that's.

2019
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:32,108
Not that

2020
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:32,775
is going to be packed

2021
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:34,110
into your reference distribution.

2022
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:35,144
Right. Right.

2023
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:37,280
You would have some desire for enough

2024
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:38,381
to make a big,

2025
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:39,315
you know, conditional on

2026
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:41,818
you're going to die. Right.

2027
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:42,318
You know,

2028
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:43,653
you'd prefer

2029
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:44,521
to make a big crater

2030
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,222
than a small crater.

2031
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:46,923
And that would

2032
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:47,957
still just go in your favor.

2033
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:48,992
All right. So.

2034
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:52,262
Yeah, yeah.

2035
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:56,032
Jacob, I was just wondering,

2036
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:59,335
and this might be me

2037
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:03,072
thinking thinking differently

2038
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:04,774
or not too deeply

2039
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:06,643
about the equation, rather.

2040
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:08,645
But in this in this formulation

2041
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:10,380
where it's a variation of free energy

2042
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,883
for each policy, I have pie.

2043
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:14,417
Does that

2044
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:15,318
does that imply

2045
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:16,819
when in the last sentence

2046
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:18,922
on the slide that free energy,

2047
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:20,823
the functional beliefs

2048
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:22,358
and a function of observations.

2049
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:24,527
That doesn't mean that the free energy

2050
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:25,662
is essentially

2051
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:28,031
a function of three variables,

2052
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:31,000
but in this case

2053
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,970
we are only writing it off of PI because

2054
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:37,407
it's always and it's it's clear

2055
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,641
that it's a function of

2056
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:41,611
of beliefs and observations

2057
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:44,647
or should be think of it more as

2058
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:47,650
just a function of

2059
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:49,586
each policy.

2060
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,588
I mean, the way it's written here,

2061
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:52,956
I'm going to think that

2062
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:54,190
straightforward way to think about it is

2063
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:56,726
I mean, it literally just means that

2064
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:57,694
using this equation,

2065
00:59:57,694 --> 00:59:59,762
you will calculate a different value

2066
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,965
for each policy, right?

2067
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:03,900
Mean that's really like you just

2068
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,101
there will be

2069
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,836
you're going to be computing

2070
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:09,272
some some variational free energy value

2071
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,173
for each policy

2072
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:10,974
and that's going to make up

2073
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:13,977
a distribution over policies.

2074
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:16,512
And and I mean, the

2075
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,781
the tricky thing I guess here is,

2076
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,517
is, is that, you know, this isn't about

2077
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,253
this is an F of f apply here

2078
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:26,456
isn't about making decisions. Right.

2079
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,991
This is just about something

2080
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:30,560
like evaluating evidence for,

2081
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,161
you know, for various policies

2082
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:32,962
because you

2083
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:33,496
you can't

2084
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:34,797
you calculate F

2085
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,666
when you already have the observation.

2086
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:37,400
Right.

2087
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,701
So you can't relate to

2088
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:40,003
this prospective decision

2089
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:41,904
making thing with f.

2090
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:42,905
So this is just basically

2091
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:46,009
a way of describing how how underage

2092
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:48,378
policy your beliefs will change

2093
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:51,247
or wouldn't change right under

2094
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:52,582
when you get conditional on each new

2095
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:53,683
observation that you got.

2096
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:57,453
And, and so it's not.

2097
01:00:57,453 --> 01:00:57,820
Yeah.

2098
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,889
So all it denotes really is it's just,

2099
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:00,356
you know,

2100
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:02,091
you have a value of F for each policy

2101
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:04,293
and that makes it a distribution.

2102
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:06,996
And that takes us to

2103
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,265
G expected free energy.

2104
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:12,368
The letter after F

2105
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:14,737
and as shown here not sure

2106
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:15,705
if there's another reason for

2107
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:17,807
why it's G.

2108
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:18,941
This is

2109
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,243
equation 2.6

2110
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:21,177
from the active inference

2111
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:22,745
textbook, just for reference

2112
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:24,313
with some other versions

2113
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:28,885
of how G is framed.

2114
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:33,289
G is a prospective value and they write.

2115
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:33,690
Decision

2116
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,491
making does not only require beliefs

2117
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:37,493
about past and present states,

2118
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:37,927
it also

2119
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:39,362
requires making predictions

2120
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,296
about future states

2121
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:42,065
and future observations.

2122
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:44,167
This requires taking the average i.e.

2123
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,035
expected free energy

2124
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:46,903
g of pi

2125
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:47,970
given anticipated

2126
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:50,073
outcomes under each policy

2127
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:52,575
that one might choose.

2128
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:53,342
And there's

2129
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:55,211
a lot to

2130
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:58,481
say on expected free energy.

2131
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,049
What is just one short note

2132
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,718
that somebody could add

2133
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:06,723
or Ryan, why was it placed here?

2134
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,425
I'm not sure I understand the question.

2135
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:10,860
Like why?

2136
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,595
Why is why is expected

2137
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:13,563
free energy required?

2138
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,198
Why is variational free energy

2139
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:16,466
not enough?

2140
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:18,901
Unexpected for energy is

2141
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:20,136
just as just what the system

2142
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:20,903
is trying to minimize

2143
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,705
when it's selecting policy. Right?

2144
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:24,974
So, I mean, it's just trying to

2145
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:25,742
I mean, in

2146
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:26,943
I mean, this decomposition

2147
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:29,011
right here is often called like the risk

2148
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:30,780
plus ambiguity decomposition.

2149
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:31,214
But

2150
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:33,850
I guess

2151
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:36,018
I like

2152
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:38,221
I think that I think that showing the

2153
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:38,988
the risk

2154
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:41,190
the risk term here provides a

2155
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:43,893
nice lesson for, again,

2156
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:45,161
the separation between beliefs

2157
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:46,963
and desires and active inference because

2158
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:51,334
your your set out

2159
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:53,469
the the term underlined and

2160
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,338
and read them, right.

2161
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:57,874
So the divergence between a given pie

2162
01:02:57,874 --> 01:02:59,609
and zero, right?

2163
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,644
I mean, that's just saying that,

2164
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:04,080
you know, how different

2165
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,114
are the observations

2166
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:05,681
I expect

2167
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:07,683
given that I choose a given policy

2168
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:09,619
and how different

2169
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,687
how how different is that?

2170
01:03:11,687 --> 01:03:12,121
How different

2171
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:14,991
or I expect that to be from my

2172
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:17,493
my preferences or my desires, right?

2173
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:21,898
So the, the closer those are together,

2174
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:25,001
the more the more similar.

2175
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:26,702
I expect the observations

2176
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:28,371
to be under a policy

2177
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:30,339
to my preferred observations,

2178
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:32,041
the smaller that's going to be.

2179
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,609
And so if I'm trying to

2180
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:36,345
select the policy that minimizes

2181
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:37,680
G, right,

2182
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,714
then that means I'm going

2183
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:39,549
to select the policy

2184
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:41,184
that's going to get me as close,

2185
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:42,151
that's going to get me as close

2186
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:42,685
to my preferred

2187
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:44,353
observations as possible. Right?

2188
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:45,188
So literally just

2189
01:03:45,188 --> 01:03:47,123
is that cale divergence literally

2190
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:49,225
just as trying to choose the policy

2191
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:54,397
that brings beliefs closest to desires.

2192
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:55,031
Very nice.

2193
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:59,035
And then what does the blue term mean?

2194
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:00,837
And that's just an entropy term, right?

2195
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,138
So it's just basically saying

2196
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:03,105
that the is

2197
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:04,106
what drives information

2198
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:05,107
seeking or part of what

2199
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:05,842
drives information.

2200
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:08,778
So again, it's just it's just yeah,

2201
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:09,512
basically

2202
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:10,880
the agents just

2203
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,048
driven to choose policies

2204
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:13,182
that also are going to generate

2205
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:15,451
more precise expected

2206
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:17,186
observations, observations

2207
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:18,187
that are going to disambiguate

2208
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:22,124
states more more easily.

2209
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:24,760
Great.

2210
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,329
Here, we'll explore it

2211
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:27,496
more in the dark one.

2212
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:28,664
But there's

2213
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:29,465
a description

2214
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:30,900
of the posterior

2215
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,302
probability distribution over policies

2216
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:36,672
of PI and an expression involving

2217
01:04:36,672 --> 01:04:39,342
the soft max symbol with the sigma.

2218
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,944
We'll return to that later.

2219
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:43,546
But this is just so that we can cover

2220
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:44,780
like the key experiments

2221
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:47,950
and the simulation results today

2222
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:50,253
of this is also one other

2223
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,121
area of formalism

2224
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:54,457
we can explore in the coming discussions

2225
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:55,725
about precision

2226
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:59,395
and the relationship of beta and gamma

2227
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:02,531
and what the convergence towards means.

2228
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:04,300
But we won't go there.

2229
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,268
There is precision

2230
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:09,071
parameter in this model.

2231
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:12,375
Let's go to the dark room problem and

2232
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:16,145
many lines of PDF screen

2233
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:18,180
and ink has been written

2234
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,548
on the dark room

2235
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:23,219
in the active world since perhaps

2236
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:25,454
first at all 2012

2237
01:05:25,454 --> 01:05:28,357
and also outside of active.

2238
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:28,824
And

2239
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:31,260
they write

2240
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,228
in a nutshell,

2241
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:33,129
the concern is

2242
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:33,963
that if agents

2243
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:36,432
only act to minimize prediction error

2244
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:38,301
as opposed to acting

2245
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:39,235
under the impetus

2246
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:41,304
of a cognitive desire like state,

2247
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:44,373
then they ought to simply seek out

2248
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:46,475
very stable, predictable environments

2249
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:51,080
such as a dark room and stay there.

2250
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,581
Would anybody like to add

2251
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:54,917
anything about this dark room problem,

2252
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:56,252
or what is the relationship

2253
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:58,821
between dark, spastic and cognitive

2254
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:07,363
ontology and active?

2255
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:09,065
I mean,

2256
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:09,832
are you just asking

2257
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:12,902
what like what those words mean or what?

2258
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:13,369
Like, I don't know.

2259
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:16,739
How do you how do you use these words?

2260
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:18,808
I mean I mean, it's just a term

2261
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,876
that refers to the leafy,

2262
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:21,277
you know,

2263
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:23,079
like epistemic sorts of things, right?

2264
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:25,715
So so a dark tastic ontology

2265
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:27,216
would be an ontology that includes

2266
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:29,151
leafy things, right?

2267
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:31,020
Whereas, whereas, uh,

2268
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,757
you know, cognitive just refers to Yeah.

2269
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:35,591
Being like targeted

2270
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:36,492
toward something, right?

2271
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:41,130
Like something about desires or,

2272
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:41,430
you know,

2273
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:42,832
something things you want versus

2274
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,066
don't want things you like

2275
01:06:44,066 --> 01:06:45,368
versus don't like. Right?

2276
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:46,035
So

2277
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:49,305
it's just, you know, when we say it's

2278
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:50,573
apparently pure access

2279
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:52,641
to ontologies, you're saying

2280
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:53,576
it might look

2281
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:56,712
as though superficially like the

2282
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:58,647
the ontology

2283
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:00,049
proposed an act active inference

2284
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:01,150
like the things that exist

2285
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:03,252
in active inference are purely belief.

2286
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,589
That's all that means.

2287
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:07,323
Great.

2288
01:07:07,323 --> 01:07:09,291
And it's applied in the setting

2289
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,494
of this dark room

2290
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:13,629
for the following two slides.

2291
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:14,530
Dean,

2292
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:15,865
help us understand

2293
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,967
what concerns are addressed

2294
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:20,169
and what the child

2295
01:07:20,169 --> 01:07:22,371
on the top right of the slides is doing.

2296
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:24,540
Yeah, well,

2297
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,842
so I'm not going to go through all of

2298
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:28,277
all of the text,

2299
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:29,445
but essentially

2300
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:30,679
this was my introduction

2301
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:31,680
to the dark room problem

2302
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,215
because it was kind of the opposite

2303
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,917
of all my experience,

2304
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:36,018
which is that

2305
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:38,554
I tend to find people that were curious

2306
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:41,190
and we're trying to move away from

2307
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:42,324
information

2308
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:45,261
level leveling

2309
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:46,028
off or

2310
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:49,098
or being static to information gain.

2311
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:51,434
So first of all, I had to learn what

2312
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:52,234
but the

2313
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:53,669
what the argument was about

2314
01:07:53,669 --> 01:07:55,171
why people would actually,

2315
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:57,740
you know, who are normally social,

2316
01:07:58,007 --> 01:07:59,442
why they would move away

2317
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:01,143
from that social realm

2318
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:03,412
and into this sort of dark space

2319
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:04,046
under the car,

2320
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:05,848
under the idea that

2321
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:07,650
active inference is actually implies

2322
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:10,486
that's what people would do.

2323
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:11,887
And then secondly was

2324
01:08:11,887 --> 01:08:13,122
I was kind of trying to tie it

2325
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:15,558
into the idea of the refrigerator

2326
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:16,392
and where it is.

2327
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:19,428
And until you actually and Dan,

2328
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:21,063
you and I talked about this a bit,

2329
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:22,698
the pragmatic piece of

2330
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:23,532
till you actually open

2331
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:24,900
the refrigerator door,

2332
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,069
which is on that kind of the next slide,

2333
01:08:27,503 --> 01:08:28,404
you don't really

2334
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:29,505
I mean you can have a belief

2335
01:08:29,505 --> 01:08:29,905
that there's

2336
01:08:29,905 --> 01:08:31,607
something of value in there,

2337
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:32,842
but it can turn out that

2338
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:36,312
when you open the door or Monti raises

2339
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:37,179
the curtain,

2340
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:39,381
the thing that you were expecting

2341
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:40,983
turns out to be a value,

2342
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:42,084
but not necessarily

2343
01:08:42,084 --> 01:08:43,819
of that thing that you were.

2344
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:46,021
You are setting yourself up to believe.

2345
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:50,025
And so that that young individual

2346
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:51,160
spitting the coin out.

2347
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:52,962
And maybe I

2348
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:53,696
guess I was just

2349
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:54,363
trying to be a little bit

2350
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:55,131
facetious there

2351
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:56,832
that it holds value,

2352
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:59,468
but it doesn't hold the same kind of

2353
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:00,603
tasty value

2354
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:00,970
as, say,

2355
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,404
having a lick of an ice cream cone.

2356
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:04,440
So again, it was

2357
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,509
it was trying to move away

2358
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:07,376
from the idea

2359
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:11,647
that the belief is stuff alone is satis

2360
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:14,783
satisfactory or necessary.

2361
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:17,786
I always get those too mixed up, but I.

2362
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:19,922
I was just trying to reinforce the idea

2363
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:21,290
that you kind of need

2364
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:21,790
to have both

2365
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:24,193
so that you can compare and contrast,

2366
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:25,161
so that you get a sense

2367
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,395
of what a person or

2368
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:28,164
what an agent is doing

2369
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:29,131
as they're

2370
01:09:29,131 --> 01:09:30,766
getting past some of those shrouds

2371
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:32,434
or some of those

2372
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:35,337
non observables into the observable

2373
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:38,941
state.

2374
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:39,275
Thanks.

2375
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:44,813
We'll keep going.

2376
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:46,415
This is unpacking

2377
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:47,716
some of the concerns

2378
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:49,251
about the apparent pure

2379
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:50,419
docs Gnostic belief

2380
01:09:50,419 --> 01:09:52,421
oriented ontology of actin.

2381
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:54,623
So Ryan described earlier

2382
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:57,126
like is it about beliefs colliding

2383
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:58,127
and if so,

2384
01:09:58,127 --> 01:09:59,962
if it's purely diagnostic,

2385
01:09:59,962 --> 01:10:03,832
then where is this desire and

2386
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:07,269
is there anything

2387
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:11,407
else that anybody wants to add here?

2388
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:13,209
I would maybe

2389
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,544
comment that I think this also

2390
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,880
relates to your

2391
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:19,748
to the earlier thing

2392
01:10:19,748 --> 01:10:21,817
that was discussed, how

2393
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:23,018
this confusion might stem

2394
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:25,487
from people misinterpreting

2395
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:28,624
or messing

2396
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:29,625
confusing the terms,

2397
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:30,626
predictive processing

2398
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:33,562
and active of inference.

2399
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:34,830
And I feel like this addresses

2400
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:35,864
it as well, where

2401
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:39,668
if we just if it's only beliefs,

2402
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:42,438
then there is obviously a concern

2403
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:44,740
that once we're in a dark room,

2404
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:48,010
we can because

2405
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,113
if we're only in the regime

2406
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:52,381
of predictive processing,

2407
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:54,917
there is no way for us to

2408
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,852
move to a different state

2409
01:10:56,852 --> 01:10:57,920
or there isn't.

2410
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,422
The formalism that that describes

2411
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:03,926
planning an action.

2412
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:06,228
But as

2413
01:11:06,228 --> 01:11:06,562
I guess

2414
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:08,564
we'll get to in the other slides

2415
01:11:08,564 --> 01:11:12,067
when we do include this planning,

2416
01:11:13,135 --> 01:11:14,570
we have,

2417
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:15,170
these are like

2418
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:16,805
terms appearing within

2419
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:21,010
the mathematical formulation as well.

2420
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:23,612
Great.

2421
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:25,047
To be clear.

2422
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:26,115
It's not like they're thrown

2423
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:27,349
in ad hoc, right?

2424
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:28,217
They emerge

2425
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:29,885
naturally as like necessary

2426
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:32,087
components of America,

2427
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:32,454
you know,

2428
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:34,390
like using this sort of framework

2429
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,158
or building it out to involve planning.

2430
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:37,259
So it's not

2431
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:38,427
like they emerge

2432
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:40,863
naturally and necessarily it's not a

2433
01:11:40,863 --> 01:11:41,563
it's not because someone's

2434
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:43,966
just kind of talking them on

2435
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:46,201
great.

2436
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:47,670
And this is referring

2437
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:50,239
to that minimization of G.

2438
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,441
The minimization of G drives

2439
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:54,310
the agent to seek out observations

2440
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,011
that will reduce uncertainty

2441
01:11:56,011 --> 01:11:57,713
about the best way to subsequently

2442
01:11:57,713 --> 01:11:58,514
bring about

2443
01:11:58,514 --> 01:11:59,581
phenotype, congruent

2444
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:01,650
or preferred outcomes.

2445
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:04,953
So that's the information seeking.

2446
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:06,021
Another way to put this

2447
01:12:06,021 --> 01:12:07,723
is that under DNI,

2448
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:09,291
an agent doesn't simply seek

2449
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:11,126
to minimize prediction error

2450
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:11,727
with respect

2451
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:13,729
to its current sensory input.

2452
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:15,130
It seeks instead

2453
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:16,198
to minimize prediction

2454
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:17,700
error with respect to its global

2455
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:19,702
beliefs about the environment,

2456
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:20,469
which entails

2457
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:21,170
seeking out

2458
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,805
observations that are expected

2459
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:24,940
to generate prediction errors

2460
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:26,742
such that uncertainty is minimized

2461
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:28,510
for the generative model as a whole.

2462
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:31,080
And another

2463
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,314
aspect of this

2464
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:33,449
type of global prediction

2465
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:35,317
error minimization process

2466
01:12:35,317 --> 01:12:36,218
is that it pertains

2467
01:12:36,218 --> 01:12:37,419
not only to beliefs

2468
01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:39,121
about states in the present,

2469
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:41,290
but also to beliefs about the past

2470
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:42,991
and in the future.

2471
01:12:42,991 --> 01:12:44,393
And so this is leading

2472
01:12:44,393 --> 01:12:46,528
to one of the claims,

2473
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:47,329
which is that

2474
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:49,264
in addition to desires,

2475
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:51,500
die captures folk

2476
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:52,801
psychological experiences

2477
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:54,002
associated with the drive

2478
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:56,238
to both know about one's current states

2479
01:12:56,772 --> 01:12:57,573
and learn

2480
01:12:57,573 --> 01:12:58,273
what will happen

2481
01:12:58,273 --> 01:13:00,342
when choosing to move to other states,

2482
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:01,543
among other parameters,

2483
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:05,681
in a generative model.

2484
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:07,683
Let's go into this generative model

2485
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:09,084
and come to the darkroom

2486
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:11,286
simulation itself

2487
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,956
and we'll

2488
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:16,959
unpack it more in future times.

2489
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:20,028
But the prior over policies of PI

2490
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:22,865
the right that

2491
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:24,566
when the agent

2492
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:26,568
repeatedly chooses a policy,

2493
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:28,470
this term increases the probability

2494
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:29,271
that the agent

2495
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:30,339
will continue to select

2496
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:32,441
that policy in the future.

2497
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:33,909
At the level of the formalism,

2498
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:34,810
this corresponds

2499
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:36,545
to an agent coming to expect

2500
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:38,280
that it will choose a policy

2501
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,482
simply because it has chosen that policy

2502
01:13:40,482 --> 01:13:42,451
many times in the past.

2503
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:44,186
This can be thought of as a type of

2504
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:45,487
hybridization process,

2505
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:46,255
but it doesn't have

2506
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:47,222
any direct connection

2507
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:48,690
to preferred outcomes

2508
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:49,858
because EFI

2509
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:51,460
Pi is not informed by other beliefs

2510
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:52,895
in the agents model.

2511
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,563
So here's the partially observable

2512
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:55,831
Markov decision process,

2513
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:58,066
just one representation of it,

2514
01:13:58,066 --> 01:13:59,435
and is sort of floating

2515
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:02,171
there, influencing but not being by.

2516
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:05,140
And we had some interesting discussions

2517
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:07,242
which we can return to another time

2518
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:10,179
about how we might be able to assess

2519
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:10,979
whether somebody

2520
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:12,681
is engaging in a behavior

2521
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:15,184
because they simply have habitually

2522
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:17,719
engaged in that behavior.

2523
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:19,922
But they understand the actual mapping

2524
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:23,125
of, how policies

2525
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:26,428
relate to outcomes, or in another case

2526
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:27,796
where somebody might be

2527
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,431
engaging in a behavior

2528
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:32,234
not because of habituation, but rather

2529
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:36,205
because they have some sort of deviation

2530
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:37,372
from the appropriate

2531
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:39,641
mapping between policies and outcomes.

2532
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:41,910
And maybe there's other.

2533
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:43,679
So I thought that was very interesting

2534
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:45,547
how even within the same

2535
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:47,182
sort of sparse

2536
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:49,084
and first principles model

2537
01:14:49,084 --> 01:14:50,953
similar behavioral outcomes

2538
01:14:50,953 --> 01:14:52,654
might be observed

2539
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:55,257
on like a behavioral manifolds and then

2540
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:57,693
different kinds of perturbations

2541
01:14:57,693 --> 01:14:59,061
or evaluations

2542
01:14:59,061 --> 01:14:59,728
might reduce

2543
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:01,763
uncertainty about what is giving rise

2544
01:15:01,763 --> 01:15:03,799
to those conversion behaviors.

2545
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:08,537
In that case.

2546
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:09,805
Okay Dean

2547
01:15:09,805 --> 01:15:11,807
with the ice cream truck and I.

2548
01:15:12,741 --> 01:15:14,042
Know I'm going to I'm going to wait

2549
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:14,977
because I think that's

2550
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:16,645
I think that's one of the

2551
01:15:16,645 --> 01:15:17,446
and the next one

2552
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:17,946
are better

2553
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:22,017
to take up in a12 part because I think

2554
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:25,354
because if Bryan can come back

2555
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,355
there's some good questions

2556
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,490
I want to ask him about those

2557
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:29,224
two sections

2558
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:31,660
because this slide and the next one

2559
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:35,230
are kind of anti dark room.

2560
01:15:35,731 --> 01:15:38,100
And so I want to kind of

2561
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:39,668
pick his brain about what,

2562
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:40,202
you know,

2563
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:40,736
how we can

2564
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:42,771
sort of convince people that that

2565
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:44,540
that dark room problem

2566
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,408
is for such a small subset

2567
01:15:46,408 --> 01:15:47,209
of the population,

2568
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:48,810
that majority of

2569
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:50,946
the stuff that we're talking about here

2570
01:15:50,946 --> 01:15:52,881
is done in in

2571
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:54,082
sort of social settings

2572
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:56,351
and social context and.

2573
01:15:56,351 --> 01:15:58,153
There's a third party

2574
01:15:58,153 --> 01:16:00,055
sometimes you can observe an observer

2575
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:01,924
and what role that plays

2576
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:03,692
in trying to figure out what's

2577
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:05,827
what's going on here as we move from the

2578
01:16:06,628 --> 01:16:09,831
from the idea of decisioning and

2579
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:12,067
and so forth. So I'll wait.

2580
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:12,534
Great.

2581
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:14,803
So here's part one of that

2582
01:16:15,504 --> 01:16:16,605
and here's part

2583
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:19,441
two, looking at social learning theory

2584
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:20,342
a little bit.

2585
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:23,011
But let's go to the figure

2586
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:25,581
and to the simulation.

2587
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:26,481
This is figure

2588
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:28,617
one simulation of an active inference

2589
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:29,985
agent deciding

2590
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:33,055
whether to eat some ice cream and

2591
01:16:36,825 --> 01:16:37,426
there's various

2592
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:39,561
ways to go about describing it.

2593
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:41,463
But one of the key pieces

2594
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:43,098
that anyone can give a remark

2595
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:45,233
about what is occurring

2596
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:46,935
is that there's three cases

2597
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:49,104
that are being compared.

2598
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:51,506
There's a no desire case,

2599
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:56,311
a weak desire reflected by this PFO,

2600
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:58,647
and a strong desire case

2601
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:00,015
where the ratio between

2602
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:02,851
the two alternatives, between

2603
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:04,186
wanting the ice cream

2604
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:06,154
and between the ice cream state

2605
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:07,723
and the no ice cream state

2606
01:17:07,723 --> 01:17:09,524
is a sharper distinction

2607
01:17:09,524 --> 01:17:11,493
in the second row.

2608
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:12,794
So there's a case

2609
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:14,763
in which ice cream is in the fridge,

2610
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:16,898
but where the kitchen is currently dark

2611
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:18,166
and so the agent doesn't know

2612
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:18,900
whether the fridge

2613
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:20,502
is to the left or right.

2614
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:23,305
So it's like a maze set up

2615
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:26,274
with three possible cases,

2616
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,543
one where there's no preference

2617
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:31,413
for observing ice cream or not a weak

2618
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,915
or a strong preference for that.

2619
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:37,019
And then

2620
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:40,222
under these situations, we can ask

2621
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:40,622
about

2622
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:43,158
what happens in terms of the action

2623
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:45,794
as well as the beliefs

2624
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:47,796
and valence updates.

2625
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:49,164
What else would you add about that?

2626
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:52,367
Right.

2627
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:53,502
Well, good point.

2628
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:53,769
You know,

2629
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:56,071
the point of this is just to show

2630
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:58,173
why I guess makes comfortable.

2631
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:00,275
I mean, so Dean mentioned that

2632
01:18:00,776 --> 01:18:02,444
the issue with the dark room, right?

2633
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:04,146
I mean, they said I mean, as you said,

2634
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:05,213
I mean, this is essentially

2635
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:08,183
just a particular very similar to

2636
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,751
to like a tmus

2637
01:18:09,751 --> 01:18:10,185
or atom

2638
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:10,652
and just putting

2639
01:18:10,652 --> 01:18:11,153
and putting

2640
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:11,586
a different sort

2641
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:13,622
of semantics on top of it.

2642
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:17,359
But they but the idea is just that

2643
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,260
it's just

2644
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:20,595
set up to show that,

2645
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:20,929
you know,

2646
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:23,565
even without any kind of desire, right.

2647
01:18:23,565 --> 01:18:26,902
Just just resolving uncertainty,

2648
01:18:26,902 --> 01:18:28,270
the agent will be driven

2649
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:29,971
to leave a dark room or do something

2650
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:31,039
to get rid of the dark room.

2651
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,709
So you don't need a desire.

2652
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:34,142
Right.

2653
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:36,812
But but in fact, any realistic agent

2654
01:18:36,812 --> 01:18:38,613
is also going to have desires.

2655
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:39,815
So.

2656
01:18:40,248 --> 01:18:40,982
So in the case

2657
01:18:40,982 --> 01:18:42,617
where there are desires,

2658
01:18:42,617 --> 01:18:45,220
then there's two different reasons why

2659
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:48,056
no active inference agent will ever

2660
01:18:48,857 --> 01:18:49,758
stay in a dark room

2661
01:18:49,758 --> 01:18:51,426
or be motivated to stay in a dark room.

2662
01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:52,961
Like in all cases,

2663
01:18:52,961 --> 01:18:56,198
it will have a motivation to to leave.

2664
01:18:56,198 --> 01:18:58,366
I mean, the point is just to show, right

2665
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,001
in some explicit simulations

2666
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:02,237
that generically.

2667
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:02,771
Right,

2668
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:04,940
like this kind of dark room problem

2669
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,777
is will it will just never apply

2670
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:11,680
to top of inference.

2671
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,682
Again, this dark room thing only applies

2672
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:14,483
if you assume the thing

2673
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:15,417
is just doing something

2674
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:17,419
like predictive coding,

2675
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:18,086
but then somehow

2676
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:22,991
also assume that it's making decisions.

2677
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:24,159
But that's not active inference

2678
01:19:26,561 --> 01:19:27,095
because it's not a

2679
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:30,999
theory of decision making.

2680
01:19:30,999 --> 01:19:35,270
Awesome.

2681
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:37,405
Here is some description

2682
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:41,276
about the strength of the desire

2683
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:43,912
could have been shown before the figure,

2684
01:19:43,912 --> 01:19:45,313
but we wanted to introduce

2685
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:47,883
the the simulation setting

2686
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:52,487
and as described there is

2687
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:55,590
a desire

2688
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:57,392
as well as an information seeking.

2689
01:19:57,392 --> 01:19:58,627
And I

2690
01:19:58,627 --> 01:19:59,094
believe that's

2691
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:00,362
the two reasons

2692
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:03,331
why the agent will escape dark room.

2693
01:20:03,865 --> 01:20:06,434
And there's there's other escape hatches

2694
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:07,369
depending on how one

2695
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:09,638
constructs their model,

2696
01:20:09,871 --> 01:20:11,940
potentially like a hierarchical model

2697
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:14,309
might have a slightly different

2698
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:15,911
explanation for why an agent does

2699
01:20:15,911 --> 01:20:17,479
or doesn't stay in the room.

2700
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:18,680
But even just within this

2701
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,582
single level model,

2702
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:22,384
there's an information seeking

2703
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:24,052
as well as a preference.

2704
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:27,722
Realizing reason.

2705
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:33,662
Any other comments here?

2706
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,797
Okay, Dean.

2707
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:37,499
Just a quick thing of baby.

2708
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:38,500
Maybe in the island.

2709
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,601
I'll put you in the island.

2710
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:40,202
Go for it.

2711
01:20:40,202 --> 01:20:41,603
Yeah.

2712
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:44,272
So maybe Ryan, just just a just a quick

2713
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:46,708
this last last couple of census,

2714
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:48,243
how our preference distributions

2715
01:20:48,243 --> 01:20:49,511
are set to zero.

2716
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:50,111
Oh, I'm sorry.

2717
01:20:50,111 --> 01:20:51,780
I matched on the previous slide.

2718
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:53,381
Sorry. Can you go back one.

2719
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:54,716
Yeah, go for it.

2720
01:20:54,716 --> 01:20:54,983
Okay.

2721
01:20:54,983 --> 01:20:56,618
So, however, a preference distributions

2722
01:20:56,618 --> 01:20:57,853
are set to zero as an error.

2723
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:59,421
No disaster simulation

2724
01:20:59,421 --> 01:20:59,821
set to the

2725
01:20:59,821 --> 01:21:01,656
no outcome is desired over here

2726
01:21:01,656 --> 01:21:03,425
and active inference agents

2727
01:21:03,425 --> 01:21:04,092
but nonetheless

2728
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:06,361
be driven to choose behaviors

2729
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:07,829
that will maximize information gain.

2730
01:21:07,829 --> 01:21:09,030
Okay, that all makes sense.

2731
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,599
That's just the background.

2732
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:11,800
This is the part I was curious.

2733
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:12,100
Well,

2734
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:13,468
while this might reasonably be

2735
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:15,470
considered a motivational influence,

2736
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:16,738
it is prima

2737
01:21:16,838 --> 01:21:17,806
facie

2738
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:18,773
less plausible

2739
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:21,209
that it should be considered cognitive

2740
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:21,977
and may therefore

2741
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:22,444
be better

2742
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:25,080
seen as a type of dark, sarcastic drive

2743
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:25,847
here.

2744
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:26,514
The formalism

2745
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:27,916
may therefore help us to recover

2746
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:29,885
and potentially new onset

2747
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:30,218
evoke

2748
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:31,586
psychological distinction

2749
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:33,555
between desire, curiosity.

2750
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,323
These types of drives

2751
01:21:35,323 --> 01:21:36,691
seem to differ fundamentally.

2752
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:38,627
I agree with you, but I was wondering,

2753
01:21:38,627 --> 01:21:41,763
if you could maybe explain why that

2754
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:44,299
should be

2755
01:21:44,299 --> 01:21:45,066
something that we

2756
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:46,234
should keep separate

2757
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:48,870
the idea of desire and curiosity

2758
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:50,906
I know you go into explaining it

2759
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:53,775
a little more into the paper, but

2760
01:21:53,775 --> 01:21:55,110
why did you want to point

2761
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:56,945
that out to readers?

2762
01:21:57,212 --> 01:21:57,712
Well, I mean,

2763
01:21:57,712 --> 01:21:58,680
I think there's a couple of things.

2764
01:21:58,680 --> 01:21:59,681
I mean I mean, one,

2765
01:21:59,681 --> 01:22:01,149
I think that these things

2766
01:22:01,149 --> 01:22:02,817
are both driving

2767
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:04,486
decisions about what to do. Right.

2768
01:22:04,486 --> 01:22:05,553
So in some way,

2769
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:06,688
they motivate

2770
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:08,957
they both motivate behavior. Right.

2771
01:22:08,957 --> 01:22:10,959
But but at the same time

2772
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,095
and I think this is something

2773
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:15,730
that Alex Cooper

2774
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:16,865
pointed out when we were writing

2775
01:22:16,865 --> 01:22:18,366
this, as opposed to just, you know,

2776
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:20,035
so it's not just me,

2777
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:21,937
but you pointed out that,

2778
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,805
you know, there is this kind of

2779
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:26,508
fairly clear difference

2780
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:28,710
between the this,

2781
01:22:29,177 --> 01:22:29,444
you know,

2782
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:31,613
curiosity or epistemic driven

2783
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:32,447
sort of behavior

2784
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:34,316
from the

2785
01:22:34,316 --> 01:22:35,550
kind of desire driven behavior

2786
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:36,885
and the the

2787
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:38,186
the kind of clear differences

2788
01:22:38,186 --> 01:22:38,753
is that

2789
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:41,690
this epistemic driven motivation isn't

2790
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:43,391
it isn't driven toward anything. Right.

2791
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:44,859
It doesn't have a target.

2792
01:22:44,859 --> 01:22:46,261
It's not trying to get one thing

2793
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:48,063
versus another

2794
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:50,732
all it's trying to do is just

2795
01:22:51,499 --> 01:22:52,667
mean just become clearer

2796
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:54,903
about what's out there essentially.

2797
01:22:55,403 --> 01:22:55,804
Right.

2798
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:58,239
So the fact that it lacks a target

2799
01:22:58,239 --> 01:22:58,740
is really,

2800
01:22:58,740 --> 01:22:59,641
I think what makes the

2801
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:02,610
what makes the distinction clear.

2802
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:03,778
But I mean, beyond that,

2803
01:23:03,778 --> 01:23:05,547
I think the motivation was just to

2804
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:09,050
was just to show that,

2805
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:10,485
you know, like just,

2806
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:12,187
you know, generically, right?

2807
01:23:12,187 --> 01:23:13,188
Like the belief, desire,

2808
01:23:13,188 --> 01:23:15,457
intention, principle doesn't really

2809
01:23:16,224 --> 01:23:19,060
doesn't really say anything about.

2810
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:21,062
The types of types of desires.

2811
01:23:21,062 --> 01:23:22,063
There's nothing really explicit

2812
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:22,530
interest in that.

2813
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:24,432
Very, very simple

2814
01:23:24,432 --> 01:23:27,736
with way of describing the framework

2815
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:29,871
that separates out

2816
01:23:29,871 --> 01:23:31,439
information seeking from from

2817
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:33,074
rewards again. Right.

2818
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:35,910
So, so

2819
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:38,446
you could write if all you're doing

2820
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,515
is trying to

2821
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:43,318
compare active inference to,

2822
01:23:43,318 --> 01:23:45,620
you know, the video model

2823
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:48,123
very simply stated then

2824
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:49,991
then this is able to kind of nuance

2825
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:51,459
a little more, right?

2826
01:23:51,459 --> 01:23:52,627
Like different,

2827
01:23:52,627 --> 01:23:55,030
different things that that

2828
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:56,431
might look like

2829
01:23:56,431 --> 01:23:57,665
going into motivation,

2830
01:23:57,665 --> 01:23:59,768
all kinds of things.

2831
01:23:59,768 --> 01:24:02,337
But there are separate influences

2832
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:06,274
on why why decisions are made

2833
01:24:06,274 --> 01:24:06,708
for one thing

2834
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:07,442
versus another that

2835
01:24:07,442 --> 01:24:08,443
more kind of tied to beliefs

2836
01:24:08,443 --> 01:24:10,011
in a different way.

2837
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:11,546
That being said,

2838
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:12,414
I mean, at the same time,

2839
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:13,481
I think that,

2840
01:24:13,681 --> 01:24:14,049
you know,

2841
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:17,819
like for psychology more more broadly,

2842
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:18,887
I think I think

2843
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:22,257
very intuitively and naturally does

2844
01:24:22,824 --> 01:24:23,792
recognize the difference

2845
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:26,194
between things like curiosity, right.

2846
01:24:26,194 --> 01:24:27,028
And things like

2847
01:24:27,028 --> 01:24:28,596
and things like reward driven behavior.

2848
01:24:28,596 --> 01:24:28,763
Right.

2849
01:24:28,763 --> 01:24:29,464
Those are concepts

2850
01:24:29,464 --> 01:24:30,899
that we have just in our natural kind

2851
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:32,700
of folk psychology.

2852
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:33,535
Step one

2853
01:24:33,535 --> 01:24:34,803
So act of inference captures

2854
01:24:34,803 --> 01:24:37,172
those, right? I mean, I

2855
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:39,641
talk about this

2856
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:40,108
just as an

2857
01:24:40,108 --> 01:24:42,710
example of how intuitive I think

2858
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:44,279
and like natural

2859
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:45,680
this sort of aspect is,

2860
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,048
you know, and I just think of like

2861
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:48,383
most of the behaviors that say

2862
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:50,785
like my little dog does,

2863
01:24:50,985 --> 01:24:53,021
I look at if I look at what my dog does,

2864
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:55,056
90% of the time,

2865
01:24:55,056 --> 01:24:56,224
it's way more information

2866
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:57,992
seeking than it is reward seeking.

2867
01:24:57,992 --> 01:24:58,693
You know,

2868
01:24:58,693 --> 01:25:00,161
the search is out for some food

2869
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:01,496
a couple of times a day,

2870
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:02,730
but I take her in the car

2871
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:03,665
and she's bolted left

2872
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:05,200
and right to see what's out the window

2873
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,068
and how that changes all the time,

2874
01:25:07,068 --> 01:25:08,903
you know, any little sound perks up

2875
01:25:08,903 --> 01:25:09,471
looks right.

2876
01:25:09,471 --> 01:25:11,206
None of those things are reward driven.

2877
01:25:11,206 --> 01:25:13,708
They're all just information seeking.

2878
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:16,311
So, I mean, very, very

2879
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:17,879
clearly, that's a big part of

2880
01:25:18,847 --> 01:25:20,181
what drives

2881
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:22,417
us and other animals to do so.

2882
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:23,251
So the point is just

2883
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:23,985
just to kind of show

2884
01:25:23,985 --> 01:25:25,854
that active inference captures that.

2885
01:25:25,854 --> 01:25:26,921
And in a certain sense,

2886
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:29,057
it adds some granularity to

2887
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:30,859
to at least what the video model says.

2888
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:32,127
But but in that case,

2889
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:33,228
the video model is kind of

2890
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:34,796
to a two horse grain.

2891
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:35,163
And I think

2892
01:25:35,163 --> 01:25:36,030
normal folks, psychology

2893
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:39,267
doesn't include those things already.

2894
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:39,901
Great

2895
01:25:42,504 --> 01:25:45,740
all sorts of to be returned to Dean.

2896
01:25:45,907 --> 01:25:47,308
Yeah because

2897
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:48,910
Brian just basically answered it all

2898
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:50,411
these two images are basically doing

2899
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:51,112
is separating

2900
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:51,813
after

2901
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:52,547
the sort of goal

2902
01:25:52,547 --> 01:25:55,950
directed from the curiosity which is,

2903
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:57,318
you know,

2904
01:25:57,318 --> 01:25:58,686
the image on the right

2905
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:00,588
is basically a documentary

2906
01:26:00,588 --> 01:26:01,923
about Franklin expedition

2907
01:26:01,923 --> 01:26:02,724
where

2908
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:03,725
they were

2909
01:26:03,725 --> 01:26:05,193
going out to the event horizon,

2910
01:26:05,193 --> 01:26:06,694
but they never returned.

2911
01:26:06,694 --> 01:26:08,763
So did they have a goal?

2912
01:26:08,763 --> 01:26:09,964
Probably.

2913
01:26:09,964 --> 01:26:11,699
Was that their curiosity

2914
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:12,433
being carried out?

2915
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:14,269
I think we

2916
01:26:14,269 --> 01:26:15,003
I think we

2917
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:16,104
got to be able to make sure

2918
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:17,438
that we appreciate both.

2919
01:26:17,438 --> 01:26:20,108
So that's all I wanted.

2920
01:26:20,108 --> 01:26:23,745
The this makes me think like,

2921
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:24,846
are you driven

2922
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:27,615
to watch the sunset over the horizon

2923
01:26:28,249 --> 01:26:29,784
or are you driven to find out

2924
01:26:29,784 --> 01:26:31,553
what's at the end of the rainbow

2925
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:33,721
and what's over the horizon?

2926
01:26:33,721 --> 01:26:35,823
And that's the sort of like infinite

2927
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:36,691
open ended

2928
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:38,326
curiosity drive

2929
01:26:38,326 --> 01:26:41,796
beyond the horizon versus the preferred

2930
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:43,298
specific state

2931
01:26:43,298 --> 01:26:46,501
that one can desire in terms of their

2932
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:48,303
observations

2933
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:50,438
and reduce the divergence there.

2934
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:53,441
But hope

2935
01:26:54,943 --> 01:26:57,145
wishful thinking will come back soon.

2936
01:26:57,612 --> 01:27:01,583
We're just leaving notes so that we can

2937
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:03,551
have more to discuss later

2938
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:05,720
because these are all like

2939
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:08,523
there's such vital threads.

2940
01:27:08,523 --> 01:27:11,793
Ryan and Maxwell and Alex, because the

2941
01:27:12,994 --> 01:27:16,197
touch to our day to day experience

2942
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:17,432
in a way that

2943
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:20,201
few other

2944
01:27:20,368 --> 01:27:22,270
frameworks and even papers

2945
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:23,638
within active do

2946
01:27:23,638 --> 01:27:25,206
so affect

2947
01:27:25,206 --> 01:27:27,242
and the role of affect and precision

2948
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:28,142
and curiosity.

2949
01:27:28,142 --> 01:27:30,545
These are all just like

2950
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:36,217
terms that touch humans.

2951
01:27:36,217 --> 01:27:37,552
One thing that I you know,

2952
01:27:37,552 --> 01:27:39,220
that I think is probably worth

2953
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:40,321
just touching on a minute ago

2954
01:27:40,321 --> 01:27:40,888
something maybe

2955
01:27:40,888 --> 01:27:41,289
you guys would

2956
01:27:41,289 --> 01:27:42,624
want to talk about in the future.

2957
01:27:42,624 --> 01:27:44,092
You know, maybe when I'm not around

2958
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:44,959
and the other

2959
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:46,294
any other sections, but sure.

2960
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:48,363
But you know,

2961
01:27:48,363 --> 01:27:50,565
so there is a probably a distinction

2962
01:27:50,565 --> 01:27:50,898
that's worth

2963
01:27:50,898 --> 01:27:53,768
keeping in mind between curiosity

2964
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:56,638
and and goal directed information.

2965
01:27:56,638 --> 01:27:58,239
I think some of the examples

2966
01:27:58,239 --> 01:27:59,007
you guys have mentioned

2967
01:27:59,007 --> 01:27:59,774
have been more kind of

2968
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:01,576
along the lines of one versus the other.

2969
01:28:01,576 --> 01:28:02,577
So I think it might be good

2970
01:28:02,577 --> 01:28:02,910
to just

2971
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:04,512
just keep that distinction clear

2972
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:06,047
that, you know,

2973
01:28:06,047 --> 01:28:08,483
and and vanilla active inference

2974
01:28:09,183 --> 01:28:09,951
is really something more

2975
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:11,252
just kind of like curiosity,

2976
01:28:11,252 --> 01:28:13,021
just kind of like independently driven,

2977
01:28:13,021 --> 01:28:14,022
this kind of

2978
01:28:14,188 --> 01:28:14,889
look where you're going

2979
01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:16,024
to gain the most information.

2980
01:28:17,058 --> 01:28:17,892
Whereas, you know,

2981
01:28:17,892 --> 01:28:19,961
the construct of directed exploration

2982
01:28:21,496 --> 01:28:23,431
and reinforcement learning and,

2983
01:28:23,431 --> 01:28:25,700
and what also, you know, often

2984
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:26,601
something that can emerge,

2985
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:27,135
I think, a little more

2986
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:27,735
clearly in like

2987
01:28:27,735 --> 01:28:30,271
sophisticated active inference

2988
01:28:30,271 --> 01:28:32,106
is, you know, is information

2989
01:28:32,106 --> 01:28:33,308
seeking specifically

2990
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:35,543
or in the service of knowing

2991
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:37,845
how to get your whole

2992
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:41,015
the curiosity aversion

2993
01:28:41,015 --> 01:28:42,650
that we're showing here.

2994
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:45,186
It has the effect of helping the agent

2995
01:28:45,186 --> 01:28:46,821
get what it wants.

2996
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:49,123
But but the drive to seek out

2997
01:28:49,123 --> 01:28:51,125
information isn't actually itself

2998
01:28:52,293 --> 01:28:53,895
due to the fact that the agent thinks

2999
01:28:53,895 --> 01:28:56,130
it will help it get in school.

3000
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:57,332
It's just going to seek

3001
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:59,834
the information independent.

3002
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:04,839
Whereas whereas in in other yeah.

3003
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:07,475
Like sophisticated inference

3004
01:29:07,475 --> 01:29:09,277
they the agent is actually

3005
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:10,511
doing something more like

3006
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:11,813
I'm going to look over here

3007
01:29:11,813 --> 01:29:13,481
because I think looking over here

3008
01:29:13,481 --> 01:29:15,049
is actually going to help me

3009
01:29:15,049 --> 01:29:17,352
get to what I want better. Right.

3010
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:18,519
So this is kind of strategic

3011
01:29:18,519 --> 01:29:19,387
information seeking

3012
01:29:19,387 --> 01:29:19,721
and that's

3013
01:29:19,721 --> 01:29:20,555
that's a little different

3014
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:22,757
than just like intrinsic curiosity.

3015
01:29:22,757 --> 01:29:25,259
So it's just something to keep clear.

3016
01:29:25,259 --> 01:29:26,661
That's quite interesting.

3017
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:29,597
It kind of ties the brain back.

3018
01:29:31,299 --> 01:29:34,435
But let's explore that later

3019
01:29:34,435 --> 01:29:35,336
here.

3020
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:38,039
We have a nice, clean

3021
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:38,840
representation

3022
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:41,242
of the summary of the main arguments

3023
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:42,577
there.

3024
01:29:42,577 --> 01:29:43,544
Proposed solution

3025
01:29:43,544 --> 01:29:45,446
is somewhat deflationary

3026
01:29:45,446 --> 01:29:46,047
in the sense

3027
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:46,314
that it

3028
01:29:46,314 --> 01:29:47,281
simply argues

3029
01:29:47,281 --> 01:29:49,317
that the functional role of desire,

3030
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:52,320
not the experience of desire,

3031
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,555
is straightforward, straightforwardly,

3032
01:29:54,555 --> 01:29:56,657
present in the formalism

3033
01:29:57,091 --> 01:29:58,860
and then in more detail.

3034
01:29:58,860 --> 01:29:59,660
They argue that

3035
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:01,195
and they provide four points,

3036
01:30:01,195 --> 01:30:02,029
which it'll be great

3037
01:30:02,029 --> 01:30:05,066
to go over with with the authors

3038
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:06,934
based on those considerations,

3039
01:30:06,934 --> 01:30:08,102
the apparent problem

3040
01:30:08,102 --> 01:30:09,971
posed by purely dark, sarcastic

3041
01:30:09,971 --> 01:30:11,272
looking constructs

3042
01:30:11,272 --> 01:30:14,175
is simply not a problem.

3043
01:30:14,175 --> 01:30:16,144
There are beliefs and desires

3044
01:30:16,144 --> 01:30:22,950
in the active inference framework.

3045
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:24,485
Perhaps we could have

3046
01:30:24,485 --> 01:30:26,320
explored this more with the formalism,

3047
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:29,957
so we'll bring it up to talking about S,

3048
01:30:30,992 --> 01:30:32,894
but I won't go into it now.

3049
01:30:32,894 --> 01:30:35,563
We'll return to the letters later

3050
01:30:35,563 --> 01:30:37,899
and then the appendix is

3051
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:39,901
very informative

3052
01:30:39,901 --> 01:30:42,904
there's a description of all the states

3053
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:44,338
and the factors

3054
01:30:44,338 --> 01:30:46,607
that are used in the simulation

3055
01:30:47,308 --> 01:30:49,010
and in the model stream.

3056
01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:51,212
One, which is, by the way, Ryan, it's

3057
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:53,915
our most popular

3058
01:30:53,915 --> 01:30:56,017
series was Model Stream one.

3059
01:30:56,717 --> 01:31:00,455
It was it was a is a fan favorite, but

3060
01:31:01,889 --> 01:31:02,723
it's some

3061
01:31:02,723 --> 01:31:05,760
similar concepts and MATLAB script.

3062
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,629
So the appendix describes how the Fig.

3063
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:10,665
one results were generated

3064
01:31:11,065 --> 01:31:12,600
and maybe we'll see

3065
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:15,169
if anybody can run that and execute it.

3066
01:31:15,169 --> 01:31:16,904
We can play with a few different things

3067
01:31:16,904 --> 01:31:18,940
and take some of these

3068
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:21,075
qualitative linguistics

3069
01:31:21,242 --> 01:31:23,911
and even mutate the simulation

3070
01:31:23,911 --> 01:31:24,345
a little bit.

3071
01:31:24,345 --> 01:31:26,747
See where that takes us.

3072
01:31:27,248 --> 01:31:27,915
We'll close out

3073
01:31:27,915 --> 01:31:29,984
with our usual closing slide.

3074
01:31:31,352 --> 01:31:34,155
So who would like to take the first

3075
01:31:34,155 --> 01:31:39,660
last word?

3076
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:41,863
Yes, Dean, then young Ryan.

3077
01:31:42,029 --> 01:31:45,266
First of all, thanks for shepherding us

3078
01:31:45,533 --> 01:31:48,402
these three cats, this paper,

3079
01:31:48,402 --> 01:31:49,804
because there's an awful lot of stuff

3080
01:31:49,804 --> 01:31:51,606
to try to cover in a

3081
01:31:51,606 --> 01:31:52,673
pretty short period of time.

3082
01:31:52,673 --> 01:31:54,242
And it was and it's easy,

3083
01:31:54,242 --> 01:31:54,976
I think, to

3084
01:31:54,976 --> 01:31:56,644
sort of go,

3085
01:31:56,644 --> 01:31:57,211
I don't want to say

3086
01:31:57,211 --> 01:31:57,845
tangentially,

3087
01:31:57,845 --> 01:31:59,747
but go deeper into some of the

3088
01:31:59,747 --> 01:32:01,215
parts of the paper, because

3089
01:32:02,783 --> 01:32:03,751
for me, it was one of those

3090
01:32:03,751 --> 01:32:05,253
ones where I would go back

3091
01:32:05,253 --> 01:32:07,455
and have to reflect on something

3092
01:32:07,455 --> 01:32:09,123
after I read a section

3093
01:32:09,123 --> 01:32:10,224
and then try to

3094
01:32:10,224 --> 01:32:11,792
fit it into the larger picture.

3095
01:32:11,792 --> 01:32:13,494
There was Ryan.

3096
01:32:13,494 --> 01:32:14,795
I think the paper

3097
01:32:14,795 --> 01:32:16,030
did a very good of sort

3098
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:17,331
of ordering through

3099
01:32:17,331 --> 01:32:18,799
what you were trying to say

3100
01:32:18,799 --> 01:32:19,267
in terms

3101
01:32:19,267 --> 01:32:20,535
of the reassurance

3102
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:23,004
of how the the quantitative

3103
01:32:23,938 --> 01:32:24,605
and the

3104
01:32:24,605 --> 01:32:27,208
and the modeling, the psychosocial

3105
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:29,877
could be seen as working

3106
01:32:29,977 --> 01:32:30,778
with each other,

3107
01:32:30,778 --> 01:32:32,113
as opposed to though

3108
01:32:32,113 --> 01:32:33,514
this doesn't answer

3109
01:32:33,514 --> 01:32:35,917
what this other thing questions,

3110
01:32:35,917 --> 01:32:37,018
but it does

3111
01:32:37,018 --> 01:32:37,418
this is

3112
01:32:37,418 --> 01:32:38,953
this was a paper that for me,

3113
01:32:38,953 --> 01:32:40,087
I won't speak for the others,

3114
01:32:40,087 --> 01:32:42,123
but I had to read the section

3115
01:32:42,123 --> 01:32:42,390
and then

3116
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:43,190
try to

3117
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:45,726
plug it back into the overall narrative

3118
01:32:45,726 --> 01:32:47,328
that was being told.

3119
01:32:47,328 --> 01:32:47,728
And again,

3120
01:32:47,728 --> 01:32:49,530
I think part of that is because

3121
01:32:49,530 --> 01:32:53,401
that the translation from the stuff

3122
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:54,669
that's typically

3123
01:32:54,669 --> 01:32:56,037
seen as

3124
01:32:56,037 --> 01:32:57,705
the quantitative part

3125
01:32:57,705 --> 01:33:00,007
is hard to move into.

3126
01:33:00,007 --> 01:33:01,709
The qualitative part,

3127
01:33:01,709 --> 01:33:03,477
I think that's that's a challenge

3128
01:33:03,477 --> 01:33:04,078
for anybody

3129
01:33:04,078 --> 01:33:05,846
that tries to move back

3130
01:33:05,846 --> 01:33:08,583
and forth between those two things. But

3131
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:12,019
yeah, I mean, in terms of,

3132
01:33:12,453 --> 01:33:14,522
in terms of making a case and,

3133
01:33:14,522 --> 01:33:16,591
and providing what I think

3134
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:17,625
people need to sort of

3135
01:33:17,625 --> 01:33:20,394
see the two in the same light.

3136
01:33:20,394 --> 01:33:20,962
Thank you.

3137
01:33:20,962 --> 01:33:22,330
Appreciate it.

3138
01:33:22,863 --> 01:33:23,998
Sure. I'm in happy.

3139
01:33:23,998 --> 01:33:26,334
Happy if it's helpful.

3140
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:26,901
Okay.

3141
01:33:28,135 --> 01:33:30,805
Yeah, I think in

3142
01:33:33,107 --> 01:33:34,609
I guess there are two points

3143
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:36,611
that I like to touch on.

3144
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:37,712
Firstly,

3145
01:33:37,712 --> 01:33:40,881
I think I thought it was very helpful to

3146
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:45,152
map this for these concepts

3147
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:47,822
that everyone, even though everyone

3148
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:51,659
I guess that's the nature of psychology

3149
01:33:51,659 --> 01:33:54,462
that everyone have a slightly,

3150
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:57,331
slightly different probably distribution

3151
01:33:57,698 --> 01:34:00,601
of what they these terms actually mean.

3152
01:34:00,868 --> 01:34:03,571
But I think it's in just learning

3153
01:34:03,738 --> 01:34:05,806
about active inference, it's helpful

3154
01:34:06,173 --> 01:34:07,174
to link

3155
01:34:07,174 --> 01:34:09,644
the math and mathematical formulation

3156
01:34:09,877 --> 01:34:11,245
and even just

3157
01:34:11,245 --> 01:34:12,780
the active inference ontology,

3158
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:15,850
which itself can be very cumbersome

3159
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:16,584
at times

3160
01:34:16,584 --> 01:34:22,089
to these very intuitive concepts and.

3161
01:34:22,089 --> 01:34:24,125
I think as we get

3162
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:26,794
we're starting to explore modeling

3163
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:29,430
within the accident flap as well.

3164
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:30,798
I think it's

3165
01:34:30,798 --> 01:34:33,367
it will be really helpful to use

3166
01:34:33,801 --> 01:34:36,570
this asymmetric prism between

3167
01:34:36,570 --> 01:34:39,173
active inference and folk psychology

3168
01:34:39,473 --> 01:34:41,175
to explain

3169
01:34:41,175 --> 01:34:43,010
the behavior of agents

3170
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:44,378
within these models

3171
01:34:44,378 --> 01:34:48,082
and not beyond in our group problem.

3172
01:34:48,115 --> 01:34:50,851
And there is some unexpected behavior

3173
01:34:51,152 --> 01:34:53,621
of an agent we can directly look at.

3174
01:34:53,954 --> 01:34:55,456
Okay, how how did

3175
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:58,192
this tensor

3176
01:34:58,192 --> 01:35:01,562
change its values and?

3177
01:35:01,562 --> 01:35:04,632
Describe it with this

3178
01:35:04,632 --> 01:35:07,068
looks like a psychological ontology.

3179
01:35:07,368 --> 01:35:09,904
So I think personally that's

3180
01:35:11,072 --> 01:35:13,040
the most exciting thing about this

3181
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:16,210
paper coming.

3182
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:16,877
Yeah.

3183
01:35:17,411 --> 01:35:18,579
Here I mean, if,

3184
01:35:18,579 --> 01:35:19,180
I mean if that's

3185
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:20,281
the kind of thing that you're interested

3186
01:35:20,281 --> 01:35:22,149
in, then I mean, that's

3187
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:23,584
kind of the whole

3188
01:35:23,617 --> 01:35:25,186
it's kind of all motivation

3189
01:35:25,186 --> 01:35:25,953
of inferences

3190
01:35:25,953 --> 01:35:27,888
like computational psychiatry, right?

3191
01:35:27,888 --> 01:35:29,957
Which is like the area that I work on.

3192
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:32,426
You you take, for instance,

3193
01:35:32,426 --> 01:35:34,128
clinical populations

3194
01:35:34,128 --> 01:35:35,996
where people may behave in unexpected

3195
01:35:35,996 --> 01:35:36,630
or ways

3196
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:38,265
or ways that don't necessarily seem

3197
01:35:38,265 --> 01:35:40,134
like they're all that adaptive. Right?

3198
01:35:40,134 --> 01:35:41,335
And you can just fit these models

3199
01:35:41,335 --> 01:35:42,103
to their behavior

3200
01:35:42,103 --> 01:35:43,437
and you can figure out, okay, well,

3201
01:35:43,437 --> 01:35:44,638
what is making their behavior

3202
01:35:44,638 --> 01:35:45,539
abnormal, right?

3203
01:35:45,539 --> 01:35:46,307
Is it

3204
01:35:46,307 --> 01:35:46,607
is it

3205
01:35:46,607 --> 01:35:48,042
something about an overly precise

3206
01:35:48,042 --> 01:35:49,510
preference distribution or is

3207
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:50,411
it something about,

3208
01:35:51,545 --> 01:35:52,680
you know,

3209
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:53,247
the belief

3210
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:55,716
that states states transition to

3211
01:35:56,450 --> 01:35:59,220
to into volatile or uncertain way

3212
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:00,354
or things like that.

3213
01:36:00,354 --> 01:36:02,456
So, I mean, it is the yeah,

3214
01:36:02,456 --> 01:36:03,657
I mean, the kind of

3215
01:36:03,657 --> 01:36:03,991
you know,

3216
01:36:03,991 --> 01:36:04,658
the major point is

3217
01:36:04,658 --> 01:36:05,459
you can use these models

3218
01:36:05,459 --> 01:36:06,227
in empirical studies

3219
01:36:06,227 --> 01:36:07,628
to figure out what the mechanisms are

3220
01:36:07,628 --> 01:36:08,529
that are leading to healthy

3221
01:36:08,529 --> 01:36:10,564
and unhealthy behavior

3222
01:36:10,831 --> 01:36:11,732
and

3223
01:36:13,901 --> 01:36:14,802
that can

3224
01:36:15,169 --> 01:36:15,536
give you

3225
01:36:15,536 --> 01:36:17,838
kind of guiding information toward

3226
01:36:17,838 --> 01:36:19,440
better treatments or,

3227
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:19,740
you know,

3228
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:21,008
trying to measure these things

3229
01:36:21,008 --> 01:36:21,742
in a more quantitative

3230
01:36:21,742 --> 01:36:22,777
way, things like that.

3231
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:25,112
And and the

3232
01:36:25,112 --> 01:36:25,379
you know,

3233
01:36:25,379 --> 01:36:26,447
and just as I said,

3234
01:36:26,447 --> 01:36:28,983
I mean, this is all using

3235
01:36:29,550 --> 01:36:32,253
using tasks that, you know, that involve

3236
01:36:32,386 --> 01:36:34,155
some kind of goal, right?

3237
01:36:34,155 --> 01:36:34,855
Like seeking

3238
01:36:34,855 --> 01:36:37,424
some kind of reward or official approval

3239
01:36:37,424 --> 01:36:40,661
or whatever it is that humans seek out.

3240
01:36:40,661 --> 01:36:42,263
You could do that, right?

3241
01:36:42,263 --> 01:36:43,197
Unless you have

3242
01:36:43,197 --> 01:36:44,698
a straightforward way to map

3243
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:46,734
the formalism,

3244
01:36:46,734 --> 01:36:49,003
each element of the formalism to,

3245
01:36:49,003 --> 01:36:50,237
you know, the reason

3246
01:36:50,237 --> 01:36:51,772
that we think people

3247
01:36:51,772 --> 01:36:53,174
behave in the way that they do.

3248
01:36:53,174 --> 01:36:54,975
Right. So, so on.

3249
01:36:54,975 --> 01:36:56,277
So I guess I'm just saying this,

3250
01:36:56,277 --> 01:36:57,545
if that's an interest of yours,

3251
01:36:57,545 --> 01:36:59,079
then I would think that you would.

3252
01:36:59,079 --> 01:37:00,614
You're probably a fan of a lot of that.

3253
01:37:00,614 --> 01:37:01,549
A lot of the computational

3254
01:37:01,549 --> 01:37:03,284
psychiatry literature more broadly,

3255
01:37:03,284 --> 01:37:05,419
both of the active inference part,

3256
01:37:05,419 --> 01:37:07,221
which is a lot of what my lab does, but

3257
01:37:07,221 --> 01:37:09,256
but also just the broader

3258
01:37:09,256 --> 01:37:10,591
computational psychiatry community

3259
01:37:10,591 --> 01:37:11,492
that uses reinforcement

3260
01:37:11,492 --> 01:37:12,960
learning and replication models

3261
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,361
and all the other programs

3262
01:37:14,361 --> 01:37:15,896
and all the other classics

3263
01:37:15,896 --> 01:37:16,897
that are out there.

3264
01:37:18,032 --> 01:37:18,666
Cool.

3265
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:21,569
And it opens it up, what

3266
01:37:22,269 --> 01:37:24,672
organizations want and what the cells

3267
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:26,640
want and all these other

3268
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:30,010
trans positions.

3269
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:31,712
Well, Ryan, really appreciate

3270
01:37:31,712 --> 01:37:33,614
that last minute

3271
01:37:35,649 --> 01:37:37,618
belief or desire,

3272
01:37:37,618 --> 01:37:40,321
combination thereof to join us.

3273
01:37:40,788 --> 01:37:42,523
Certainly help

3274
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:44,158
resolve our uncertainty a lot

3275
01:37:44,158 --> 01:37:46,627
And it's a great conversation.

3276
01:37:46,627 --> 01:37:47,928
In the coming two weeks,

3277
01:37:47,928 --> 01:37:49,129
we're going to be

3278
01:37:49,129 --> 01:37:51,232
with hopefully some more authors

3279
01:37:51,565 --> 01:37:54,368
and more lab participants and just

3280
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:56,670
I'm looking forward

3281
01:37:56,670 --> 01:37:58,472
to taking some notes.

3282
01:37:59,607 --> 01:38:00,241
Thank you.

3283
01:38:00,241 --> 01:38:01,742
See you all soon.

3284
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:27,735
By.
