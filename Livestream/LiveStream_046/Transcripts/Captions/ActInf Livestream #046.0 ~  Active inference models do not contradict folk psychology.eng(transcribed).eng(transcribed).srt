00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,840
all right

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,560
hello and welcome everyone

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,400
it's ActInfLab Livestream number 46.0

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,279
and

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,480
it's June 10th 2022.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,800
welcome to the active lab everyone we're

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,199
a participatory online lab that is

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,199
communicating learning and practicing

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,600
applied active inference you can find us

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,680
at links here on the slide

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,680
this is a recorded in an archived live

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,360
stream so please provide us with

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,399
feedback so we can improve our work

16
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,160
all backgrounds and perspectives are

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,160
welcome and we'll be following video

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,559
etiquette for live streams

19
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,039
head over to activeinference.org if you

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,280
want to learn more about live streams at

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,360
the lab or other projects that are

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,360
ongoing

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,600
all right we are here in the first

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,160
discussion the dot zero for background

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,159
and context in stream number 46.0

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,119
we are learning and discussing the paper

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,720
active inference models do not

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,320
contradict folk psychology by ryan smith

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,280
maxwell ramstead and alex kiefer

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,280
and the video just like all the videos

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,600
are is an introduction and a

32
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,479
contextualizer and an appetizer for some

33
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,360
of these ideas it's not a review or a

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,640
final word

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,560
we're going to say hi and give

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,840
introductions

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,560
then we'll be covering the roadmap and

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,960
abstract claims and aims and then we'll

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,799
head through some of the core sections

40
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,520
of the paper and just get some of the

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,159
key arguments down and during the dot

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,159
one and the dot two in the coming two

43
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,280
weeks we'll have uh open space for

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,040
asking a lot of questions for those who

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,600
wanna participate live and ask questions

46
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,640
as well

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,600
so

48
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,200
on we go

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,920
we'll start just by introducing ourself

50
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,159
as much or as little as we'd like and if

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,920
we want to mentioning something that

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,799
we're excited about in the paper like

53
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,679
what brought us to want to contribute to

54
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,440
this dot zero

55
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,760
and all start i'm Daniel i'm a

56
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,599
researcher in california and i think the

57
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,440
title says it all though there's still

58
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,360
more to add and it speaks to many of the

59
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,560
hottest

60
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,560
and brightest debates in active

61
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,920
inference which is

62
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,480
the rubber hitting the road with mind

63
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,360
and brain and body and psychology and

64
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,680
previous and different conceptions

65
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,800
i'll pass it to Dean

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,400
thanks Daniel. I'm Dean. I'm up here in

67
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,440
calgary

68
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,640
um

69
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,480
i think well a couple of things first of

70
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,760
all one of the first active

71
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,680
infrastructure that i was on

72
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,000
was a paper that ryan had written and so

73
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,760
i was kind of impressed with that paper

74
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,560
and i knew that if i sort of invested

75
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,640
some time in this one

76
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,239
stuff that i would

77
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,159
become

78
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,920
previous and

79
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,319
the primary thing i came where i was was

80
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,360
looking at

81
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,040
active inference from the decisioning

82
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,560
and uh

83
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,879
and the movement standpoint

84
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,920
sort of

85
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,560
seeing that's uh

86
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,680
looked at from

87
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,239
a higher order and the lower order type

88
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,239
of um processings

89
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,239
and that when i bought the time i got

90
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,599
the end of the paper and started looking

91
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,280
at the mind's world

92
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,840
and world's mind piece and and and

93
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,599
seeing where the

94
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,720
the potential connectors were between

95
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,959
sort of coming into it not

96
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,400
necessarily knowing that there would be

97
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,720
different things of active inference

98
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,239
much like i didn't realize there was an

99
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,400
extended active inference until i read

100
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,480
axel constance paper that was kind of

101
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,000
helpful and i'll pass it to jacob

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,200
hi everyone i'm jakob i'm a student from

103
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,640
the czech republic

104
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,599
and

105
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,560
i'm

106
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,000
excited to

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,040
uh

108
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,879
reduce my uncertainty about the

109
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,680
new

110
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,000
kind of formulation that that

111
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,319
um was introduced in this paper at least

112
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,799
it was the first time i came across it

113
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,760
in the active inference literature um as

114
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,680
you mentioned dean about the

115
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,798
different higher order and

116
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,040
lower order descriptions and how they

117
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,399
conceptually

118
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,358
map

119
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,320
um

120
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,639
to the different mathematical

121
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,040
mathematical formulation and also

122
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,759
to

123
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,040
the

124
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,280
psychological ontology

125
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,639
and

126
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,320
um

127
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,199
overall just discuss uh

128
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,240
what that what that means and um what it

129
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,000
might mean for um other applications as

130
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,120
well

131
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,919
and

132
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,360
i'll pass on to ryan

133
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,680
i'm yeah thanks so i'm i'm ryan smith

134
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,320
i'm a research associate professor at

135
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,160
the uh laureate institute for brain

136
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,199
research

137
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,520
um you know so i'm the

138
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,240
first author of this uh this paper so

139
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,919
you know obviously i was especially

140
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,280
excited about the ideas to write about

141
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,000
it

142
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,240
um or sufficiently motivated at least to

143
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,479
try to clarify some things that i am you

144
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,919
know from my perspective or sort of

145
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,320
common misconceptions um

146
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,880
so um yeah i mean you know i'm i'm

147
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,000
probably more gonna sit in the

148
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,600
background here i'll just be here to uh

149
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,960
you know answer questions or clarify

150
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,800
anything um you know if something comes

151
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
up where um something in the paper

152
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,479
wasn't uh wasn't sufficiently clear

153
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,919
because i didn't i didn't do my job well

154
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,800
enough so um yeah so i appreciate you

155
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,720
guys being with us willing to uh to talk

156
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,080
about it

157
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,560
thanks well an overall comment was we

158
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,560
really appreciate the clarity of the

159
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,120
argument and the writing and the weaving

160
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,880
together of the the math and the

161
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,039
formalisms with the argument the

162
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,440
rhetoric and the ontology that's

163
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,479
that's

164
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,800
prime time so we'll just jump right in

165
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,199
and of course anyone is welcome to share

166
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,320
their comments

167
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,800
so dean would you like to help us

168
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,840
contextualize with a big question

169
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,319
yeah so i think that there's

170
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,000
some questions surrounding and i'm just

171
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,360
going to take some of the important

172
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,479
quotes that i

173
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,080
i lifted from the paper the concern that

174
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,840
active infants

175
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,840
spoke psychology because

176
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,560
they do not explicitly include terms for

177
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,680
desires or other cognitive constructs at

178
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,479
the mathematical level of description

179
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,280
so

180
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,440
given that distinction

181
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,880
uh that there are active inference

182
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,800
models of motor control which need not

183
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,039
have desires under folk psychology and

184
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,000
active inference models

185
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,160
you have desires within folk psychology

186
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,120
then

187
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,560
worry is that it

188
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,039
those can

189
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,880
be

190
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,000
constructed

191
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,759
could you um i think when you're talking

192
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,520
you like turn away a little bit or move

193
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,479
back it kind of cuts the audio so maybe

194
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,360
yeah

195
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,280
we'll try that okay continue from the

196
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,720
given thank you

197
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,080
okay so

198
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
given the there's a distinction in

199
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,360
active inference models of motor control

200
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,759
uh which do not have desires under fox

201
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,680
ecology and active interest models of

202
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,120
decision processes which do have desires

203
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,319
with psychology or so as argued here

204
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,680
then the worry is that if active

205
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,720
inference models can explain cognition

206
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,400
without appealing to constructs it can

207
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,560
be mapped onto the common sense notion

208
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,080
of desires

209
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,560
and that's how to explain what that is

210
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,080
then this could be seen as threat or

211
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,840
intuitive folks i call like

212
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,880
oh of ourselves as agents

213
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,120
such a situation would also pressure the

214
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,639
traditional belief desire intent model

215
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,199
of folk psychology that is prominent in

216
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,240
philosophy the bdi model is a model of

217
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,800
human agency that explains what it means

218
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,759
act intentionally so for me i was

219
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,360
introduced to the bdi model as

220
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,960
yes great and and one way that i kind of

221
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,120
saw this big question even pulling back

222
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,960
a layer is like is active inference

223
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,280
recontextualizing reframing augmenting

224
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,080
building on what is already familiar in

225
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
a sense though there are many folk

226
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,840
psychologies and i think that could be

227
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,160
something we go into or is this the

228
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,479
displacement of some

229
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,440
cherished framework for some other

230
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,440
construct and the way that people speak

231
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,120
like i want the cup of coffee or

232
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,720
something like that are we gonna need

233
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,039
like a different word for an active

234
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,120
compatible folk psychology and

235
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,039
linguistics so

236
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,958
jacob any thoughts on that

237
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,000
well

238
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,519
um

239
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,799
i guess

240
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,240
one question i uh perhaps had

241
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,480
was like um

242
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,279
this

243
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,959
even this formulation of the of the

244
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,040
initial of the initial statement like

245
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,160
given this distinction of motor control

246
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,839
active inference and

247
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,040
decision processes active inference then

248
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,519
we have this then we have this issue

249
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,399
well

250
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,080
one thing that i was a bit uncertain

251
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,760
about was whether this distinction was

252
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,240
made to fit the distinction that's

253
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,800
within folk psychology like there is

254
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,839
some kind of

255
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,920
ontology for motor control

256
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,320
and um an ontology for decision

257
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,000
processes so therefore we try to um

258
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,680
split active inference into these two

259
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,480
parts

260
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,279
or whether there is actually

261
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,680
uh whether these this distinction

262
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,440
follows directly from

263
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,880
the the same mathematical formulation of

264
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,320
um active

265
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,200
great

266
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,839
well i think i think i think one thing

267
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,240
one thing to um you know to clarify i

268
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,000
think i think the way that this kind of

269
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,240
given the distinction followed by then

270
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,040
here

271
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,360
um i think could be leading to a little

272
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,120
bit of a misunderstanding you know so

273
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,760
the the idea that there's a concern

274
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,480
about about a threat to full psychology

275
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,040
um comes not from that distinction it

276
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,480
comes from

277
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,880
the the fact that there's at the

278
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,959
mathematical level of description it

279
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,480
doesn't look like there's anything in

280
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,279
there

281
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,880
that that's that's

282
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,320
desire-ish

283
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,600
right i mean that's where the worry

284
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,640
comes from

285
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,480
um it doesn't really the worry doesn't

286
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,399
come from the distinction between motor

287
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,480
control and decision processes

288
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
right the the distinction between motor

289
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,240
control and decision process is actually

290
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,399
one thing that by making that more

291
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,279
explicit and it actually

292
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,920
helps to resolve uh the concern or it

293
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,600
shows why it's not really a concern or

294
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,160
that part of the concern stems from

295
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,680
a failure to make that distinction

296
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,040
explicitly

297
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,000
um so so just to kind of clarify the you

298
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,680
know so i think the order

299
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,279
of the of the thought process here is a

300
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,440
little bit different than the way um the

301
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,160
way it is in the paper

302
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,519
thanks

303
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,240
helpful times and we'll clarify and go

304
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,360
through the argument in order to

305
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,480
so

306
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,959
uh briefly just the aims of the paper as

307
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,959
they presented are to

308
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,279
provide a brief review of the historical

309
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,200
progression from predictive coding to

310
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,680
current active inference models

311
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,600
and show that despite a superficial

312
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,519
tension when viewed at the mathematical

313
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,600
level the active inference formalism

314
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,279
contains terms that are readily

315
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,839
identifiable as desires and related

316
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,360
cognitive constructs at the

317
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,240
psychological level which is downstream

318
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,120
of that clarification of the distinction

319
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,959
that ryan just mentioned

320
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,959
and then they discuss the additional

321
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,120
insights offered by active inference and

322
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,279
the implications it has for current

323
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,880
debates about active inference

324
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,640
any other aims you'd want to add ryan

325
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,279
um i think this is fine at the moment i

326
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,760
mean i'm sure things will come up

327
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,560
great

328
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,519
and then

329
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,639
um claims um jakub could you read the

330
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,240
claims

331
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,040
yeah

332
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,639
so uh firstly that the apparent problem

333
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,639
posed by purely

334
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,279
doctastic looking constructs simply is

335
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,440
not a problem there do not appear to be

336
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,279
cases where the phenotype consistent

337
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,040
prior expectation in dai often called

338
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,399
prior preferences

339
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,480
will ever conflict with or make distinct

340
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,800
predictions than a traditional folks i

341
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,040
call psychological account in which

342
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,600
beliefs and desires are integrated to

343
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,959
intentions

344
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,800
the second claim is that

345
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,519
what we have referred to as dai the

346
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,279
partially observable markov decision

347
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,760
process formulation of actin

348
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,160
is a corollary of the fep and it can be

349
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,680
implemented using prediction error

350
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,920
minimization but there are many other

351
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,399
aspects of the fep and many other

352
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,240
theories that fall under the umbrella of

353
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,000
predictive processing

354
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,720
and

355
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,680
in some there are beliefs and desires in

356
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,240
the active inference framework

357
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,320
thanks and those are just a few claims

358
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,240
that we pulled out but many other

359
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,639
declarative sentences will also be

360
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,040
claims

361
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,120
um i wouldn't i wouldn't necessarily

362
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,040
call those the primary claims of the

363
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,000
paper i mean there's certainly

364
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,839
statements that we make but

365
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,519
um i think i think the idea that there

366
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,440
isn't uh i think the idea that the

367
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,040
apparent problem isn't a problem i think

368
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,399
that's a claim

369
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,600
um

370
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,160
and uh that it doesn't that there won't

371
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,760
be a conflict

372
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,760
with with an account where you're

373
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,279
combining beliefs and desires to form

374
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,120
intentions that's true

375
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,800
um

376
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,000
this idea about about what falls under

377
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
the predictive processing umbrella would

378
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,800
um

379
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,120
you know immediately

380
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,160
i wouldn't necessarily say that's

381
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,920
something we're arguing for in the paper

382
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,800
it's just

383
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,519
it's just um something that that

384
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,880
matters when you're trying to correctly

385
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
frame this kind of this kind of debate

386
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,839
because

387
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:42,800
um

388
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
you know predictive processing is just a

389
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,920
very

390
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,480
generic term right like like it doesn't

391
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,639
refer to any particular mathematical

392
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,399
formalism it just refers to a really

393
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,920
broad idea

394
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,600
that in some way the brain is doing some

395
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,839
sort of predicting um either with

396
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,279
respect to

397
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,880
resolving problems in perception or

398
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,240
problems in decision making and motor

399
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,000
control

400
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,399
so so there really isn't um

401
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,160
there's not enough uh

402
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,279
there's really just not enough

403
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,440
mathematical specificity associated with

404
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,519
predictive processing as a term to

405
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,040
really even test any predictions that it

406
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,279
would make right so i mean i mean what

407
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,839
you what you need to do is pick you know

408
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,920
whatever specific mathematical formalism

409
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,760
what actual hypothesis you're talking

410
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,639
about

411
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,519
um and you evaluate and test claims with

412
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,600
respect to that right so there's there

413
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,880
just aren't

414
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,360
there's aren't clear uh

415
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,959
like what even

416
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:35,760
uh

417
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,959
it's just you're predictive processing

418
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,680
is just too general in bank is the point

419
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,399
so

420
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,160
you know we can only really say look

421
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,959
under

422
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,720
under the current models used that are

423
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
called active inference right so these

424
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,160
you know partially observable markup

425
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,079
decision process models

426
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,480
um you know that that minimize expected

427
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,240
free energy as a way of making decisions

428
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,760
right those

429
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,480
those arguably count as one particular

430
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,680
right theory or or class of models

431
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,399
under the predictive processing umbrella

432
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,160
and we can evaluate claims with respect

433
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,399
to that model

434
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,639
but you know what's true of that doesn't

435
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,959
need to be true of you know the other

436
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,639
you know 20 things out there that might

437
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,360
um

438
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,720
you know might also fall under a

439
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,480
predictive processing umbrella so that i

440
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,399
mean the main point is just we need to

441
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,480
evaluate um

442
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,839
you know claims and predictions and

443
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,760
things like that with respect to

444
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,680
a specific model not with respect to a

445
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,599
kind of vague general category of models

446
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,079
thank you

447
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,480
okay

448
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,360
um

449
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,639
so just

450
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,120
rapidly through the abstract

451
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,440
active inference offers a unified theory

452
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,959
of perception learning and decision

453
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,800
making at computational and neural

454
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,720
levels of description

455
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,800
in this article we address the worry

456
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,720
that active inference may be in tension

457
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,360
with the belief desire intention bdi

458
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,519
model within folk psychology because it

459
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,920
does not include terms for desires or

460
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,000
other cognitive constructs at the

461
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,320
mathematical level of description

462
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,800
to resolve this concern we first provide

463
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,399
a brief review of the historical

464
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,000
progression from predictive coding to

465
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,160
active inference enabling us to

466
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,480
distinguish between active inference

467
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,040
formulations of motor control

468
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,839
mai which need not have desires under

469
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,839
folk psychology and active inference

470
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,199
formulations of decision processes dai

471
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,759
which do have desires under or sorry

472
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,440
within folk psychology

473
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,279
we then show that despite a superficial

474
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,279
tension when viewed at the mathematical

475
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,959
level of description the active

476
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,959
inference formalism contains terms that

477
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,040
are readily identifiable as encoding

478
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,800
both the objects of desire and the

479
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,880
strength of desire at the psychological

480
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,639
level of description

481
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,079
we demonstrate this with simple

482
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,480
simulations of an active inference agent

483
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,560
motivated to leave a dark room for

484
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,920
different reasons

485
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,920
despite their consistency we further

486
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,680
show how active inference may increase

487
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,920
the granularity of folk psychological

488
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,680
descriptions by highlighting

489
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,759
distinctions between drives to seek

490
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,039
information versus reward and how it may

491
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,839
also offer more precise quantitative

492
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,160
folk psychological predictions

493
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,559
finally we consider how the implicitly

494
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,039
cognitive components of active inference

495
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,679
may have partial analogues i.e as if

496
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,400
desires in other systems describable by

497
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,480
the broader free energy principle to

498
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,280
which it conforms

499
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,280
here's the roadmap

500
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,640
so

501
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,760
the dot

502
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,919
zeros all of them in the world wouldn't

503
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,559
be enough to hit every stop

504
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,039
so we will go through um

505
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,320
roughly in order of these sections

506
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,400
um and the section titles are listed

507
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,520
here but ryan what was the thought going

508
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,320
into the ordering or the structuring and

509
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,559
why there was such a

510
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,520
comprehensive historical and preliminary

511
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,720
consideration section

512
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,799
i mean i mean a lot of you know i mean

513
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,640
the vast majority of these sections are

514
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,799
just kind of building up background

515
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,880
right i mean sufficient background to

516
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,960
kind of see right where

517
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,280
where the um you know both both i think

518
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,120
historically where you know potential

519
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,120
misunderstandings might come from

520
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,360
um you know and also and also just

521
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,039
enough of the you know providing enough

522
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,039
of the formalism you know one part of

523
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,320
the formalism just kind of build on

524
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,760
another right to see why the um you know

525
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,679
to see why the the

526
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,679
apparent problem just isn't there

527
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,120
right so i mean the vast majority of

528
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,200
these sections are just preliminary just

529
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
kind of building up so that the reader

530
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,799
has the information necessary to

531
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,559
understand the argument i mean only only

532
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,840
the last couple of sections they're

533
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,320
really um really the meat of the

534
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,799
argument itself i mean so so you know

535
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,120
for example just section

536
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,200
two you know the are what we just said

537
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,720
from the predictive coding active

538
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
inference is just kind of highlighting

539
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,679
how you know these initial

540
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,360
brain as as implemented through

541
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,280
predictive coding was you know purely a

542
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,880
model of perception

543
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,640
right so then you know so then when

544
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,320
people but a lot of times you'll see

545
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,080
especially in the um you know older

546
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,039
literature in some philosophy literature

547
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,840
um you know predictive processing

548
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,520
somehow both refers to predictive coding

549
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,919
but then also is talked about as though

550
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,200
it's um

551
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,720
as though it's the same thing as active

552
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,080
inference

553
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,919
um you know or there'll be these kinds

554
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,200
of ideas where

555
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,039
um if you just extend predictive coding

556
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,400
as kind of a

557
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,640
the way it's talked about as a kind of

558
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,840
way of thinking about what the whole

559
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,799
brain does you know then all of a sudden

560
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,360
um you know controlling the body

561
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,520
ends up also just being something about

562
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,880
predicting what the body will do um

563
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,880
but but and especially when described

564
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,440
that way right it sounds like something

565
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,320
like

566
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,559
desire and motivation and goals and

567
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,840
things like that are just kind of

568
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,280
completely out the window and it's very

569
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,120
hard to make sense of what how a system

570
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,720
like that would even work

571
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,440
right um and so it's and and part of

572
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,520
that i think is because there's you know

573
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,880
some um

574
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,799
you know some uh

575
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,080
the way that certain things are written

576
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,360
in some of the literature can be a

577
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,240
little bit um confusing or it's not too

578
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,600
it's not too

579
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,159
uh hard to understand why you know these

580
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,520
sorts of um you know these sorts of

581
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,440
misunderstandings could uh you know

582
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,640
could happen

583
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,000
um but but uh but the you know section

584
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,080
two there was really really is to show

585
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,240
how you know initially right when you're

586
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
trying to move from predictive coding

587
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,440
again which is purely a model of

588
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,280
perception it's not about decision

589
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,120
making it's not about action selection

590
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,480
you know it's not even about motor

591
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,840
control right it's just it's just a

592
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,919
bayesian just a theory of how the brain

593
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,440
can do approximate bayesian inference

594
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,640
and perception

595
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,320
um you know how

596
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,720
that was initially just extended to say

597
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,720
hey like if the brain works this way

598
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,960
then you know how do you how do you get

599
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,280
a system that actually controls the body

600
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,679
using the same generic architecture

601
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,120
right and so then you know the story

602
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,240
that carl fristan you know and and

603
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,919
you know some other people started

604
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,679
trying to put together was

605
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,080
the story about how you can use

606
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,840
predictions you know descending

607
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,960
predictions

608
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,440
um if weighted appropriately right as a

609
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,440
way of essentially setting the target

610
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,880
states of the body

611
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,200
right like like is this kind of you know

612
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,720
the way you'll see it talked about is

613
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,400
you know i predict that my arm will be

614
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,720
here but really it's down here but if i

615
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,400
wait that correctly then it'll kind of

616
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,080
like you know you'll kind of control the

617
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,080
set point in a reflex arc to you know so

618
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,440
your arm kind of moves up with a

619
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,720
position

620
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,559
right but but that's

621
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,480
just a theory about how you can use a

622
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,919
descending prediction signal to

623
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,360
essentially act as a motor command

624
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,600
signal right there's nothing in that at

625
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,480
all that that's deciding

626
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,960
what that prediction ought to be right

627
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,720
there's nothing deciding what that what

628
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,240
which motor command

629
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,919
should should be the one right that's

630
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,640
getting sent down in in a

631
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,919
in in the

632
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,840
with the form of a prediction

633
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,559
um right so so again so even there it's

634
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,000
just a theory about how you can use

635
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,320
predictions as motor commands right like

636
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,600
there's no there's a very big

637
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,919
distinction between that and whatever

638
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,480
the system uh is on top of that right

639
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,720
that's deciding okay what motor command

640
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,280
what what motor prediction right do i

641
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,159
send

642
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,400
um and so just making you know making

643
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,240
making that clear right because around

644
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,080
2015

645
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,240
there was this big shift right from

646
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,960
these from these act where from active

647
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,120
inference being talked about as a just

648
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,640
kind of a motor control process right

649
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,000
like a like a story about how you can

650
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,679
extend predictive coding

651
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,559
to

652
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,440
uh

653
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,760
you know also do motor commands right

654
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,000
like from that to

655
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,840
you know these larger more comprehensive

656
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,159
decision making models which are the

657
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,120
current right pump bps

658
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,679
and those you know which was what we aim

659
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,799
to show um very explicitly you know have

660
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,039
something that um you know in the

661
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,320
mathematics

662
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,240
it just does right it specifies the

663
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,480
goals of the system um it's pretty hard

664
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,159
to get around the fact that you need

665
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,400
something a system needs something like

666
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,320
goals right because it has to evaluate

667
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,440
somehow

668
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,120
why one decision is going to be better

669
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,320
than another

670
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,760
right the only way you can really do

671
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,320
that is with respect to how likely it is

672
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,640
to get whatever the system wants

673
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,600
um

674
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,480
so so it's just i mean in my

675
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,240
yeah in my view it's it's very difficult

676
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,360
to see how

677
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,640
um

678
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,360
how you could ever get um a system to be

679
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,960
able to evaluate one action is better

680
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,320
than another without having some sort of

681
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,600
target state

682
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,559
um

683
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,559
and um and so

684
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,840
you can call

685
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,280
right like the the target dates in

686
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,679
active inference um a type of prior

687
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:34,640
belief

688
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,080
but at the end of the day its functional

689
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,159
role is to specify what what

690
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,400
observations are better than what right

691
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,760
so i mean you can really think of active

692
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,880
inferences

693
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,159
as

694
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,600
using this kind of trick in a certain

695
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,480
sense right of specifying desired

696
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,640
outcomes in the form of a probability

697
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,919
distribution

698
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,240
um because that helped keep everything

699
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,120
belief believe me fully bayesian right

700
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,880
um but it's not it's not it's not

701
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,960
playing functional world belief right

702
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,640
it's encoding you know higher

703
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,200
probability just means right like the

704
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,120
better more rewarding outcome

705
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,919
um so so a lot of it is just

706
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,640
um you know kind of working step by step

707
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,440
through

708
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,760
both kind of the historical progression

709
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,480
so you can see where the

710
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,400
misunderstanding could come from and

711
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,960
then also through the current formalism

712
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,039
so that you can see exactly where those

713
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,640
where the you know the goal states are

714
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,799
encoded in terms of something with the

715
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,720
form of a probability distribution

716
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,120
thank you

717
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,080
the

718
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,200
keywords

719
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,080
are

720
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,799
active inference folk psychology

721
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,679
predictive processing bayesian beliefs

722
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,799
and desires so now we're going to jump

723
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,520
in

724
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,159
and some of the slides have a lot of

725
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,960
text topically arranged so we won't need

726
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,200
to read all the text on many of the

727
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,840
slides but especially if somebody wants

728
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,440
to pull out like one of the highlighted

729
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,279
sections and

730
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,720
like bring it to our attention that

731
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,640
would be awesome

732
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,200
so um and also ryan thanks a lot for

733
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,440
that great historical overview and i

734
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,919
think there's there's so much more to be

735
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,400
going into about what happened before

736
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,200
2015 and what happened in the last seven

737
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,320
years

738
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,840
um

739
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,000
in fact i think you covered many of the

740
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,400
key points in what you just described

741
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,279
here

742
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,440
which had to do with the development of

743
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,760
predictive coding framework into

744
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,440
understanding brain and body

745
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,799
is there anything that anyone else wants

746
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,400
to add about these points

747
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,120
great then

748
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,360
um

749
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,640
all discussions and um dot zeros are

750
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,360
like a two-way street where some people

751
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,240
with active inference familiarity are

752
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,960
learning about new ideas and frameworks

753
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,640
and also people who might have

754
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,840
familiarity with a broadly

755
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,320
used area outside of actin are learning

756
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,760
about active so for both directions on

757
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,279
that freeway it's important to

758
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,559
understand what is the target non-actin

759
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,039
framework that's being juxtaposed and

760
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,600
found concordances with active inference

761
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,400
so

762
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,559
the article is addressing the worry that

763
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,120
active models may be in tension with the

764
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,480
belief desire intention model and there

765
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,559
are some consequences to that

766
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,000
um worry

767
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,320
in other words um given some priors it's

768
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,240
a founded worry

769
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,200
um

770
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,520
would anyone like to summarize what the

771
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,600
belief desire intention model is

772
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,919
thank you daniel because you i think you

773
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,960
put this slide together

774
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,880
ryan what led you to select the bdi

775
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,840
model

776
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,559
and i wondered about um almost this

777
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,720
tension or paradox with like it's folk

778
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,640
psychology it's about what the people

779
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,520
think

780
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,919
but we're gonna do a citation and one

781
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,559
specific academic acronym for what

782
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,440
people think so is this like the main

783
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,480
game in town for folk psychology from an

784
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,960
academic perspective or what is the bdi

785
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,360
and what led you to select that

786
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,760
rather than like a small portfolio of

787
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,960
alternate folk psychologies

788
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,200
um i think i think that the you know

789
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,679
belief desire intention model is just um

790
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,480
a very kind of you know generic button

791
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,520
but also um you know widely known right

792
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,279
like account of you know trying to

793
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,240
capture full psychology and you know

794
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,000
it's kind of the it's a it's a

795
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,200
it's a major

796
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,679
um sort of target of uh a lot of

797
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,600
discussion within you know like

798
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,760
philosophy of mind um

799
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,600
but but i mean it's just very generic

800
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,440
right i mean just this idea that you

801
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,039
know what what are the what are the

802
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,799
necessary ingredients

803
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,640
um to make a decision

804
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,000
well you know i have to have some

805
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,440
beliefs about how the world is and i

806
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,720
have to have some desires about how the

807
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,799
world i would like it to be

808
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,720
and my intention involves integrating

809
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,880
those two things right and then and then

810
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,360
if all goes if all goes well in terms of

811
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,520
translating intentions into controlling

812
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,520
the body then i'll act out you know

813
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,679
something according to my intention

814
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,600
right i mean simple you know like the

815
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,679
dumb example that you'll often hear just

816
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,440
you know something like you know i

817
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,360
desire some ice cream

818
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,799
you know i believe that there's an ice

819
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,399
cream truck

820
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,080
you know down the road

821
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,559
you know given those two things and

822
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,279
and necessarily those two things right i

823
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,120
can inform and touch it and then form an

824
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,880
intention to go you know walk over the

825
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,720
ice cream truck and buy some ice cream

826
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,159
you know so i mean the question is how

827
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:36,880
else

828
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,039
you know are you going to explain why i

829
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,320
went over to the truck to buy the ice

830
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
cream it literally just is you know that

831
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,840
is the general sort of thing that when

832
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,480
we're reasoning about other people's you

833
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,720
know decisions other people's um

834
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,000
you know behavior and we're trying to

835
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,520
figure out okay why did this person do

836
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,360
what they did you know if we're assuming

837
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,200
it's a voluntary action right if we're

838
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,720
assuming it's not because like their

839
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,799
arms spasmed or you know because they

840
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,559
have some like really highly ingrained

841
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,320
habit or compulsion or something like

842
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,600
that right when we're talking about

843
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,000
voluntary behavior um that is just the

844
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,720
way right that that we tend to reason

845
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,880
about how people do what they do you

846
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,399
know either once when somebody does

847
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,480
something that's we think is weird

848
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,080
right then usually we have to explain

849
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,440
that in terms of okay well they just

850
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,000
believed something that was incorrect

851
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,159
right or or they had some really funny

852
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,039
desire right that i don't relate

853
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,000
um you know it tends to be you know one

854
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,679
of those sorts of things

855
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,520
right i mean i mean i don't know a lot

856
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,960
of other um

857
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,240
you know separate

858
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,240
uh folk psychological models that would

859
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,640
uh entail anything different than this

860
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,159
um you know at a very generic level um

861
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,760
and it's also

862
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,520
exactly the sort of thing

863
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,039
right that that people try to contrast

864
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,640
active inference with

865
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,200
where where instead of you know belief

866
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,279
desires beliefs and desires coming

867
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,039
together to form intentions instead it'd

868
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,120
be something like one kind of belief and

869
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,640
another kind of belief come together to

870
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,720
form an intention

871
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,679
um which again for a lot of reasons um

872
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,399
is

873
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,600
you know

874
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,360
confusing and rightfully so when it's

875
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,158
presented that way

876
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,120
thanks

877
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,960
yes

878
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,039
so ryan when

879
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,880
we've had some conversations with other

880
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,120
authors and other papers where we've

881
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,679
talked about the scale three formalism

882
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,279
and we've also talked a little bit about

883
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,279
the sort of scale friendly

884
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,080
uh

885
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,320
times when you have to find that history

886
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,000
and that context what you just mentioned

887
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,480
was sort of the generic

888
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,440
generalized sense that the bdi umbrella

889
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,760
provides you're not saying that

890
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,080
scale-free quantification and a generic

891
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,000
uh way of modeling something are the

892
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,080
same thing but what i think i'm like

893
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,679
without putting words in your mouth are

894
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,640
you saying that the scale freeness as it

895
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,679
moves to something more scale friendly

896
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,360
sweeps up some of that generic big tent

897
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,840
idea or model and now

898
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,399
moves it along it allows you to sort of

899
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,320
parse and be specific and precise

900
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,039
precise but also be able to generalize

901
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,039
as you move through those you know

902
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,519
quantifications of the just distribution

903
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,679
and density and such because that's kind

904
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,519
of what i was reading into it i just

905
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,200
want to make sure that i got it i was

906
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,399
kind of

907
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,840
maybe you can help me clean that up a

908
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,519
bit

909
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,200
um i mean i really don't know that

910
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,120
anything that we're saying uh really

911
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,799
depends on or even gets into a lot of

912
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,120
those sorts of specifics i mean really

913
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,279
and really all we're saying is is that

914
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,679
um you know if you want to take

915
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,200
um the model uh like the the current

916
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,480
active inference formulas and the

917
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,960
current kind of like vanilla formalism

918
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,880
right so in terms of an interested

919
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,039
standard one level palmdp or you know if

920
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,039
you want to scale it up hierarchically

921
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,799
it doesn't ultimately matter it is if

922
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,880
you want you use

923
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,640
um the vanilla active inference

924
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,799
framework to actually model some sort of

925
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,279
voluntary decision process in a human

926
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,880
right so i mean a lot of my work has to

927
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,799
do with people you know modeling

928
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,039
behavior on decision making tasks

929
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,600
right often have to do with you know the

930
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,120
person the person has the goal of

931
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,600
maximizing you know how much money they

932
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,519
win or you know maximizing some sort of

933
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,679
social reward something like that the

934
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,480
idea is just that when you're trying to

935
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,159
if you're gonna take an active inference

936
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,440
model and you're gonna use it to model

937
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,919
uh successfully model actual human

938
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,080
behavior when they're making decisions

939
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,600
then um

940
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,440
there's always gonna be

941
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,559
a mapping between the different elements

942
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,880
in the active inference model of

943
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,720
voluntary behavior

944
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,519
that or the whatever the prior you know

945
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,000
prior preference distribution is

946
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,559
you just check that so that it just

947
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,760
builds the level of reward

948
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,880
you know so so there's really nothing

949
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,320
about any

950
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,240
scale or anything like that this is much

951
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,159
more generic it's just if you're going

952
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,320
to use active inference to model

953
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,880
voluntary choice then

954
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,799
um it will always have

955
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,480
something analogous to a belief and a

956
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,039
desire because that's just what you need

957
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,600
right like to model to model voluntary

958
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,640
behavior

959
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,880
um it's true that you know that's

960
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,880
probably if you're if you actually were

961
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,480
going to try to capture

962
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,519
something

963
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,440
uh kind of like more of the actual

964
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,120
architecture in the brain as opposed to

965
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,039
just this kind of like

966
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,440
voluntary decision process aspect i mean

967
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,039
i'm sure there's a lot of kind of

968
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,799
hierarchy below that under the hood

969
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,559
right that's translating

970
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,760
more abstract policy selection processes

971
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,760
into whatever the dynamic signals are

972
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,399
that end up controlling you know moment

973
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:41,919
by moment muscle movements and things

974
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,360
like that

975
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,279
but the point is is the below

976
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,840
below this kind of top level where

977
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,159
you're doing policy selection

978
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,279
um

979
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,640
you know at that point you don't really

980
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,399
need the desires anymore right you just

981
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,279
need the policy to specify whatever the

982
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,279
motor commands are going down that can

983
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,360
take the form of predictions

984
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,600
um so so i don't i don't know if that

985
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,600
helps but it's just it's just that

986
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,279
there's a certain level in any kind of

987
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,359
hierarchy of a model that's going to

988
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,879
actually

989
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,800
be applicable successfully to human

990
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,719
behavior and

991
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,199
at the level of policy selection

992
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,560
um

993
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,320
prior preferences will just include the

994
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,560
the desired outcomes they'll just encode

995
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,000
the goals that the agent's trying to

996
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,480
reach and the policy that's chosen

997
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,280
will

998
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,918
be evaluated as being the most likely

999
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:30,879
policy

1000
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,560
because it's the thing that's predicted

1001
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,280
to

1002
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,079
have the highest probability of um of

1003
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,320
getting the desired you know generating

1004
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,159
the desired uh observation

1005
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,079
um

1006
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,040
if i may also comment on that and

1007
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,399
i'm not sure if this is

1008
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,719
um answering your question dean but the

1009
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,079
way i thought about it when i was

1010
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,639
reading the paper uh was that part of

1011
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,560
the reason why uh

1012
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,800
the belief desire intention model kind

1013
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,400
of uh

1014
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,520
works uh works well for for mapping the

1015
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,839
active inference ontology to the folk

1016
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,640
psychology ontology is because it's a

1017
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,040
discrete model in that it separates

1018
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,040
these these different these different

1019
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,640
parts and

1020
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,640
and i think that also might have

1021
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,480
motivated the choice to

1022
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,520
consider mainly discrete pomdps

1023
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,640
uh and describe the uh decision this

1024
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,680
decision active inference in that um

1025
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,280
in that way as well

1026
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,960
um

1027
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,320
because then this

1028
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,920
discrete model

1029
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,920
can be more easily mapped to

1030
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,760
say the discrete model of

1031
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,000
uh the pomdp that's this that's

1032
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,680
described like a like a factory graph

1033
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,880
i'm

1034
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,920
i'm not sure

1035
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,800
i

1036
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,520
i was wondering how this would map to

1037
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,640
continuous tasks as well it

1038
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,960
well i mean i mean i think the i mean

1039
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,000
part of the

1040
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,920
i mean uh you know part of the part of

1041
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,000
the reason why you need something

1042
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,280
discreet

1043
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,160
right is is because actions is discrete

1044
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,480
right i mean there's either

1045
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,800
one or there's policy two or this policy

1046
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,200
right so those those just are sort of

1047
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,640
necessarily

1048
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,040
right i mean you get you know continuous

1049
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,960
state spaces work well or are

1050
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,160
appropriate

1051
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,920
um you know at lower levels in a

1052
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,359
hierarchy you know when you're talking

1053
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,280
about kind of dynamics and motor

1054
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,880
movement you know dynamics in the

1055
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,200
setpoint of some reflex arcore or when

1056
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,359
you're trying to estimate um

1057
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,359
something in perception that you know

1058
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,359
just just as a continuous quantity right

1059
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,680
like brightness or you know orientation

1060
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,240
or things like that but but the level of

1061
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,200
um

1062
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,920
at the level of decision making

1063
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,640
um models are necessarily

1064
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,000
right discreet

1065
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
um i mean i mean there is

1066
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,200
you know there are there are kind of

1067
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,640
hybrid models right that are out there

1068
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,320
in the literature you know like mama's

1069
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,240
part for example you know has published

1070
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,160
liberal papers using these sorts of

1071
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,200
models where the the kind of policy

1072
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,599
at the higher level which is which is in

1073
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,040
a discrete model

1074
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,599
uh generates right some observation that

1075
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,359
then sets that point

1076
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,280
right for some continuous or some

1077
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,839
continuous lower level model that then

1078
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,240
you know can end up in a in a way that's

1079
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,720
kind of like this kind of

1080
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,200
story you know like move the eyes around

1081
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,640
the cod to different locations and

1082
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,720
things like that um so um so i i

1083
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,040
i kind of think that that the

1084
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,839
discreteness is or the the

1085
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,599
the reason why

1086
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,440
um things move to a discrete state space

1087
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,440
architecture is just because of like the

1088
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,640
necessary

1089
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,560
um what's necessary with respect to a

1090
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,400
model of policy collection

1091
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,920
um because it is kind of all or none

1092
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,440
um

1093
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,400
just to keep the dot zero zero-ish we're

1094
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,720
gonna move a lot faster through the

1095
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,599
following slides and there's many

1096
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,000
important questions um in the chat and

1097
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,480
and also arising so we're just gonna

1098
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,440
carry on more rapidly so people can

1099
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,440
pick up on these key points in the xero

1100
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,680
and we'll have a lot of time to explore

1101
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,680
soon

1102
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,960
section two

1103
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,320
from predictive coding to active

1104
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,680
inference traces the uh history and the

1105
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,599
development from

1106
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,040
various fields

1107
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,480
and just

1108
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,280
one

1109
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,440
sentence here that that dean and i both

1110
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,800
highlighted on and then dino let you

1111
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,680
describe the button was that um

1112
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,920
crucially for the purposes of this paper

1113
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,839
the first generation active inference

1114
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,320
was not a theory of decision making it

1115
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,720
did not explain how we decide or plan

1116
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,560
where to move our body it only explained

1117
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,960
how body movements can be executed using

1118
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,359
the predictive coding apparatus once a

1119
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,680
decision has been made so how did you

1120
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,720
connect that to the bottom right yeah so

1121
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,640
if you're on a if you're on a

1122
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,359
some sort of a website and you have to

1123
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,520
pass through to something my question

1124
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,920
was based on that statement when the

1125
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,520
expectation is

1126
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,680
to know that you've actually

1127
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,839
crossed a threshold you've moved beyond

1128
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,000
one page and there's an expectation that

1129
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,400
there's something that you validated or

1130
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,000
confirmed or whatever

1131
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,079
is the feedback that you received does

1132
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,599
that have

1133
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,160
how how does the person who's actually

1134
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,680
expecting that

1135
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,440
they're on the other side what kind of

1136
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,920
feedback mechanism do they need to for

1137
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,079
that confirmation is tactile

1138
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,000
feedback enough do they need some sort

1139
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,079
of a visual confirmation as well like

1140
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,280
what is the

1141
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,800
what's the

1142
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,200
it is there because we're talking about

1143
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,359
thresholds is that different for every

1144
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,440
single person or is there sort of

1145
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,680
expectations built in depending upon the

1146
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,200
kind of situation that you're dealing

1147
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,000
with

1148
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,400
um i do know that with with the idea

1149
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,280
that like changes are saved or links are

1150
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,040
copied sometimes the click isn't enough

1151
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,200
to give people confidence that in fact

1152
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,920
that process is carried through

1153
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,520
i mean i would i would say that i mean a

1154
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,720
lot of those questions are really

1155
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,880
empirical empirical questions as opposed

1156
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,640
to modeling questions

1157
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,119
um you know i mean i mean in terms of in

1158
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,560
terms of how you would model that sort

1159
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,000
of thing right you just specify what

1160
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,680
observations count as tactile you

1161
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,119
specify what observations count as

1162
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,160
visual

1163
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,599
and and uh

1164
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,040
you know what ends up being thresholds

1165
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,560
first efficient evidence and things like

1166
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,640
that just just have to do with the way

1167
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,960
that it processes just how the dynamics

1168
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,119
naturally you know enroll um in the

1169
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,000
model

1170
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,880
under whatever the model

1171
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,240
parameterization is you know so so um

1172
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,240
you'll hit a threshold faster if the

1173
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,240
mapping between observing whatever

1174
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,400
observations and states is more precise

1175
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,079
um for example

1176
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,760
um i mean

1177
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,839
there's uh you know in relation in

1178
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,839
relation to that when we're doing policy

1179
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:40,079
selection right we also have to check

1180
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,280
and see whether things are actually

1181
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,520
going as we expected them to go you know

1182
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,599
under a choice of policy right so it's

1183
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,440
possible that you choose policy one and

1184
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,640
you start to get the subsequent

1185
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,000
observations and they don't actually

1186
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,839
match what you expected you know given

1187
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,760
that you had chosen policy one

1188
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,760
um you know in which case

1189
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,760
um you'll update your beliefs through

1190
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,359
perceptual inference and that might

1191
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,160
influence how you act going forward

1192
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,040
um so so but uh the specifics about you

1193
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,480
know what's enough and whether it's

1194
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,079
visual or tactile or anything like that

1195
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,520
i mean those are those are really just

1196
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,520
empirical questions um that would have

1197
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,119
to be answered in studies as opposed to

1198
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,040
something about model choices

1199
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,480
okay so there was really not a good

1200
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,640
enough thing when you did the dark room

1201
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,480
aspect of it

1202
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,079
like the rhythm that you were prepared

1203
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,520
to take on

1204
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,200
right like somebody was prepared to take

1205
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,280
on the risk because they really urgently

1206
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,760
wanted the ice cream versus the person

1207
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,240
who was like

1208
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,200
i'm i'm agnostic right so that's maybe

1209
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,800
that's kind of what i was

1210
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,319
this was on the second reading of your

1211
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,400
paper right so i was kind of now back

1212
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,800
filling from further down in the paper

1213
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,680
so

1214
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,280
well i'm into that

1215
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,200
yeah we'll go in the order because we're

1216
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,400
mentioning things that we haven't

1217
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,079
brought up yet but let's continue on and

1218
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,880
we'll return to that and ryan i i also

1219
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,040
agree that in any specific case it's

1220
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,200
going to be a model parameterization

1221
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
some of these are very difficult to

1222
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,440
answer in the abstract model selection

1223
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,839
setting

1224
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,359
here

1225
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,319
the

1226
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,400
distinction between motor active

1227
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,960
inference and decision active inference

1228
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,560
is introduced

1229
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,680
and

1230
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,000
i'll allow jakob to just convey one pass

1231
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,599
what is the difference between motor

1232
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,599
active inference and decision active

1233
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,000
inference

1234
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,800
um

1235
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,359
so i'm not sure whether i can uh

1236
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,480
say much that hasn't been said yet but

1237
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:32,880
in a

1238
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,319
[Music]

1239
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,280
briefly the motor active inference

1240
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,319
is

1241
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,920
does well

1242
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,680
as already mentioned it does not

1243
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,599
consider design

1244
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,200
desires in the

1245
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,599
in the active inference and folk

1246
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,839
psychological sense uh

1247
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:50,960
as

1248
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,920
um

1249
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,839
was then connected in the in the paper

1250
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:54,880
but

1251
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,280
uh also it is my understanding that the

1252
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,800
motor control version of active

1253
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,400
inference is modeled uh continuously

1254
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,280
like the models of uh

1255
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,079
of

1256
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,520
the movement of individual muscle

1257
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,520
muscles which does not entail decision

1258
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,200
making so it's modeled with um in

1259
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,280
continuous time rather than in discrete

1260
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,240
time

1261
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,839
and the decision-making uh active as

1262
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,680
uh ryan already said as well uh

1263
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,839
is all about decision making so it

1264
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:26,960
describes

1265
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,400
the discrete process of decision making

1266
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,359
with

1267
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,680
uh prior beliefs

1268
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,680
and preferences

1269
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,400
and it can i and it can be modeled at

1270
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,040
different different

1271
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,079
levels of cognition as well which is

1272
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,920
one thing that i'm still a bit uncertain

1273
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,520
about how we can move

1274
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,839
through these different layers while

1275
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,599
still keeping the same mathematical

1276
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,119
formulation

1277
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,280
uh but i think we'll probably get to

1278
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,480
that in the other slides

1279
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,200
yep we're gonna continue with this um

1280
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,680
distinction of m a i for motor active

1281
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,680
inference and d a i

1282
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,839
for the decision active inference

1283
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,680
here we're showing some key sections

1284
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,880
from the paper

1285
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,839
and

1286
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,040
some citations

1287
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,400
i think we will

1288
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,440
continue on without going into this

1289
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,480
in depth but it describes some of the

1290
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,119
specific model quantities

1291
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,119
that are being

1292
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,599
described in active inference formalism

1293
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:36,880
and we're going to come to them when we

1294
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,200
look at some equations in the coming

1295
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,598
slides

1296
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,760
in section 3

1297
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,040
preliminary considerations

1298
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,160
two broad points are uh introduced and

1299
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,040
we might show um a second one on a later

1300
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,319
slide

1301
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,560
um

1302
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,359
how can we think ryan about what is said

1303
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,160
here that decision making ai models are

1304
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,880
largely taken to describe sub-personal

1305
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,599
non-conscious processes

1306
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,400
um and also it was asked in the chat not

1307
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,480
that we have to address it now by david

1308
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,480
um has active inference produced a

1309
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,520
single reasonable model of a qualia

1310
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,920
so when we're thinking about this first

1311
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,240
broad point that was made here

1312
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,040
where

1313
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,640
is experience and what is the

1314
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,160
distinction between the personal and the

1315
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,839
sub-personal in

1316
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:32,880
dai um

1317
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,480
well i mean so there's a couple

1318
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,240
different questions you asked there and

1319
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,680
i don't necessarily think they're

1320
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,800
synonymous

1321
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,319
so you know when you said i think the

1322
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:41,599
first question you asked was something

1323
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,119
about um

1324
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,000
uh

1325
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,920
has active inference provided some sort

1326
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,040
of uh explanation or or model of um of

1327
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,920
qualia that would be satisfactory um in

1328
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,839
the strong sense so in the sense of the

1329
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,760
sense of quality as an explanation for

1330
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,359
like the hard problem of consciousness

1331
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,359
then i think active inference is in the

1332
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,440
same place as anyone else and that no

1333
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,000
one has a good explanation for

1334
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,839
for you know how to deal with the hard

1335
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,520
problem of consciousness right i mean

1336
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,160
like massive literature out there but um

1337
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,440
i think everyone thinks it's just as

1338
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,960
mysterious as ever

1339
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,560
um so so no right i mean on the other

1340
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,520
hand

1341
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,640
um i mean you know myself and others you

1342
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,160
know have published multiple papers

1343
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,920
showing how you can successfully use

1344
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,599
active inference models

1345
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,599
to um to model conscious access

1346
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,000
processes right so the distinction

1347
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,440
between when the brain is representing

1348
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,359
something unconsciously versus when it's

1349
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,599
representing something consciously um

1350
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,359
you know in that it can you know

1351
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:40,240
self-report right what it's representing

1352
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,839
um can use the information to make

1353
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:43,599
voluntary choices

1354
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,040
um and we've shown that those sorts of

1355
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,079
models are able to um you know reproduce

1356
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,960
uh like empirical results in like eeg

1357
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,880
studies and fmri studies and things like

1358
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,680
that

1359
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,160
um that an and that also can make novel

1360
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,240
neurophysiological predictions um some

1361
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,319
of which seem like they um you know in

1362
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,960
some subsequent work uh you know have um

1363
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,319
like empirical support for those

1364
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:05,520
predictions

1365
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,119
um so so in terms of providing a um

1366
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,359
you know uh what seems like a useful

1367
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,599
account of the the processes associated

1368
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,240
with what people self-report that they

1369
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,480
consciously experience um and uh and the

1370
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,800
brain basis for that i think active

1371
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,280
inference has the at least the starting

1372
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,599
you know the starting um starting point

1373
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,119
for for being useful and explaining

1374
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,720
those sorts of things but

1375
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,520
you know

1376
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,599
why one little posterior inside a model

1377
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,119
versus another posterior in a model

1378
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,880
actually corresponds to like the

1379
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,319
experience of red versus blue or

1380
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,160
something i mean no i don't i think

1381
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,920
active inferences is

1382
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,680
um not any better than anyone else you

1383
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,160
know any other model for that question

1384
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,200
um

1385
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,839
the um the i guess the second thing you

1386
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,160
know that you asked had to do with

1387
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,520
um it's kind of like a related question

1388
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,880
of you know why it's the case that one

1389
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,119
level has to do with a conscious process

1390
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,920
versus unconscious process and um

1391
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,240
um the best i really got there and you

1392
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,760
know what what falls out of the models

1393
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,400
that we've um you know shown really just

1394
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,800
has to do with temporal scale um you

1395
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,079
know so there's though there will be a

1396
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:09,720
certain level of temporal

1397
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,559
representations in a hierarchical model

1398
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,480
that um that integrates enough and

1399
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,000
represents regularities over a long

1400
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,839
enough time scale that it can contribute

1401
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:18,559
to

1402
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,359
you know sort of prospective um

1403
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,200
um it'll be sufficiently compact to

1404
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,200
generate things like self-reports right

1405
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,800
so i mean think about how complicated

1406
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,480
and temporally extended

1407
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,480
um reporting and choosing to report

1408
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,880
something like you know i see something

1409
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,520
green with me right i mean it's a very

1410
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,559
complicated temporally deep um you know

1411
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,480
type of policy to select and requires

1412
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,440
integrating a bunch of information from

1413
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,119
stuff at lower levels that's happening

1414
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,800
over faster time scales

1415
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,280
um so at a minimum right you just need

1416
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,839
to be at a level of representation where

1417
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,480
the regularities are sufficiently uh

1418
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,040
sufficiently long and um especially

1419
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,040
temporarily deep and then have access to

1420
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,400
all the relevant information you need to

1421
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,240
integrate to be able to generate um

1422
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,760
reports like that

1423
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,079
um whereas whereas much of the other

1424
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,079
kind of little pieces in the model right

1425
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:09,760
like uh

1426
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,240
you know the generated um say like

1427
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,920
expected or for like variational for

1428
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,520
energy gradients and things like that

1429
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,040
that you know people might call like

1430
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,920
surprise right i mean no one's claiming

1431
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,839
that and often they will not relate in

1432
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,359
any way to people's conscious reports

1433
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:24,960
about feeling surprised because

1434
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,079
conscious reports about feeling

1435
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:27,359
surprised will have to do with

1436
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,839
representations of surprises in states

1437
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,680
right as opposed to

1438
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,839
um you know some sort of prediction

1439
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,839
error like uh you know gradient

1440
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,480
minimization process

1441
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,800
thanks

1442
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,119
um

1443
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,240
also in section three there are several

1444
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,000
clarifications

1445
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,040
um

1446
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,720
and some

1447
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,640
seeds that are planted

1448
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,599
uh

1449
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,680
namely if computational and folks

1450
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,240
psychological predictions converge

1451
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,839
and no other available theory can

1452
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:04,000
account for behavior equally well this

1453
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,079
could entail the mathematical structure

1454
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:07,440
of dai

1455
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,839
as more than a convenient tool instead

1456
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,280
that it corresponds to the true

1457
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,839
information processing structure

1458
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:16,480
underlying and enabling folk psychology

1459
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,319
and related abilities

1460
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:19,760
and this is really

1461
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,079
nicely put here that the crucial point

1462
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,920
remains that one should not conflate

1463
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,160
mathematical and psychological levels of

1464
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,440
description

1465
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,839
however dai models might nonetheless

1466
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:31,680
offer more detailed information about

1467
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,240
the true form of folk psychological

1468
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,640
categories and processes

1469
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,319
and then they add that their aims are to

1470
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:41,920
demonstrate that there's a clear

1471
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,720
isomorphism between the elements of dai

1472
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,359
models and those of the bdi model

1473
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:48,319
and then

1474
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:49,680
show how

1475
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,680
provided one does not assume probability

1476
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,839
distributions in computational models

1477
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:55,680
must be identified with beliefs at the

1478
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,760
psychological level there will be no

1479
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,920
tension between dai and bdi and that

1480
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,760
comparison or juxtaposition is clarified

1481
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,040
by

1482
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,000
separating mai from dai like has been

1483
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,040
mentioned

1484
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,440
anything else before we start to jump

1485
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,920
into some of the formalisms and keeping

1486
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,960
all of this in mind

1487
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,920
i guess i um i had one question on um

1488
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,359
on the

1489
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,480
on

1490
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,839
which

1491
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:31,280
um

1492
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,359
ontology we're working with when we say

1493
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,119
there's a isomorphism between the

1494
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,680
elements of dai models and those of the

1495
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,280
bdi model

1496
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,400
um

1497
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,760
because i think there are multiple ways

1498
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,400
to interpret this uh

1499
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,480
one one thing that i'm wondering about

1500
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,400
is whether this means that we can

1501
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,480
basically construct a mathematical

1502
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,680
formulation of the of the bdi model that

1503
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,319
is like a subset of active inference or

1504
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:57,359
maybe

1505
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:58,480
um

1506
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,800
maybe there are certain certain elements

1507
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,480
of the bdi model that aren't necessarily

1508
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,800
encapsulated within actin that weren't

1509
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,400
discussed in this paper and what

1510
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,839
that would

1511
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:12,800
um

1512
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,240
mean in terms of

1513
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,839
formulating

1514
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:16,880
this

1515
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,040
mathematical

1516
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,599
mathematical formulation of of the bdi

1517
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,680
model

1518
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,559
so

1519
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,720
i mean what the isomorphism just means

1520
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,440
is

1521
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,520
tell me the description at one level and

1522
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,800
i'll be able to translate it for you

1523
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,480
very quickly and directly into whatever

1524
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,160
the description is at the other level in

1525
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,680
both directions

1526
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,839
right i mean so it just means you know

1527
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:40,400
tell me tell me what you know tell me

1528
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,400
what it is that you want you know if i

1529
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,559
say do you want ice cream or do you want

1530
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,359
a pizza right tell me tell me that you

1531
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,200
like if you tell me that you like you

1532
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,880
want pizza twice as much as you like ice

1533
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:51,839
cream

1534
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,240
then it's very easy to just put

1535
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,280
you know

1536
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,319
a four

1537
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:58,400
you know in the you know in the in the

1538
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,160
distribution you know in the preference

1539
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,000
distribution over the observation of

1540
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,400
pizza and the two for ice cream

1541
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,599
and then softmax it and log it right and

1542
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:08,480
then

1543
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,720
like you know there's that's the

1544
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,839
description

1545
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:13,839
right so just in a very direct way just

1546
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:15,760
encodes relative desires for one thing

1547
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,520
versus another you know tell me what

1548
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,680
your beliefs are right i mean do you

1549
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,040
believe that pizza is to the left or to

1550
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,359
the right i can put that in as the

1551
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:24,800
different categories of hidden states

1552
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,000
that you're getting for a distribution

1553
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,119
over right so like it's just the point

1554
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:31,359
is that in either direction right give

1555
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,599
me the full psychological description

1556
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:34,640
i can translate it very

1557
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,880
straightforwardly um using the same

1558
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,359
elements every time as being desires or

1559
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:40,559
beliefs

1560
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:43,119
um you know give it to me at the uh

1561
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,440
at the mathematical level i can

1562
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,720
translate that into a description in

1563
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,480
terms of beliefs and desires right i

1564
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,400
mean it's just it's just one-to-one

1565
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,040
um i can't think of an example of hand

1566
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,839
um

1567
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:57,200
where um there would be any kind of like

1568
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,280
mismatch or an ability for one to um

1569
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,880
account for the other but

1570
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,400
um you know it's kind of hard to prove a

1571
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,160
negative right so i mean maybe you can

1572
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,839
give me an example but i can't think of

1573
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:08,000
one

1574
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,200
awesome

1575
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,720
jacob

1576
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,319
yeah i was just gonna say that i can't

1577
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,520
really think of an example uh right now

1578
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,400
um

1579
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,200
i

1580
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,960
i just found i found it really

1581
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,559
interesting with the usage of uh

1582
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,240
of just the word isomorphism because

1583
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,040
that

1584
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,680
like as you as you said it's just

1585
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,720
a bi-directional subjective map so it's

1586
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,800
basically equivalent it's just set in a

1587
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,000
different way

1588
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,880
so i can imagine that uh

1589
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,559
meaning that we can basically

1590
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,079
instead of the wikipedia page for the

1591
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,520
bdi model uh using all of these

1592
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,760
terms uh um

1593
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,240
like believe desire intention it could

1594
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,160
just be a set of active inference

1595
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,160
equations and that's the bdi model

1596
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,920
because it's an isomorphism

1597
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,160
right

1598
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:58,400
literally your your beliefs are just

1599
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,520
your cues

1600
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,040
right and

1601
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,440
your uh and your desires are just your

1602
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,200
uh you know pfos

1603
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,839
right i mean and i mean in the you know

1604
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:10,319
the way that we've uh you know we and

1605
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,480
others have tended to write it now

1606
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,319
right is to literally just explicitly to

1607
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:16,400
say like that desires are um or the

1608
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,160
preference distribution is p of o given

1609
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,040
c

1610
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,640
right where c is just a matrix that

1611
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,559
defines your preferences right so i mean

1612
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,760
it's a lot clearer to do that um

1613
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,079
than to just just leave it just p of o

1614
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:29,040
right i think that's part of the

1615
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,359
confusion is that uh it's not clear

1616
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:32,880
where the preferences come from but

1617
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,920
they're just it's just because their

1618
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,440
condition on this other thing c

1619
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,680
and c can be fixed or learnt but that's

1620
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,640
the basis of the calculation there

1621
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,920
yeah

1622
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,720
here we get into section four

1623
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,880
variational and expected free energy

1624
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,240
considerations

1625
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,960
and in large script we see the

1626
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,200
variational free energy equation

1627
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,240
dean

1628
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,480
what is the skydiver doing

1629
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,799
and during the one and the two

1630
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,839
we'll unpack more about the exact terms

1631
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:08,000
and and what is um coming into and

1632
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,319
coming out of this equation but just as

1633
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:12,640
an appetizer here what's the skydiver

1634
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,160
doing

1635
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,079
well now i've got the author here i i

1636
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,280
just put through that in there because i

1637
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,119
like that

1638
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:20,480
i don't think it's a metaphor but the

1639
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,359
analogy of of how so how do you respond

1640
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:24,559
when you jump out of the airplane and

1641
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:25,920
you know your parachute's not going to

1642
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,000
work do you uh

1643
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,760
do you go head first and really attack

1644
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,000
it or like what now what are you doing

1645
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,359
in terms of

1646
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:36,079
what your expectations are so maybe

1647
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,000
maybe

1648
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,839
that that that was a good analogy ryan

1649
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,520
maybe what like so where were you where

1650
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,680
were you going with that because

1651
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,799
yeah

1652
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,480
well i mean i think the point the point

1653
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,880
of those sorts of examples are just uh

1654
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,040
just to um

1655
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,680
sorry to put this to to show

1656
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,559
why

1657
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,319
it's not um

1658
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:59,839
it's not really correct to think about

1659
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:00,960
the um

1660
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,280
like prior uh you know this prior

1661
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,359
preference distribution even though it's

1662
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,359
you know it's again it's cast as a prior

1663
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:08,960
belief right

1664
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,040
um it's not really appropriate to think

1665
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,640
about that as a

1666
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,160
as a um

1667
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,200
a belief per say right i mean

1668
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,079
the um or an expectation at any at a

1669
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:22,799
psychological level of description um so

1670
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:24,480
you can and the way to contrast that

1671
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,400
right is you could say look like the

1672
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,359
person

1673
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:30,000
in a model where they don't want

1674
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,240
right to fall to the ground and die

1675
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,160
right that would be

1676
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,160
your your yeah that would be your pia

1677
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,720
though right it's your preference not to

1678
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,240
have the observation of hitting the

1679
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,160
ground and dying

1680
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,319
but what you act

1681
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:45,200
right

1682
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,000
is is your q of o given pi right it's

1683
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,160
what do i expect to observe given that i

1684
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,640
choose this policy versus that policy

1685
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,480
right so that's the that's the you know

1686
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,559
the leafy part right it's what i expect

1687
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:58,880
given that i do this or that and you

1688
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,599
know how close is that to how much does

1689
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,200
that diverge from

1690
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,040
what i what i want right which would be

1691
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,319
your pfl

1692
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:07,760
um so it's just it's just a clear

1693
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,359
example of how your

1694
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,040
you know your belief the expectations

1695
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,880
and your desire the expectations come

1696
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,280
apart

1697
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,559
and that and it just doesn't work

1698
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,720
conceptually i think one is think of one

1699
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,280
as like the same kind of uh

1700
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,839
uh kind of thing as the other

1701
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:25,520
yeah i i just thought as if i'm not

1702
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,680
going to get a soft landing how big of a

1703
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,880
crater can i

1704
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,799
can i create

1705
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,319
well that's that then is going to be

1706
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,000
packed into your preference distribution

1707
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,839
right

1708
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,040
right you would have some desire for you

1709
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,960
know to make a big you know conditional

1710
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,839
on you're going to die right like like

1711
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:43,839
you know you'd prefer right to make a

1712
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,319
big crater than a small crater

1713
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,160
and that would still just go in your pfo

1714
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,960
right so yeah yeah

1715
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,079
um

1716
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,079
jakub

1717
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:58,000
um i was just wondering um and this

1718
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,720
might be me uh

1719
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,960
thinking thinking

1720
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,760
or not too deeply about the equation uh

1721
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,559
rather but in this in this formulation

1722
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:10,720
where it's a variational free energy for

1723
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,960
each policy f of pi

1724
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,000
um does that does that imply when in the

1725
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,400
last sentence on this slide that uh free

1726
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,720
energy is a function of beliefs

1727
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,480
and a function of observations that

1728
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,720
doesn't mean that the free energy is

1729
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,119
essentially a function of three

1730
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:28,640
variables

1731
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,400
uh but in this case we are only writing

1732
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,400
it f of pi because

1733
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,359
uh it's always imp it's it's clear that

1734
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:39,119
it's a functional of beliefs and

1735
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,640
observations

1736
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,680
um

1737
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,960
or

1738
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,680
should we think of it more as

1739
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,680
just a function of

1740
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,000
each policy

1741
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,440
um i mean the way it's written here i

1742
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,359
mean i think that the most preferred way

1743
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:54,799
to think about it is i mean it literally

1744
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,520
just means that um using this equation

1745
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,680
you will calculate a different f value

1746
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,440
for each policy

1747
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,119
right i mean that's really it like you

1748
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:04,960
just there will be

1749
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,799
you're going to be computing

1750
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:09,040
some some variational for energy value

1751
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,640
for each policy and that's going to make

1752
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,960
up a distribution over policies

1753
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:17,040
um and um and uh i mean the

1754
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,960
the the tricky thing i guess here is is

1755
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,160
that um

1756
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,000
you know this isn't about

1757
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,079
this isn't you know f of f of pi here

1758
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,480
isn't about making decisions right this

1759
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,000
is just about you know something like

1760
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,920
evaluating evidence for

1761
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,079
um you know for various policies one

1762
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:34,640
because you you can't you calculate f

1763
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,559
when you already have the observation

1764
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:38,799
right so you can't really do this

1765
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:41,280
perspective decision making thing with f

1766
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,040
um so this is just basically a way of

1767
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,880
describing how um

1768
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,680
how under each policy your beliefs will

1769
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,720
change uh or wouldn't change right under

1770
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,000
when you know when you get conditional

1771
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
in each new observation that you get

1772
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,119
um

1773
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,400
and um and so it's not uh yeah so all it

1774
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,319
denotes really is is just you know you

1775
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:02,000
have a value of f for each policy and

1776
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,720
that makes it a distribution

1777
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,960
and that takes us to

1778
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:07,920
g

1779
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:12,319
expected free energy the letter after f

1780
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,359
and

1781
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:14,799
as shown here not sure if there's

1782
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:17,200
another reason for why it's g

1783
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,880
um this is

1784
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,040
equation 2.6 from the active inference

1785
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,960
textbook just for reference with some

1786
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:27,680
other versions of how g is framed

1787
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:29,920
g

1788
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,400
is a prospective value

1789
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,319
and they write decision making does not

1790
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:36,000
only require beliefs about past and

1791
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,280
present states

1792
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,200
it also requires making predictions

1793
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,640
about future states and future

1794
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:41,920
observations

1795
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,079
this requires taking the average i.e

1796
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,119
expected free energy g of pi given

1797
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:50,079
anticipated outcomes under each policy

1798
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,480
that one might choose

1799
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,480
and there's um

1800
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,319
a lot to say on expected free energy

1801
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,000
what is just one short note that

1802
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,599
somebody could add

1803
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:06,079
or ryan why was it placed here

1804
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,520
um i'm not sure i understand the

1805
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,760
question

1806
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,200
like why what

1807
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,960
why is why is expected free energy

1808
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,119
required why is variational free energy

1809
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:17,359
not enough

1810
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,119
i mean expected free energy is just is

1811
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:20,319
just what the system's trying to

1812
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:22,240
minimize when it's selecting a policy

1813
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,880
right so i mean it's just trying to i

1814
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,799
mean in this i mean this decomposition

1815
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:28,559
right here is often called like the risk

1816
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:31,440
risk with ambiguity decomposition but

1817
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,480
um

1818
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,119
i guess uh

1819
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:37,200
i like i think that i think that showing

1820
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,280
the um you know the risk term the risk

1821
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,119
term here provides a

1822
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:43,760
nice kind of intuition for um for again

1823
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,119
the separation between beliefs and

1824
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,520
desires and active inference because

1825
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,280
um you know you're

1826
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,079
you're uh so the

1827
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:54,880
the term underlined in in red there

1828
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,119
right so the kale divergence between q o

1829
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:59,039
given pi and p of l

1830
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:01,119
right i mean that's just saying

1831
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,920
that um you know how different

1832
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,920
are the observations i expect given that

1833
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,000
i'd use a given policy

1834
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
and you know how different how how

1835
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,440
different is that

1836
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,599
how different do i expect that to be

1837
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:14,559
from

1838
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:17,119
my uh my preferences are my desires

1839
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:18,559
right pfl

1840
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:21,839
um so the the closer those are together

1841
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:22,640
right

1842
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,599
the more uh the more similar i expect

1843
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:28,240
the observations to be under a policy

1844
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,640
to my preferred observations the smaller

1845
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,920
that's going to be

1846
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,839
and so if i'm trying to select the

1847
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:35,760
policy that minimizes

1848
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,119
uh g

1849
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:38,640
right then that means i'm going to

1850
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,079
select the policy that's going to get me

1851
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,000
as close that's going to get me as close

1852
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,920
to my preferred observations as possible

1853
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,079
right so literally just is that kl

1854
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:48,240
divergence literally just is trying to

1855
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,160
choose the policy that brings beliefs

1856
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,200
closest to desires

1857
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,000
very nice and then what does the blue

1858
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,799
term mean

1859
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:00,720
uh that's just an entropy term right so

1860
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,160
i mean it's just basically saying that

1861
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,319
the is what drives information seeking

1862
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:05,680
or part of what drives information

1863
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,520
seeking it's just uh

1864
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,000
it's just yeah basically the agents

1865
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,359
choose you know driven to choose

1866
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:14,079
policies that also are going to generate

1867
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,400
more precise expected observations

1868
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,359
observations that are going to

1869
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:21,440
disambiguate states more more easily

1870
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,079
great

1871
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:26,960
um here we'll explore it more in the dot

1872
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,920
one but there's a a description of the

1873
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,400
posterior probability distribution over

1874
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,799
policies p of pi

1875
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:37,760
and an expression involving the soft max

1876
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,400
symbol with the sigma we'll return to

1877
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,799
that later but this is just so that we

1878
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:44,720
can cover like the key experiments and

1879
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:48,399
the simulation results today

1880
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:50,960
this is also one other

1881
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,039
area of formalism we can explore in the

1882
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:54,400
coming discussions

1883
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,160
about precision and the relationship of

1884
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,039
beta and gamma and what the convergence

1885
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:02,960
towards means

1886
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,039
but we won't go there there is precision

1887
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:08,960
parameter in this model

1888
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,880
let's go to the dark room problem and

1889
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:13,920
many

1890
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,680
lines of pdf screen and ink has been

1891
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,440
written on the dark room

1892
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,280
in the active world since um perhaps

1893
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,359
first in at all 2012

1894
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:28,319
and also outside of active

1895
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,160
and um

1896
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,960
they write in a nutshell the concern is

1897
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,280
that if agents only act to minimize

1898
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,039
prediction error

1899
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:39,039
as opposed to acting under the impetus

1900
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:42,000
of a cognitive desire-like state

1901
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:42,799
then

1902
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:44,480
they ought to simply seek out very

1903
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,960
stable predictable environments such as

1904
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,880
a dark room and stay there

1905
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,200
would anybody like to add anything about

1906
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,440
this dark room problem or what is the

1907
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,000
relationship between doxastic and

1908
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,480
cognitive

1909
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,680
ontology

1910
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,919
and active

1911
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:10,640
i mean are you just asking what like

1912
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:13,280
what those words mean or what like how

1913
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,559
do you how do you use these words

1914
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:18,640
i mean i mean detoxastic is just a term

1915
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,880
that refers to you know the leafy you

1916
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,720
know like epistemic sorts of things

1917
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,760
right so so a doxastic ontology would be

1918
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,480
an ontology that includes beliefy things

1919
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,839
right whereas whereas

1920
01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:34,400
uh you know conative just refers to

1921
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,680
yeah being like targeted towards

1922
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,680
something right like something about you

1923
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,839
know desires or um

1924
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:40,960
um

1925
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,319
you know something things you want

1926
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:44,160
versus don't want things you like versus

1927
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:48,079
don't like right so um it's just uh you

1928
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:50,000
know when we say it's apparently purely

1929
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,559
a duck tastic ontologist just saying

1930
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:55,599
it might look as though superficially

1931
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:59,280
like the um the ontology proposed an act

1932
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,960
of inference like the things that exist

1933
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,839
in active inference are purely beliefy

1934
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:06,640
yeah that's all that means

1935
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,280
great and it's applied in the setting of

1936
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,960
this dark room

1937
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,520
um for the following two slides

1938
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:14,559
dean

1939
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,200
help us understand what concerns are

1940
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,559
addressed and what the child on the top

1941
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:23,839
right of the slide is doing

1942
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,520
yeah well so

1943
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,119
i'm not going to go through all all of

1944
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:29,920
the text but essentially this was my

1945
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,599
introduction to the darkroom problem

1946
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:33,680
because it was kind of the opposite of

1947
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,559
all my experience which is that i

1948
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,640
tend to find people that were curious

1949
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,119
and we're trying to move away from

1950
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:43,119
information

1951
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:44,720
um

1952
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,319
leveling offers

1953
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:49,599
or being static to information gain so

1954
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:51,520
first of all i had to learn what what

1955
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,760
the what the argument was about why

1956
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,480
people would actually in it who are

1957
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,280
normally social why they would move away

1958
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,599
from that social realm and into this

1959
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:03,280
sort of dark space

1960
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,680
under the con under the idea that

1961
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,760
active inference actually implies that's

1962
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,440
what people would do

1963
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,160
um and then secondly it was i was kind

1964
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,480
of trying to tie it into the idea of

1965
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,960
the refrigerator and where it is and and

1966
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,520
until you actually and then danny you

1967
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,120
and i talked about this a bit the

1968
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,120
pragmatic piece of until you actually

1969
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,399
open the refrigerator

1970
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:26,479
door which is on the kind of the next

1971
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:28,640
slide you don't really i mean you can

1972
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,238
have a belief that there's something of

1973
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:32,719
value in there but it can turn out that

1974
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:33,759
when

1975
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:36,319
you open the door or monty raises the

1976
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:37,839
curtain the thing that you were

1977
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:41,040
expecting uh turns out to be a value but

1978
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,880
not necessarily of that thing that you

1979
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:43,679
were

1980
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:46,399
you were setting yourself up to believe

1981
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:47,439
and so

1982
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:48,319
that

1983
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:50,719
that young individual spitting the coin

1984
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:52,319
out um

1985
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:53,920
maybe i guess i was just trying to be a

1986
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,399
little bit facetious there that it holds

1987
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:58,158
value but it doesn't hold the same kind

1988
01:08:58,158 --> 01:08:59,279
of um

1989
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:01,600
tasty value of say having a lick of an

1990
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,600
ice cream cone so

1991
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,719
again it was

1992
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:07,198
it was trying to move away from the idea

1993
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:08,080
that

1994
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,399
the beliefy stuff alone

1995
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:12,158
is satisf

1996
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:14,000
satisfactory or

1997
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,479
necessary i i always get those two mixed

1998
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:18,719
up but i think i i was just trying to

1999
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:21,120
reinforce the idea that you kind of need

2000
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,359
to have both so that you can compare and

2001
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,279
contrast so that you get a sense of what

2002
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:28,080
a person or what an agent is doing

2003
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,080
as they're getting past some of those

2004
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,158
shrouds or some of those

2005
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:33,279
um

2006
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:35,279
non-observables into the observable

2007
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:37,600
state

2008
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:42,080
thanks we'll keep going

2009
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,318
um

2010
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:47,520
this is unpacking some of the concerns

2011
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,839
about the apparent pure doxastic

2012
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:52,799
belief-oriented ontology of actin so

2013
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:55,600
ryan described earlier like is it about

2014
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,239
beliefs colliding and if so if it's

2015
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:01,760
purely doxastic then where is this um

2016
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,360
desire

2017
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:03,980
and um

2018
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:06,560
[Music]

2019
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:08,000
is there anything else that anybody

2020
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,040
wants to add here

2021
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:13,440
i would maybe um

2022
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:16,400
comment that i think this also relates

2023
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,120
to

2024
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,159
uh your

2025
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:20,159
um to the earlier thing that was

2026
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,880
discussed how this confusion might stem

2027
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,920
from people um misinterpreting

2028
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,760
or um mis

2029
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,920
uh confusing the terms predictive

2030
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,560
processing and active inference

2031
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,440
um

2032
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,960
and i feel like this addresses it as

2033
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,520
well where if we just if it's only

2034
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,800
beliefs

2035
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:39,600
uh

2036
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,640
then there is obviously a concern that

2037
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,640
once we're in a dark room

2038
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:45,440
we

2039
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,880
uh

2040
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,040
can't because uh

2041
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,199
if we're only in the regime of

2042
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:53,360
predictive processing there is no way

2043
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,800
for us to

2044
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,719
move to a different state

2045
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,600
or there isn't the formalism that that

2046
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,880
describes

2047
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,560
planning and action

2048
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,920
um

2049
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:04,960
but

2050
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,080
as

2051
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,400
i guess we'll get to in the other slides

2052
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,360
when we do include this

2053
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,960
planning

2054
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,400
we suddenly have

2055
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,719
desire like terms appearing within the

2056
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:20,159
mathematical formulation as well

2057
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,120
great

2058
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,360
yeah i want to be clear it's not like

2059
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,360
they're thrown in at hawk right they

2060
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,760
emerge naturally as like necessary

2061
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,920
components of any kind of

2062
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,760
you know like using this sort of

2063
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,600
framework or building it out to involve

2064
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,679
planning so it's not a like that they

2065
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:39,760
emerge naturally and necessarily it's

2066
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,520
not a it's not because someone's just

2067
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,560
kind of tacking them on

2068
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,840
great um and this is referring to that

2069
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,000
minimization of g

2070
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,840
the minimization of g

2071
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,440
drives the agent to seek out

2072
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,880
observations that will reduce

2073
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,719
uncertainty about the best way to

2074
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:58,880
subsequently bring about phenotype

2075
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,520
congruent or preferred outcomes

2076
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,800
so that's the information seeking

2077
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,800
another way to put this is that under

2078
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,280
dai an agent doesn't simply seek to

2079
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,600
minimize prediction error with respect

2080
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,480
to its current sensory input it seeks

2081
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,239
instead to minimize prediction error

2082
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:18,480
with respect to its global beliefs about

2083
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,800
the environment which entails seeking

2084
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,800
out observations that are expected to

2085
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,719
generate prediction errors

2086
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,719
such that uncertainty is minimized for

2087
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:29,600
the generative model as a whole

2088
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,480
and

2089
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,800
another aspect of this type of global

2090
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,280
prediction error minimization process is

2091
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,280
that it pertains not only to beliefs

2092
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,679
about states in the present but also to

2093
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,800
beliefs about the past and in the future

2094
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,760
and so this is leading to one of the

2095
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,000
claims which is that in addition to

2096
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,120
desires

2097
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,360
dai captures folk

2098
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,199
psychological experiences associated

2099
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:55,280
with the drive to both know about one's

2100
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,719
current states

2101
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:58,719
and learn what will happen when choosing

2102
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:00,719
to move to other states among other

2103
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:05,080
parameters in a generative model

2104
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,760
let's go into this generative model and

2105
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,960
come to the dark room simulation itself

2106
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,239
um

2107
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:13,920
and we'll

2108
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,600
unpack it more

2109
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,280
in future times

2110
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:21,120
but the prior over policies e of pi

2111
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,440
they write that um

2112
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,520
when the agent repeatedly chooses a

2113
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,520
policy this term increases the

2114
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,760
probability that the agent will continue

2115
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,400
to select that policy in the future at

2116
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,000
the level of the formalism this

2117
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,400
corresponds to an agent coming to expect

2118
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,239
that it will choose a policy

2119
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:40,320
simply because it has chosen that policy

2120
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,239
many times in the past

2121
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:44,000
this can be thought of as a type of

2122
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,080
habitization process but it doesn't have

2123
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,600
any direct connection to preferred

2124
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,480
outcomes because e of pi is not informed

2125
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,880
by other beliefs in the agent's model so

2126
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,800
here's the partially observable markov

2127
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,120
decision process just one representation

2128
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,679
of it and e is sort of floating there

2129
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:02,880
influencing but not being influenced by

2130
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,960
and we had some interesting discussions

2131
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,520
which we can return to another time

2132
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,080
about how we might be able to assess

2133
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,679
whether somebody is engaging in a

2134
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:14,320
behavior because they simply have

2135
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,760
habitually

2136
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,600
engaged in that behavior

2137
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,640
but they understand the actual mapping

2138
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,239
of how

2139
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:25,120
policies um relate to outcomes

2140
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,040
or in another case where somebody might

2141
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,159
be engaging in a behavior not because of

2142
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:33,040
habitualization but rather because they

2143
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,360
have um some sort of

2144
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,679
deviation from the appropriate mapping

2145
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:40,159
between policies and outcomes

2146
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:42,159
and maybe there's other ways so i

2147
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:43,760
thought that was very interesting how

2148
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,440
even within the same

2149
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,239
sort of sparse and first principles

2150
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:50,960
model similar behavioral outcomes might

2151
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,480
be observed

2152
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,640
on like a behavioral manifold

2153
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:55,760
and then

2154
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:57,679
different kinds of perturbations or

2155
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:00,159
evaluations might reduce uncertainty

2156
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:02,560
about what is giving rise to those

2157
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:06,480
conversion behaviors in in that case

2158
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:11,040
um okay dean with the ice cream truck

2159
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,560
and the eye

2160
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,159
no i'm gonna i'm gonna wait because i

2161
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:16,480
think that's i think this one and that

2162
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,560
and the next one are better to take up

2163
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,679
in a one two part because

2164
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:25,360
because if if ryan can come back there's

2165
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,199
some good questions i want to ask him

2166
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:28,400
about those

2167
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,880
two sections because this slide and the

2168
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,480
next one

2169
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,239
are kind of anti

2170
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:35,600
uh dark room

2171
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,560
and so

2172
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,960
i want to kind of pick his brain about

2173
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,880
what you know how we can sort of

2174
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,440
convince people that that that dark room

2175
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:46,320
problem is for such a small subset of

2176
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,640
the population that majority of

2177
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,880
the stuff that we're talking about here

2178
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,719
is done in in

2179
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:55,040
sort of social settings and social

2180
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:58,000
context and there's a third party

2181
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
sometimes it can observe an observer and

2182
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,760
what role that plays

2183
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,840
in trying to figure out what's what's

2184
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,480
going on here as we move from the

2185
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,120
from the idea of decisioning

2186
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,000
and and so forth so i'll wait

2187
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,360
great so here's part one of that

2188
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,280
and here's part two

2189
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,360
looking at uh social learning theory a

2190
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:20,480
little bit

2191
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,000
but let's go to

2192
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,199
the figure and to the simulation

2193
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:27,679
uh this is figure one simulation of an

2194
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:30,239
active inference agent deciding whether

2195
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:32,560
to eat some ice cream

2196
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:35,840
and um

2197
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,320
there's various ways to go about

2198
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,199
describing it but one of the key pieces

2199
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:43,440
that anyone can give a remark about what

2200
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,120
is occurring here

2201
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,040
is that there's three cases that are

2202
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,960
being compared

2203
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:52,080
there's a no desire case

2204
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,760
a weak desire

2205
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,520
reflected by this

2206
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:56,719
p of o

2207
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:59,520
and a strong desire case where the ratio

2208
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,800
between the two alternatives between um

2209
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,120
wanting the ice cream and or between the

2210
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,960
ice cream state and the no ice cream

2211
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,840
state is a sharper distinction in this

2212
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,360
second row

2213
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,760
so there's a case in which ice cream is

2214
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,080
in the fridge but where the kitchen is

2215
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,760
currently dark and so the agent doesn't

2216
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,440
know whether the fridge is to the left

2217
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:20,400
or right

2218
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,719
so it's like a tea maze

2219
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:23,920
setup

2220
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,560
with three possible cases

2221
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,960
one where there's no preference for

2222
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,840
observing ice cream or not a weak or a

2223
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:35,520
strong preference for that

2224
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,880
and then

2225
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,120
under these situations

2226
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,840
we can ask about what happens in terms

2227
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,600
of the action

2228
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:46,320
as well as the um beliefs and valence

2229
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:47,600
updates

2230
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,280
what else would you add about that ryan

2231
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,600
well i mean i think the point you know

2232
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,840
the point of this is just to show

2233
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,080
well i guess makes a couple you know i

2234
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,760
mean so dean mentioned that

2235
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,000
um you know the issue with the dark room

2236
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,679
right i mean as he said i mean as you

2237
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,000
said i mean this is essentially just a a

2238
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,239
particular very similar to

2239
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:10,239
to like a team is right i mean just

2240
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:11,520
putting a putting a different sort of

2241
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,360
semantics on top of it

2242
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,120
but the you know but the idea is just

2243
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,199
that um

2244
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:18,719
it's just

2245
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:20,480
set up to show that

2246
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:23,040
you know even without any kind of desire

2247
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:26,719
right just just resolving uncertainty um

2248
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:28,880
the agent will be driven to leave a dark

2249
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,320
room or do something to get rid of the

2250
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,440
dark room

2251
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,880
um so you don't need a desire right but

2252
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,040
but in fact any realistic agent is also

2253
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,520
going to have desires so

2254
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,760
um so in the case where there are

2255
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,440
desires then there's two different

2256
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:44,560
reasons

2257
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:45,440
why

2258
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:48,640
um no active inference agent will ever

2259
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,400
stay in a dark room or be motivated to

2260
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,800
stand a dark room like in all cases

2261
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,800
it will have a motivation

2262
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,360
to to leave so i mean the point is just

2263
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,120
to show right in some explicit

2264
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:02,640
simulations that um generically right

2265
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,280
like the this kind of dark room problem

2266
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:06,239
um

2267
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:09,600
just will it will just never apply um to

2268
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:10,960
active inference

2269
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,040
um again the stark room thing only

2270
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,719
applies if you assume the thing is just

2271
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:17,199
doing something like predictive coding

2272
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:18,719
but then somehow also assume that it's

2273
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:20,840
making decisions

2274
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,719
um

2275
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:26,320
but that's not active inference um

2276
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:27,520
because it's not a theory of decision

2277
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,840
making

2278
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,280
awesome

2279
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:39,280
um here is some description about the

2280
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:41,760
strength of the desire

2281
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,679
could have been shown before the figure

2282
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:46,239
but we wanted to introduce the the

2283
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:49,520
simulation setting

2284
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:53,520
and as described there is um

2285
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,520
a desire

2286
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:58,400
as well as an information seeking and i

2287
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,520
believe that's the two reasons why the

2288
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,080
agent will escape the dark room and

2289
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,239
there's there's other escape hatches

2290
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:08,000
depending on how one constructs their

2291
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,679
model um

2292
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,760
potentially like a hierarchical model

2293
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,440
might have a slightly different

2294
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,840
um explanation for why an agent does or

2295
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,920
doesn't stay in the room but even just

2296
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,719
within this single level model there's

2297
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:23,360
an information seeking as well as a

2298
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,360
preference realizing

2299
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:26,800
reason

2300
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:27,760
um

2301
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:31,880
any other comments here

2302
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:34,480
okay

2303
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:35,600
dean

2304
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,040
just a quick thing

2305
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,960
baby in the island i'll put you in the

2306
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:42,719
island go for it yeah uh so maybe ryan

2307
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:45,520
just just a just a quick this last last

2308
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,440
couple of senses however preference

2309
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,679
distributions are set to zero oh i'm

2310
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:50,960
sorry i'm not still on the previous

2311
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:53,199
slide daniel sorry can you go back one

2312
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:54,560
yeah go for it

2313
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:55,920
okay so however if preference

2314
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,679
distributions are set to zero as in our

2315
01:20:57,679 --> 01:20:59,920
no desire simulation such that no

2316
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,679
outcome is desired over any other net

2317
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:03,920
and active inferences will nonetheless

2318
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,679
be driven to choose

2319
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:07,440
behaviors that will maximize information

2320
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,040
gain okay that all makes sense that's

2321
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,400
just the background

2322
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,000
this is the part i was curious about

2323
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,280
while this might reasonably be

2324
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,520
considered a motivational influence it

2325
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,719
is

2326
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:19,040
basically less plausible that it should

2327
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,040
be considered cognitive

2328
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,800
and may therefore be better seen as a

2329
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,440
type of doctastic drive

2330
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,199
here the formalism may therefore help us

2331
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:29,679
to recover and potentially nuance

2332
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:31,440
the folk psychological distinction

2333
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,840
between desire and curiosity these types

2334
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:37,040
of drives seem to differ fundamentally i

2335
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,639
agree with you but i was wondering if

2336
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:40,480
you could maybe

2337
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:43,199
explain why that

2338
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:44,239
should be

2339
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:46,080
something that we should keep separate

2340
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:49,120
the idea of desire and curiosity i know

2341
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,360
you go into explaining it a little more

2342
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,920
into the paper but

2343
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,440
why did you want to point that out to

2344
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,040
readers

2345
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,239
well i mean i think there's a couple

2346
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:00,320
things i mean i mean one i think that

2347
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,320
you know these things are both driving

2348
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,000
you know decisions about what to do

2349
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,639
right so in some way they motivate they

2350
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:09,840
both motivate behavior right but but at

2351
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,199
the same time

2352
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:12,960
you know and i think uh this is

2353
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,280
something you know that alex keeper and

2354
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:16,400
you know pointed out when we were

2355
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,159
writing this as opposed to just you know

2356
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:19,440
so it's not just me

2357
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,840
um but you know pointed out that um you

2358
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,280
know there is this kind of

2359
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,480
um

2360
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:27,520
fairly clear difference um between the

2361
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,480
um

2362
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,000
this uh you know curiosity or

2363
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,719
epistemically driven um sort of behavior

2364
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:35,040
um from the kind of desire-driven

2365
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,880
behavior and the the

2366
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:39,199
the kind of clear differences is the vm

2367
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:40,960
this epistemically driven motivation

2368
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,960
isn't um it isn't driven toward anything

2369
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,040
right it doesn't have a target it's not

2370
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,120
trying to get one thing versus another

2371
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:47,920
um

2372
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:49,920
all it's trying to do is just

2373
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,360
um

2374
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:52,719
you know just become clearer about

2375
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:55,679
what's out there um essentially right so

2376
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:58,239
so the fact that it lacks a target um is

2377
01:22:58,239 --> 01:22:59,920
really i think what makes the what makes

2378
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,440
the distinction clear

2379
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:02,400
um

2380
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,840
but the i mean beyond that i think

2381
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,159
motivation was just a was just to show

2382
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:08,880
that um

2383
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,400
you know like just a

2384
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,400
you know generically right like the

2385
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,560
belief desire intention principle

2386
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,080
doesn't really um

2387
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,960
doesn't really say anything about uh

2388
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,880
you know types of types of desires

2389
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,159
there's nothing really explicitly just

2390
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:25,280
in that very very simple um

2391
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:26,560
way of um

2392
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,239
describing the framework that that

2393
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:29,520
separates out

2394
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,600
uh information seeking from from rewards

2395
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,280
to gang right um so

2396
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,840
you know so you could right if all

2397
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:38,960
you're doing

2398
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,520
is trying to you know compare active

2399
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,120
inference to um

2400
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,080
do

2401
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,000
you know the bdi model very simply

2402
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,280
stated then um then this is able to kind

2403
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,600
of nuance a little more right like

2404
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:54,880
different different things that that um

2405
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,800
might look like you know promotive

2406
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,159
motivational

2407
01:23:58,159 --> 01:23:59,040
kinds of things

2408
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,159
[Music]

2409
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:04,239
but there are separated those um

2410
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:06,239
on you know why decisions are made for

2411
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:07,679
one thing versus another more kind of

2412
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:09,600
tied to beliefs in a different way

2413
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,679
um you know that being said i mean at

2414
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:13,920
the same time i think that um you know

2415
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,679
like full psychology

2416
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:16,480
more

2417
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,040
more broadly i think i think uh very

2418
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:22,480
intuitively and naturally um does you

2419
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,000
know recognize the difference between

2420
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,760
things like curiosity

2421
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,360
right and things like and things like

2422
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:28,880
reward-driven behavior right those are

2423
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,159
concepts that we have just in our

2424
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:32,800
natural kind of folk psychology um you

2425
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,639
know so active inference just captures

2426
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:36,719
those right i mean

2427
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:38,000
i um

2428
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
yeah i talked about this um just as an

2429
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,320
example of you know how intuitive i

2430
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,639
think and like natural the sort of

2431
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:46,639
aspect is you know and i just like think

2432
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:48,159
of like most of the behaviors that say

2433
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:50,159
like my little dog does

2434
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:51,840
um you know if i look at if i look at

2435
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,440
what my dog does

2436
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:56,080
90 of the time it's way more information

2437
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,000
seeking than it is reward seeking you

2438
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:58,800
know

2439
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,320
she searches out for some food a couple

2440
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,639
times a day but i take her in the car

2441
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,080
she's pulling left and right to see

2442
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,600
what's out the window and how that

2443
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,760
changed all the time you know any little

2444
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:09,600
sound perks up looks right none of those

2445
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,840
things are reward driven they're all

2446
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:14,080
just information seeking

2447
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,880
um so i mean very very clearly that's a

2448
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,400
big part of

2449
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,000
you know what drives

2450
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,400
us and other animals to do um so so the

2451
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:23,840
point was just to just to kind of show

2452
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,159
that active inference captures that in a

2453
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:28,000
certain sense it adds some granularity

2454
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,400
to um to at least what the bdi model

2455
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,719
says but but in that case the bdi model

2456
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:34,719
is kind of too uh too coarse grained and

2457
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:36,159
i think normal hulk psychology doesn't

2458
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:39,120
include those things already

2459
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,560
great

2460
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,320
um

2461
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:45,840
also to be returned to dean

2462
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,080
yeah because ryan just basically

2463
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,520
answered it all these two images are

2464
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,760
basically doing is separating out the

2465
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,400
sort of goal directed from the

2466
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,639
curiosity which is

2467
01:25:56,639 --> 01:25:59,280
you know the the image on the right is

2468
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,719
basically a documentary about the

2469
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:02,800
franklin expedition where

2470
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,960
they were going out to the event horizon

2471
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,639
but they never returned

2472
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:07,679
so

2473
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:10,080
did they have a goal probably but was

2474
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:13,520
that their curiosity being carried out

2475
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,440
i think we i think we've got to be able

2476
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:18,239
to make sure that we appreciate both so

2477
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:20,400
that's all i wanted

2478
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:23,600
this makes me think like um

2479
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,719
are you driven to watch the sunset over

2480
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:28,080
the horizon

2481
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,920
or are you driven to find out what's at

2482
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,080
the end of the rainbow and what's over

2483
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,600
the horizon

2484
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,760
and that's the sort of like infinite

2485
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:38,639
open-ended curiosity drive beyond the

2486
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:39,840
horizon

2487
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,080
versus the preferred

2488
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:45,280
specific state that one can desire in

2489
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:47,040
terms of their

2490
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,800
um observations and reduce the

2491
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:51,520
divergence there but

2492
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:52,480
cool

2493
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,718
um

2494
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,440
wishful thinking we'll come back to

2495
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,440
we're just leaving notes so that we can

2496
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,520
um

2497
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:04,159
have more to discuss later because these

2498
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:05,600
are all like

2499
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:08,400
there's such vital threads um

2500
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,800
ryan and maxwell and alex

2501
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,960
because they um

2502
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,719
touch to our

2503
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:16,560
day-to-day experience

2504
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,719
in a way that

2505
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:20,159
few other um

2506
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:22,400
frameworks and and even papers within

2507
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:25,760
active do so affect and the role of

2508
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,320
affect and precision curiosity these are

2509
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,120
all just like

2510
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:32,880
terms that

2511
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,120
touch humans

2512
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,159
um

2513
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:37,760
one thing that i you know that i think

2514
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,520
is probably worth just touching

2515
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,960
animating is something maybe you guys

2516
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,400
would want to talk about in the future

2517
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,320
you know maybe when i'm not around the

2518
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,880
other any other sections not sure but

2519
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,920
um you know uh so there is a probably a

2520
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,360
distinction that's worth keeping in mind

2521
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,679
between uh curiosity per se

2522
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:55,679
and um and goal-directed information

2523
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:57,679
seeking um i think some of the you know

2524
01:27:57,679 --> 01:27:58,960
examples you guys have mentioned have

2525
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,320
been more kind of along the lines of one

2526
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,239
versus the other so i think it might be

2527
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:04,080
good to just just keep that distinction

2528
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:07,440
clear that um you know in in vanilla

2529
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,360
active inference um it is really

2530
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,239
something more just kind of like

2531
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:11,600
curiosity just kind of like

2532
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,840
independently driven just kind of you

2533
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,040
know look where you're going to get the

2534
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,400
most information

2535
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,480
um whereas you know the construct of

2536
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:20,400
directed exploration

2537
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,639
um you know and reinforcement learning

2538
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:25,520
and um and what also you know often

2539
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:26,639
something that can emerge i think a

2540
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:27,600
little more clearly and like

2541
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:30,239
sophisticated active inference um

2542
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:32,400
is um you know as information seeking

2543
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,639
specifically or you know in the service

2544
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:37,520
of knowing you know how to get your goal

2545
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,320
um

2546
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:40,800
you know the the the curiosity version

2547
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,480
that we're showing here

2548
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:45,040
it has the effect of helping the agent

2549
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:46,880
get what it wants

2550
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:47,679
but

2551
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:49,760
but the drive to seek out information

2552
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:52,159
isn't actually itself

2553
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:53,760
due to the fact that the agent thinks it

2554
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,920
will help it get its goal

2555
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,280
you know it's just driven to seek the

2556
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,760
information independently

2557
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:04,400
whereas um whereas uh in in other

2558
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:07,360
yeah like in sophisticated inference um

2559
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:08,400
the

2560
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,000
agent is actually doing something more

2561
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,159
like i'm going to look over here because

2562
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:13,840
i think looking over here is actually

2563
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,159
going to help me get to what i want

2564
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:17,840
better right so this is kind of

2565
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,600
strategic information seeking and that's

2566
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:20,880
that's a little different than just like

2567
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,840
intrinsic curiosity so um just something

2568
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,120
to keep clear

2569
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:28,239
that's quite interesting it kind of

2570
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:31,199
ties a braid back

2571
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:33,679
but let's explore that later

2572
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:35,199
um here

2573
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:37,120
we have a nice

2574
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,920
uh clean representation of the summary

2575
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:42,159
of the main argument

2576
01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:43,920
their proposed solution is somewhat

2577
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,280
deflationary

2578
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,280
in the sense that it simply argues that

2579
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,920
the functional role of desire

2580
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,400
not the experience of desire is

2581
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:53,600
straightforward

2582
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,840
straightforwardly present in the dai

2583
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:58,960
formalism and then in more detail they

2584
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,040
argue that and they provide four points

2585
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:02,960
which it'll be great to go over with

2586
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:04,880
with the authors

2587
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,880
based on those considerations the

2588
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:09,040
apparent problem posed by purely

2589
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:12,000
doxastic looking constructs is simply

2590
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,080
not a problem

2591
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,239
there are beliefs and desires in the

2592
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:19,959
active inference framework

2593
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:22,400
um

2594
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:25,120
perhaps we could have uh explored this

2595
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,360
more with the formalism so we'll bring

2596
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:30,880
it up to uh talking more about f

2597
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:33,520
but won't go into it now we'll return to

2598
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,440
the letters later

2599
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:38,239
and then the appendix is uh very

2600
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:39,840
informative

2601
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:43,040
there's a description of all the states

2602
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:45,760
and the factors that are used in the

2603
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,199
simulation

2604
01:30:47,199 --> 01:30:50,159
and in the model stream one which is by

2605
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:51,840
the way ryan it's um

2606
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,840
our our most popular

2607
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:56,560
series was model stream one

2608
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:58,239
it was it was uh

2609
01:30:58,239 --> 01:31:00,000
it was a fan favorite

2610
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,760
but um

2611
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,840
it's some similar

2612
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:06,239
concepts and matlab scripts so the

2613
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:08,159
appendix describes how the

2614
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:09,360
figure one

2615
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:12,239
results were generated and maybe we'll

2616
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:14,800
see if anybody can run that and execute

2617
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,239
it we can play with a few different

2618
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:17,520
things and

2619
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:20,080
take some of these qualitative

2620
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,920
linguistics and

2621
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:24,159
even mutate the simulation a little bit

2622
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:27,040
see where that takes us

2623
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,440
we'll close out with our usual closing

2624
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:30,639
slide

2625
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:32,480
um so

2626
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,400
who would like to take the first last

2627
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,719
word

2628
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:42,239
yes dean then yeah then ryan first of

2629
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:45,679
all thanks for uh shepherding us these

2630
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:48,400
three cats through this uh paper because

2631
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,159
there's an awful lot of stuff to try to

2632
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:51,440
cover in a

2633
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:52,880
pretty short period of time and it was

2634
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:56,480
and it's easy i think to sort of go

2635
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:58,159
i don't want to say tangentially but go

2636
01:31:58,159 --> 01:32:00,080
deeper into some of the parts of the

2637
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:02,239
paper because um

2638
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:04,080
uh for me it was one of those ones where

2639
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:06,159
you i would go back and and have to

2640
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:08,080
reflect on something after i read a

2641
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:10,880
section and then try to fit it into the

2642
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,040
larger picture that was

2643
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,639
ryan i think the paper

2644
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:16,719
did a very good job of sort of ordering

2645
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:18,800
through what you were trying to say in

2646
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:21,360
terms of the reassurance of how

2647
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:23,360
the the quantitative

2648
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,520
uh and the the modeling of the

2649
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:27,120
psychosocial

2650
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:28,320
could be

2651
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:30,800
seen as working with each other as

2652
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:33,360
opposed to though this doesn't answer

2653
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:36,159
what this other thing questions but it

2654
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:38,400
does cause this is this was a paper that

2655
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,560
for me i won't speak for the others but

2656
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,480
i had to read the section and then try

2657
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:45,120
to plug it back into the overall

2658
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,520
narrative that was being told and again

2659
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:50,880
i think part of that is because the the

2660
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,960
translation from the

2661
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:55,840
stuff that's typically seen as

2662
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:59,120
the quantitative part is hard to

2663
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:01,840
move into the qualitative part i think

2664
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,920
that's that's a challenge for anybody

2665
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:06,080
that tries to move back and forth

2666
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:09,440
between those two things but uh

2667
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:12,320
yeah i mean in terms of

2668
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,800
in terms of making a case and and

2669
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,199
providing what i think people need to

2670
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:20,239
sort of see the two in the same light

2671
01:33:20,239 --> 01:33:22,880
thank you appreciate it

2672
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:26,560
sure i'm happy i'm happy if it's helpful

2673
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,470
yeah i think um

2674
01:33:29,470 --> 01:33:32,960
[Music]

2675
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:35,280
i guess there are two points that i

2676
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,600
like to touch on firstly

2677
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:42,000
i think i thought it was very helpful to

2678
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:46,159
map these folks these concepts that

2679
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:48,960
everyone even though everyone uh i guess

2680
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:49,760
that's

2681
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:52,159
the nature of psychology that everyone

2682
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:54,239
will have a slightly

2683
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:56,480
slightly different um probably

2684
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:59,840
distribution on of what they these terms

2685
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:02,800
actually mean but i think it's in just

2686
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:05,120
learning about active inference it's

2687
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:08,000
helpful to link the math

2688
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,120
mathematical formulation and even just

2689
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:13,199
the active inference ontology which

2690
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:14,880
itself can be

2691
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:18,320
very cumbersome at times to these very

2692
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:21,199
um intuitive concepts

2693
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:23,600
and i think as

2694
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:26,080
we get we're starting to explore

2695
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:27,199
modeling

2696
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:30,159
within the actin flap as well i think

2697
01:34:30,159 --> 01:34:32,800
it's it will be really helpful to

2698
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:33,760
use

2699
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:34,880
this

2700
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:38,000
isomorphism between active inference and

2701
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,040
folk psychology to explain

2702
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,360
the the behavior of agents within these

2703
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:45,520
models and

2704
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:46,480
not

2705
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,880
beyond a dark room problem when there is

2706
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:52,400
some unexpected behavior of an agent we

2707
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:55,920
can directly look at okay how how did

2708
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:56,880
um

2709
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:01,440
this tensor change its values and

2710
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:02,960
describe it with

2711
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,719
this uh

2712
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:08,400
psycho psychological ontology so i i

2713
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,480
think personally that's

2714
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:12,880
uh the most exciting thing about this

2715
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,670
paper for me um

2716
01:35:14,670 --> 01:35:16,080
[Music]

2717
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:17,040
yeah

2718
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:18,800
well here i mean if that's i mean if

2719
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:19,760
that's the kind of thing that you're

2720
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,520
interested in then

2721
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:23,520
i mean that's kind of the whole um

2722
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:25,280
it's kind of the whole motivation of you

2723
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:26,480
know for instance like computational

2724
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:28,639
psychiatry right which is like the area

2725
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:31,280
that i currently work in right you you

2726
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:34,000
take for instance clinical populations

2727
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,080
where people may behave in unexpected or

2728
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:38,080
ways or ways that don't necessarily seem

2729
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:39,840
like they're all that adaptive right

2730
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,280
then you can just fit these models to

2731
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,639
their behavior and you can figure out

2732
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:44,480
okay well what is making their behavior

2733
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,800
abnormal right is it is it something

2734
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,239
about an overly precise preference

2735
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:50,800
distribution or is it something about

2736
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:51,679
um

2737
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:52,560
you know

2738
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:54,719
the belief that states uh states

2739
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:58,159
transition to uh to um into volatile or

2740
01:35:58,159 --> 01:35:59,920
uncertain away or you know things like

2741
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:02,560
that so i mean it is the yeah i mean the

2742
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,480
kind of uh you know the major point is

2743
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:05,760
you can use these novels in empirical

2744
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:06,719
studies to figure out what the

2745
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:08,080
mechanisms are that are leading to

2746
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:12,960
healthy and unhealthy behavior um and

2747
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:14,960
that can

2748
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:16,480
give you kind of guiding information

2749
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:17,920
toward you know designing better

2750
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:20,480
treatments or you know trying to measure

2751
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:21,920
these things in a more quantitative way

2752
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:25,040
things like that and um and the uh you

2753
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:26,880
know and just as i've said i mean this

2754
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,840
is all

2755
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:29,440
um using

2756
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,679
using tasks that uh you know that

2757
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:34,320
involve some kind of goal right like

2758
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:36,639
seeking some kind of reward or social

2759
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:39,360
approval or you know whatever it is that

2760
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:41,360
you know humans seek out you could do

2761
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,360
that right unless you have a

2762
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:45,119
straightforward way to map

2763
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:47,199
um the formalism each element of the

2764
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:49,280
formalism to

2765
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:51,600
you know the reason that we think people

2766
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,920
behave in the way that they do right so

2767
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:56,400
so on so i guess i'm just saying if if

2768
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:57,679
that's an interest of yours then i would

2769
01:36:57,679 --> 01:36:59,280
think that you would um you'd probably

2770
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:00,800
be a fan of a lot of the a lot of the

2771
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,400
computational psychiatry literature more

2772
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,639
broadly both you know both the active

2773
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:06,000
inference part which is a lot of what my

2774
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,560
lab does but but also just the broader

2775
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,480
um computational psychiatric community

2776
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:11,840
that uses reinforcement learning and

2777
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,440
drift fusion models and all the other

2778
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:15,679
from you know all the other classics

2779
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:17,920
that are out there

2780
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:21,119
cool and it opens it up to

2781
01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:22,159
what

2782
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:24,560
organizations want and what do cells

2783
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:27,119
want and all these other

2784
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:28,159
um

2785
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:29,840
transpositions

2786
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:32,159
well ryan really appreciate that last

2787
01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:35,520
minute um

2788
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:37,520
belief or desire

2789
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:39,199
combination thereof

2790
01:37:39,199 --> 01:37:42,320
to join us it certainly helped

2791
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,719
resolve our uncertainty a lot and it's a

2792
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:46,560
great conversation

2793
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:48,960
in the coming two weeks we're gonna be

2794
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,840
with hopefully some more authors and

2795
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:55,840
more lab participants and just

2796
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:59,360
i'm looking forward to taking some notes

2797
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:05,400
thank you see you all soon and bye

2798
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:18,239
you
