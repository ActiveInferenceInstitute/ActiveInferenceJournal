hello everyone welcome to actin flap

4
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,800
live stream number 46.2

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,239
it's june 22 2022

6
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,559
welcome to the actin flap we're a

7
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,640
participatory online lab that is

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,800
communicating learning and practicing

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,200
applied active inference you can find us

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,600
at the links on the slide

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,840
this is a recorded and an archived live

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,520
stream so please provide us with

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,239
feedback so we can improve our work

14
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,079
all backgrounds and perspectives are

15
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:58,960
welcome

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,039
and will follow video etiquette for live

17
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,120
streams

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,360
head over to

19
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,640
activeinference.org to learn about

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,320
participating in

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,520
live streams or in the many other active

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,320
lab projects

23
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,240
we're here in our third discussion on

24
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,520
the paper

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,119
active inference models do not

26
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,000
contradict folk psychology by smith

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
ramstead and kiefer we had a zero

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,320
with ryan joining

29
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,560
and jakub and dean where we talked

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,880
through some of the background of this

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,000
paper

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,159
and last week in the dot one

33
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,280
we

34
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,520
had a great discussion went a lot of

35
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,680
ways as dot ones do

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,600
and opened up some threads to continue

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,000
discussing in this dot two

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,240
i know each of you have some

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,479
things to bring up there's also a few

40
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,079
key sections of the paper that we

41
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,320
haven't gone into in much detail

42
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,799
so there'll be a lot to do in the dot

43
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,520
two and of course everybody watching

44
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,439
live is also welcome to

45
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,920
make comments

46
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,800
we'll start with uh just an introduction

47
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,399
and warm-up

48
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,280
we

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,160
can say hi and add anything else that

50
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,200
we're looking forward to talking about

51
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,080
or to reducing our uncertainty about

52
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,720
through today's discussion or maybe even

53
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,200
if it's not too early where we'd like to

54
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,080
be heading as we

55
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,440
take off on this dot 2 and leave the 46

56
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,800
series how does it

57
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,959
result results in us being different

58
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,120
thinking differently acting differently

59
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,640
in the rest of our

60
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,879
post-46 lives

61
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,760
so

62
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,760
i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

63
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,040
california

64
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,800
and

65
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,040
just a conversation with dean before we

66
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,200
began about some other

67
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,040
core concepts

68
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,040
other than beliefs desires and

69
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,159
intentions

70
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,560
so what other acronym models could we

71
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,840
use

72
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,680
what other kinds of models are

73
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,440
consistent or

74
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,120
where else can active inference be

75
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,360
providing us extra information or

76
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,120
utility

77
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,200
and a few other things and i'll pass it

78
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,360
to dean

79
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,680
hey stanley i'm dean here in calgary um

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,040
i think what i'm

81
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,560
i'm curious about is a couple of things

82
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,360
as i said i'm i'm curious about things

83
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,319
are behaviors that appear to be targeted

84
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,680
versus

85
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,319
behaviors that appear to be non-targeted

86
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,799
and there was some there was

87
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,319
there's some reference to that in this

88
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,280
paper

89
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,000
the other thing as i said i'm kind of

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,760
curious about is

91
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,799
this

92
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,319
moving to the place of saying that

93
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,080
active inference has these different

94
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,040
types

95
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,200
be it extended or

96
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,519
decision making or motor active imprints

97
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,080
and what the implications of that are

98
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,239
i mean bottom line for me is i think if

99
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,400
we can

100
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,760
operationalize that word

101
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,040
um

102
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,760
through active inference that

103
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,680
it shouldn't be difficult to figure out

104
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,239
that that applies to behaviors that

105
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,239
there's operations

106
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,560
grounding a lot of behavior so

107
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,760
yeah that's what i'm kind of curious

108
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,839
about the outpatient to uh give it

109
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,360
great to be back uh it's my second time

110
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,759
on here really uh appreciate this i'm on

111
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,479
33 so i've listened through lecture 33

112
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,000
so i'm almost

113
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,759
caught up to uh

114
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,520
the current i look forward to having

115
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,199
daniel on my channel

116
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,360
friday 4 p.m

117
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,040
eastern time

118
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,400
you know there's so much to active

119
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,479
inference because it's your useful

120
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,479
framework for

121
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,240
countless different fields and

122
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,400
specifically related to this i had you

123
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,759
know definitely thoughts and then how do

124
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,440
we look at the

125
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,600
mechanics of the equation

126
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,840
versus

127
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,240
you know we call folks ecology but uh i

128
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,479
would put that generally into uh what i

129
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,919
would call introspection i have a

130
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,759
background in theology

131
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,160
and uh yes i've thought a lot about

132
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,440
introspection

133
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,039
and trying to match

134
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,160
what we see through various methods of

135
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,680
introspection

136
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,880
and

137
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,479
you know maybe where the science and

138
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,320
mathematics is leading us

139
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,000
and also i guess the field of

140
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,639
psychometrics that isn't necessarily

141
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,160
introspection but it may or may not uh

142
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,880
match uh the equations and then how do

143
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,440
we describe the phenomenon uh you

144
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,120
understand them or maybe they're not

145
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,960
descriptibles and that we describe them

146
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,960
with the mathematical equations and

147
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,120
there's not really any good way to uh

148
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,680
translate that into uh words that would

149
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,560
be

150
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,039
you know understandable to uh

151
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,360
your folk uh common people in in that

152
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,360
way

153
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,160
awesome ali

154
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,280
uh hi i'm ali i'm an independent

155
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
researcher from iran

156
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,800
i'm very glad to be here and i'm looking

157
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,039
forward to learn more about

158
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,600
uh this fascinating paper

159
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,759
uh especially i'm interested in

160
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,120
exploring

161
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,400
uh phenomenological aspects of

162
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,759
bdi

163
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,520
belief desire and intention and also

164
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,240
to explore

165
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,440
somewhat more deeply the philosophical

166
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,240
underpinnings of

167
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,800
representation versus simulation aspect

168
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,520
of modeling

169
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,599
vdi in active inference

170
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,360
and

171
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,840
yeah that's it for me

172
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,360
great

173
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,800
let's uh begin with this more taxonomic

174
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,000
question

175
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,800
about the types of active inference

176
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,960
so we can think about the different

177
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,800
types that we've heard about in this

178
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,560
paper and elsewhere and then

179
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,080
whether or not we have something to

180
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,639
contribute about adding a specific type

181
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,599
to this list that will continue to grow

182
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,280
what does it mean or entail that we do

183
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,080
have

184
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,520
these different types so just to

185
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,400
review

186
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,199
in

187
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,199
this paper 46

188
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,520
they make a very clear upfront

189
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,000
distinction between what they

190
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,880
characterize as motor active mai and

191
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,880
decision active

192
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,080
and there's

193
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,000
a few differences

194
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,199
between motor and decision

195
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,599
who can list one category of difference

196
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,479
well the motor active inference doesn't

197
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,919
typically

198
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,240
require that you have to make a decision

199
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,440
it's more

200
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,639
a reaction or a reflective

201
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,000
form

202
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,520
uh as

203
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,520
compared to the decision active entrance

204
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,120
which does as the paper say

205
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,400
likely map over to the desire

206
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,080
question

207
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,960
yes

208
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,919
so

209
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,000
the motor ai

210
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,039
was connected to like motor reflex

211
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,360
are there decision-making reflex

212
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,520
does even if that's not

213
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,400
a classical usage like in the reflex arc

214
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,160
of the spine or something

215
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,160
moving the hand away from a hot surface

216
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,440
are there

217
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,559
cognitive refluxes

218
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,120
not really sure i i just i'm i basically

219
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,719
was asking in the

220
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,120
in the context of people who are writing

221
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,640
these papers now

222
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,320
who are bringing

223
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,040
the question down to a motor operational

224
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,120
behavior standpoint

225
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,399
how

226
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,760
breaking active inference up into

227
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,839
different classifications

228
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,240
is that in response to

229
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,399
a bigger problem which is

230
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,040
the behavior doesn't necessarily

231
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,839
um

232
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,360
behavior doesn't necessarily isn't

233
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,120
something that that's necessarily we're

234
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,480
able to conveniently um dissolve

235
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,560
down to or concentrate down into motor

236
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,640
operations

237
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,240
or or extensions or any of those other

238
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,680
different things that

239
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,680
that the writers tend to want to focus

240
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,720
on now

241
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,800
as opposed to

242
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,720
sort of the complexity and the variety

243
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,360
and the randomness of behavior

244
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,240
as a whole so

245
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,080
yes

246
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,000
great um so this is from page

247
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,519
81. oh yes i'll go for it

248
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,080
uh well i think uh the distinction

249
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,040
between

250
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,480
m a i and dai uh

251
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,320
is not

252
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,720
globally accepted among uh

253
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,080
well

254
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,079
various researchers

255
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,640
for instance uh if we look at the work

256
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,360
of

257
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,440
alan bertos

258
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,880
uh french

259
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,160
neuroscientist especially his book

260
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,600
i think it was called

261
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,959
the brain's sense of movement uh in that

262
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,640
book uh he actually

263
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,920
has a famous

264
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,440
code namely perception is simulated

265
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,480
action

266
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,600
uh and uh by this he means that he

267
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,839
implies that perception and

268
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,880
motion

269
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,680
and motion and perception or

270
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,480
thinking for that matter are irreducibly

271
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,920
interconnected

272
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,440
and so

273
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,720
the former

274
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,519
the former defines the latter

275
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,800
because of

276
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,320
the

277
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,880
intrinsic motricity

278
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,760
uh

279
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,560
of the creatures endowed with uh nervous

280
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,640
systems uh so i'm not sure if we can

281
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,000
distinguish between mai and dai in such

282
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,959
a

283
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,519
clear-cut manner

284
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,839
because as we know that

285
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,000
most motor

286
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,240
most

287
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,600
motricity and motor

288
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,120
or actions

289
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,480
are also

290
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,800
uh

291
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,959
pre-predefined in that perception or

292
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,560
many other thought processes

293
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,240
thanks dude

294
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,720
yes i i didn't know enough about

295
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,680
the

296
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,720
bdi model or the you know i'm still new

297
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,320
to the language especially of the

298
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,000
authors of this paper to the general

299
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,079
philosophy but you know i was talking a

300
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,279
lot about last week about the unified i

301
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,000
and higher order rules so if you want to

302
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,680
look like decision as higher order rules

303
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,079
and they would have some sort of uh

304
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,600
power like usually when we think of

305
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,000
consciousness in a unified eye

306
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,920
that makes decisions

307
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,000
and

308
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,240
we talked about eliminativism and the

309
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,880
implications of the equations are the

310
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,639
eliminativistic or not

311
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,920
and uh

312
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,320
yours is there what what direction does

313
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,240
the evidence take us

314
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,560
and so in terms of motor control like i

315
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,120
mentioned fodar's uh

316
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,560
modular mind

317
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,480
that it could be that uh

318
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,920
you know it's a threshold it's a free

319
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,160
energy principle

320
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,399
and it could just be action

321
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,839
action reaction

322
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,440
sense perception

323
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,720
and then a module of our mind sends you

324
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,639
know some perception of what however we

325
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,480
understand consciousness

326
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,240
that makes it appear to us like we made

327
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,880
a decision

328
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,720
[Music]

329
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,720
pardon me but that may not be accurate

330
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
that uh you know the equations might

331
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,560
hint that that's not actually what's

332
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,720
going on it's simply free energy

333
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,079
threshold being reached the threshold

334
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,160
could conceivably have

335
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,639
nothing or very little to do with the

336
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,200
decision-making process and it could be

337
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,120
post-facto like uh

338
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,440
the liebet experiments that uh the

339
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,839
perception like we made a decision

340
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,320
actually comes post-facto from the

341
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,880
threshold

342
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,240
cool thank you um also i think

343
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,680
uh adam saffron who had discussed those

344
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,440
libre experiments

345
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,000
does find a space for agency

346
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,399
if that's not to course of a

347
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,880
simplification but there is some

348
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,480
interesting ways to think about what

349
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,519
that experiment uh does or doesn't show

350
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,519
maybe we can return to that when we kind

351
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,639
of have

352
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,240
some figures and details dean

353
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,839
yeah i didn't know what you guys were

354
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,240
talking about with this unlimited thing

355
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,920
until i went back to the paper and then

356
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,279
i found this

357
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,600
and i'll just quote it we also this is

358
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,040
from the paper we also motivate a

359
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,279
squarely

360
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:02,480
non-eliminativist position with respect

361
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,160
to such constructs

362
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,000
and suggests that the set of theoretical

363
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,600
primitives out of which the active

364
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,000
inference models are built is sufficient

365
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,240
not only to recover the categories of

366
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,639
folk psychology but also to potentially

367
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,399
nuance them with more

368
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,600
fine-grained

369
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,320
distinctions so i don't i'm not sure

370
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,199
exactly dude what how what you've been

371
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,560
saying

372
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,440
either corresponds with that or not but

373
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,800
i'm i'm kind of curious

374
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,279
yeah go for it

375
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,240
yeah i mean to me it's a fallacy that uh

376
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,079
you know like a best of both worlds

377
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,079
fallacy that uh

378
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,519
materialistic research into

379
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,120
consciousness make

380
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,160
is that in reality my understanding of

381
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,320
the their conclusions of what they're

382
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,639
saying is that it is a limitivist and

383
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,079
they'll put a little statement in like

384
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,839
it's not a limited vist

385
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,920
but what does the evidence of their

386
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,600
models actually say

387
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,079
and can they actually

388
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,120
uh

389
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,680
program like a unified eye

390
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,399
and uh you put that did they eliminate

391
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,000
the unified eye

392
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,320
and it's just a bunch of perceptions

393
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,079
and various factors that reach a

394
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,279
threshold

395
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,880
and what does it mean

396
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,000
to uh

397
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,440
make a decision

398
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,040
so uh

399
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,720
and that's why i said do we just throw

400
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,519
away

401
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,839
uh thousands of years of dualistic

402
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,760
theology and uh

403
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,320
how people you know our whole lexicon

404
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,160
of uh

405
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,320
consciousness psychology comes from a

406
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,160
dualistic tradition

407
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,000
so if they're trying to grandfather in

408
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,880
these dualistic concepts

409
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,639
but even the evidence of what they're

410
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,519
saying

411
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,839
doesn't necessarily seem to warrant it

412
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,360
and then you know do they have the

413
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,320
courage

414
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,399
to be like no unfortunately the evidence

415
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,959
points to eliminativism

416
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,000
and go with that so i mean my impression

417
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,759
they kind of just throw in the statement

418
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,399
but it's unclear how how they're uh

419
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,600
you know how they're doing it because

420
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,199
the you know i guess you know it's going

421
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,360
to be unpopular to be an unlimited it's

422
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,279
kind of like the free will question

423
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,759
that i mean limitism also relates the

424
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,040
free will

425
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,360
but you know to stand up and be like no

426
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,519
i'm sorry free will doesn't exist that's

427
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,360
where the evidence is pointed

428
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,680
uh sort of put in there that they're not

429
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,199
trying to say that

430
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,519
but uh you know my impression i think

431
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,880
they actually are trying to say that

432
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,639
or that's where the evidence of their

433
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,040
conclusions are saying they just have

434
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,040
you know human weakness that doesn't

435
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,519
want to go so far as to follow the

436
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,720
evidence of

437
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,600
you know their research

438
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,560
interesting so just to continue on this

439
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,120
motor and decision ai so

440
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,320
page five

441
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,560
mai does not make decisions

442
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,160
once a decision has been made about what

443
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,600
to do

444
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,920
mai uses proprioceptive prediction

445
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,839
signals to move the body to carry out

446
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,839
the decided action sequence and

447
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,600
elsewhere we've talked about that sort

448
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,279
of set point

449
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,120
and then a transient suppression of

450
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,839
precision which allows the body to reach

451
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,359
this new spatial position

452
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,919
and also these models have tended to be

453
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,319
formulated in continuous time

454
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,679
whereas decision ai plugs in very nicely

455
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,199
to the motor ai

456
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,799
because it is explicitly considering

457
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,880
decision making and these higher order

458
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,000
rules

459
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,280
that

460
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,280
have to do with either

461
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,600
if you take a more realist perspective

462
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,000
what organisms or cognitive systems are

463
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,799
doing

464
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,360
or the more instrumental perspective

465
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,480
which is just this is how the the

466
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,400
process of decision making can be

467
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,480
modeled

468
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,160
and it's about what which decisions are

469
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,840
made about what to do in order to

470
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,679
generate some observations and not

471
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:50,720
others

472
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,080
and it's that

473
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,120
uh

474
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,880
focus on the observations that are

475
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,559
generated under different courses of

476
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,200
action and their evaluation in terms of

477
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,760
expected free energy that also ties it

478
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,440
closely to like perceptual control

479
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,360
theory

480
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,080
so that's the distinction they bring up

481
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,039
and

482
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,840
again in whether in the real world this

483
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,840
carves cognitive systems at the joint is

484
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,120
one question

485
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,039
in the world of the theories as

486
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,160
constructed

487
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,880
this is a clean separation

488
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,960
although as ali brought up that doesn't

489
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,559
mean that it's um

490
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,520
widely

491
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,280
accepted or even if everybody heard

492
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,799
about it that they would necessarily

493
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,440
agree with it

494
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,600
and there may be phenomena that are

495
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,000
mixtures and that's also why they talk

496
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,720
about the hybrid models where it's like

497
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,880
decision making at a higher level

498
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,440
and then motor at a lower level so that

499
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,760
could allow decisions about what section

500
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,160
of a face to look at or what section of

501
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,840
a page to read

502
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,679
and then that decision becomes

503
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,200
implemented in a continuous motor active

504
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,679
inference context through ocular motor

505
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,720
action dean

506
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,080
yeah

507
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,760
i'm not i don't think i'm

508
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,679
i don't think i'm leading with this

509
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,840
question about are we moving to a place

510
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,880
that says

511
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,080
that uh active inference will have

512
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,440
different types because i think that

513
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,280
there's different map there's a there's

514
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,600
math that's used in financial situations

515
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,679
those operations there's math that's

516
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,000
used in mechanical situations those

517
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
operations so i think it's it's a

518
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,520
natural byproduct of so how do you make

519
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,600
the math work

520
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,280
given the circumstance i don't think

521
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,720
that there's anything about this that's

522
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,320
saying active inference doesn't work

523
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,760
just because you want to make sure that

524
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,160
you're applying the proper formula

525
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,520
to the thing that you're trying to

526
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,000
describe but i do think it's interesting

527
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
that in order to be able to describe it

528
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,039
more precisely you just can't say

529
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,640
active inference you have to kind of

530
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,039
figure out what the math is

531
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,720
for the specific condition that we're

532
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,360
trying to analyze

533
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,559
yeah

534
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,480
definitely makes sense let's now move to

535
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,520
this lower part of the page on the

536
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,000
different adjectives that we've seen so

537
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,159
people can probably add or think of more

538
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,760
or even imagine there's so many

539
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,600
adjectives in the

540
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,400
in the textbook called the dictionary

541
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,039
we've talked about extended active

542
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,080
inference

543
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,159
which was addressing extended cognitive

544
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,919
features and phenomena

545
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,720
where there could be sort of a

546
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,159
offloading

547
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,000
which was when the adaptive active

548
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,720
entity is going to utilize something

549
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,159
that is

550
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,000
more like a notepad like it's offloading

551
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,159
memory onto the notepad and then the

552
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,480
entity is holding on to information

553
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,280
about how to seek that information

554
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,000
or on both sides of the interface there

555
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,320
could be adaptive active and so that was

556
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,400
like the sort of true

557
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,799
emergent extended cognitive processes

558
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,960
deep active inference and and citations

559
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
could be could be added didn't get them

560
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,080
for all

561
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,360
deep

562
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,640
was utilized to describe temporal depth

563
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,720
in terms of longer and longer time

564
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,799
horizons of considerations

565
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,520
this was really an important development

566
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,400
because it moved beyond the sort of one

567
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,360
shot

568
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,000
next step model of active

569
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,080
and help manage this trade-off between

570
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,320
considering time horizons

571
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,200
as well as taking action in the time

572
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,480
step that the entity is actually in

573
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,720
sophisticated active inference

574
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,640
and various other

575
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,760
um

576
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,679
cousins of it

577
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,320
utilized hierarchical modeling

578
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,200
which could have temporal depth at one

579
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,440
or multiple levels but doesn't need to

580
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,840
it it does and it could

581
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,520
but this is referring to like the

582
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,240
thickness or the hierarchical modeling

583
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,440
component

584
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,559
uh affective active inference which was

585
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,120
used by hespet all to refer to

586
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,960
uncertainty parameters

587
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,159
and some of the cognitive

588
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,400
interpretations of uncertainty

589
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,559
parameters as being related to to

590
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,760
valence

591
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,440
um and then there's others like

592
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,440
branching time active and um

593
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,760
it comes to what dean said which is

594
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,679
just saying like we use active inference

595
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,000
may not reduce uncertainty enough

596
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,679
any more than we used a linear model

597
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,760
whether just talking about it casually

598
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,559
or

599
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,919
writing the paper

600
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,240
more information has to be provided

601
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,480
and so this is sorting this is sorting

602
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,400
to uh starting to build

603
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,200
the taxonomy and the classifications and

604
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,799
the ways of communicating reducing

605
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,799
uncertainty okay you went to that

606
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,440
hemisphere but was it this continent or

607
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,919
that continent was it this coast or was

608
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,640
it that coast like zooming in

609
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,640
ultimately resulting in just describing

610
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,240
the particulars of the model that was

611
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,600
constructed ali

612
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,120
uh well adding to what dean has just

613
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,000
said uh well i don't think that these

614
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,480
different flavors and versions of active

615
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,120
imprints that have recently been

616
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,399
recently been branched up

617
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,720
they don't necessarily

618
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,320
concern themselves with different

619
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,120
situations or different niches

620
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,520
for example that last one branching time

621
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,880
active inference

622
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,480
uh well that was a very recent

623
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,320
uh version of active inference which was

624
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,360
uh

625
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,880
yes this is the paper uh they introduced

626
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,840
that and it's basically a more

627
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,600
efficient uh

628
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
computational approach to active

629
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,799
inference

630
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,880
and it's just the traditional active

631
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,200
inference but in a more

632
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,440
efficient out with a more efficient

633
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,679
algorithm to compute

634
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,520
the all the parameters needed

635
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,360
yes sometimes

636
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,880
it's these adjectives are describing

637
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,799
heuristics or implementations or

638
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,080
algorithms

639
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,039
other times they're describing the model

640
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,640
structure

641
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,320
other times they're referring to the

642
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,320
context that the model is being applied

643
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,120
to

644
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,320
like an extended cognitive system deem

645
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,240
yeah that's that's what i was going to

646
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,720
ask ali about so if i'm saying something

647
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,400
more efficient what am i saying it's

648
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,559
more efficient relative to

649
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,440
uh well relative to

650
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,840
the traditional approach to active

651
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,960
inference uh that has been proposed uh

652
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,919
for

653
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,919
the past decade or two uh and also uh

654
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,279
relative to

655
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,640
the other

656
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,000
um

657
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,799
the other approaches that are similar to

658
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,039
active inferences approach but not if

659
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,440
not exactly equivalent to it for

660
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,480
instance

661
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,559
reinforcement reinforcement learning

662
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,640
approaches and so on

663
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,760
okay and

664
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,520
one other

665
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,840
kind of analogy or mapping there would

666
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,880
be like

667
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,840
when a new variant of a neural network

668
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,919
architecture is introduced

669
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,960
there's a pomp and circumstance

670
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,799
to announce the novelty and the

671
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,720
relevance of this for somebody who's in

672
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,000
that field

673
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,640
similarly when there's a new variant or

674
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,679
a new focus whether model structure

675
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,520
model target or something else related

676
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,799
to evolutionary biology

677
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,760
sometimes a new word will come in

678
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,840
but then

679
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,039
that

680
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,960
new

681
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,840
target or model

682
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,919
structure if it becomes used

683
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,520
and it's sufficiently close that it's

684
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,240
not rejected from the rest of the body

685
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,960
of theory if it's an incoherent usage of

686
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,039
the adjective someone says well i made

687
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,840
you know simple active inference and it

688
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,559
has this totally different structure

689
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,120
that might not become incorporated into

690
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,520
the the network of active inference

691
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,559
models

692
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,919
whereas

693
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,520
if it does

694
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,200
become incorporated through its

695
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,159
theoretical compatibility or

696
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,120
utility and modeling that phenomena

697
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,320
or it's

698
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,400
presented in terms of a model

699
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,520
architecture that does apply elsewhere

700
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,080
the adjective kind of gets dropped and

701
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,520
then it just goes back to being neural

702
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,200
networks back to being active inference

703
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,440
back to being evolutionary biology

704
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,559
and then the field moves on and so the

705
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,919
the adjectives are just kind of like

706
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,240
another brick in the wall

707
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,240
dude

708
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,320
yeah i also mentioned last week i'm not

709
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,400
sure if it would go here in this section

710
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,520
is uh

711
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,480
the

712
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,159
purpose driven

713
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,520
the

714
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,679
purpose-driven behavior action or even

715
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,640
the

716
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,400
perception related to

717
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,159
a unified eye

718
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,679
and

719
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,520
even if it's on the pure level of sense

720
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,080
perception is it just that we have

721
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,240
uh you know these perceivers and they

722
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,960
perceive and then how are the signals

723
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,000
read

724
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,440
and uh

725
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,200
i mean it's easier to describe this in

726
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,279
an eliminativistic way whether we're

727
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,000
limiting or not uh in the for the

728
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,360
predictive mind is the main uh

729
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,919
struggles so to say between short-term

730
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,399
uh goals and long-term goals and then

731
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,559
you have to put in what axioms are we

732
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,520
making

733
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,760
is there some sort of uh for the higher

734
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,480
order rules if we assume that there's

735
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,120
some sort of rule that like an organism

736
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,080
acts in its own self-interest in its own

737
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,000
uh you know sort of say desire to

738
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,240
survive or to uh replicate and then you

739
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,240
the only struggle would be between

740
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,919
short-term and long-term actions like

741
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,520
you know god forbid here we have a

742
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,080
mosquito pandemic i was gardening and

743
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,399
got you know eaten up by mosquitoes and

744
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,399
it was just a sense you're replying to

745
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,640
the environment like i have an itch

746
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,640
should i itch it or should i have some

747
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,200
longer term that will go away quicker if

748
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,679
uh if i don't itch it and is that you

749
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:06,799
know something that's even in the

750
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,799
subconscious where just naturally i

751
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,559
would have an itch and i would itch it

752
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,360
but then i would somehow enter a longer

753
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,600
term decision making process

754
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,960
that

755
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,279
would tell me to act in a different way

756
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,039
and even terms for how i'm going to

757
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,080
interact

758
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,320
with the environment in the future let

759
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,799
alone something that might have a

760
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,799
moral or ethical

761
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,720
implication so if you have a simplified

762
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,000
model of just

763
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,720
where do we need purpose

764
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,600
for a sense perception to work and for

765
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,840
motor control to work even in terms of

766
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,440
reflexes because i think

767
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,600
you're just even on the motor control

768
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,399
let alone the decision-making uh where

769
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,799
does the decision making uh go and

770
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,399
what's the purpose

771
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,720
behind it and then how is that purpose

772
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,720
derived

773
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,240
yes so we can go to uh

774
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,279
targeted non-targeted

775
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,080
um

776
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,840
another

777
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,520
branch point is

778
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,799
i think this important question of

779
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,919
mapping from real world phenomena

780
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,360
and even

781
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,320
direct felt experiences like aesthetic

782
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,600
or just more generally phenomenological

783
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,559
and

784
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,120
anything about a formalism

785
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,520
and i'm not sure if i've quoted too

786
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,760
narrowly

787
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,480
but

788
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,520
they are writing that

789
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,720
intentions

790
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,039
so just to review the

791
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,760
uh bdi the beliefs and the desires come

792
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,880
together

793
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,799
and that is what generates the intention

794
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,440
there's the desire for the ice cream and

795
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,279
there's the belief that there's the ice

796
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,200
cream truck and that is what generates

797
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,720
the intentional behavior of like

798
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,640
pursuing the ice cream truck

799
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,159
intentions map straightforwardly to

800
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,000
policies with the lowest value for

801
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,480
expected free energy which is calculated

802
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,120
across different policies

803
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,279
policies are affordances that can be

804
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,399
taken

805
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,679
over a given time horizon so over time

806
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,360
horizon of three it's the combination of

807
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,840
affordances of length three

808
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,320
almost all other variables in the dai

809
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,200
model

810
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,559
are candidates for traditional

811
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,320
psychological beliefs

812
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,480
if being used to model the right kinds

813
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,279
of high-level cognitive processes

814
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,440
so what are the right kinds

815
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,320
but then later in footnote 5

816
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,840
this is distinguishing uh in

817
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,360
what they characterize as a different

818
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,760
reading of desire this reading is not

819
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,360
the thing that is desired but instead

820
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,799
about the transient presence of the

821
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,799
motivational force to approach the thing

822
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,240
we desire

823
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,559
so it's like why did you go there it was

824
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,200
my desire to go there what moved you to

825
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,360
go there desire

826
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,200
so it's almost like desire in the

827
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,080
specifics and then also seeing it as a

828
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,399
motivating force

829
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,760
but then they note

830
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,840
that habit might not have a direction of

831
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,000
fit and it illustrates another reason

832
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,679
consistent with our broader argument

833
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,840
concerning desires

834
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,679
not to assume that probability

835
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,760
distributions in the formalism must be

836
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,679
mapped onto beliefs the psychological

837
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,039
level

838
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,399
so

839
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,879
their candidates if we do it right

840
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,279
but it isn't an assumption

841
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,279
that they must be mapped onto beliefs

842
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,799
ali

843
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,880
uh well uh i wanted to mention uh the uh

844
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,919
uh a broader sense of the term

845
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,799
intentionality uh which i think the

846
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,679
heroes refer to because uh you see uh

847
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,279
for all the entities defined by uh

848
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,799
markup blankets and uh defined by uh the

849
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,200
existence of their mark of blankets and

850
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,159
their ergotic behavior uh well we need

851
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,519
an entity uh who can treat

852
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,559
an effect as being about its cause you

853
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,600
see

854
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,120
an entity who can

855
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,840
follow the direction from effect uh

856
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,080
to cause and um we also need an entity

857
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,399
who can treat an isomorphic map

858
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,919
as being about what it maps

859
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:22,640
or

860
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,960
let's say as oriented toward what it

861
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,200
maps well in both of these cases the

862
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,120
directionality or orientation

863
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,240
uh

864
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,279
can be referred to as

865
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:38,640
intentionality in its broad sense

866
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,279
so just to clarify this the second piece

867
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,640
you mentioned was

868
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,080
the entity

869
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,240
needs to be able to treat some sort of

870
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,159
isomorphic or structure preserving

871
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,200
mapping

872
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,640
as having an aboutness of the target

873
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,720
like the map of the city

874
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,640
translating that into the physical

875
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,080
movement and then uh there was a causal

876
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,600
inference question

877
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,679
entity can trace causes

878
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,360
such that they understand such that

879
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,440
they're doing some kind of causal

880
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,640
mapping

881
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,519
where agency is the belief that one can

882
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,679
be the cause

883
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:14,640
of

884
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,279
future aspects so is this agency

885
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,640
or is this

886
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,320
causal modeling

887
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,399
that could happen in the absence of

888
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,840
entity level agency

889
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,559
i think it's more uh it's a broader than

890
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,159
uh

891
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,000
necessarily being a cognitive agent uh

892
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,960
you see

893
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,840
it's any abstract entity

894
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,400
that can

895
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,840
[Music]

896
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,960
that can sketch out these kind of causal

897
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,720
relationships between

898
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,880
between the signs and

899
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,200
their either

900
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,679
uh icons or their

901
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,240
indices so

902
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,279
it's much broader and more abstract than

903
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,159
uh

904
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,519
necessarily cognitive agents

905
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,679
what kind of entities are you thinking

906
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,879
of

907
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,520
and is it manipulation and and that kind

908
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,760
of logical

909
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,159
uh juxtaposition no no the one uh

910
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,520
obvious example would be neural networks

911
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,440
neural nets uh we don't uh necessarily

912
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,639
bestow upon neural networks uh

913
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,159
cognitive agency right but they can uh

914
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,359
well match uh the uh

915
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,359
at least their input patterns uh onto

916
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:43,760
uh their uh output um

917
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,240
output indices

918
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,960
and it's um

919
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,480
these continuums of agency continuums of

920
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,400
cognitive systems it's like

921
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
easy to forget we're we're talking about

922
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,440
a cognitive modeling framework

923
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,480
albeit one that has a motor cousin

924
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,240
mai

925
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,160
and motor dev motor modeling history

926
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,599
because the mii distinction is um

927
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,359
also historical

928
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,040
like in terms of what which malls were

929
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,680
developed when

930
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,760
and uh

931
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,119
is this pan cognitivism

932
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,119
are we modeling everything as if it is

933
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,280
on the continuum of cognitive entities

934
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,560
like

935
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,000
i don't

936
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,599
know if it's as controversial to say

937
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,280
that a neural network is a cognitive

938
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,040
artifact

939
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,119
it might not be self-perpetuating or

940
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,079
embodied or have open-ended agency or

941
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,760
all these other features that some

942
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,160
cognitive systems have but

943
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,200
what makes it not cognitive if you meant

944
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,160
that

945
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,320
well probably the cognitive here uh

946
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,599
it was not a proper proper adjective uh

947
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,800
perhaps what i meant was uh to be

948
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,000
i don't know a kind of a conscious agent

949
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,880
or

950
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,520
but again on the uh

951
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,920
the subject of uh

952
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,079
using the adjective cognitive or neural

953
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,680
networks uh well there are quite a few

954
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,350
uh

955
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,760
[Music]

956
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,480
uh opponents uh to this characterization

957
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,960
for neural networks because uh they

958
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,760
believe that uh neural networks

959
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,480
as

960
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,000
uh agents

961
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,359
uh don't necessarily

962
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,520
uh decide on uh their

963
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,560
decide on their cognitive basis uh how

964
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,359
to

965
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,400
uh

966
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,480
map how to

967
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,560
you see map between the inputs and

968
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,400
outputs because

969
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,359
that's the difference between

970
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,480
representation and simulation if we uh

971
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,920
well uh

972
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,160
can differentiate between the between

973
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,520
those two

974
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,480
uh so probably yeah the more suitable

975
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,760
adjective here should be a conscious

976
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,119
agent

977
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,560
as opposed to cognitive agents

978
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,160
does that not take us extremely

979
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,839
far afield out of where we

980
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,760
um lose touch with empirical

981
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,079
measurements for example

982
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,960
and enter into important

983
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,440
philosophical questions but ones that

984
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,920
take us like

985
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,280
away from

986
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,200
our cognitive leg

987
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,200
and psychology perhaps even especially

988
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,800
folk psychology is sitting at the

989
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
intersection of cognitive systems

990
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,760
philosophical self-reflexive systems

991
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,640
so it's almost like a question of

992
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,280
this teetering stack

993
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,760
of folk psychology which way will it end

994
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,920
up falling

995
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,800
eliminativism perhaps is saying we'll be

996
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,599
able to dispense with classical

997
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,560
philosophical debates or some aspects of

998
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,440
them

999
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,320
by

1000
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,440
just

1001
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,800
moving everything that was folk

1002
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,040
psychological into

1003
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,960
a mathematical cognitivist framework

1004
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,680
uh

1005
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,160
well what i mean here is that well

1006
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,400
the term intentionality

1007
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,079
here

1008
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,920
can also be used

1009
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,520
in

1010
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,359
in abstract models of active inference

1011
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,040
and not necessarily

1012
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,920
uh

1013
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,920
well uh in the cases where we

1014
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,480
unambiguously deal with

1015
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,480
conscious entities that's what i mean

1016
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,839
i think one of the

1017
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,079
takeaways of this paper or one of the

1018
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,920
implications of this paper

1019
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,280
would be that

1020
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,560
if

1021
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,839
intentions

1022
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,760
in folk psychology

1023
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,640
are

1024
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,880
beliefs plus desires

1025
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,200
hashtag bdi model

1026
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,720
and

1027
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,760
beliefs and desires are identifiable

1028
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,520
quantities in the academic formalism

1029
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,760
then by constructing entities consistent

1030
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,000
with the active formalism

1031
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,760
it can be said that they have

1032
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,160
intentionality because it could be said

1033
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,320
that they have beliefs and desires

1034
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,400
and so then it would only make sense to

1035
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,280
call the behaviors arising from beliefs

1036
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,560
and desires

1037
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,800
to be intentional

1038
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,839
so doesn't this uh conceptualization of

1039
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,200
intentionality also subsume uh

1040
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,560
the

1041
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,880
more strict or narrow sense of that term

1042
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,960
because well if we uh

1043
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,320
in this sense if we uh infer

1044
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,280
from

1045
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,040
the the use of intentionality here

1046
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,880
as as referring to only conscious agents

1047
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,880
uh well in that case uh the um

1048
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,839
the whole purpose of simulating active

1049
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,560
inference agents uh

1050
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,520
could potentially uh well raise some

1051
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,640
questions

1052
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,640
that's well uh i i'm not sure if i uh

1053
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,400
could express myself

1054
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,560
clearly on this matter or not but

1055
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,200
oh no very interesting um dean and then

1056
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,760
do it

1057
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,720
so maybe amongst the three of you you

1058
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,000
can help me with this because i don't

1059
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,240
really keep up with the latest news on

1060
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,240
neural nets but

1061
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,839
if i

1062
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,760
if i were to look at a neural net i

1063
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,359
would assume that

1064
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,720
most of those

1065
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,400
nets are given

1066
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,480
some kind of a target

1067
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,319
even if they go out and forage for it

1068
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,000
there is something about that but what

1069
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,800
i've

1070
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,480
been always been curious about is

1071
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,319
especially in the in the context of this

1072
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,599
paper

1073
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,200
is that

1074
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,400
if there is a target that's been

1075
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,200
sort of linked to desire in this paper

1076
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,400
and if there's

1077
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,359
a curiosity aspect to the agent or the

1078
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,920
net that's been sort of linked to

1079
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,280
non-targeting

1080
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,480
so if that's if that's one continuum the

1081
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,800
orthogonal aspect of that also in the

1082
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,480
paper is that there's

1083
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,839
a rewarding

1084
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,839
component say on the left of that

1085
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,599
there's an information seeking or an

1086
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,720
information an ambiguity component to

1087
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,000
the right of that so here's my question

1088
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,200
if

1089
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,280
unless we say that

1090
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,000
curiosity actually is a target

1091
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,640
which this paper says is it's actually a

1092
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,800
non-target and the operation and the

1093
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,839
formalism actually points that out

1094
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,119
then

1095
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,040
how to set something up like a neural

1096
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,839
net to actually be curious

1097
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,000
because we we can be curious we can be

1098
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,440
non-targeting

1099
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,240
and

1100
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,280
find reward in that if we go

1101
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,079
one direction and find information

1102
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,520
gained in that

1103
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,200
in another direction and they are they

1104
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,960
are completely different things they're

1105
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,000
not

1106
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,400
seen in the in the formalism as the same

1107
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,440
thing so

1108
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,079
i'm just curious whether

1109
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,079
we're like because as i said i don't

1110
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,760
know enough about neural nets to know

1111
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,880
but

1112
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,480
aren't neural nets constantly

1113
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,640
constrained by having a target

1114
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,599
i think there's many ways to

1115
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,000
answer that

1116
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,280
i am not sure if it would totally map

1117
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,599
onto the difference of supervised and

1118
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,079
unsupervised learning

1119
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,720
like supervised learning being where

1120
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,440
labels are provided

1121
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,280
these x-rays belong to this patient

1122
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,960
category these ones belong to the

1123
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,200
alternate category i want you to get

1124
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,440
really good but you know don't over

1125
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,440
specify don't overfit

1126
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,119
that distinction

1127
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,359
supervised learning unsupervised

1128
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:01,119
learning is more along the lines of like

1129
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,839
here's input

1130
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,720
according to how you're set up

1131
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,920
embody

1132
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,920
the statistical regularities and the

1133
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,280
structure

1134
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,880
of the information that has been input

1135
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,599
okay and then that representation

1136
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,920
allows like clustering and subsequent

1137
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,200
analyses

1138
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,160
or the addition of labels later

1139
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,400
but it isn't predicated

1140
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,480
in the training phase

1141
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,680
upon the data or the cases being labels

1142
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,880
does that

1143
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,319
yeah but the predication is not

1144
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,000
curiosity is it

1145
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,560
that's my point is that there is no

1146
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,560
curiosity in what you just described

1147
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,240
right it's like a a pipeline

1148
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,160
that is receiving whatever information

1149
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,599
is being provided

1150
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,760
and curiosity seems to kind of break out

1151
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,040
of that

1152
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,839
and it's like give me more examples

1153
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,599
and then the directed curiosity would be

1154
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,839
like i'm looking for more examples of

1155
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,520
the label a

1156
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,520
the undirected curiosity would be more

1157
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,640
like

1158
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,920
i just would like more examples

1159
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,440
right so to

1160
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,240
ask ally maybe ali is it consciousness

1161
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,839
if it doesn't have curiosity

1162
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,680
uh well um i don't think so because uh

1163
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,599
you see uh even in uh

1164
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,480
unsupervised learnings uh we don't

1165
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,319
necessarily

1166
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,319
well the neural networks uh don't

1167
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:36,800
necessarily uh extract the uh

1168
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,760
the

1169
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,720
the essence of their training examples

1170
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,000
what they do is all

1171
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
is to extract

1172
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,960
a statistical prototype of their tokens

1173
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,880
the statistical prototype of their

1174
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,800
training examples

1175
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,160
so

1176
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,200
actually

1177
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,160
they can't recognize

1178
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,520
a dog as a dog they just see patterns

1179
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,680
they just see statistical patterns which

1180
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,040
they've learned

1181
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,079
through their

1182
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,920
training process

1183
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,800
so they're not

1184
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,520
they're not necessarily conscious of

1185
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,880
the object of dog or cat or whatever

1186
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,240
what

1187
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,400
what they try to do

1188
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,400
is uh and in fact in some cases uh

1189
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,200
well

1190
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,839
sometimes we see that uh they have in

1191
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,640
fact inferred uh wrong statistical

1192
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,520
prototypes because of

1193
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,720
well

1194
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,959
insufficient training examples or

1195
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,880
well

1196
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,440
not appropriate training examples or so

1197
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,160
on

1198
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,599
but in any case uh what uh i don't think

1199
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,839
we can uh

1200
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,839
say that uh

1201
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:55,280
well neural networks because uh

1202
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,640
uh because of their ability to recognize

1203
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,480
these patterns they necessarily

1204
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,359
well

1205
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,319
have consciousness because well

1206
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:07,680
probably

1207
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,560
in order to achieve consciousness

1208
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,119
well other layers of

1209
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,000
cognitive and even perceptual

1210
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,240
mechanisms need to be deployed

1211
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,599
good

1212
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,359
i had some other points but if you

1213
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,119
wanted to uh

1214
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,520
you'll stay in the curiosity topic

1215
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,319
um

1216
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,480
and it's related to what the point i was

1217
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,640
going to make about belief and desire

1218
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,240
of you

1219
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,720
clearly defining the words so if they're

1220
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,400
specifically you know you're going to

1221
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,960
take the bdi model

1222
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,119
and use words like belief and desire to

1223
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:49,920
uh

1224
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,760
you know some relatively obscure

1225
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,280
scientific model

1226
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,960
versus

1227
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,720
you know like a whole historical review

1228
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,040
of the etymology

1229
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,960
and uh

1230
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,800
you know i mean and how do we how are we

1231
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,839
defining

1232
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,119
uh

1233
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:06,560
beliefs and desire you know does

1234
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,200
curiosity have a desire to learn

1235
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,480
something

1236
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,160
um

1237
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,480
you know for its own purpose that that

1238
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,079
means it's not goal

1239
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,359
uh driven

1240
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,040
and then how i would understand belief

1241
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,240
and desire

1242
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,839
in terms of

1243
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,040
your so desires are biological urges

1244
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,520
like uh your reproduction

1245
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,640
or uh

1246
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,200
survival and if of the emotions or maybe

1247
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,119
all derivative uh how you're going to

1248
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,880
put that out where if you're going to

1249
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,640
try to source all of them from one pure

1250
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,720
desire and all the other desires are

1251
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,640
derivative if you're gonna have multiple

1252
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,640
uh desires and then you'd have to have

1253
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,240
some sort of waiting

1254
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,200
function to await the different desires

1255
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,960
and then beliefs are self-made

1256
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,440
rules that come from our own

1257
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,960
technician and that's where decision

1258
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,359
making comes comes in and even you know

1259
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:02,000
i think a rabbinic statement in terms of

1260
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,640
free will that free will is implying

1261
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,480
that you have the choice

1262
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,599
to make the less desirous opinion the

1263
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,000
the less desires choice like as a chess

1264
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,079
player if you're thinking like uh

1265
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,559
candidate moves and analysis trees that

1266
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:19,520
in reality our candidate moves are just

1267
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,000
how we control our body and you know do

1268
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,920
we move our arm up or down

1269
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,319
or the various controls of our physical

1270
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:27,520
function

1271
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,119
but you know what are the candidate

1272
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:30,160
moves

1273
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,200
and then how would the analysis tree

1274
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,119
and

1275
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,200
decision making is it you know how would

1276
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,599
it come that you would make the less

1277
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,119
desirous uh

1278
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,520
decision is it purely you know let's say

1279
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,640
short term uh verse long term and then

1280
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,359
the organization of uh you know that's

1281
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,119
like a system like okay i'm a jew i'm a

1282
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,040
muslim i'm an atheist or i'm a

1283
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,000
capitalist i'm a communist that we have

1284
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,400
these self-directed

1285
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,160
uh

1286
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,960
beliefs that control our behavior and if

1287
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,040
it's learning to do things like i can't

1288
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,520
steal uh god forbid i can't rape i can't

1289
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,720
kill and that like my desire if the body

1290
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,280
tells me okay i see attractive woman uh

1291
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,440
i want to have sexual relations

1292
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,240
but then i have these beliefs like that

1293
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,359
there's a system of rules and governance

1294
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:22,160
that

1295
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,680
is it purely because i can't get away

1296
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,920
with it that i don't do it we don't rape

1297
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,960
still and kill because uh

1298
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,960
we can't get away with it or is there

1299
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,400
this self-imposed moralistic uh behavior

1300
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,640
and that's coming down to uh what belief

1301
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,520
means

1302
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,440
and then uh you know also if

1303
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,440
you so curiosity you'd have to clearly

1304
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,280
define

1305
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,119
curiosity and if you're talking about

1306
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,839
neural nets that you know can computer

1307
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:50,559
just learn for its own sake uh and even

1308
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,319
can a human just learn for its own sake

1309
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:53,119
that

1310
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:53,839
uh

1311
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,040
you know we're participating in these

1312
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,160
discussions purely because i enjoy

1313
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,319
figuring things out even if it has no

1314
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,240
practical implication

1315
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,280
to uh you know some primal directive

1316
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,559
of survival or reproduction or however

1317
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,400
you're going to understand these primal

1318
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,760
directives

1319
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,040
and then uh

1320
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,559
you know the equation be similar to a

1321
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,319
chess algorithm for a computer where

1322
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,960
uh it would appear that you could add in

1323
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,119
weighting factors that you could program

1324
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:25,040
this into the equations

1325
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,000
and

1326
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,760
you have some constants that would be

1327
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,000
weighting factors so if you did have

1328
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,040
just one primal directive of survival or

1329
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,960
two primal directives

1330
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,920
of uh reproduction and survival

1331
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,280
and then you could give those weighting

1332
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,480
factors

1333
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,599
or you could have uh um a feedback

1334
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,400
mechanism uh i mean with the environment

1335
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,680
and and then

1336
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,960
you know as i said where did the belief

1337
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,359
comes in the self-made rules and then

1338
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:54,079
how are those waiting factors calculated

1339
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,839
in decision making and what does it mean

1340
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,079
to make a decision is it possible that

1341
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,960
we make the least desirous decision and

1342
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,480
if we can't make the less desirous

1343
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,119
decision uh you know do we not have free

1344
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,119
will

1345
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,480
thanks so jonathan shock made a great

1346
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,319
point which is that deep neural networks

1347
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,160
applied to reinforcement learning can

1348
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,040
include curiosity as an explicit factor

1349
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,599
it guides the agent to states which has

1350
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,760
about which it has the most uncertainty

1351
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,599
so it's a term which makes it rewarding

1352
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,680
to explore currently unexplored states

1353
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,720
and then just

1354
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,520
um

1355
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,079
to get provide a recent example

1356
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:33,040
here's

1357
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,960
a way in which a neural network

1358
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,160
architecture was used

1359
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,119
certainly worthy of more exploration

1360
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:42,000
and

1361
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,520
at a first pass or at least just

1362
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,000
qualitatively one way to think about

1363
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:46,960
that

1364
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,040
and then we'll come to how curiosity was

1365
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,000
described in the text is in active

1366
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,880
inference we have a imperative for

1367
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,559
action selection

1368
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,400
that includes a pragmatic and an

1369
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,880
epistemic component

1370
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,240
whereas a pragmatic absolutist

1371
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,880
perspective like reinforcement learning

1372
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,280
needs to generate these modules and

1373
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,599
alternate architectures

1374
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:12,800
such that

1375
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,520
information seeking curiosity

1376
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,760
can be coerced into a reward framework

1377
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,119
i mean what is the next question going

1378
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,680
to be well it's rewarding to gain

1379
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,720
information

1380
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,720
oh what kind of information how much

1381
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,400
information how are we going to learn

1382
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,559
the parameters on our curiosity model

1383
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:32,880
and so on and so active inference as a

1384
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,839
first principles approach for this kind

1385
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:38,400
of artificially intelligent system

1386
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,000
allows us to include at the base level

1387
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,160
both in objective

1388
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,839
uh achieving

1389
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:49,839
and a pure curiosity reducing element uh

1390
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:51,280
dean and then we'll

1391
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,119
look at how they talk about curiosity

1392
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,319
thanks daniel so

1393
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:01,359
as as is has directly been the case for

1394
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:02,559
point twos

1395
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,559
oh really just left and i was gonna ask

1396
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,000
him this question okay i guess he's

1397
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,599
still here um

1398
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,359
so david when after uh got one

1399
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,200
and now just what you were just sharing

1400
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,960
with us here i

1401
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,720
wondered without putting words in the

1402
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,960
mark and i get a clarification i think

1403
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,040
one of the things that you're

1404
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,599
trying to make clear or

1405
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:24,880
or at least bring

1406
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,160
into the con

1407
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:26,960
that

1408
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,359
prioritization

1409
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,280
which is the sort of the value waiting

1410
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,240
aspect of how we see the world

1411
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,920
is not

1412
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,240
ordering the kind of placing of a

1413
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,960
formalism down on paper that includes

1414
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,440
rules like equals and plus and minus in

1415
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,400
the fep or the sort of extended and

1416
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,319
variation of energy

1417
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:49,680
is that

1418
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,640
and that's that oversimplifying what you

1419
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,200
want us to make clear that

1420
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,040
that having evaluating is not the same

1421
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,359
that kind of prioritization is not the

1422
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:04,319
same as being able to formally set down

1423
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,880
an order

1424
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,559
well i'm a dualist so like i'm i'm i'm

1425
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,480
trying to i i think i could use these

1426
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,240
equations for dualistic you know

1427
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,359
purposes

1428
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:16,960
and you could just factor in a weighting

1429
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,000
factor

1430
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,640
for these higher order rules and then

1431
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,319
you know so my system would have some

1432
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,640
sort of uh um

1433
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,800
struggle between two separate realms of

1434
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,280
material and spiritual realm so that's

1435
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,880
you personally how i'm look i'm looking

1436
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,480
at it but you know i could attempt to

1437
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,920
understand it from

1438
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,160
uh just the materialistic realm

1439
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,040
and how the uh equations

1440
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,040
uh you know would apply

1441
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,520
and then if there's competing factors

1442
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,880
what's the origin

1443
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,200
of those competing factors so so if you

1444
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,240
just put

1445
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,119
your desires are biological

1446
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,839
animalistic urges and beliefs are

1447
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:56,160
self-created

1448
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,839
rules of uh

1449
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,839
cognition and then you want to have a

1450
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,640
separate function like curiosity where

1451
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,599
where

1452
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,040
curiosity

1453
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,359
maybe benefits the purpose of making

1454
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:10,079
beliefs which would later come to become

1455
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,559
higher order rules

1456
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:13,359
and

1457
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:14,880
or if you want to have the ability to

1458
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,160
have

1459
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,240
behavior that has no purpose

1460
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,400
that you know i just enjoy understanding

1461
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,119
things uh maybe that understanding will

1462
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,920
help me make better higher order rules

1463
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,359
um

1464
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:28,799
and then even then saying oh like you're

1465
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:30,160
saying for the equation here we have

1466
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,400
these equations and it's free energy

1467
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,799
and uh you know so the purpose

1468
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,720
is to uh

1469
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,040
minimize it minimize uh you know the

1470
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,760
least action principle or eliminates the

1471
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,000
limit energy usage and so if you're

1472
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,240
looking like well why did i do that was

1473
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,920
like you know dummy didn't you look at

1474
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,280
the equation it was still it was the

1475
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,440
free energy principle you did it to uh

1476
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,359
minimize energy usage

1477
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:54,960
and uh you know so we're just saying

1478
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,400
that that uh

1479
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,760
that's

1480
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,200
you know the origin of all human

1481
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,359
behavior from an

1482
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:02,240
uh

1483
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,119
sense

1484
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,440
and uh you know from the folk psychology

1485
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,960
that's what i said so i'm taking a

1486
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,359
dualistic perspective where these higher

1487
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:11,280
order rules are coming from a

1488
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,359
non-material plane but i think they

1489
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:16,799
could be modeled into the equations

1490
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:19,760
thanks um also free energy minimization

1491
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,319
doesn't entail the actual

1492
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:25,040
minimal possible energy usage

1493
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,359
though some people have made that

1494
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:30,079
accidentally or intentionally a claim it

1495
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:32,160
isn't what those equations as they're

1496
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,079
being used here necessarily represent

1497
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,240
but it could there could be a system

1498
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,400
that thrives optimally based upon

1499
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,720
reducing energy usage but also there are

1500
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,400
situations where free energy

1501
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,000
minimization and the path of least

1502
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,400
action are not the lowest energy

1503
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,520
consumption

1504
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,559
um

1505
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,319
is that short term versus long term

1506
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:51,920
they're saying long term it is but it's

1507
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,079
just short term versus long term uh

1508
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:55,839
decision making in the

1509
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:58,240
as opposed to a dualistic the predictive

1510
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,079
mind that's saying it's not dualistic

1511
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,640
spiritual versus material it's a single

1512
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,559
materialistic and it's short-term versus

1513
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:07,119
long-term

1514
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:09,520
okay

1515
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,440
let's think about that in the context of

1516
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,119
of curiosity

1517
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,559
um how they're describing so

1518
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:17,680
uh

1519
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,559
g

1520
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:21,520
expected free energy of policies it's

1521
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,079
like the policies are enumerated and

1522
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,400
then g is calculated for them

1523
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,000
reflects the inferred value of each

1524
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,400
policy based upon beliefs

1525
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,440
beliefs are p of o sub t

1526
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,119
conditioned on pi so

1527
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,599
the distribution of outcomes

1528
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:40,079
conditioned upon policies if i go left

1529
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:41,599
what do i expect to see if i go right

1530
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:44,720
what do i expect to see that's a belief

1531
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,839
and

1532
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:48,319
the belief distribution about

1533
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:50,400
observations conditioned upon hidden

1534
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,720
states of the world

1535
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,640
if there is food there then what

1536
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,359
observations will i expect to see

1537
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:59,920
and desired outcomes which is

1538
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,960
as we've explored in 37

1539
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,920
in user's guide there's this dual

1540
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,359
implication

1541
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,240
of the p of o distribution and active

1542
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,280
inference

1543
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,920
as what is expected as well as preferred

1544
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,520
because

1545
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,160
we reduce our surprise

1546
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,200
about

1547
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,880
the expected

1548
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,920
slash preferred outcome distribution and

1549
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,720
that is how the desired outcomes are

1550
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,359
realized not by providing a higher

1551
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:33,599
reward or value

1552
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,319
to increasingly preferred states but

1553
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:37,440
rather

1554
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,480
treating the preference distribution

1555
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,480
as expectations

1556
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,520
which allows us to use supprisal and

1557
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,000
surprisal bounding approaches

1558
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,640
towards achieving

1559
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,920
preferences

1560
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,760
so how do they

1561
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,280
talk about desire and curiosity

1562
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,200
they're suggesting that these drives so

1563
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,119
this is in earlier we talked about

1564
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:02,799
there's the two ways to talk about

1565
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:06,240
desire the specific target of desire as

1566
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,359
a desire like i desire a cube of

1567
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:11,760
tungsten or something and then there's

1568
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,040
the drive that is associated with desire

1569
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,599
what made the person do it desire in the

1570
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,839
abstract

1571
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,240
curiosity

1572
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,920
drives discovery of what is not yet

1573
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,000
known and thus has no preconceived

1574
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,240
target

1575
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,880
however one could also say that it has a

1576
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,839
semi-formed concept of target because

1577
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:36,559
one could be like

1578
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:38,240
curious about something and then their

1579
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,640
curiosity would be satiated by something

1580
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,680
else

1581
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,760
something but not something else so in

1582
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,799
that case there was some of something of

1583
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:50,400
a prior on what they were looking for

1584
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:52,559
the claim that curiosity is not

1585
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,680
cognitive so desire related

1586
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,280
might seem suspect on the grounds it

1587
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,520
could also be characterized as simply

1588
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,160
the desire to learn

1589
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,680
qualitatively

1590
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,520
and this in turn could be conceived as

1591
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,359
the desire that one's beliefs are as

1592
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:10,240
precise as possible

1593
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,839
even though especially in the short term

1594
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:14,319
learning sometimes feels like it reduces

1595
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,640
our precision

1596
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,240
however the mathematics allow us to

1597
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,559
motivate a genuine distinction here

1598
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:22,720
specifically changing outcomes to

1599
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,119
minimize the kl divergence in the risk

1600
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:28,240
term in efe is a fundamentally different

1601
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,160
sort of process for minimizing the

1602
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,680
ambiguity term

1603
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:32,559
so

1604
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:34,480
the kl divergence is on the left side

1605
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,720
here

1606
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,520
and the ambiguity term is on the right

1607
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,559
side here

1608
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:44,799
here's equation 2.6 from the textbook

1609
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:48,000
and it's it's in a different order

1610
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,079
but just to see here's risk with the kl

1611
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:51,520
divergence

1612
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,280
and then here's expected ambiguity with

1613
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:57,799
the h for the entropy calculation

1614
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,839
um the latter

1615
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:04,160
which is the ambiguity term does not

1616
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,280
care how uncertainty is resolved so long

1617
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,720
it is resolved

1618
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,480
there's no preference for becoming more

1619
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,480
confident in one possible belief over

1620
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,880
another

1621
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,079
whereas

1622
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:18,720
the reduction of uncertainty

1623
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:19,680
by

1624
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,400
reducing the kl divergence is what is

1625
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,160
bringing us into alignment with our

1626
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,559
preferences slash expectations

1627
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:29,520
hence that is a much more targeted form

1628
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,599
of curiosity

1629
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:33,839
in that it allows for

1630
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:38,079
goal directed information seeking

1631
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:39,359
and then they write at a minimum the

1632
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:41,599
folk psychological concept of curiosity

1633
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:43,280
corresponds to a very different type of

1634
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,520
desire with a distinct counterpart in

1635
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,960
dai

1636
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,880
dean

1637
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,480
yeah

1638
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,000
that's perfect because what i wanted to

1639
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,119
say was that i think that the curiosity

1640
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:57,280
really points to that risk

1641
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,920
and the reason i say that is because

1642
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,520
you may find

1643
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,240
that when the ambiguity is removed the

1644
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,039
prize is a happy one or a not so happy

1645
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:08,480
one and i think

1646
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:09,520
that's

1647
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,160
that's kind of important here to to see

1648
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,599
sort of the

1649
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:16,720
it's it's hard to say as it says here

1650
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,960
it's however the claim the curiosity is

1651
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,960
non-conduit it might seem suspect on the

1652
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,039
grounds it could also be characterized

1653
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,000
as simply

1654
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,400
the desire to learn well that

1655
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,400
before the learning

1656
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,799
you you're you're sort of in a in an

1657
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:32,720
ambiguous state will it be a happy

1658
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,960
surprise or will it be an unhappy

1659
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,359
surprise and so i think this this kind

1660
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:39,680
of pulls that out

1661
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,839
you

1662
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:44,720
the the ambiguity applies a certain

1663
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,720
amount of risk but then you have to you

1664
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,440
have to act in the active inference

1665
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,920
aspect of it to determine

1666
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,160
whether or not the surprise will let the

1667
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,920
other side of it is actually

1668
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:56,720
good

1669
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,160
or not so good

1670
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:01,039
so i think that's where the curiosity

1671
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:02,400
arm of this

1672
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,799
comes to the fore it is non-targeted

1673
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:05,760
until

1674
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,039
it actually

1675
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:08,160
has been

1676
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,720
realized or somehow materialized

1677
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,400
whereas the

1678
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,119
the targeted stuff the desire stuff

1679
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:18,640
and be part of your plan

1680
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,920
i'm not sure whether the curiosity fits

1681
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:26,160
as conveniently as the desire does

1682
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,799
and just one short note on that is we

1683
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:31,280
see a conditioning on policy

1684
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,520
right

1685
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:35,760
in a few different places so

1686
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,440
it'd be interesting to think about where

1687
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,839
does planning to learn

1688
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:41,280
come into play

1689
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,440
and in what ways is planning to learn

1690
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,960
directed

1691
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,960
or what if you plan to

1692
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,000
have undirected learning

1693
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,680
or all these other combinations david

1694
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:57,039
yeah i'm not sure if it would exactly

1695
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:58,799
fit in with the equations i'm thinking

1696
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,599
here like maslow's hierarchy of needs

1697
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:03,760
defined in terms of the free energy

1698
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,039
principle

1699
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:06,559
where um

1700
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:08,640
you know so to say curiosity

1701
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,000
requires

1702
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,319
excess energy so if you're on the first

1703
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:14,000
trunk of the hierarchy

1704
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,960
that you have limited energy to apply

1705
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,960
towards curiosity and if you do have

1706
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,000
energy to apply towards curiosity you're

1707
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,839
going to be best off to be curious about

1708
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:28,559
things that will directly apply to you

1709
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:31,039
know your security uh you know your food

1710
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:34,480
or the primal uh directives as opposed

1711
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,520
to uh

1712
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,720
if you move up

1713
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,079
up the hierarchy

1714
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:40,160
of at least put this into maslow's

1715
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,920
hierarchy where there you know there's

1716
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,640
less risk associated with curiosity that

1717
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,240
maybe you've achieved more

1718
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,720
leisure activity and then and therefore

1719
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:49,839
have more

1720
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:51,280
um

1721
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,920
energy to expand towards curiosity that

1722
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,599
you could reach the highest levels of

1723
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:58,880
massless hierarchy and focus on

1724
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,960
your ideals and

1725
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,480
what is the meaning of truth or

1726
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,760
understanding

1727
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,200
uh science

1728
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,960
but it would still be

1729
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,160
you know however you're defining the

1730
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,559
free energy principle that you have some

1731
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:12,079
sort of uh

1732
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,799
conservation of energy and curiosity is

1733
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:17,440
an expansion of energy

1734
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,119
that uh

1735
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:22,079
is limited uh but uh you know more

1736
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:24,799
resources could be allocated so to say

1737
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:28,240
energy resources to curiosity if it uh

1738
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,559
makes the whole you know uh

1739
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:33,039
unified uh your person more

1740
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,160
more uh um efficient and you know they

1741
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,160
become more secure more safe more social

1742
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,000
except so and so on and therefore

1743
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,680
they're more energy to expand towards

1744
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,319
curiosity

1745
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:47,200
thanks ali

1746
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:51,520
i also think uh it might be helpful to

1747
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,480
uh

1748
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,240
mention the neural basis for um

1749
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:59,520
these surprise appraisals because uh you

1750
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,960
see uh

1751
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,160
as we know we have two systems of

1752
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,960
thinking system one system two famously

1753
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,359
uh sketched out by uh

1754
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:11,200
conor manning taversky

1755
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,000
or

1756
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,960
fast track and slow track of reacting to

1757
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,319
stimuli

1758
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:17,039
so

1759
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,039
in the fast track

1760
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:20,480
uh well uh

1761
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,720
the stimuli uh bypass the sensory cortex

1762
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,119
and go directly from thalamus to

1763
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:31,440
amygdala right so uh our first reaction

1764
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,720
our immediate

1765
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,200
reaction to every surprise

1766
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,319
uh would be something quite similar to

1767
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:39,359
fear

1768
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:42,960
but then after uh appraising that

1769
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,039
stimulate stimulus

1770
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:47,440
after going through the sensory cortex

1771
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,960
and dynamic delay and then the

1772
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:54,000
hippocampus uh then we can appraise uh

1773
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,039
we can't evaluate that surprise as being

1774
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:58,960
positive or negative

1775
01:06:58,960 --> 01:06:59,680
and

1776
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,319
as a result of that we get a positive or

1777
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:05,280
negative balance effect

1778
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,440
so

1779
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:13,119
in summary uh well every surprise

1780
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:16,079
i mean either positive or negative it

1781
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:18,480
could be at first at the very first

1782
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,000
moment uh the um uh kind of

1783
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,760
uh

1784
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,200
negative uh

1785
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,760
can induce a negative balance emotion in

1786
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,839
us

1787
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,720
yes i i brought in some of the quotes

1788
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,480
from this paper um habitual and

1789
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,720
reflective control in hierarchical

1790
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,240
predictive coding

1791
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,839
it's uh from 2021 and it's by king horn

1792
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:43,920
millage and buckley

1793
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,400
so they directly connect hierarchical

1794
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,000
predictive coding architectures which

1795
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,319
when they consider action have a lot to

1796
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:54,400
do with active inference

1797
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,160
in terms of thinking fast and slow like

1798
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,000
you had just brought up

1799
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
so they wrote on this view fast actions

1800
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,920
may be triggered using only the lower

1801
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,760
levels of the hierarchical predictive

1802
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,119
coding schema

1803
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:06,960
whereas more deliberative actions need

1804
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,160
higher layers

1805
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,720
we demonstrate that hpc can distribute

1806
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,640
learning throughout its hierarchy with

1807
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,640
higher layers called into use only as

1808
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,080
required

1809
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,040
so

1810
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,120
that is very interesting when we think

1811
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,880
about

1812
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,600
going back to the mai dai distinction

1813
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,920
from this paper

1814
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,759
it's a hybrid model

1815
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:30,399
albeit one where the motor spatial

1816
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:33,120
control is continuous or modeled as

1817
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,319
continuous

1818
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,560
and then there's a more discrete

1819
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,439
more mental or cognitive model that's

1820
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:41,920
like thinking slow so it's almost like

1821
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,520
there's thinking fast and slow even

1822
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,359
within the mind and then there's

1823
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:47,198
thinking with the body

1824
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:49,759
and that's like even a lower level i

1825
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:53,359
don't think even by thinking fast

1826
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:55,359
they weren't talking about the reflex

1827
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:57,279
arc

1828
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:59,439
but there can be hierarchical modeling

1829
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:00,880
even there

1830
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,560
um

1831
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,719
so

1832
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,000
it uh

1833
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,080
what are these

1834
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,679
nested models

1835
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:13,839
that are slower

1836
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:16,399
how do those develop are they related to

1837
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:17,439
the

1838
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,600
physical architecture

1839
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:20,799
of

1840
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:22,319
our onboard

1841
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:23,520
machinery

1842
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,600
to what extent do they involve so many

1843
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,679
of our offsourced

1844
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:30,640
or extended cognitive phenomena like our

1845
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:33,198
colleagues like our social networks

1846
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:35,279
our books and learnings the social

1847
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:38,319
structures that scaffold our beliefs and

1848
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:39,920
so on

1849
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,920
there's a lot of interesting pieces

1850
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,279
there

1851
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,198
um

1852
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:48,080
what would be a good direction to go

1853
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:51,679
in this second half of the dot too um

1854
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:54,960
we had targeted non-targeted

1855
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,159
is there anything there that's not

1856
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:00,800
covered by the curiosity discussion is

1857
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,560
there

1858
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:06,239
oh unmute dean then yes go for it

1859
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:09,760
sorry about that yeah i think we pretty

1860
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,440
much okay

1861
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,520
wrestle that one to the ground

1862
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,560
okay do it

1863
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,120
yeah my conception for targeted i'm

1864
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,280
calling the unified eye

1865
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,040
in terms of uh

1866
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,199
you know maybe like the ant colony

1867
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:26,480
where uh

1868
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,520
if you

1869
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,199
you could look at it like the ants are

1870
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:30,400
all functioning

1871
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,520
personally

1872
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,120
with their own

1873
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,840
uh your directive behavior and it just

1874
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,159
works out that they're directed or or as

1875
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:40,880
a unit but even like a human

1876
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,360
whether there's a unified

1877
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:44,800
um

1878
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,560
of the human cells like even sense

1879
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,239
perception that you know it's easier to

1880
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:49,679
look at it like our

1881
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,760
our uh um

1882
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,360
you know like i mentioned we have 100

1883
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,760
like almost 100 million cones and rods

1884
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,360
in our eyes that are receiving photons

1885
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,600
at every given instant and you just look

1886
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,360
at it like they're active acting in a

1887
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,880
unified manner

1888
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,360
um but even that requires some sort of

1889
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,000
targeted behavior that the you for even

1890
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,440
direct motor

1891
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,880
motor control

1892
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:13,040
that our cells in our given body are

1893
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:16,960
acting in a unified manner and could you

1894
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:21,040
uh you take the free energy principle to

1895
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,719
a cellular level

1896
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:24,159
and say well

1897
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:27,920
cells will act in a unified way

1898
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,520
if it's in accordance with the free

1899
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,600
energy principle but if it wasn't in

1900
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,800
accordance with the free energy

1901
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,120
principle then cells don't act in a

1902
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,199
unified targeted way

1903
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:39,440
and act according to their own levels

1904
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,360
i'm not sure if you could take that to

1905
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,280
the cellular level for

1906
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,120
even things like sense perception motor

1907
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:47,040
control like one arm wants to go this

1908
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,120
way and one arm wants to go that way and

1909
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:53,400
how do we have this unified control

1910
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:57,360
it's it's interesting thing about what

1911
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,960
would it what would make something

1912
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,280
concord or not with fep because it's a

1913
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,760
description framework

1914
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:07,760
here is where in from live stream 25

1915
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,719
with uh professor levin

1916
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:14,400
here's even in the ant colony example

1917
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,280
where different subsystem and and cancer

1918
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,520
and and um like

1919
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,280
other situations like biofilms were

1920
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,840
modeled this way

1921
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:27,120
that there can be coherence within each

1922
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,320
tone

1923
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,239
so to speak

1924
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:32,480
uh

1925
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,159
i don't know if this moves us closer to

1926
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:37,440
understanding the experience of the eye

1927
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,719
or whether there is in fundament

1928
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:42,719
a unified eye

1929
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:43,440
but

1930
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,920
the cells in the nest mates body can be

1931
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,679
understood as undergoing coherent

1932
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:49,280
behavior

1933
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:52,080
nest mates can the colony can

1934
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,760
and then different people have taken

1935
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,600
different perspectives on

1936
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,159
what makes one level of analysis

1937
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:00,080
more relevant than others like an

1938
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,520
evolutionary perspective is that the

1939
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,120
unit of selection is granted some

1940
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,520
special power

1941
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,920
a information processing perspective or

1942
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,440
integrated information theory might

1943
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,760
highlight what happens informationally

1944
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,640
within and across levels

1945
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:22,000
let's look at the air their um

1946
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,440
dark room

1947
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,120
experiment

1948
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,560
we kind of

1949
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,640
came to it a little bit last time but

1950
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:31,360
what did anyone think their figure

1951
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,360
and simulation

1952
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,120
spoke to

1953
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:38,000
how was it adding

1954
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,480
details or

1955
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:45,480
information that weren't present in the

1956
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:48,960
more formalism and qualitative driven

1957
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:52,159
other sections of the paper

1958
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,159
i have a i have a question i don't know

1959
01:13:56,159 --> 01:13:57,760
if i have an

1960
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,199
interpretation of it when others when

1961
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:02,880
others looked at this

1962
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,520
as it's now craft out

1963
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,159
did they see ambiguity

1964
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:11,360
removal or did they see

1965
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,800
an entropy

1966
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,280
question being resolved because

1967
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,920
what i saw was the latter i i kind of

1968
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,120
saw

1969
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,880
that

1970
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,400
something

1971
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:25,520
something appeared with more information

1972
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,400
gain

1973
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:27,679
or something

1974
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:29,679
disappeared if there was

1975
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:30,719
no

1976
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:32,080
sense that

1977
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,280
that the

1978
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,679
that the change of an ambiguity state

1979
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:37,760
was going to make any difference so i'm

1980
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,440
kind of curious what

1981
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:40,640
others

1982
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,880
how others interpreted the the actual

1983
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,760
data as it as it laid out

1984
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,320
post talk because this is all post hoc

1985
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:52,840
this is just comparing 0.7.3.2.99.01

1986
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,679
in terms of it is in terms of the

1987
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:05,440
desired strength

1988
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,040
and then i think they use the term

1989
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:09,280
urgency in the paper

1990
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:10,640
going

1991
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,960
right

1992
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,199
yes

1993
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,080
well

1994
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:21,040
on on the left side um okay so time is

1995
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,719
there's uh time is moving from left to

1996
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:25,120
right

1997
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,239
there's a an entity that doesn't

1998
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:30,719
desire they don't have a preference for

1999
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:32,560
achieving ice cream

2000
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,719
and in this simulation run

2001
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:36,719
they observed that they were in a dark

2002
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:37,520
room

2003
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,760
and they picked the decision to flip a

2004
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,840
switch

2005
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,199
they then

2006
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:46,320
went to the right

2007
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,239
and they ended up

2008
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:49,600
not finding

2009
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,840
that they got ice cream

2010
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:59,360
the weak desire agent first

2011
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:01,840
flips a switch

2012
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,239
and then

2013
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:06,800
with higher confidence

2014
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,480
goes to the left

2015
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:12,639
and they end up realizing ice cream

2016
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:16,480
in this case of the strong desire agent

2017
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,480
even though they have uncertainty about

2018
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:21,839
going left or right initially

2019
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,520
they're in a hurry

2020
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,520
or it's urgent

2021
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,960
and they go left immediately

2022
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,760
and that turns out that it does

2023
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:32,800
achieve

2024
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:36,239
getting the ice cream

2025
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:45,440
one one note is like

2026
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:48,159
these are only showing one run of each

2027
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:51,120
of those simulations

2028
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,120
so it's like

2029
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,760
does the

2030
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:00,719
no desire entity always go to the right

2031
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:04,159
or is that a 50 50

2032
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:10,320
how have people use the bdi to do

2033
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:13,679
quantitative modeling of behavior

2034
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:15,520
are they moving

2035
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:18,480
their verbal and formal arguments from

2036
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,560
above in the paper

2037
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,360
into a form factor

2038
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,839
that will

2039
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:29,679
be more amenable or palatable

2040
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:31,520
to people who are already using these

2041
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,600
models to do

2042
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,640
behavioral analysis

2043
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,679
well i think the bdi

2044
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:44,320
i mean strictly from the standpoint of

2045
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,920
here's what we watched

2046
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,760
this agent do

2047
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,320
it kind of it kind of had a 50 50 choice

2048
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,000
it was playing more in the geometry

2049
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,760
space how this is represented is more

2050
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,640
sort of the bayesian distribution piece

2051
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,800
right so you've got a

2052
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,920
percentage of of an area as you're

2053
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:04,880
moving

2054
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,000
from left to right that's either

2055
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,760
darkened or

2056
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,159
remains agnostic it doesn't it doesn't

2057
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:13,920
sort of change

2058
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,199
what

2059
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:18,560
what the outcome or what the the

2060
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:22,000
matching of an outcome and

2061
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,560
the expected free energy are

2062
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,480
so i think that it just brings more

2063
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,480
information to the

2064
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,800
to the observation of what's actually

2065
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,480
going on when

2066
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,719
when the lights either do go on or don't

2067
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:36,560
go on because that first one

2068
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,800
the lights don't go on i think and the

2069
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,120
agent either stumbles

2070
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:44,080
to the right place or doesn't

2071
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,800
but they don't care

2072
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,520
but i do think that what what happens

2073
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,120
is

2074
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,760
you can have geometry only or you can

2075
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,320
have deep geometry and

2076
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,800
a proportion or a distribution and i

2077
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,640
think that's what this is

2078
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,880
kind of laying out for us that you now

2079
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,880
you've got more information

2080
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,640
and with more information hopefully

2081
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,719
you've got less

2082
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:11,679
less uh

2083
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:15,360
invariance you've got more variance

2084
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,520
being described here than you would if

2085
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,199
you left the vocal geometric bubble

2086
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:23,520
alone does that make sense

2087
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,560
yes

2088
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,679
and uh they they follow up

2089
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:30,000
after the figure

2090
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,440
that this magnitude mapping

2091
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,840
it's

2092
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:39,199
giving not just some theoretical detail

2093
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:40,719
to this

2094
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:42,719
mapping

2095
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:45,600
and they provide several citations many

2096
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:50,280
recently with smith and others

2097
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,960
um where it's used

2098
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,080
in in many different contexts and then i

2099
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,480
i kind of found it

2100
01:19:58,480 --> 01:19:59,600
uh

2101
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,800
also interesting in the following

2102
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:03,760
uh

2103
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,840
sentences after the paragraph that i had

2104
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,800
just quoted there

2105
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,080
this motivating force could be

2106
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,080
corresponding to the magnitude of the kl

2107
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,600
divergence

2108
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,199
kl divergence

2109
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:19,679
between the q variational distribution

2110
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:22,639
of observations conditioned upon policy

2111
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:24,320
divergence with

2112
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,400
the preference distribution

2113
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,960
p of up

2114
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,679
within the expected free energy

2115
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:33,120
so that's one of the terms that we've

2116
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,040
looked at in the g of pi

2117
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,719
i.e the risk term

2118
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:40,400
not the ambiguity term with the entropy

2119
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,920
this is because stronger preference

2120
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,040
values over rewarding outcomes in p of o

2121
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:48,880
of t increase the kale divergence

2122
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,120
and lead the agent to seek reward over

2123
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:54,000
information gain

2124
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,960
so there's still a knob

2125
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,719
maybe multiple that are slightly

2126
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:00,400
interacting

2127
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,560
there's a knob by which

2128
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,320
more

2129
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,960
pure curiosity that would be just the

2130
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,360
ambiguity resolving

2131
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:12,400
but undirected

2132
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,719
mixtures of pure curiosity and directed

2133
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:16,080
curiosity

2134
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,159
weak preferences

2135
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:20,480
with a lot of openness

2136
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,880
and increasingly sharp

2137
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,880
preference distributions

2138
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,320
induce

2139
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,719
increasingly urgent

2140
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:32,159
pragmatic values seeking outcomes

2141
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:32,900
and um

2142
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:34,320
[Music]

2143
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,239
there's a lot of

2144
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:39,600
funny things that come to mind like

2145
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,199
a question for one person might be a

2146
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:42,719
survival question

2147
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:44,400
for another it might be a research

2148
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,480
question for another it might be like a

2149
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,599
pure curiosity

2150
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:51,280
um

2151
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:54,080
where's the oxygen in this room

2152
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:57,040
is that a survival question is that just

2153
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,080
um

2154
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,440
you know again are you researching

2155
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:01,920
oxygen distributions in rooms so you

2156
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:04,239
have a target to understand that or are

2157
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:06,560
you just curious about that thought um

2158
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,159
dean then do it

2159
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:10,639
i think that i think daniel that clearly

2160
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:12,719
speaks to what david and ali were both

2161
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,480
mentioning in terms of so what's your

2162
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,080
time frame here right

2163
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,679
so you take off and you have a bird

2164
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:19,520
strike and now you don't have enough

2165
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,560
time

2166
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,679
to

2167
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:23,440
land anywhere

2168
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:24,400
on the river

2169
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,400
is that curiosity

2170
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,480
it's that desire

2171
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,120
is that what is that in terms of how

2172
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,679
much time do you have now to manage

2173
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:35,520
the risk

2174
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,600
aspect of this

2175
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,120
this situation that you now find

2176
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:42,320
yourself under certainly survival

2177
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:45,360
but yeah what what what percentages or

2178
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,760
what proportions of each one of these

2179
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:48,719
different

2180
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:51,199
parts of the equation

2181
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:54,880
are being calculated at any given moment

2182
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,760
relative to the overall time frame that

2183
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,679
you're now constrained under

2184
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:01,520
so

2185
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,760
yes dude

2186
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,400
yeah we just look at the refrigerator

2187
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,159
you know example that

2188
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:10,639
well okay had i been curious

2189
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:12,560
you know earlier during the day

2190
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,880
about the layout of the room i might

2191
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,560
have remembered how to get to the

2192
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,639
refrigerator but i i didn't expend that

2193
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:21,120
mental energy so here i am hungry

2194
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:24,000
and i don't know my surroundings

2195
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,480
and so you have the level of curiosity

2196
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,159
could have provided benefit but now at

2197
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:29,600
this point uh

2198
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,040
uh you know you have the risk factor

2199
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,199
will i injure myself or or

2200
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:35,440
eat and i was thinking uh

2201
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,440
you know like chess or something like

2202
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,520
okay like i'm uh

2203
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,400
the

2204
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,920
alpha zero

2205
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:42,639
is

2206
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:44,159
programmed with the you know the most

2207
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:47,040
powerful computers for hours and hours

2208
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,600
to just understand the game

2209
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,360
and then later it's able to take that

2210
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,239
and win

2211
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:54,080
uh so like as a person it's like okay i

2212
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,679
really just like thinking about chess

2213
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:57,679
and understanding the patterns but then

2214
01:23:57,679 --> 01:23:59,679
you know well i have to reproduce i have

2215
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:02,560
to see to the success of my children

2216
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,159
in the offspring i have to uh you know

2217
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:05,920
make money and survive

2218
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,000
and so you know maybe i could become a

2219
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
professional chess player or something

2220
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,360
like that but then you would come and

2221
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:15,360
come in and well um if my goal is to uh

2222
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,199
you know reproduce and see the success

2223
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:18,639
of my offspring

2224
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:20,320
and you know make money and survive

2225
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,400
there's better methods to do that than

2226
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,679
becoming a

2227
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:24,960
professional chess player even like

2228
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,239
active inference

2229
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:28,000
that okay i'm curious about how this

2230
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
stuff works but it's probably not going

2231
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,639
to help me reproduce or make a living

2232
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:34,560
and if i try to you know take my

2233
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,639
curiosity about consciousness

2234
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:37,600
and

2235
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,520
use that to benefit reproduction or

2236
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,600
making or making a living

2237
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,199
it's unlikely

2238
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:44,480
uh to

2239
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,400
see that much uh

2240
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,440
fruition

2241
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,760
but at the same time the the

2242
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,360
i mean the power of curiosities you

2243
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,679
don't know how it's gonna benefit you so

2244
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:55,920
the ice cream example you know if we if

2245
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:57,760
we had a meeting in the kitchen you know

2246
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,360
during the day and then we all go back

2247
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,800
to our rooms to go to sleep and then

2248
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,800
we're hungry at night the person who was

2249
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,040
just curious about how the room uh was

2250
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,679
laid out is going to be able to uh you

2251
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:09,760
know likely retrieve the ice cream

2252
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,080
without any injury as were the person

2253
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,719
who didn't expand the energy to be

2254
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:16,960
curious about the layer uh layout of the

2255
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:17,840
room

2256
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,520
uh may not achieve

2257
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:22,080
uh the ice cream and that's why i like

2258
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,320
in my in my own head it may not be you

2259
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,920
know directly applicable to this paper

2260
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,080
but it could be in folk psychology

2261
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,000
uh it would be to

2262
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,360
you know map this to something like

2263
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,120
maslow's hierarchy of rules which would

2264
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:33,840
be

2265
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,760
in line with neural nets that there

2266
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,440
would be some sort of

2267
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:40,080
higher order rules and some sort of

2268
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,400
ability to uh

2269
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,000
put the expansion

2270
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,719
of more energy like okay like i thought

2271
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:48,880
about chess and now i'm winning and i've

2272
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,880
achieved a little bit of social standing

2273
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:53,199
or you know want a little prize money or

2274
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:54,480
you know even school

2275
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,800
i was curious about consciousness now i

2276
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,880
got a bachelor's degree and i have

2277
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:01,520
enough proficiency to you know get a job

2278
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,199
and support a family

2279
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:05,360
and now i could exhort even more energy

2280
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:06,320
to it

2281
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:09,199
but at the time of the pure curiosity

2282
01:26:09,199 --> 01:26:11,840
you don't know how it may uh you

2283
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:15,760
actually benefit you in terms of reward

2284
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:17,440
great

2285
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,679
points that it's almost like jumping

2286
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:21,600
through different hoops

2287
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:22,400
what

2288
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,920
it might be best accomplished through

2289
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:27,040
pure curiosity

2290
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:29,679
at a future time point

2291
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:32,719
so in in again that survival research

2292
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:35,600
and pure curiosity trilemma

2293
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,239
there's times where being driven by one

2294
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:40,320
or the other

2295
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,679
helps us

2296
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:43,840
move through complex real world

2297
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,679
situations

2298
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:46,960
if we knew

2299
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,520
the whole story from the beginning

2300
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:52,239
then we could just follow along

2301
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:53,120
but

2302
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:55,760
in a highly partial information world

2303
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:58,000
where we don't want our priors

2304
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,159
to

2305
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:03,040
lead to ruin basically

2306
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:07,199
then pure curiosity and research

2307
01:27:07,199 --> 01:27:08,800
help

2308
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:12,239
bring things within our survivable limit

2309
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:14,159
into information gathering spaces that

2310
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:15,760
we wouldn't necessarily

2311
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,760
have traveled to

2312
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,120
limited resources i don't know if they

2313
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,480
could program that also into the

2314
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:21,920
computer also like the limit of

2315
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,679
resources and if that

2316
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:25,440
if you interpret free energy principle

2317
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,840
in general to you'll be a definition of

2318
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:31,639
limited energy resources

2319
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,599
ali

2320
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:39,679
uh well uh yeah adding to my uh

2321
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:42,960
own previous comments about uh the

2322
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:46,400
subject of consciousness and curiosity

2323
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,719
i personally believe that the nature of

2324
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:50,400
consciousness is ultimately

2325
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,000
computational

2326
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,080
so it's amenable to

2327
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:56,000
modeling and

2328
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,840
similar simulation but

2329
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:00,719
we're we're just not there yet

2330
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:01,679
but

2331
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:03,120
well

2332
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:04,080
one

2333
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:07,920
possible approach to

2334
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:10,960
to achieve such model could be

2335
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,199
potentially the active inference

2336
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:15,840
approach or other related approaches

2337
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:18,880
but uh you see

2338
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:22,320
curiosity is just one aspect of uh

2339
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:25,280
consciousness and uh i think

2340
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:27,679
it should it could probably be helpful

2341
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:30,560
to distinguish between the artificial

2342
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:31,920
curiosity

2343
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:34,880
and the experience of curiosity or the

2344
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,679
phenomenology of the curiosity because

2345
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:39,679
what we see here is

2346
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:42,800
the agent that simulates the artificial

2347
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:46,080
curiosity uh and and not it's not

2348
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,679
exactly

2349
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:50,239
uh isomorphic with

2350
01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:53,840
the experience we get from our derived

2351
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:54,719
to

2352
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:57,920
our information seeking drives and uh

2353
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:00,960
and in fact uh in this paper i think it

2354
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,320
was in page

2355
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,719
uh 28

2356
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:05,600
yes

2357
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,760
it's in page 28

2358
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,719
that uh they state that uh

2359
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:12,560
we have not addressed questions about

2360
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:14,239
the structure regenerative model would

2361
01:29:14,239 --> 01:29:17,679
need in order to account for experiences

2362
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:19,920
of beliefs and desires

2363
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,760
uh so

2364
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,080
well at least in this paper we're not

2365
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,440
dealing with

2366
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:29,120
the actual uh experience of curiosity

2367
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:30,880
we're just trying to

2368
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:34,080
somehow model uh and simulate the

2369
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:36,239
artificial curiosity in fact this term

2370
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:38,880
artificial curiosity is one favored by

2371
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,360
carl priston himself in his various

2372
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:42,159
other

2373
01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:44,159
lectures

2374
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:46,960
yes very good point

2375
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,639
and it relates to kind of the

2376
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:50,880
experienced view from the inside

2377
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,719
versus the behavioral modeling view from

2378
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:55,600
the outside a curious particle or a

2379
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,679
curious forager

2380
01:29:57,679 --> 01:29:59,360
might be engaging in some kind of

2381
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,280
behavior but

2382
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:02,480
that isn't

2383
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,080
the same thing

2384
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,120
as

2385
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:06,880
experience of

2386
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:09,440
but they do provide references to

2387
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:10,320
other

2388
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:13,360
uh work like including work that has

2389
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:14,880
been discussed previously on live

2390
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,960
streams with christopher white and ryan

2391
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,000
smith

2392
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:22,239
on report paradigms of consciousness

2393
01:30:22,239 --> 01:30:24,480
um as we kind of head towards the end

2394
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:26,718
here

2395
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:29,440
i thought this was very interesting in

2396
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:32,400
the section before the conclusion 11

2397
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,320
free energy principle and direction of

2398
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:35,280
fit

2399
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:37,920
and this is kind of a good

2400
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:40,880
section to to carry out and

2401
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,639
bring forward into our other discussions

2402
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:45,280
on active

2403
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:48,480
for any organism described by the fep

2404
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:49,840
the description will contain an

2405
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,920
implicitly normative state element about

2406
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,320
the states the organism should be in

2407
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,560
and can be described as having cognitive

2408
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:58,719
desire-like direction of fit

2409
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:00,800
so there's a

2410
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,880
preference distribution

2411
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:06,159
and as this paper is building up it can

2412
01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:08,159
have an interpretation

2413
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:12,320
as desire being a targeted desire

2414
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:14,560
even beyond the case

2415
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,360
a forward-looking afford-looking

2416
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:17,520
decision-making agents

2417
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,600
not all bayesian beliefs in the fap

2418
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,840
formalism are best characterized as

2419
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:26,159
doxastic being about belief doxology

2420
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:28,800
this perspective may expand upon current

2421
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,880
discussion in the fep literature

2422
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,880
where it is fairly prominent to discuss

2423
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,360
as if beliefs in simple systems

2424
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:37,520
whether a mere active entity like a

2425
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,120
pendulum or

2426
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,360
adaptive active entities and just say

2427
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:42,719
well i'm not saying that it really

2428
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:44,800
believes that it's acting as if it

2429
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,800
believes that

2430
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:49,120
that conform to the fep

2431
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,920
here our point is they can also

2432
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:54,560
equally be described as having as if

2433
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:57,120
desires

2434
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:00,400
belief entered the active

2435
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:03,120
lexicon slash ontology

2436
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:05,679
perhaps because belief is used also in

2437
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:08,159
bayesian statistics where distributions

2438
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:10,560
more generally are called beliefs

2439
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:13,440
also disjoint from the phenomenology of

2440
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,920
experiencing a belief but rather that's

2441
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,400
just called belief updating

2442
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,520
is like a

2443
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:22,960
process in bayesian statistics

2444
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:24,480
this paper

2445
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:27,120
kind of closes the loop with belief

2446
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:30,080
not towards phenomenology but stapling

2447
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,080
together some of the bayesian

2448
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:35,199
distributional usage of the term belief

2449
01:32:35,199 --> 01:32:38,320
with the doxastic

2450
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,639
being about belief the aboutness of

2451
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:43,199
those bayesian beliefs is the folk

2452
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:47,280
psychological concept of belief

2453
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:50,239
by making that mapping

2454
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:52,880
and connecting the formalism as a whole

2455
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:54,480
or at least in the

2456
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,639
core equations like the f and the g

2457
01:32:56,639 --> 01:32:58,960
to the bdi model

2458
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,199
it also allows them to identify which

2459
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:03,840
bayesian belief distributions map to

2460
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,679
belief in the bdi

2461
01:33:05,679 --> 01:33:07,760
and which bayesian belief distributions

2462
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:09,679
map to d

2463
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:11,520
to the desires

2464
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,280
in the bdi

2465
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:15,679
and so to the extent that somebody can

2466
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:16,719
say

2467
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:20,800
a system has an as if belief

2468
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:24,400
implicitly in a folk psychological way

2469
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:29,920
we can also talk about as if desires

2470
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,600
and that

2471
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:33,199
helps

2472
01:33:33,199 --> 01:33:35,440
partition

2473
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:38,480
but not disregard the discussion around

2474
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:40,560
what different systems experience the

2475
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:43,920
classic you know what is it like to be x

2476
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:44,719
but

2477
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:46,080
it

2478
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:48,080
at least according to this

2479
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:51,280
argument and perspective authorizes

2480
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:53,040
usage of

2481
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:55,600
intentions and desires

2482
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,760
intentions arising from basically the

2483
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:58,960
combination of the beliefs and the

2484
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:01,440
desires in the bdi

2485
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:02,880
and talking about

2486
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:06,560
octave systems as if they have desires

2487
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:11,600
what is that simulation desirous of

2488
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:14,800
and then using its beliefs and desires

2489
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,280
to explain its intentional behavior

2490
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:19,199
not the experience of intentionality

2491
01:34:19,199 --> 01:34:20,800
experience of belief experience of

2492
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:23,840
desire but using them in this

2493
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,840
view from the outside

2494
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:28,880
more deflationary perspective so

2495
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:30,320
that's quite interesting and i think

2496
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:33,520
something that will be uh

2497
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:35,440
we'll see how it

2498
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:38,000
catches on

2499
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,280
are there other sections that people

2500
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,760
want to talk about or what

2501
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,360
will they carry

2502
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:51,840
forward into their

2503
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,440
post-46

2504
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:56,440
life

2505
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:01,840
i think daniel a couple of things i

2506
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,520
think the desire to think part that

2507
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:05,280
you're just talking about there

2508
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:08,000
i'm not sure that it's specific

2509
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,080
in nature i think it's more

2510
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,400
generalizable and and sort of that scale

2511
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:13,600
free

2512
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,500
never

2513
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,199
[Music]

2514
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:18,400
to

2515
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:19,920
to some of the stuff that you've brought

2516
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:20,410
up um

2517
01:35:20,410 --> 01:35:22,000
[Music]

2518
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,100
i think that when you when you

2519
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:26,560
[Music]

2520
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:28,239
when you start getting getting to know

2521
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:30,400
active inference a little bit more and

2522
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:33,119
i'll speak from personal experience

2523
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:35,119
with a focus on a little bit of

2524
01:35:35,119 --> 01:35:36,719
sort of personal grooming you become one

2525
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:39,199
heck of an attractive state and so

2526
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:41,119
i think you might not make money off of

2527
01:35:41,119 --> 01:35:43,360
that but at this point but i think as

2528
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,920
you get more comfortable with the kind

2529
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:48,480
of being able to take the information

2530
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,239
and uh

2531
01:35:50,239 --> 01:35:52,000
use it across a variety of different

2532
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,480
situations it's um

2533
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:56,080
it's actually is quite helpful i don't

2534
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:58,080
think i'll i'll ever get rich off of it

2535
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:00,159
at this point but it it is kind of

2536
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:01,760
interesting how

2537
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:04,560
it's um i think it is growing in terms

2538
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:05,760
of the amount of attention that it's

2539
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,280
getting so

2540
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:09,360
that's kind of my

2541
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:12,560
my two takes on this so far

2542
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,480
so you're saying it might

2543
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,560
influence fitness

2544
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:18,880
i think it might down the road as long

2545
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:21,840
as we have enough time scale

2546
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:24,840
dude

2547
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,960
you know i've been coaching chess for a

2548
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:28,719
while and mostly to youth and i'm used

2549
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:31,440
to explaining uh

2550
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:32,960
somewhat you know these concepts like

2551
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:34,239
you know i i

2552
01:36:34,239 --> 01:36:36,639
want you to say that uh

2553
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:38,960
people who are just curious about chess

2554
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,400
and how the patterns work and how the

2555
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,960
pieces work often improve much faster

2556
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:45,199
than people who desire to win

2557
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:47,119
and that a lot of times people will

2558
01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:49,920
reach a certain strength and then uh

2559
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:52,639
their curiosity diminishes and it's just

2560
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:55,119
their desire to win which isn't enough

2561
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:56,800
that you know it's just like i want to

2562
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:59,440
spend my night thinking about these uh

2563
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,639
patterns

2564
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:02,800
uh versus like i really want to you know

2565
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:03,520
win

2566
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:05,600
and have some sort of practical benefit

2567
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:06,800
from

2568
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,239
my efforts so

2569
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:09,680
uh you know i have my own

2570
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:11,040
[Music]

2571
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,800
personal you know goals that brought me

2572
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,159
to active inference because i was

2573
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:16,080
looking for my own tools to advance my

2574
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,320
own research and came on to active

2575
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:21,360
inference as a a method or tool that

2576
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,440
even though i you know like

2577
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:25,440
it appears that you know the majority of

2578
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:26,800
people are using it for a different

2579
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:29,199
purpose that i would be able to rework

2580
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:32,080
it for my own purpose but because it's a

2581
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,159
interdisciplinary study and like you

2582
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:35,520
know i'm an engineer and like

2583
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:37,600
engineering usually works that way

2584
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:38,960
where someone has

2585
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,440
professional certification they sign off

2586
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,040
and you could expect that they did their

2587
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:44,880
part right and it's going to work

2588
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,800
and you could

2589
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,719
you know attach that module to your

2590
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:51,760
module and both modules are going to do

2591
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:53,760
what they said they're going to do uh

2592
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,520
and then you know the curiosity will do

2593
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:56,960
i really want to understand how your

2594
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:59,600
module works you know do i really care

2595
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:02,639
about dean and ali's research or you

2596
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:04,400
know do i just uh you know want to trust

2597
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:06,320
that their module works and i'm going to

2598
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,560
be able to attach that to my module to

2599
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:11,119
uh you know make make something uh

2600
01:38:11,119 --> 01:38:13,199
more powerful and both are probably true

2601
01:38:13,199 --> 01:38:15,119
to you know to

2602
01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:17,600
you know limited uh energy uh limited

2603
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,360
resources that uh you know that i would

2604
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:21,840
like to understand dean and ali's module

2605
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:24,880
to the best of my ability but energy uh

2606
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:28,000
time allocation uh resources are are

2607
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,159
limited uh but then you know certainly

2608
01:38:30,159 --> 01:38:31,679
if you had a module that would help my

2609
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:33,520
module and we could plug them in

2610
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:35,600
together and uh you create a more

2611
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:38,000
powerful interface so that i'm bullish

2612
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,360
about active inference uh and uh as a

2613
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:42,400
framework

2614
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,159
that will benefit uh you know the more

2615
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:46,560
and more people who get involved and i'm

2616
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:48,639
seeing my own direction in my own

2617
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:50,639
research how uh you know i think this

2618
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:52,719
will be useful and i even think uh

2619
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:54,239
i got uh

2620
01:38:54,239 --> 01:38:55,920
jennifer i think joined the discord and

2621
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:58,080
i mentioned it to a few other people

2622
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:59,840
that that might be able to advance their

2623
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:02,400
research and then try to understand uh

2624
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,960
you know the current uh existing modules

2625
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:07,280
uh you know that are that are out there

2626
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:09,360
you know within the act of inference and

2627
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,119
you know as i mentioned the first the

2628
01:39:11,119 --> 01:39:13,440
importance of interdisciplinary studies

2629
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:15,840
for uh you know big issues uh you know

2630
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,520
none of us are going to figure this out

2631
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:19,040
it's going to take interdisciplinary

2632
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:21,280
studies and none of us are going to be

2633
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:23,199
able to understand all the disciplines

2634
01:39:23,199 --> 01:39:24,480
necessary

2635
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:27,839
to piece together the bigger puzzle

2636
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:30,560
nice thank you yes interesting point

2637
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,239
about the uh

2638
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:34,080
curiosity driven

2639
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:36,239
learning

2640
01:39:36,239 --> 01:39:37,400
and how that can

2641
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:38,560
[Music]

2642
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:40,960
be like a

2643
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:44,800
not even paradoxically more successful

2644
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:47,440
approach or mentality to set off on a

2645
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:48,960
learning journey

2646
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,080
with

2647
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:50,450
um

2648
01:39:50,450 --> 01:39:53,440
[Music]

2649
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:56,080
i just think about somebody trying to

2650
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:58,320
learn organic chemistry which i tutored

2651
01:39:58,320 --> 01:39:59,760
for many years

2652
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,000
and people who set themselves up for the

2653
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,520
pragmatic value

2654
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:06,320
and said i want this outcome

2655
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:08,080
sometimes they achieve the outcome other

2656
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:09,679
times they didn't

2657
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:12,800
but it set up a lot of psychology around

2658
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:14,800
not achieving the outcome when it didn't

2659
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:17,119
happen on the expected timeline

2660
01:40:17,119 --> 01:40:19,119
and a lot of like secondary cascading

2661
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:22,080
failures

2662
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:23,760
however

2663
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:26,480
there's also the the clear counterpoint

2664
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:28,719
which is but if we don't

2665
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:31,280
want the higher grade

2666
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:32,719
then

2667
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:34,159
like if we're just going to be curious

2668
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:36,480
about learning organic chemistry like my

2669
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,239
finals in six weeks

2670
01:40:38,239 --> 01:40:39,920
so how are we going to balance the

2671
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:41,280
timelines

2672
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:44,159
and uh the curiosity and i think maybe

2673
01:40:44,159 --> 01:40:46,239
even this paper helped us look at one

2674
01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:47,119
way

2675
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:48,159
which is

2676
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:50,880
keep the preference direction

2677
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:53,679
but understand how the urgency of your

2678
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:56,320
preference

2679
01:40:57,199 --> 01:40:58,800
influences

2680
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:01,280
the way that you take action

2681
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:02,239
and

2682
01:41:02,239 --> 01:41:04,560
just think about what what if you what

2683
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:06,800
if your final was tomorrow how would you

2684
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:09,040
go about it okay now what if the final

2685
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:11,440
was in 100 years how would you go about

2686
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:12,719
it

2687
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:15,040
where are we in that continuum

2688
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:17,199
do we have time for curiosity and for

2689
01:41:17,199 --> 01:41:20,239
openness or is this an actual emergency

2690
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:22,880
situation

2691
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:25,119
and then we can triage where there is an

2692
01:41:25,119 --> 01:41:28,719
emergency organic chemistry situation

2693
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:31,119
but also hold space for curiosity and

2694
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:34,560
openness and even in the emergency there

2695
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:37,040
has to be information seeking it's just

2696
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:39,600
more directed information seeking okay

2697
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:40,880
we're going to work through the practice

2698
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:41,840
tests and that's what we're going to

2699
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:43,600
have time for

2700
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:44,800
there's still is going to be information

2701
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:47,600
seeking but not of the same kind if we

2702
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:51,360
had more time to kind of space out

2703
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,440
even though in a alternate slash

2704
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:54,800
preferable world perhaps that's the

2705
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:56,400
better way to learn or the more fun way

2706
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,000
to learn or

2707
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,239
so on

2708
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:02,960
any other

2709
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:05,280
thoughts

2710
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,760
uh well one of the things i really like

2711
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:10,880
about

2712
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:13,199
active imprints research is the

2713
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:15,600
willingness of the researchers in this

2714
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:16,960
area to

2715
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:21,119
uh seriously address the criticisms

2716
01:42:21,119 --> 01:42:22,320
instead of just

2717
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,000
dodging them and

2718
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,119
their willingness to to constantly

2719
01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:30,480
improve and update the theory uh in

2720
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:31,760
order to

2721
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:32,800
fill the

2722
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:35,679
fill the gaps and uh well

2723
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:36,960
and

2724
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,000
also

2725
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,960
address the uh

2726
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:44,239
uh well the weakness or any any weakness

2727
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:47,520
or loophole uh in the in the theory uh

2728
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,679
and that's uh very

2729
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:52,880
uh it's liberating to see such uh active

2730
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:56,480
area of research uh going uh

2731
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,400
going forward uh

2732
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:01,840
in a very determined and also very

2733
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:05,280
open-minded and open-minded way uh and

2734
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:06,639
uh well

2735
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:09,119
that's one of the things i think

2736
01:43:09,119 --> 01:43:11,520
sets it apart from

2737
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,840
other some other

2738
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:17,440
research areas today

2739
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:25,560
it's what we prefer it's what we expect

2740
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:28,880
we're curious about it

2741
01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:31,440
okay

2742
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:34,000

discussion and and ryan maxwell and alex

2744
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:40,320
for this paper it really capped off a

2745
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:41,280
long

2746
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:44,320
run of live streams we've had

2747
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:46,639
quite a nice sequence

2748
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:48,239
going back to

2749
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:50,960

2750
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:53,280
getting through many many

2751
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:55,440
discussions

2752
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:58,000
next week we're going to have the

2753
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,679
second quarterly

2754
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:01,920
roundtable meeting

2755
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:05,199
and then we'll have july off of

2756
01:44:05,199 --> 01:44:07,600
paper discussions

2757
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:10,480
and we'll be coming back in august with

2758
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:12,639
paper discussions

2759
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:13,840
we don't know exactly what they're going

2760
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:14,800
to be

2761
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:15,920
but

2762
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:18,159
we know some of them

2763
01:44:18,159 --> 01:44:20,800
and we have a few guest streams and

2764
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:23,360
other streams coming up but

2765
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:23,710
um

2766
01:44:23,710 --> 01:44:25,199
[Music]
