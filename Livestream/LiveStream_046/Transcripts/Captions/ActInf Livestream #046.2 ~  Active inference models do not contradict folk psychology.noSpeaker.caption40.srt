00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:29,896
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:30,797
Welcome to

3
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:31,831
Active Inference Lab

4
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,934
Livestream number 46.2.

5
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:36,936
It's June 22nd, 2022.

6
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,440
Welcome to the ActInfLab.

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,475
We're a participatory online lab

8
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:43,476
that is communicating,

9
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:44,911
learning and practicing

10
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,713
applied active inference.

11
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,380
You can find us

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,749
at the links on the slide.

13
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:50,784
This is a recorded

14
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,519
and archived livestream,

15
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,120
so please provide us with feedback

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,389
so we can improve our work.

17
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,223
All backgrounds

18
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,092
and perspectives are welcome

19
00:00:59,092 --> 00:00:59,492
and we'll

20
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,594
follow video etiquette for livestreams.

21
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,998
Head over to active inference

22
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:05,899
dot org

23
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,600
to learn about participating

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,235
in livestreams

25
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,638
or in the many other active

26
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:14,274
lab projects.

27
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:16,676
We're here

28
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:19,079
in our third discussion on the paper.

29
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:20,880
Active inference models

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,848
do not contradict

31
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:23,049
folk psychology

32
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,452
by Smith, Ramstad and Kieffer.

33
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:29,789
We had a zero with Ryan joining

34
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,892
and Jacob and Dean where we talk through

35
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:35,462
some of the backgrounds of this paper.

36
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:38,264
And last week in the Dark One,

37
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,767
we had a great discussion,

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,269
went a lot of ways as dot ones do,

39
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,138
and opened up some threads

40
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,507
to continue discussing in this start to.

41
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,275
I know each of you

42
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,478
have some things to bring up.

43
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,045
There's also

44
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,012
a few key

45
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,013
sections of the paper

46
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:54,681
that we haven't gone

47
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,449
into in much detail.

48
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,252
So there'll be a lot to do in the data.

49
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,621
And of course, everybody watching

50
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,257
live is also welcome to make comments.

51
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:06,759
We'll start

52
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,662
with just an introduction and warm up.

53
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:13,533
We can say hi and add

54
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:14,134
anything else

55
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,735
that we're looking forward

56
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,337
to talking about

57
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,372
or to reducing our uncertainty

58
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,407
about through today's discussion.

59
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:24,043
Or maybe even if it's not too early

60
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,147
where we'd like to be heading as we

61
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,616
take off on this Dark

62
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,118
two and leave the 46 series.

63
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:33,620
How does it

64
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,256
results in us

65
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:37,123
being different,

66
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:37,891
thinking differently,

67
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,259
actually differently

68
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:42,362
in the rest of our post 46 lives.

69
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,631
So I'm Daniel.

70
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,600
I'm a researcher in California and

71
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,670
just a conversation with Dean

72
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,738
before we began

73
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,541
about some other core concepts

74
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,010
other than beliefs, desires

75
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,344
and intentions.

76
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,246
So what other acronym models

77
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,881
could we use?

78
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:03,483
What other kinds of models

79
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,617
are consistent?

80
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,686
Or where else can active

81
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,688
inference be providing us extra

82
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,023
information or utility?

83
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:12,458
And a few other things.

84
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,295
And I'll pass it to Dean

85
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,030
instead of I'm Dean

86
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,332
in Calgary.

87
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,334
I think what I'm

88
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:22,735
curious about is a couple of things.

89
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:23,803
As I said, I'm

90
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:26,673
I'm curious about things are behaviors

91
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,908
that appear to be targeted versus

92
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:30,376
behaviors

93
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,478
that appear to be non-targeted.

94
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,681
And there was there was

95
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:35,682
there's some reference

96
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,417
to that in this paper.

97
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,184
The other thing is

98
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:38,651
they said,

99
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:43,489
I'm kind of curious about is this moving

100
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,492
to the place of saying that

101
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:47,293
active inference

102
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,262
has these different types,

103
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,364
be it extended or

104
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,832
decision making or motor

105
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:53,633
active inference,

106
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,735
and what the implications of that are.

107
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,403
The bottom line for me

108
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,305
is I think if we can

109
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,341
operationalize that word

110
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,845
through active inference,

111
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,847
it shouldn't be difficult to figure out

112
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,882
that that applies to behaviors,

113
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,285
that there's operations

114
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,753
grounding a lot of behavior.

115
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,121
So yeah, that's

116
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,556
what I'm kind of curious about

117
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:17,957
has to do with

118
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,528
the great to be back.

119
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:23,796
It's my second time on here.

120
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,765
I really appreciate this.

121
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,966
I'm on

122
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,670
33, so I've listened through lecture 33,

123
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,872
so I'm almost caught up to

124
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:34,841
the current.

125
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,075
I look forward to having Daniel

126
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,611
in my channel Friday 4 p.m.

127
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,014
Eastern time.

128
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,915
And there's so much to active inference

129
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:43,583
because it's

130
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:47,120
a useful framework for countless

131
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,187
different fields.

132
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:49,656
And specifically related to this,

133
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,391
I had your definitely thoughts.

134
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,493
And then how do we look at the

135
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,762
mechanics of the equation

136
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,464
versus, you know,

137
00:04:58,531 --> 00:04:59,766
we call folk psychology,

138
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,001
but I would put that generally into a

139
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,870
what I would call introspection.

140
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,872
I have a background in theology

141
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:09,175
and I find a lot about introspection

142
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,244
and trying to match

143
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,513
what we see through various methods of

144
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,282
introspection and

145
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,685
maybe where the science and

146
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,420
mathematics is leading us.

147
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,354
And also,

148
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,489
I guess, the field of psychometrics

149
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,925
that isn't necessarily introspection,

150
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,194
but it may or may not

151
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,263
match the equations.

152
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,731
And then how do we describe

153
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,333
the phenomenon?

154
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,367
You understand them,

155
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,835
or maybe they're not descriptive

156
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,136
those that we describe them

157
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:38,971
with the mathematical equations,

158
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,740
and there's not really any good way

159
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,476
to translate that into words.

160
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,777
That would be

161
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:47,680
you'll understand, able to use folk

162
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:53,252
and people in that way.

163
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,421
Awesome. Ali

164
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,157
Hi, I'm Ali.

165
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,693
I'm an independent researcher from Iran.

166
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,597
I'm very glad to be here and I'm

167
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,632
looking forward to learn more about

168
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,203
this fascinating paper,

169
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,739
especially interested in exploring

170
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:16,809
phenomenological aspects of body,

171
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,545
I believe, desire and intention,

172
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,648
and also to explore

173
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:27,253
somewhat more deeply the philosophical

174
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:31,224
underpinnings of representation versus

175
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:35,661
simulation aspect of modeling.

176
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,897
VDI in active inference.

177
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:40,733
And

178
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,202
that's it for me.

179
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,438
Great.

180
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,205
Let's

181
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:49,442
begin with this more taxonomic question

182
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,345
about the types of active inference

183
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,781
so we can think about

184
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:55,448
the different types

185
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,616
that we've heard about

186
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,619
in this paper and elsewhere, and then

187
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:01,320
whether or not

188
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,789
we have something to contribute

189
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:03,723
about adding

190
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,591
a specific type to this list

191
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,693
that will continue to grow,

192
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,430
what does it mean or entail

193
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,866
that we do have these different types?

194
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:18,704
So just to review in this paper 46,

195
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,240
they make a very clear

196
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,742
upfront distinction

197
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,744
between what they characterize

198
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:25,344
as motor

199
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:28,514
active and I and decision active.

200
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,717
And there's a few differences

201
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,354
between motor and decision

202
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,223
who can list one category

203
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:42,094
of difference?

204
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:43,863
Well, the motor active inference

205
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,799
doesn't typically require

206
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,401
that you have to make a decision.

207
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,404
It's more reaction or reflective

208
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:53,673
form

209
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,375
as compared to the

210
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,677
decision active inference,

211
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:01,214
which does as the papers say,

212
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,416
likely map over to the desire.

213
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,686
QUESTION Yes.

214
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,988
So the motor

215
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,391
I was connected to like motor reflex

216
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,895
are their decision making reflex.

217
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,699
Does even if that's not

218
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,133
a classical usage

219
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,201
like in the reflex

220
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,270
arc of the spine or something,

221
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,973
moving the hand away from a hot surface

222
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,843
are their cognitive reflexes

223
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,285
not really sharp.

224
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,321
I just basically was asking that

225
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,757
in the context of people

226
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,826
who are writing these papers now,

227
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,562
who are bringing the question down

228
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:50,029
to it,

229
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,532
a motor operational behavior standpoint,

230
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:56,469
how breaking active inference up

231
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,505
into different classifications

232
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:03,376
is that in response to a bigger problem,

233
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,510
which is

234
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,914
the behavior doesn't necessarily

235
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,250
even or doesn't necessarily

236
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,051
isn't something

237
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,019
that's necessarily

238
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,155
we able to conveniently dissolve

239
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,124
down to or concentrate on

240
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,592
into motor operations

241
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,062
or extensions

242
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:23,829
or any of those

243
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:24,931
other different things

244
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:25,831
that that

245
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:26,933
that the writers tend

246
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,868
to want to focus on now

247
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:32,138
as opposed to sort of the complexity

248
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:32,939
and the variety

249
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,441
and the randomness of behavior

250
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:36,042
as a whole.

251
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:40,580
So, yes, great.

252
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:44,116
So this is from page

253
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:44,717
81.

254
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:48,654
Oh, yes, I'll go for it.

255
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,790
Well, I think the distinction between

256
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,326
may I and I

257
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,195
is not

258
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,831
globally accepted among,

259
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,667
well, various researchers.

260
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,469
For instance,

261
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,938
if we look at the work of Alan

262
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,407
Bartels, the French

263
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,444
neuroscientist, especially his book,

264
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,813
I think it was called

265
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,649
The Brain's Sense of Movement.

266
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,118
In that book, he actually

267
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,755
has a famous quote,

268
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:26,993
namely, perception is simulated action.

269
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,661
And by this

270
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:29,662
he means that

271
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:30,162
he implies

272
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,030
that perception

273
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:35,001
and motion and motion and perception

274
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,103
or thinking for that matter,

275
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,672
are irreducibly interconnected.

276
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:40,706
And so

277
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:42,642
the former

278
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,645
the former defines the latter

279
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:50,583
because of the intrinsic monstrosity

280
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:52,885
of the creatures

281
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,921
endowed with nervous systems.

282
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,290
So I'm not sure if we can

283
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,694
distinguish between May I and I

284
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:05,731
in such a clear cut manner,

285
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:09,335
because as we know that most motor

286
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,604
and most

287
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,940
mattress, city and motor

288
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,144
or actions are also

289
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,448
pretty predefined in that perception

290
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:27,353
and or many other thought processes.

291
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,020
Thanks.

292
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,957
Do it.

293
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,860
Yes. So I didn't know enough about

294
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,830
the BDA model or the

295
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:38,164
you know,

296
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,665
I'm still new to the language,

297
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,134
especially of the authors of this paper,

298
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,937
to the general philosophy

299
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,273
I was talking a lot about last week,

300
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,174
about the unified

301
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:51,210
I and higher order rules.

302
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,179
So if you want to look like decision

303
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,781
as higher order rules

304
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,284
and they would have some sort of

305
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,185
power like usually

306
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,453
when we think of consciousness

307
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,422
in a unified way that makes decisions

308
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,158
and I think

309
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,027
we talked about a limited wisdom

310
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,830
and the implications of the equations

311
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,199
are the element of a stick or not and

312
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,234
yours is there.

313
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:15,501
What,

314
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,502
what direction does

315
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,337
the evidence take us?

316
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,473
And so in terms of motor control,

317
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,041
like I mentioned, photos, a

318
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,878
modular mind that it could be that,

319
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:26,979
you know, it's

320
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:27,780
a threshold, it's

321
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,216
a free energy principle

322
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,451
and it could just be actually

323
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,054
action, reaction, sense perception.

324
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,958
And then a module of our mind sends you

325
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,659
some perception of what, however,

326
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,661
we understand consciousness

327
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:43,863
that makes it appear to us

328
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,365
like we made a decision.

329
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,834
Pardon me, but that may not be accurate

330
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:49,602
that the,

331
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:49,802
you know,

332
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,537
the equations might hint

333
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:52,505
that that's not actually

334
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:53,572
what's going on.

335
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,841
It's simply free energy threshold

336
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:56,876
being reached.

337
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,211
The threshold could conceivably

338
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,981
have nothing or very little to do

339
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,617
with the decision making process,

340
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,319
and it could be post facto like that.

341
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,921
The experiments

342
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,256
that the perception

343
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,924
might be made a decision

344
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,759
actually comes post facto

345
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,929
from the threshold.

346
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:19,532
Cool.

347
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,433
Thank you. Also, I think

348
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:26,105
Adam Safran, who had discussed those lab

349
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,907
experiments, does

350
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,109
find a space for agency,

351
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,811
if that's not too,

352
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,312
of course, of a simplification.

353
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:37,049
But there is some

354
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,651
interesting ways to think about what

355
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,520
that experiment does or doesn't show.

356
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,222
We can return to that

357
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:43,923
when we kind of

358
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,592
have some figures and details in.

359
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,895
Yeah, I didn't know what you guys

360
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:50,896
were talking about with this.

361
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:51,697
A limited Ms.

362
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,799
thing till I went back to the paper

363
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,434
and then I found this

364
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:56,569
and I'll just quote it

365
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,370
We all this is from the paper.

366
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,706
We also motivated squarely non a

367
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,074
to best position

368
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,343
with respect to such constructs

369
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:04,977
and suggests

370
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,745
that the set of theoretical primitives,

371
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:07,346
out of which

372
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,315
the active inference models are built,

373
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,082
is sufficient

374
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,251
not only to recover the categories

375
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,752
of folk psychology,

376
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:14,787
but also to potentially

377
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:15,554
nuance them

378
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,657
with more fine grained distinctions.

379
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:22,494
So I don't I'm not sure exactly what how

380
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,697
what you've been saying

381
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,399
either corresponds with that or not.

382
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,970
But I'm kind of curious.

383
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:31,704
Yeah, go for it.

384
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:33,639
Yeah.

385
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,442
I mean, to me, it's a fallacy that

386
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:36,876
you're like a

387
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,078
best of both worlds fallacy that

388
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,413
a material is like research

389
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,215
into consciousness make.

390
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,251
Is that in reality,

391
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,785
my understanding of the

392
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,821
the conclusions of what they're saying

393
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,689
is that it is a limit of best

394
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:51,957
and they'll put a little statement

395
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:54,026
in like it's not a limited list,

396
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,495
but what is the evidence of their models

397
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:59,498
actually say and can they actually

398
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,302
program like a unified a

399
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,838
and you to put that

400
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,206
did they eliminate the unified

401
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,909
I and it's just a bunch of perceptions

402
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:11,777
and various factors

403
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,345
that reach a threshold

404
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:16,115
and what does it mean to

405
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:19,184
make a decision so

406
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,252
and that's why I said do

407
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,987
we just throw away

408
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,990
thousands of years of dualistic theology

409
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,059
and

410
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,763
how people your whole lexicon of

411
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,933
consciousness psychology

412
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,302
comes from a dualistic tradition.

413
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:36,936
So, you know,

414
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,070
if they're trying to grandfather

415
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:38,404
in these

416
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,973
dualistic concepts,

417
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,341
but even the evidence

418
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,642
of what they're saying

419
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,945
doesn't necessarily seem to warrant it.

420
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:46,812
And then, you know,

421
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,448
do they have the courage to be like, no,

422
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,883
unfortunately, the evidence points

423
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,453
to a limited wisdom and go with that.

424
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,188
So, I mean, in my impression

425
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,890
they can just throw in the statement,

426
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,592
but it's unclear how they're,

427
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:00,826
you know,

428
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,194
how they're doing it because, you know,

429
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:02,795
I guess,

430
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,229
you know, it's going to be unpopular

431
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,331
to be an element of us.

432
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:05,931
It's kind of like

433
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,800
the free will question that.

434
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:07,967
I mean,

435
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,600
the element of wisdom

436
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,170
also relates to free will.

437
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,272
But to stand up and be like,

438
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,507
no, I'm sorry, free will doesn't exist.

439
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,810
That's where the evidence is pointed,

440
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,644
sort of put in there.

441
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,746
That they're not trying to say that.

442
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,182
But you're my impression.

443
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,483
I think they actually are trying

444
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,919
to say that in looking

445
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:27,886
for that's

446
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,722
where the evidence of their conclusions

447
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:30,289
are saying.

448
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,324
And they just have a human weakness

449
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,126
that doesn't want to go so far

450
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,195
as to follow the evidence of,

451
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:40,065
you know, their research.

452
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:40,766
Interesting.

453
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,102
So just to continue on this motor

454
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,136
and decision.

455
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,772
So page five, may

456
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,741
I just not make decisions

457
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:49,641
once a decision has

458
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:50,743
been made about what to do?

459
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:52,644
And may I use this

460
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,079
proprioceptive prediction

461
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,247
signals to move the body

462
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,549
to carry out the decided action sequence

463
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:58,417
and elsewhere.

464
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,985
We've talked about that sort of

465
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,353
set point

466
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:01,920
and then a

467
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,089
transient suppression of precision

468
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,591
which allows the body

469
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,893
to reach this new spatial position.

470
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,130
And also these models

471
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,631
have tended to be formulated

472
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,433
in continuous time,

473
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,368
whereas decisioning eye

474
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,937
plugs in very nicely to the motor eye

475
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,207
because it is explicitly considering

476
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:23,375
decision

477
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,544
making in these higher order rules

478
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,714
that have to do with either.

479
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,650
If you take a more realist perspective

480
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,851
what organisms

481
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,920
or cognitive systems are doing,

482
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,289
or the more instrumental perspective,

483
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:38,290
which is just

484
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,625
this is how the

485
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,794
the process of decision

486
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,196
making can be modeled.

487
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,532
And it's about which decisions are made

488
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:46,865
about what

489
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:47,866
to do in order

490
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,501
to generate some observations

491
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,537
and not others. And it's that

492
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,039
focus on the

493
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,607
observations that are generated

494
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,342
under different courses of action

495
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:58,610
and their evaluation

496
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,813
in terms of expected free energy.

497
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:01,747
That also ties

498
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,314
it closely

499
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:05,551
to like perceptual control theory.

500
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,153
So that's the distinction they bring up.

501
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:11,156
And again, whether in the real world

502
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,292
this carves cognitive systems

503
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,160
at that point is one question

504
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,962
in the world of the theories

505
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,330
as constructed,

506
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,066
this is a clean separation,

507
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,102
although as Ali brought up, that doesn't

508
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,138
mean that it's some widely accepted

509
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,840
or even if everybody heard about it,

510
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,273
that they would

511
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,743
necessarily agree with it.

512
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:32,878
And there may be phenomena

513
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,413
that are mixtures,

514
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,181
and that's also why they talk

515
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:38,050
about the hybrid models,

516
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,251
where it's like decision

517
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,053
making at a higher level

518
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,055
and then motor at a lower level.

519
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,756
So that could allow decisions

520
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:45,390
about what

521
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,592
section of a face

522
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:47,426
to look at

523
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,995
or what section of the page to read,

524
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,363
and then that decision

525
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:52,698
becomes implemented

526
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,933
in a continuous motor

527
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,368
active inference context

528
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,937
through ocular motor action. Then

529
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:03,375
yeah, I'm not I don't think I'm,

530
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:04,443
I don't think

531
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,545
I'm leading with this question about

532
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,248
are we moving to a place that says that

533
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:10,983
active inference

534
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,985
will have different types

535
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:13,519
because they think

536
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,820
that there's different

537
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,154
there's a

538
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:15,754
there's math

539
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,723
that's used in financial situations.

540
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,224
Those operations,

541
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:19,691
there's math

542
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:21,860
that's used in mechanical situations,

543
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,628
those operations.

544
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:23,862
So I think it's

545
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,431
it's a natural byproduct of so

546
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,734
how do you make the math work

547
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,036
given the circumstance?

548
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:31,603
I don't think that

549
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,839
there's anything about this that's

550
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,441
saying active inference doesn't work

551
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,809
just because you want to make sure

552
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,412
that you're applying the proper formula

553
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:40,979
to the thing

554
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,714
that you're trying to describe.

555
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,750
But I do think it's interesting that

556
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,584
in order to be able

557
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:46,185
to describe it

558
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,419
more precisely,

559
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:50,055
you just can't say active inference.

560
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,423
You have to kind of figure out

561
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,192
what the math is

562
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,593
for the specific condition

563
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:55,827
that we're trying to analyze.

564
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,598
Yeah, definitely makes sense.

565
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:00,265
Let's now

566
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,334
move to this lower part of the page

567
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,570
on the different adjectives

568
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,971
that we've seen

569
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,506
so people can probably add

570
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,474
or think of more or even imagine

571
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:10,842
there's so many adjectives

572
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:11,743
in the

573
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:14,479
in the textbook called the dictionary.

574
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,848
We've talked about extended

575
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,217
active inference,

576
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,751
which was addressing extended

577
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,987
cognitive features and phenomena

578
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,589
where there could be

579
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,724
sort of a offloading,

580
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,626
which was when the adaptive

581
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:28,894
active entity

582
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,395
is going to utilize

583
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,966
something that is more like a notepad,

584
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,000
like it's

585
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,903
offloading memory onto the notepad,

586
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,338
and then the entity is

587
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,672
holding on to information

588
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:43,375
about how to seek that information

589
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,944
or on both sides of the interface,

590
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,813
there could be adaptive, active.

591
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:48,714
And so that was like

592
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,449
the sort of true

593
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,185
emergence, extended cognitive processes,

594
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,588
deep active inference and

595
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,522
citations could be

596
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:58,357
could be at it

597
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,525
didn't get them for all deep

598
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,263
was utilized to describe temporal depth

599
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,964
in terms of longer

600
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:06,932
and longer time

601
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,967
horizons of considerations.

602
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,303
This was really an important development

603
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,871
because it moved

604
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,940
beyond the sort of one shot

605
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,576
next step model of active

606
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,311
and help manage

607
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:19,945
this tradeoff

608
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,980
between considering time horizons

609
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,384
as well as taking action in the time

610
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:28,620
step that the entity is actually in

611
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,789
sophisticated active inference

612
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,859
and various other

613
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,460
cousins of it

614
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,863
utilized, hierarchical modeling

615
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,732
which could have temporal depth

616
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,267
at one or multiple levels

617
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:43,535
but doesn't need to.

618
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,937
It does and it could.

619
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:47,372
But this is referring to

620
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,540
like the thickness

621
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,876
or the hierarchical modeling component,

622
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,279
affective active inference,

623
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,315
which was used by a hospital

624
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,650
to refer to uncertainty parameters

625
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,252
and some of the cognitive

626
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,520
interpretations

627
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,255
of uncertainty parameters

628
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,223
as being related to surveillance.

629
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:07,492
And then there's others

630
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:12,864
like branching time, active infants.

631
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,766
It comes to what Dean said,

632
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:17,703
which is just saying, like we use

633
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,705
active inference

634
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,207
may not reduce uncertainty enough

635
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:24,876
anymore.

636
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:27,813
Then we used a linear model,

637
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,314
whether just talking about it

638
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,682
casually or

639
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,050
writing the paper,

640
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,353
more information has to be provided.

641
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,088
And so this is sort of

642
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:36,655
this is starting

643
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,691
to starting to build the taxonomy

644
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,159
and the classifications

645
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,494
and the ways of communicating,

646
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:43,562
reducing uncertainty.

647
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,664
Okay. You went to that hemisphere.

648
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,266
Was it this continent or that continent?

649
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,202
Was it this coast or was it

650
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,704
that like zooming in,

651
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,972
ultimately resulting

652
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:54,873
in just describing

653
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,074
the particulars of the model

654
00:22:56,074 --> 00:23:01,346
that was constructed early?

655
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:02,581
Well, adding to what

656
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,716
Dean has just said, well,

657
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,550
I don't think

658
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,486
that these different flavors

659
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,488
and versions of active inference

660
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,256
that have recently been

661
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:13,291
recently in branch of

662
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,828
the they don't necessarily

663
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:17,896
concern themselves

664
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,264
with different situations

665
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:21,199
or different niches.

666
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,301
For example, that last one branching

667
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,537
time, active inference.

668
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:29,641
Well, that was a very recent version

669
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:33,912
of active inference, which was, yes,

670
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,248
this is the paper, uh,

671
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,649
they introduced that

672
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:40,852
and it's basically a more efficient

673
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,155
computational approach

674
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,890
to active inference

675
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:45,924
and it's just

676
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,559
the traditional active inference,

677
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,928
but in a more efficient,

678
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:51,596
with a more efficient

679
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,832
algorithm to compute

680
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:57,636
the, all the parameters needed.

681
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:58,136
Yes.

682
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:59,404
Sometimes

683
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:02,140
it's these adjectives are describing

684
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,776
heuristics or implementations

685
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,144
or algorithms.

686
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,878
Other times

687
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,714
they're describing the model structure,

688
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,416
other times

689
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,151
they're referring to the context

690
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,253
that the model's being applied to,

691
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:18,123
like an extended cognitive system.

692
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,090
Yeah, that's.

693
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,392
That's what I was going to

694
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:21,426
ask Ali about.

695
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:22,561
So if I'm saying

696
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:23,562
something more efficient,

697
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:24,329
what am I saying?

698
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,932
It's more efficient relative to

699
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,371
well, relative to

700
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,474
the traditional approach

701
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,175
to active inference

702
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:39,077
that has been proposed

703
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,680
for the past decade or two.

704
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:46,485
And also relative to the other

705
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:49,521
and the other approaches

706
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,756
that are similar to active inference

707
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:52,891
as approach with not

708
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,993
if not exactly equivalent to it

709
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,163
instance reinforcement and reinforcement

710
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:01,166
learning approaches and so on.

711
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,702
And one other

712
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,170
kind of analogy or mapping

713
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,038
there would be like

714
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:09,608
when a new variant of a neural network

715
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,043
architecture is introduced,

716
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,246
there's a pomp and circumstance

717
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,648
to announce the novelty

718
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:17,883
and the relevance of this

719
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:20,151
for somebody who's in that field.

720
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:22,521
Similarly, when there's a new variants

721
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,590
or a new focus, whether model structure,

722
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:26,591
model target

723
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:27,325
or something else

724
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,628
related to evolutionary biology,

725
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:33,031
sometimes a new word will come in,

726
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:34,566
but then

727
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:38,970
that new

728
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,072
target or model structure,

729
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,075
if it becomes used

730
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,343
and it's sufficiently closed

731
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,012
that it's not rejected

732
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,047
from the rest of the body of theory

733
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:49,681
give, it's

734
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,783
an incoherent usage of the adjective.

735
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:52,717
Someone says,

736
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:53,518
Well, I made, you know,

737
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,086
simple active inference,

738
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,721
and it has this totally

739
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,323
different structure

740
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,759
that might not become incorporated

741
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:01,626
into the

742
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:04,129
the network of active inference models,

743
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:08,733
whereas if it does become incorporated

744
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,102
through its theoretical compatibility

745
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:14,639
or utility in modeling that phenomena

746
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,543
or it's presented in terms of a model

747
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,645
architecture that does apply elsewhere,

748
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,149
the adjective kind of gets dropped

749
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:25,116
and then it just goes back

750
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:26,451
to being neural networks, back

751
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:27,619
to being active inference, back

752
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,521
to being evolutionary biology,

753
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,890
and then the field moves on.

754
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:32,691
And so

755
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:33,391
the adjectives

756
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:34,092
are just kind of like

757
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,428
another brick in the wall.

758
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:41,032
Do it.

759
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:42,267
You also mentioned last week,

760
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,902
I'm not sure if it would go here in

761
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:47,539
this section is the purpose driven.

762
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:48,573
The

763
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,076
purpose driven behavior

764
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:52,777
action or event

765
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,714
perception related to a unified AI?

766
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:57,148
And

767
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:58,883
even if it's on the pure

768
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,652
level of sense perception,

769
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,287
is it just that we have,

770
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,122
you know, these procedures

771
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,290
and they perceive

772
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,560
and then how are the signals read and

773
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:10,462
I mean, it's easier

774
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,262
to describe this

775
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:12,564
in a element of a static way,

776
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,033
whether we're limited of it or not.

777
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,034
In the per,

778
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:18,169
the predictive mind is the main

779
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,172
struggle, so to say, between short

780
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:24,342
term goals and long term goals.

781
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:25,644
And then you have to put in

782
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,545
what axioms are we making?

783
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,481
Is there some sort of

784
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,882
for the higher order rules

785
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:32,684
if we assume that there's

786
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,953
some sort of rule that like an organism

787
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,088
acts in its own self-interest

788
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,958
and its own a sort of, say, desire

789
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,961
to survive or to replicate.

790
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:44,396
And then you

791
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,665
the only struggle would be between short

792
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,399
term and long term

793
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,099
actions, like,

794
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:48,299
you know,

795
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:48,900
God forbid, here

796
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,002
we have a mosquito pandemic

797
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,137
that was gardening

798
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,406
and got eaten up by mosquitoes.

799
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,774
And for just a sense,

800
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,242
you're replying to the environment

801
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,377
like I have an itch, try it.

802
00:27:59,377 --> 00:27:59,878
Should

803
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,513
or should I have some longer term

804
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,014
that will go away quicker

805
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,983
if if I don't, it should.

806
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,317
And is that something

807
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:07,986
that's even in the subconscious?

808
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:08,853
We're just naturally

809
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:09,587
I would have an itch

810
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:10,722
and I would itch it,

811
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:11,356
but then I would

812
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,957
somehow enter

813
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,226
a longer term decision making process

814
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,363
that would tell me to act

815
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,464
in a different way.

816
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:20,231
And even the terms

817
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:22,267
for how I'm going to interact

818
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:24,235
with the environment in the future,

819
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:24,769
let alone

820
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:25,837
something that might have

821
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:29,641
a moral or ethical implication.

822
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:32,277
So if we have a simplified model of just

823
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,915
where do we need purpose

824
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,717
for sense perception to work

825
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,852
and for motor control

826
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,721
to work even in terms of reflexes,

827
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,222
I think you're just

828
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,757
even on the motor control,

829
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:48,359
let alone the decision making.

830
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,762
Where does the decision making go

831
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:53,431
and what's the purpose behind it?

832
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:59,571
And then how is that purpose derived?

833
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,271
Yes.

834
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:06,177
So we can go to targeted non targeted.

835
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:07,412
Another

836
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,681
branch point is

837
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:12,917
I think this important question of

838
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,286
mapping from real world phenomena

839
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:19,124
and even direct felt experiences

840
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,425
like esthetic

841
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,827
or just more generally phenomenological

842
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:26,498
and anything about a formalism.

843
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:28,099
And I'm not sure

844
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,301
if I've quoted too narrowly,

845
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:36,474
but they are writing that intentions.

846
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:39,944
So just to review the

847
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,480
by the beliefs and desires come together

848
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,115
and that is what generates

849
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:44,949
the intention.

850
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,519
There's the desire for the ice cream

851
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,720
and there's the belief

852
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,054
that there's the ice cream truck.

853
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:51,456
And that is what generates

854
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,457
the intentional behavior

855
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,759
of like pursuing the ice cream truck.

856
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:55,593
Intentions map

857
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:56,895
straightforwardly to policies

858
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:57,762
with lowest value

859
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:59,697
for expected free energy,

860
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,132
which is calculated across

861
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:01,933
different policies.

862
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:04,435
Policies are

863
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:06,471
affordances that can be taken

864
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,506
over a given time horizon.

865
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:09,874
So over time

866
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:10,608
horizon of three

867
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:11,409
is the combination

868
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,945
of affordances of length three.

869
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,613
Almost all of the variables

870
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:16,414
in the design

871
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:17,315
model

872
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,049
are candidates

873
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,485
for traditional psychological beliefs.

874
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,753
If being used to model

875
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,354
the right kinds of high level

876
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,390
cognitive processes.

877
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,692
So what are the right kinds?

878
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,794
But then later in footnote five,

879
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:33,898
this is distinguishing in a

880
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,500
what they characterize as a different

881
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,001
reading of desire.

882
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,336
This reading is not the thing

883
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,003
that is desired,

884
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,772
but instead about the transient presence

885
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,040
of the motivational force

886
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,375
to approach the thing we desire.

887
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,444
So it's like, why did you go there?

888
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:48,346
It was my desire to go there.

889
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,114
What moved you to go there?

890
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:51,149
Desire.

891
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,117
So it's almost like desire

892
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:54,452
in the specifics

893
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,987
and then also seeing it

894
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:57,155
as a motivating force.

895
00:30:58,623 --> 00:30:58,890
But then

896
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:59,824
they note

897
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:00,391
that have

898
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,627
it might not have a direction to fit

899
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:03,494
and it illustrates

900
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:04,729
another reason consistent

901
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:05,797
with our broader argument

902
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:09,067
concerning desires not to assume

903
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,568
that probability distributions

904
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,270
in the formalism must be mapped

905
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,139
onto beliefs. The psychological level.

906
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,642
So they're candidates.

907
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:21,045
If we do it right.

908
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,448
But it isn't an assumption

909
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:28,987
that they must be mapped on to beliefs.

910
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:33,791
Ali, I well,

911
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:37,762
I wanted to mention the

912
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:39,497
broader sense

913
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,799
of the term intentionality,

914
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,902
which I think here is referred to,

915
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,870
because you see,

916
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,439
for all the entities defined by

917
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,143
market blankets and defined by

918
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:53,544
the existence

919
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:54,245
of their market

920
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,282
blankets and their ergodic behavior,

921
00:31:57,282 --> 00:32:01,352
well, we need an entity who can treat

922
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,289
an effect as being about its cost.

923
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:05,523
You see

924
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,393
an entity who can follow the direction

925
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,561
from effect to cause.

926
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:13,398
And and we also need an entity

927
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,834
who can treat an ice morphic map

928
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:20,939
as being about what it maps

929
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,776
or, let's say, is oriented toward

930
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,677
what it maps.

931
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,845
Well, in both of these cases,

932
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,915
the directionality or orientation

933
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:35,453
can be referred to as intentionality.

934
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:39,123
And it's brought sense.

935
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,458
So just to clarify,

936
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,492
there's the second piece

937
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:42,827
you mentioned was

938
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:45,430
the entity needs to be able

939
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,198
to treat some sort of ice and morphic

940
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:49,267
or structure preserving, mapping

941
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:52,303
as having an about ness of the target

942
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,872
like the map of the city,

943
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,341
translating that into

944
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,608
the physical movement.

945
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:58,643
And then

946
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,145
there is a causal inference question

947
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,815
entity can trace causes

948
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,249
such that they understand

949
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:05,917
such that they're doing

950
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,052
some kind of causal mapping

951
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,722
where agency is the belief

952
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:12,890
that one can be the cause

953
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,660
of future aspects.

954
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,428
So is this agency

955
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,031
or is this causal modeling

956
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:21,232
that could happen

957
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:25,937
in the absence of entity level agency?

958
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:28,673
I think it's more it's broader than

959
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,175
necessarily

960
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,611
that being a cognitive agent,

961
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,215
you see it's any abstract entity

962
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,784
that can

963
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:43,888
that can sketch out

964
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:46,224
these kind of causal relationships

965
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:47,692
between

966
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,697
between the signs and they're either

967
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:56,567
icons or they're indices.

968
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,036
So

969
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,905
it's much broader and more abstract

970
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:04,242
than necessarily cognitive agents.

971
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,211
What kind of entity use

972
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,780
are you thinking of?

973
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,681
And isn't manipulation

974
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:12,750
and and not kind of logical

975
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,553
juxtaposition?

976
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,654
No, no.

977
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,289
The one

978
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:19,290
obvious example

979
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,659
would be neural networks.

980
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,027
In neural nets.

981
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:26,097
We don't necessarily bestow

982
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:30,201
upon neural networks a cognitive agency.

983
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:30,535
Right.

984
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:34,238
But they can well match the

985
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,076
at least their input patterns

986
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:41,679
onto their outputs,

987
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:52,223
like output indices.

988
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:53,524
And it's

989
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:56,894
these continuum

990
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:58,563
of agency, continuum

991
00:34:58,563 --> 00:34:59,497
of cognitive systems.

992
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,265
It's like easy to forget.

993
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:01,766
We're, we're

994
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,567
talking about

995
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:05,570
a cognitive modeling framework,

996
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:09,273
albeit one that has a motor cousin MRI

997
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:11,943
and motor

998
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,345
motor modeling history.

999
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:17,682
Because the MRI distinction is

1000
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,651
also historical, like in terms of what

1001
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,121
which models were developed when

1002
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:26,724
and

1003
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:30,027
is this pattern cognitive ism?

1004
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:33,231
Are we modeling everything as if it is

1005
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:33,998
on the continuum

1006
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:36,767
of cognitive entities like

1007
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,570
I don't know if it's as controversial

1008
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:39,804
as say,

1009
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,605
that a neural network

1010
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:43,141
is a cognitive artifact.

1011
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,109
It might not be self-perpetuating

1012
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:46,410
or embodied

1013
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,146
or have open ended agency

1014
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,347
or all these other features

1015
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,882
that some cognitive systems have.

1016
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:51,449
But

1017
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,252
what makes it not cognitive.

1018
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:58,289
If you meant that.

1019
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,025
Well, probably the cognitive here

1020
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:04,629
was not a proper, proper adjective.

1021
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,466
Perhaps what I meant was to be,

1022
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,700
I don't know,

1023
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,537
a kind of conscious agent or

1024
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,707
but again, on the the subject of

1025
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,710
using the adjective cognitive

1026
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,679
or neural networks,

1027
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,848
well, there are quite a few.

1028
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:27,151
Well, opponents

1029
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:27,752
to this

1030
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,687
characterization from neural networks

1031
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,522
because they believe

1032
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:35,593
that neural networks as agents

1033
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:39,764
don't necessarily

1034
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:43,100
decide and their cognitive

1035
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:47,171
a decide on their cognitive basis how to

1036
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:50,708
map out how to

1037
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,042
you see

1038
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,244
map between the inputs and outputs,

1039
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:55,213
because that's the difference

1040
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,414
between representation

1041
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:59,083
and simulation if we well

1042
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,152
can differentiate

1043
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,354
between between those two.

1044
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,456
So probably

1045
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,458
the more suitable adjective here

1046
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:10,761
should be a conscious agent

1047
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:14,732
as opposed to cognitive agents.

1048
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,101
Does that not take us extremely

1049
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,671
far afield out of where we

1050
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,542
lose touch with empirical measurements?

1051
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:27,812
For example, and enter into important

1052
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,615
philosophical questions,

1053
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:34,051
but ones that take us like

1054
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,721
away from our cognitive leg

1055
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:38,322
and psychology,

1056
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:38,889
perhaps even

1057
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:39,624
especially folk

1058
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:40,791
psychology, is sitting

1059
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:41,525
at the intersection

1060
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:42,927
of cognitive systems,

1061
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,896
philosophical self-reflexive systems.

1062
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:47,565
So it's almost like a question of

1063
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:52,770
this teetering stack of folk psychology.

1064
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,040
Which way will it end up falling?

1065
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,641
A limited

1066
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,509
ism perhaps is saying

1067
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,144
we'll be able to dispense

1068
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:03,414
with classical philosophical debates

1069
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:05,549
or some aspects of them

1070
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:08,953
by just moving everything that was folk

1071
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,023
psychological into a mathematical

1072
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:15,860
cognitive framework.

1073
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,596
What I mean here is that, well,

1074
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:23,034
the term intentionality here

1075
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,537
can also be used in

1076
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,640
in abstract models

1077
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,777
of active inference and not necessarily

1078
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:36,847
well in the cases where we

1079
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:40,251
unambiguously deal with

1080
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:41,852
conscious entities.

1081
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:45,189
That's what I mean.

1082
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:48,526
I think one of the takeaways

1083
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:49,560
of this paper

1084
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,063
or one of the implications of this paper

1085
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:55,499
would be that if intentions

1086
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:57,768
in folk psychology

1087
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:00,304
are beliefs plus desires,

1088
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:05,376
hashtag PDA, model, and beliefs

1089
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:06,377
and desires

1090
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,713
are identifiable quantities

1091
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,581
in the active formalism.

1092
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:12,216
Then by

1093
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:13,951
constructing entities consistent

1094
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:16,053
with the act in formalism,

1095
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:17,355
it can be said

1096
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,256
that they have intentionality

1097
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:20,324
because it could be said

1098
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,426
that they have beliefs and desires.

1099
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,395
And so then it would only make sense

1100
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:25,463
to call the behaviors

1101
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:28,265
arising from beliefs and desires

1102
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,968
to be intentional.

1103
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,270
So doesn't this conceptualization

1104
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:36,073
of intentionality also subsume

1105
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,977
the a more strict

1106
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:41,979
or narrow sense of that term?

1107
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,751
Because, well, if we

1108
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:50,388
in this sense, if we infer in the

1109
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:53,491
from the use of intentionality here

1110
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,662
as referring to only conscious agency.

1111
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,332
Well in that case the

1112
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,336
the whole purpose of simulating

1113
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,672
active inference agents

1114
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:10,541
could potentially

1115
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,777
well raise some questions.

1116
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,512
That's. Well,

1117
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,047
I'm not sure if I could

1118
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:18,516
express myself

1119
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,718
clearly on this matter or not, but.

1120
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,120
Oh, no, very interesting of Dean.

1121
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,856
And then do it.

1122
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,793
So maybe among the three of you,

1123
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:29,693
you can help me with this,

1124
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:30,795
because I don't really keep up

1125
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:33,364
with the latest news on neural nets. But

1126
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:35,566
if I

1127
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,768
if I were to look at a neural net,

1128
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,437
I would assume that

1129
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,972
most of those nets are given

1130
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,642
some kind of a target,

1131
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,477
even if they go out and forage for it.

1132
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:47,645
There is something about that.

1133
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,180
But what I've

1134
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,514
always been curious about is,

1135
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,950
especially in the context of this paper,

1136
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:54,885
is that

1137
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,822
if there is a target that's been

1138
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:01,292
sort of linked to desire in this paper,

1139
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,560
and if there's

1140
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,162
a curiosity aspect to the agent

1141
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:05,996
or the net

1142
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:06,831
that's been

1143
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,899
sort of linked to non targeting.

1144
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,169
So if that's it, that's one continuum.

1145
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,305
The orthogonal aspect of that

1146
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,306
also in the paper

1147
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,341
is that there's a reward

1148
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:21,912
component, say on the left of that

1149
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,113
there is an information

1150
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:24,782
seeking or an information

1151
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:26,684
and ambiguity component

1152
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:28,219
to the right of that.

1153
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,054
So here's my question.

1154
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,656
If unless we say that

1155
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:36,060
curiosity actually is a target,

1156
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,828
which this paper says

1157
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:38,696
is it's actually

1158
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:40,698
a non target in the operation

1159
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:41,899
and the formalism

1160
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,968
actually points that out.

1161
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:46,537
Then how do you set something up

1162
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:47,872
like a neural net

1163
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:50,040
to actually be curious?

1164
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,608
Because we

1165
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:51,609
we can be curious,

1166
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,477
we can be non targeting

1167
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:56,947
and find reward in that if we go

1168
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,482
one direction

1169
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,951
and find information gained in that

1170
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,153
in another direction and they are,

1171
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:04,922
they are completely different things.

1172
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:05,890
They're not

1173
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,024
seen in the

1174
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,759
in the formalism as the same thing.

1175
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:11,061
So I'm just curious whether

1176
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,597
we're right because

1177
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:14,031
as I said,

1178
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,533
I don't know enough about neural nets

1179
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,834
to know, but

1180
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:17,968
aren't neural nets

1181
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:19,236
constantly constrained

1182
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:25,643
by having a target?

1183
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:27,711
I think there's many ways to

1184
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:31,282
answer that.

1185
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:33,384
I am not sure if it would totally map

1186
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,552
onto the difference

1187
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,987
of supervised and unsupervised learning,

1188
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:40,124
like supervised learning being

1189
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:42,359
where labels are provided.

1190
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:45,396
These x rays belong to this patient

1191
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,530
category, these ones

1192
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,566
belong to the alternate category.

1193
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,967
I want you to get good,

1194
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:52,202
but you know, don't over specify

1195
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:54,538
don't over fit that distinction.

1196
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:56,674
Supervised learning

1197
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:58,342
unsupervised learning

1198
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:01,278
is more along the lines of like

1199
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:02,780
here's input

1200
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,817
according to how your set up

1201
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:09,853
embody the statistical regularities

1202
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:11,322
in the structure

1203
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:15,392
of the information that has been input.

1204
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:17,695
And then that representation

1205
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,263
allows like clustering

1206
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,332
and subsequent analyzes

1207
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:24,301
or the addition of labels later.

1208
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:26,503
But it is predicated

1209
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:28,539
in the training phase

1210
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:32,009
upon the data or the cases being labels

1211
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:35,079
does that.

1212
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,447
Yeah, but the predication is not

1213
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,148
curiosity is it.

1214
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:39,350
That's my point is

1215
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,452
that there is no curiosity

1216
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:45,322
in what you just described.

1217
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:45,756
Right.

1218
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:47,891
It's like a pipeline

1219
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:49,293
that is receiving

1220
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,662
whatever information is being provided

1221
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:53,197
and Cheerios really seems

1222
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:55,199
to kind of break out of that.

1223
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,035
And it's like, give me more examples.

1224
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:58,936
And then the directed

1225
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:00,170
curiosity would be like, I'm

1226
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,673
looking for more examples of the label.

1227
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:03,440
A

1228
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:05,142
The undirected curiosity

1229
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,810
would be more like

1230
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,513
I just would like more examples.

1231
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:13,350
So to, to ask, are we maybe Ali,

1232
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,418
is it consciousness

1233
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:18,722
if it doesn't have curiosity?

1234
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:22,292
Well, I don't think so, because you see,

1235
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,695
even in

1236
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:28,198
unsupervised learning,

1237
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:30,501
we don't necessarily

1238
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,236
well, the neural networks

1239
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:35,039
don't necessarily extract the

1240
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,976
the the essence

1241
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:40,911
of their training examples.

1242
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:42,980
What they do is all

1243
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:46,250
is to extract a

1244
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,886
statistic prototype of their tokens,

1245
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:50,421
the statistical prototype

1246
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:52,923
of their training examples.

1247
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:55,292
So actually

1248
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:58,228
they can't recognize

1249
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,397
a dog as a dog.

1250
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:01,732
They just see patterns.

1251
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:03,600
They just see statistical patterns

1252
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,135
which they have learned

1253
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:07,371
through their training process.

1254
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:10,708
So they're not

1255
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:12,843
they're not necessarily conscious

1256
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:16,980
of the object of dog or cat or whatever.

1257
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,818
What, what are what they try to do is

1258
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:23,220
and in fact, in some cases,

1259
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:26,523
well, sometimes we see that

1260
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,526
they have in fact inferred

1261
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:31,862
wrong the statistical prototypes

1262
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:35,632
because of, well, insufficient

1263
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:39,002
training examples or

1264
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:40,771
well,

1265
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:43,273
not appropriate training examples

1266
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:44,241
or so on.

1267
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:46,577
But in any case, what

1268
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:49,580
I don't think we can

1269
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,648
say that.

1270
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:54,585
Well, neural networks because

1271
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:58,555
because of their ability to recognize

1272
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:01,492
these patterns, they necessarily

1273
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:03,393
well,

1274
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:05,696
have consciousness because well,

1275
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:07,731
probably

1276
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:11,101
in order to achieve consciousness, well,

1277
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:14,004
other layers of cognitive

1278
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:17,040
and even perceptual mechanisms

1279
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:19,543
need to be deployed

1280
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:29,153
if it had some other points.

1281
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:31,321
But if you wanted to a

1282
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:34,424
you'll stay on the curiosity topic.

1283
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:35,759
And it was related to

1284
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:36,493
what at the point

1285
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:37,628
I was going to make up about belief

1286
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:38,896
in desire,

1287
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,832
you're clearly defining the words.

1288
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:44,067
So there's specifically a,

1289
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:44,401
you know, we're

1290
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:46,737
going to take the PDI model

1291
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:49,339
and use words like belief and desire to

1292
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:51,875
use some relatively obscure

1293
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:55,412
scientific model versus a, you know,

1294
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:55,846
like a whole

1295
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:58,649
historical review of the etymology.

1296
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:00,117
And,

1297
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,653
you know, how do we

1298
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:06,323
how we defining of beliefs in desire,

1299
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,891
you know, just curiosity,

1300
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:12,296
have a desire to learn something,

1301
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:13,764
your thoughts on purpose

1302
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:17,034
that that means it's not goal driven.

1303
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:18,902
And then how I would understand

1304
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:22,139
belief and desire in terms of you.

1305
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:24,575
So desires are biological urges

1306
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:27,144
like reproduction

1307
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:30,981
or survival in a for the emotions

1308
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:32,816
or maybe all derivative

1309
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:34,384
how you're going to put that out, where

1310
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,320
if you're going to try to source

1311
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,423
all of them from one pure desire

1312
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:40,257
and all the other

1313
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:41,391
desires are derivative,

1314
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:41,792
or if you're going

1315
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:43,961
have multiple desires,

1316
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:45,229
and then you'd have to have some sort

1317
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:47,231
of weighting function

1318
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:47,965
to weight

1319
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:49,333
the different desires,

1320
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,835
and then beliefs are self-made

1321
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:56,206
rules that come from our own cognition.

1322
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,175
And that's where decision making comes

1323
00:47:58,175 --> 00:47:58,742
comes in.

1324
00:47:58,742 --> 00:47:59,910
And even, you know,

1325
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,545
a rabbinic statement

1326
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,679
in terms of free will,

1327
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:04,815
that free will is implying

1328
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:07,117
that you have the choice to make

1329
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,319
the less desirous opinion,

1330
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:11,521
that the less desires choice.

1331
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:12,422
Like as a chess player,

1332
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:14,224
if you're thinking like a

1333
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,993
candidate moves an analysis tree,

1334
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:17,761
is that in reality

1335
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:18,362
are candidate

1336
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:20,998
moves are just how we control our body?

1337
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:23,667
And do we move our arm up or down

1338
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:25,836
or the various controls

1339
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:27,638
of our physical function?

1340
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:29,673
But what are the candidate moves

1341
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,710
and then how would the analysis tree and

1342
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:37,781
decision making is it how would it come

1343
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:40,550
that you would make the less desirous

1344
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,152
decision?

1345
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:44,187
Is it purely, you know, as a short term

1346
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,456
versus long term?

1347
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:49,293
And then the organization of you,

1348
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:50,327
let's take a system like,

1349
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:51,194
okay, I'm a Jew, I'm

1350
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:52,496
a muslim, I'm an atheist

1351
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:54,231
or I'm a capitalist,

1352
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:55,565
I'm a communist

1353
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:57,901
that we have these self directed

1354
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,673
beliefs that control our behavior.

1355
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:04,708
And if it's learning to do things like,

1356
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,143
I can't steal,

1357
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:06,610
God forbid,

1358
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,278
I can't rape, I can't kill,

1359
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,947
and that like my desire,

1360
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,315
if the body tells me,

1361
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:13,450
okay, see, attractive woman,

1362
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,452
I want to have sexual relations

1363
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,721
other than I have these beliefs

1364
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:18,422
like that.

1365
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:21,091
There's a system of rules and governance

1366
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:22,926
that is a purely

1367
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:24,261
because I can't get away with it

1368
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:25,329
that I don't do it.

1369
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:27,497
We don't rape still until because

1370
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:30,567
we can't get away with it.

1371
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:32,569
Or is there this self-imposed,

1372
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,571
moralistic behavior

1373
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:36,406
and that's coming down to what

1374
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:37,574
belief means.

1375
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:38,308
And then,

1376
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:38,542
you know,

1377
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:38,909
also,

1378
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:40,811
if you're so curiosity,

1379
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,380
you'd have to clearly define

1380
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,581
curiosity.

1381
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,383
If you're talking about neural nets

1382
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:47,384
that, you know,

1383
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:48,018
can a computer

1384
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:50,153
just learn for its own sake

1385
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,321
and even can a human

1386
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,789
just learn for its own sake that,

1387
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:54,324
you know,

1388
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,193
we're participating these discussions?

1389
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:58,328
Purely because I enjoy

1390
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,363
figuring things out,

1391
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:01,064
even if it has no practical

1392
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:03,300
implication to,

1393
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:03,567
you know,

1394
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:06,703
some primal directive of survival

1395
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,372
or reproduction

1396
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:09,573
or however you're going to understand

1397
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:11,875
these primal directives.

1398
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:12,843
And then,

1399
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,011
you know, the equation

1400
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,012
be similar to a chess

1401
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,581
algorithm for a computer where

1402
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,951
it would appear that you could add

1403
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:22,352
in weighting factors,

1404
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,553
that you could programed this

1405
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:25,088
into the equations

1406
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:27,491
and you have some constants

1407
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:29,259
that would be weighting factors.

1408
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:30,160
So if you did have

1409
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,661
just one primal directive

1410
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:34,398
of survival or two primal directives

1411
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:38,101
of reproduction and survival,

1412
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:38,802
and then you could give

1413
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:40,570
those weighting factors,

1414
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:42,672
or you could have

1415
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:45,242
a feedback mechanism

1416
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:47,878
with the environment, and then,

1417
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:48,378
you know,

1418
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:50,080
where do the belief comes in the self

1419
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,148
made rules?

1420
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:51,915
And then how do that

1421
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:52,716
how are those weighting

1422
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,318
factors calculated in decision making

1423
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:56,019
and what does it mean

1424
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:56,853
to make a decision?

1425
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:58,021
Is it possible

1426
00:50:58,021 --> 00:50:59,456
that we make the least

1427
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:00,957
desirous decision?

1428
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:01,892
And if we can't make the

1429
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,193
less desirous decision,

1430
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:04,861
do we not

1431
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:09,699
have free will?

1432
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:10,200
Thanks.

1433
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,002
So Jonathan Schock

1434
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:12,936
made a great point,

1435
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:14,471
which is that deep neural networks

1436
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:15,572
applied to reinforcement

1437
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,340
learning can include curiosity

1438
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,176
as an explicit factor.

1439
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:20,877
It guides the agent to states

1440
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:22,112
which it has about

1441
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:23,947
which it has the most uncertainty.

1442
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:24,681
So it's a term

1443
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:25,715
which makes it rewarding

1444
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:27,784
to explore currently unexplored states.

1445
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:29,052
And then just

1446
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:32,222
to provide a recent example,

1447
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:35,025
here's a way in which a neural network

1448
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:37,661
architecture was used

1449
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:41,164
certainly worthy of more exploration,

1450
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:43,700
and at a first pass, or at least just

1451
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:44,868
qualitatively,

1452
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:47,070
one way to think about that,

1453
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,305
and then we'll come to

1454
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:49,706
how Curiosity was described

1455
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:52,642
in the text, is in active inference,

1456
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:53,510
we have

1457
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:56,046
a imperative for action selection

1458
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:58,281
that includes a pragmatic

1459
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,649
and an epistemic component,

1460
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:03,053
whereas a pragmatic

1461
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:05,188
absolutist perspective

1462
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:06,123
like reinforcement

1463
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,324
learning needs

1464
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:08,125
to generate

1465
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,192
these modules

1466
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:11,628
and alternate architectures

1467
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:14,131
such that information seeking

1468
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:17,901
curiosity can be coerced into

1469
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,903
a reward framework.

1470
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:21,171
I mean, what is the next question

1471
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:22,038
going to be?

1472
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:22,472
Well, it's

1473
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,875
rewarding to gain information.

1474
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:26,443
Oh, what kind of information?

1475
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:27,544
How much information,

1476
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:29,312
how are we going to learn the parameters

1477
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,714
on our curiosity model

1478
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:31,681
and so on

1479
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:32,816
and so active inference

1480
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,918
as a first principles approach

1481
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:36,086
for this kind

1482
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:38,522
of artificially intelligent system

1483
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:41,625
allows us to include at the base level

1484
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:44,694
both an objective

1485
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:47,864
achieving and a pure curiosity

1486
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:49,900
element.

1487
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:51,401
Dean And then we'll

1488
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:55,839
look at how they talk about curiosity.

1489
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:56,506
Thanks, Daniel.

1490
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:57,274
So

1491
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:00,777
as a as is historically

1492
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:02,812
been the case for point two's,

1493
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:03,980
I'll just left

1494
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:04,848
and I was going to ask him

1495
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:05,749
this question, okay.

1496
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:06,483
Because he's still here.

1497
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:10,887
So David went after the one

1498
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:12,556
and now just what

1499
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:14,191
you were just sharing with us here,

1500
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,593
I wondered without putting words,

1501
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,762
can I get a clarification?

1502
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:21,064
I think one of the things that you're

1503
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:23,800
trying to make clear or

1504
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,102
or at least bring into the card

1505
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:28,538
is that prioritization,

1506
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:30,974
which is the sort of the value

1507
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:32,042
weighting aspect

1508
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:36,680
of how we see the world, is not ordering

1509
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:38,048
the kind of placing

1510
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,083
of a formalism down on paper

1511
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:41,551
that includes rules

1512
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:42,419
like equals

1513
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:44,688
and plus and minus in the FPP

1514
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:47,090
or the sort of extended and variation

1515
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:52,095
is that in not oversimplifying

1516
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:54,531
what you want us to make clear that

1517
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:57,334
that having a evaluating

1518
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:59,202
is not the same,

1519
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:01,338
that kind of prioritization is not

1520
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:03,607
the same as being able to formally set

1521
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:08,445
and order.

1522
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:09,813
Well, I'm a dualist, so.

1523
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:11,381
Like I'm trying to.

1524
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,149
I think I could use these equations

1525
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:15,452
for dualistic purposes

1526
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:16,519
and you could just factor

1527
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:18,121
in a waiting factor

1528
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:20,190
for these higher order rules.

1529
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:20,824
And then,

1530
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:21,057
you know,

1531
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:23,026
so my system would have some sort of

1532
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:25,862
struggle between

1533
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:27,530
two separate realms of material

1534
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:28,832
and spiritual realm.

1535
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:30,033
So that's your personally

1536
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:31,601
how I'm I'm looking at it.

1537
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:31,968
But, you know,

1538
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:34,337
I can attempt to understand it from

1539
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:36,239
just the materialistic realm

1540
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:38,642
and how the equations

1541
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:41,111
of your would apply.

1542
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,680
And then if there's competing factors,

1543
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,948
what's the origin

1544
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,816
of those competing factors?

1545
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:48,385
So if you just put

1546
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,487
your desires, our biological,

1547
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:54,357
animalistic urges and beliefs are self

1548
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:58,795
created rules of cognition,

1549
00:54:59,062 --> 00:54:59,863
and then you want to have

1550
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:00,897
a separate function

1551
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:04,668
like curiosity, where we're curiosity,

1552
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:06,202
maybe benefits

1553
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:08,071
the purpose of making beliefs

1554
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:08,938
which would

1555
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:11,341
later come to become higher order rules.

1556
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:13,343
And

1557
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:14,377
or if you want to have

1558
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:16,246
the ability to have

1559
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:18,381
behavior that has no purpose,

1560
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:20,950
that I just enjoy understanding things,

1561
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:23,119
maybe that understanding

1562
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:23,653
will help me

1563
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,923
make better, higher order rules.

1564
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:28,658
And even then saying, oh,

1565
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:29,793
like you're saying for the equation,

1566
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:30,994
because here we have these equations

1567
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,462
and it's free energy.

1568
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:35,532
And, you know, so the purpose is to

1569
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:37,534
minimize it,

1570
00:55:37,534 --> 00:55:39,102
minimize the

1571
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:41,938
at least in principle, it eliminates

1572
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:43,473
limit energy usage.

1573
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:44,941
And so if you're looking like, well,

1574
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:46,142
why did I do that?

1575
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:46,876
Was like,

1576
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:47,744
you know, dummy, didn't

1577
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:48,611
you look at the equation?

1578
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:49,079
It was

1579
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:50,780
it was the free energy principle

1580
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,982
you did to minimize energy usage.

1581
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:54,317
And, you know,

1582
00:55:54,317 --> 00:55:56,853
so if we're just saying that that that's

1583
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,290
the origin of all human behavior

1584
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,258
from an element of a static

1585
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:04,294
sense and

1586
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:05,695
you're from the false psychology.

1587
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:06,363
That's why I said, if

1588
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,698
I'm taking a dualistic perspective

1589
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:10,533
where these higher order rules

1590
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,602
are coming from a non material plane,

1591
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:14,170
but I think they could be modeled

1592
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:16,039
into the equations.

1593
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:17,907
Thanks.

1594
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:19,109
Also, free energy

1595
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:20,977
minimization doesn't entail

1596
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:23,613
the actual minimal possible

1597
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,215
energy usage,

1598
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,583
though some people have made

1599
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,084
that accidentally

1600
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:30,019
or intentionally a claim.

1601
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:31,521
It isn't what those equations

1602
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:33,089
as they're being used here

1603
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:35,191
necessarily represent, but it could

1604
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:36,426
there could be a system

1605
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:37,994
that thrives optimally

1606
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:40,196
based upon reducing energy usage.

1607
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:41,531
But also there are situations

1608
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:43,266
where free energy minimization

1609
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:45,001
in the path of least action

1610
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:47,070
or not, the lowest energy consumption

1611
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:48,972
was that

1612
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:50,940
short term versus long term thing?

1613
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:51,508
Long term

1614
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:51,841
it is,

1615
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:52,542
but it's just short

1616
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:54,210
term versus long term

1617
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:55,979
decision making in the

1618
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:57,781
as opposed to a dualistic

1619
00:56:57,781 --> 00:56:58,681
the predictive mind.

1620
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,216
That thing is not dualistic,

1621
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:01,885
spiritual versus material.

1622
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:03,686
It's a single, materialistic

1623
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:08,825
in its short term versus long term.

1624
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:09,559
Okay.

1625
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:10,193
Let's

1626
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:10,727
think about that

1627
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:13,763
in the context of of curiosity,

1628
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:17,367
how they're describing so

1629
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:21,037
gee, expected free energy of policies.

1630
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,773
It's like the policies are enumerated

1631
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:27,010
and then is calculated for them reflects

1632
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,945
the inferred value of each policy based

1633
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,547
upon beliefs.

1634
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:33,016
Beliefs are p of o sub t

1635
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:34,517
condition on pi.

1636
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:37,153
So the distribution of outcomes

1637
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:39,622
conditioned upon policies.

1638
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:40,323
If I go left,

1639
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:41,825
what do I expect to see if I go right?

1640
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:43,660
What do I expect to see? That's a belief

1641
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:47,897
and the belief distribution

1642
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:49,466
about observations

1643
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,500
conditioned upon hidden

1644
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,202
states of the world.

1645
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,204
If there is food there,

1646
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:55,505
then what observations

1647
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:57,507
will I expect to see

1648
00:57:57,507 --> 00:57:59,642
and desired outcomes, which is,

1649
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:04,180
as we've explored in 37 in User's Guide,

1650
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:07,050
there's this dual implication

1651
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:09,853
of the P of O distribution

1652
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:12,989
and active inference as what is expected

1653
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:16,292
as well as preferred,

1654
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:19,796
because we reduce our surprise

1655
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:22,332
about the expected

1656
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:25,768
slash preferred outcome distribution,

1657
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:28,438
and that is how the desired outcomes

1658
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:29,873
are realized,

1659
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:32,208
not by providing a higher reward

1660
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:33,676
or value

1661
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:36,246
to increasingly preferred states,

1662
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:37,480
but rather

1663
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,049
treating the preference distribution

1664
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,652
as expectations

1665
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:45,188
which allows us to use surprises

1666
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:46,322
and surprising

1667
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:49,559
bounding approaches towards achieving

1668
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,028
preferences.

1669
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:53,863
So how do they

1670
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:56,432
talk about desire and curiosity?

1671
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,202
They're suggesting that these drives

1672
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,770
so this is in earlier

1673
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:01,638
we talked about there's

1674
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:03,840
the two ways to talk about desire,

1675
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,042
the specific target of desire

1676
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:07,310
as a desire

1677
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:08,945
like I desire

1678
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:10,813
a cube of tungsten or something.

1679
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:12,982
And then there's the drive

1680
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:15,151
that is associated with desire.

1681
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:16,553
What made the person do it?

1682
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:21,090
Desire in the abstract,

1683
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,725
curiosity drives

1684
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,427
discovery of what is not yet known

1685
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:28,464
and thus has no preconceived target.

1686
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:30,300
However, one could also say

1687
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,501
that it has a semi

1688
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:33,636
formed concept of target

1689
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:34,971
because one could be like

1690
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:37,907
curious about something and

1691
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,076
then curiosity would be satiated

1692
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,844
by something else,

1693
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:43,479
something but not something else.

1694
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:44,781
So in that case,

1695
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:46,583
there was some of

1696
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,383
something of a prior

1697
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:49,619
on, what they were looking for

1698
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:51,187
the claim

1699
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:53,289
that curiosity is not cognitive,

1700
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:55,825
so desire related

1701
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:57,360
might seem suspect on the grounds.

1702
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,062
It could also be characterized

1703
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:02,298
as simply the desire to learn

1704
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:03,866
qualitatively.

1705
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:05,468
And this in turn could be conceived

1706
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:06,269
as the desire

1707
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,170
that one's beliefs

1708
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:10,940
are as precise as possible, even though,

1709
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,342
especially in the short term, learning

1710
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:13,743
sometimes feels like

1711
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:16,879
it reduces our precision.

1712
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:17,914
However, the mathematics

1713
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:18,781
allow us to motivate

1714
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,584
a genuine distinction here, specifically

1715
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,419
changing outcomes to minimize

1716
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:25,755
the scale divergence in the risk term.

1717
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:28,391
In if he is a fundamentally different

1718
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:29,425
sort of process

1719
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:31,794
for minimizing the ambiguity term.

1720
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:34,197
So the key divergence is on the

1721
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:34,964
left side here

1722
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:39,102
and the ambiguity term

1723
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:40,737
is on the right side here.

1724
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:41,604
Here's the equation

1725
01:00:41,604 --> 01:00:44,874
2.6 from the textbook

1726
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:47,543
and it's it's in a different order.

1727
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,679
But just to see here's risk

1728
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,714
with the scale divergence

1729
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:53,282
and then here's expected ambiguity

1730
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:54,183
with an H

1731
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:59,756
for the entropy calculation,

1732
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:01,991
the latter of

1733
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,493
which is the ambiguity term

1734
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,094
does not care

1735
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:07,497
how uncertainty is resolved so long

1736
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:08,865
it is resolved.

1737
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:09,832
There's no preference

1738
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,100
for becoming more confident

1739
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:15,071
in one possible belief over another,

1740
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:18,207
whereas the reduction of uncertainty

1741
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:21,944
by reducing the scale divergence is

1742
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:23,913
what is bringing us into alignment

1743
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:26,182
with our preferences slash expectations.

1744
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:27,183
Hence

1745
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,252
that is a much more targeted

1746
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:31,654
form of curiosity

1747
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:34,323
in that it allows for goal

1748
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:38,161
directed information seeking

1749
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:38,861
and then they write.

1750
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:39,462
At a minimum,

1751
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:41,597
the psychological concept of curiosity

1752
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:42,331
corresponds

1753
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:44,133
to a very different type of desire,

1754
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:47,336
with a distinct counterpart in Die Dean

1755
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:50,073
Yeah,

1756
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,474
that's perfect, because

1757
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:52,742
what I wanted to say was that

1758
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:53,843
I think that

1759
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:55,178
that curiosity

1760
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:57,480
really points to that risk.

1761
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,715
And the reason I say

1762
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,951
that is because you may find that

1763
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:04,020
when the ambiguity is removed,

1764
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,656
surprises a happy one or a not.

1765
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:07,457
So happy one.

1766
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:09,692
And I think that's

1767
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:10,727
that's kind of important

1768
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,062
here, too, to see sort of the

1769
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,933
it's it's hard to say, as it says here.

1770
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:17,700
It's however,

1771
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:18,101
the claim

1772
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:19,936
that curiosity is non-cognitive

1773
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:21,971
might seem suspect on the grounds.

1774
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:23,206
It could also be characterized

1775
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:25,875
as simply just the desire to learn that

1776
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:28,911
before learning you,

1777
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,313
you're you're sort of in a

1778
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:31,948
in a ambiguous state.

1779
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:33,416
Will it be a happy surprise

1780
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:36,119
or will it be an unhappy surprise?

1781
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:38,221
And so I think this this kind of pulls

1782
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,323
that out. You

1783
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:41,924
know,

1784
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,826
the ambiguity

1785
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:45,728
applies a certain amount of risk.

1786
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:46,696
But then you have to

1787
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:48,164
you have to act

1788
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:50,366
in the act of inference aspect of it

1789
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,903
to determine whether or not the surprise

1790
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:55,071
or let the other side of it

1791
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:57,707
is actually good or not so good.

1792
01:02:58,241 --> 01:02:59,642
So I think that's

1793
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:01,978
where the curiosity arm of this

1794
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:03,446
comes to the fore.

1795
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:04,814
It is non targeted

1796
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:08,951
until it actually has been realized

1797
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:11,788
or somehow materialized, whereas the

1798
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:14,791
the targeted stuff, the desire stuff

1799
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:19,162
and be part of your plan.

1800
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:21,564
I'm not sure whether the curiosity fits

1801
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:24,667
as conveniently as the desire does.

1802
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,670
And just one short on

1803
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:28,404
that is we

1804
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:30,840
we see a conditioning on policy

1805
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:35,011
right, in a few different places.

1806
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:37,380
So it'd be interesting to think about

1807
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,982
where does planning to learn

1808
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:41,417
come into play

1809
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:42,618
and in what ways

1810
01:03:42,618 --> 01:03:45,121
is planning to learn directed

1811
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:47,023
or what if you plan to

1812
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:48,691
have undirected learning

1813
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:50,626
or all these

1814
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:55,298
other combinations, do it.

1815
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:55,798
Yeah, I'm

1816
01:03:55,798 --> 01:03:56,632
not sure if it would

1817
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:58,434
exactly fit in with the equations,

1818
01:03:58,434 --> 01:03:59,969
but I'm thinking here, like Maslow's

1819
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:02,872
hierarchy of needs are defined in terms

1820
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:05,641
the free energy principle, where

1821
01:04:06,742 --> 01:04:08,711
you sort of say curiosity

1822
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:11,147
requires excess energy.

1823
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:12,715
So if you're on the first rung

1824
01:04:12,715 --> 01:04:14,083
of the hierarchy

1825
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:16,819
that you have limited energy to apply

1826
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:18,287
towards curiosity.

1827
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:20,523
And if you do have energy to apply

1828
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:21,991
towards curiosity,

1829
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:23,559
you're going to be best off

1830
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:26,362
to be curious about things

1831
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,497
that will directly apply to,

1832
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:30,299
you know, your security,

1833
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:31,200
you know, your food

1834
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,937
or the primal directives as opposed to,

1835
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:35,771
you know,

1836
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:37,773
if you move up, up the hierarchy,

1837
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:40,276
at least put this into Maslow's

1838
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:41,644
hierarchy, where the

1839
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:42,678
you know, there's less risk

1840
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:44,614
associated with curiosity,

1841
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:45,648
that maybe you've achieved

1842
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:47,717
more leisure activity

1843
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,485
and then therefore have more

1844
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:53,589
energy to expand towards curiosity,

1845
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:54,724
that you could reach

1846
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,959
the highest levels of Maslow's hierarchy

1847
01:04:56,959 --> 01:04:58,828
and focus on

1848
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:01,864
your ideals and what is the meaning

1849
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:04,800
of truth or understanding of science.

1850
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,203
But it would still be

1851
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:08,204
you, however, you're defining

1852
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:09,739
the free energy principle

1853
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:10,940
that you have some sort

1854
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,476
of a conservation of energy

1855
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:17,146
and curiosity is an expansion of energy

1856
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:20,683
that is limited.

1857
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:23,920
But more resources could be allocated,

1858
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:26,923
so to say, energy resources to curiosity

1859
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:30,159
if it makes the whole, you know, a

1860
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:33,529
unified person more more

1861
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,198
efficient, then, you know,

1862
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:37,199
they become more secure,

1863
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:38,834
more safe, more social acceptance

1864
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:39,635
and so on.

1865
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:40,236
And therefore,

1866
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:41,037
they're more energy

1867
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:44,707
to expand towards curiosity.

1868
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:48,511
Thanks, Ali.

1869
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:51,580
I also think it might be helpful to

1870
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:54,917
mention the neural basis

1871
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:58,988
for these surprise appraisals, because

1872
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:02,291
you see, as we know,

1873
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:05,027
we have two systems of thinking system

1874
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:07,029
one system, two things really

1875
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:08,431
sketched out by

1876
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:11,334
Kahneman and diversity

1877
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:12,501
or fast

1878
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:13,736
track and slow

1879
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:16,405
track of reacting to stimuli.

1880
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:19,408
So in the fast track,

1881
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:21,978
well, the stimuli

1882
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:24,513
bypassed the sensory cortex

1883
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,183
and go directly from thalamus

1884
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:28,684
to amygdala. Right?

1885
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:31,620
So our first reaction,

1886
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:34,957
our immediate reaction to every surprise

1887
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:37,026
would be something

1888
01:06:37,026 --> 01:06:39,495
quite similar to fear.

1889
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:42,298
But then after appraising

1890
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:44,700
that stimuli stimulus

1891
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:47,670
after going through the sensory cortex

1892
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,939
and then amygdala and then hippocampus,

1893
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:54,210
then we can appraise,

1894
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:56,178
we can evaluate that

1895
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:58,381
surprise as being positive or negative.

1896
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,050
And as a result of that,

1897
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,319
we get a positive or negative

1898
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:05,421
valence affect.

1899
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:06,122
So

1900
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:10,192
in summary,

1901
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:13,229
well, every surprise,

1902
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:15,765
I mean, either positive or negative,

1903
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:17,166
it could be at first

1904
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:20,236
and at the very first moment be

1905
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,805
a kind of

1906
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:24,940
negative

1907
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:26,742
can induce a negative

1908
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:30,579
valence emotion in us.

1909
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:30,946
Yes.

1910
01:07:30,946 --> 01:07:32,915
I brought in some of the quotes

1911
01:07:32,915 --> 01:07:33,949
from this paper,

1912
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:35,785
habitual and reflective control

1913
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:37,787
and hierarchical predictive coding.

1914
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:41,757
It's from 2021 and it's by Kinghorn,

1915
01:07:41,857 --> 01:07:44,060
Milledge and Buckley.

1916
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,661
So they directly connect

1917
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:47,029
hierarchical predictive

1918
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:49,031
coding architectures

1919
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:51,567
which when they consider action,

1920
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,469
have a lot to do with active inference

1921
01:07:54,503 --> 01:07:55,171
in terms of

1922
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:56,105
thinking fast and slow

1923
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:58,140
like you had just brought up.

1924
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,408
So they wrote on this view

1925
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:00,910
fast actions may be triggered

1926
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,478
using only the lower levels

1927
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:03,512
of the hierarchical

1928
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:05,281
predictive coding schema,

1929
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:06,849
whereas more deliberative actions

1930
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:08,317
need higher layers.

1931
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:10,886
We demonstrate that HPC can distribute

1932
01:08:10,886 --> 01:08:12,588
learning throughout its hierarchy

1933
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:13,489
with higher layers

1934
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:16,192
called into use only as required.

1935
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:18,961
So that is very interesting.

1936
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:20,362
We think about

1937
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:22,765
going back to the idea

1938
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,934
I distinction from this paper,

1939
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:28,804
it's a hybrid model, albeit one

1940
01:08:28,804 --> 01:08:29,972
where the motor

1941
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:32,975
spatial control is continuous or model

1942
01:08:32,975 --> 01:08:34,410
that is continuous,

1943
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:36,579
and then there's a more discrete,

1944
01:08:36,579 --> 01:08:39,115
more mental or cognitive model

1945
01:08:39,315 --> 01:08:41,016
that's like thinking slow.

1946
01:08:41,016 --> 01:08:42,618
So it's almost like there's thinking

1947
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:43,385
fast and slow

1948
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:44,720
even within the mind

1949
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,323
and then there's thinking with the body.

1950
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:49,725
And that's like even a lower level.

1951
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:52,261
I don't think even by thinking fast

1952
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:54,130
they weren't

1953
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:57,399
talking about the reflex arc,

1954
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:59,535
but there be hierarchical modeling

1955
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:02,638
even there.

1956
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:03,639
So

1957
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:06,175
it

1958
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:10,179
what are these

1959
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:12,815
nested models that are slower?

1960
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:15,384
How do those develop?

1961
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:17,620
Are they related to the

1962
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,722
physical architecture

1963
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:23,092
of our on board machinery?

1964
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:25,327
To what extent do they involve

1965
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,830
so many of our off sourced

1966
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,332
or extended cognitive phenomena like our

1967
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:31,467
our colleagues,

1968
01:09:31,467 --> 01:09:33,302
like our social networks,

1969
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:34,170
our books

1970
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,005
and learning the social structures

1971
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:39,041
that scaffold our beliefs and so on.

1972
01:09:40,142 --> 01:09:42,077
There's a lot of interesting pieces

1973
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:45,347
there.

1974
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:48,150
What would be a good direction to go

1975
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:49,051
in this second?

1976
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:51,754
Half of the two

1977
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:55,090
we had targeted non-targeted?

1978
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:57,259
Is there anything there that's not

1979
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:00,429
covered by the curiosity discussion?

1980
01:10:00,729 --> 01:10:01,764
Is there

1981
01:10:02,631 --> 01:10:08,370
a unmuted and yes, go for it.

1982
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,205
Sorry about that.

1983
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,272
Yeah, I think we pretty much

1984
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:13,676
wrestled that one to the ground.

1985
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:16,712
Okay, do it.

1986
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:18,747
Yeah. Conception for targeted.

1987
01:10:19,114 --> 01:10:22,284
I'm calling the unified AI in terms of,

1988
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:25,254
you know, maybe like the ant colony

1989
01:10:25,254 --> 01:10:26,622
where.

1990
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:27,656
You've you

1991
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:28,557
you could look at it

1992
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:30,559
like the ants are all functioning

1993
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:33,629
personally with their own,

1994
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:35,064
your directive behavior

1995
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:36,532
and it just works out

1996
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:38,801
that they're directed or as a unit.

1997
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,003
But even in like a human,

1998
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:44,473
whether there's a unified

1999
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,709
of the human cells, like even sense

2000
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:47,643
perception that,

2001
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:47,810
you know,

2002
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:50,145
it's easier to look at it like our our,

2003
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,515
you know, like I mentioned, we have 100

2004
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:54,183
like almost

2005
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:55,117
100 million

2006
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:56,452
cones and rods in our eyes

2007
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:57,553
that are receiving photons

2008
01:10:57,553 --> 01:10:59,021
at every given instant.

2009
01:10:59,021 --> 01:10:59,989
And we just look at it

2010
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:00,823
like they're actors

2011
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:02,524
acting in a unified manner.

2012
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:04,159
But even

2013
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:05,094
that requires some

2014
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:06,495
sort of targeted behavior

2015
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,429
that the, you know,

2016
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:10,532
for for even direct motor motor control

2017
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:12,935
that our cells in our given body

2018
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:15,337
are acting in a unified manner.

2019
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:17,273
And could you

2020
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,775
you take the free energy principle to

2021
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:24,647
a cellular level and say, well, cells

2022
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:27,483
will act in a unified way

2023
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:29,151
if it's in accordance

2024
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:30,519
with the free energy principle.

2025
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:32,187
But if it wasn't in accordance

2026
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:32,921
with the free energy

2027
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:33,922
principle,

2028
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:36,025
then cells don't act in a unified,

2029
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:37,259
targeted way

2030
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:39,628
and act according to their own levels.

2031
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:41,530
I'm not sure if you could take that to

2032
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:42,598
the cellular level

2033
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:44,967
for even things like sense perception,

2034
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:45,701
motor control,

2035
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:47,403
like when ARM wants to go this way

2036
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:49,071
and one wants to go that way,

2037
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:55,811
and how do we have this unified control?

2038
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:57,212
It's interesting thing about

2039
01:11:57,212 --> 01:11:58,180
what would it

2040
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,615
what would make something Concord

2041
01:11:59,615 --> 01:12:01,317
or not with ATP because it's

2042
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:02,851
a description framework

2043
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:05,854
here is where in

2044
01:12:05,854 --> 01:12:09,224
from life from 25 with professor Levin

2045
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:13,162
here's even in the colony example

2046
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:17,433
where different substance and and cancer

2047
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:20,636
and and like other situations

2048
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:23,806
like biofilms were modeled this way

2049
01:12:24,306 --> 01:12:25,874
that there can be coherence

2050
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:29,111
within each cone, so to speak.

2051
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:30,913
A

2052
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:33,849
I don't know if this moves us

2053
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:34,249
closer

2054
01:12:34,249 --> 01:12:34,917
to understanding

2055
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:38,320
the experience of the eye or whether

2056
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:42,091
there is in fundamental a unified eye.

2057
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:45,394
But the cells in the estimates

2058
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:46,562
body can be understood

2059
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:49,331
as undergoing coherent behavior.

2060
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:52,167
Then estimates can, colony can,

2061
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:53,469
and then different people

2062
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:54,837
have taken different perspectives

2063
01:12:54,837 --> 01:12:57,873
on what makes one level of analysis

2064
01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:59,041
more relevant

2065
01:12:59,041 --> 01:12:59,842
than others,

2066
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:01,343
like an evolutionary perspective

2067
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:01,577
is that

2068
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:03,045
the unit of selection is granted

2069
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:05,581
some special power.

2070
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:07,916
A information processing perspective

2071
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:09,017
or integrated information

2072
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:10,986
theory might highlight what happens.

2073
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:19,495
Information within and across levels.

2074
01:13:19,495 --> 01:13:21,096
Let's look at the their

2075
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:25,267
dark room experiment.

2076
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:26,602
We kind of

2077
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:28,537
came to a little bit last time,

2078
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:30,939
but what did anyone think their figure

2079
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:35,210
and simulation spoke to?

2080
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:38,147
How was it adding

2081
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:40,549
details or

2082
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:42,418
information that weren't a presence

2083
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:43,952
in the

2084
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,524
more formalism and qualitative

2085
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:53,896
driven other sections of the paper?

2086
01:13:53,896 --> 01:13:55,964
I have a question.

2087
01:13:55,964 --> 01:13:57,866
I don't know if I have an

2088
01:13:57,866 --> 01:14:00,068
interpretation of it.

2089
01:14:00,402 --> 01:14:02,671
When others when others looked at this

2090
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:04,973
as it's now graphed out,

2091
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:08,977
did they see ambiguity removal

2092
01:14:08,977 --> 01:14:10,712
or did they see

2093
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:14,516
and an entropy question being resolved?

2094
01:14:14,516 --> 01:14:16,852
Because what I saw was the latter.

2095
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:19,588
I, I kind of saw that

2096
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:24,193
something, something appeared

2097
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:25,594
with more information

2098
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:28,530
gained or something disappeared.

2099
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:32,501
If there was no sense that, that,

2100
01:14:33,335 --> 01:14:35,737
that the change of the ambiguity state

2101
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:37,473
was going to make any difference.

2102
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:38,640
So I'm kind of curious

2103
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:42,277
what others, how others interpreted the

2104
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:45,347
the actual data as it as it laid out

2105
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:47,950
post hoc because this is all post hoc.

2106
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:49,952
This is just comparing.

2107
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:54,022
..7.32.99.01

2108
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:03,131
in terms of the does

2109
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:05,567
in terms of the desire, strength.

2110
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:06,435
And I think

2111
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:08,537
they used the term urgency in the paper

2112
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:13,008
going right?

2113
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:17,212
Yes.

2114
01:15:17,212 --> 01:15:19,381
Well, on on the left side.

2115
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:20,282
Okay.

2116
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:20,816
So time

2117
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:21,750
as there's

2118
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:25,287
time is moving from left to right.

2119
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:29,057
There's an entity that doesn't desire

2120
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:30,359
they don't have a preference

2121
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:32,661
for achieving ice cream.

2122
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:34,897
And in this simulation run,

2123
01:15:34,897 --> 01:15:35,931
they observed that

2124
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:37,699
they were in the dark room

2125
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:38,100
and they

2126
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,335
picked the decision to flip a switch.

2127
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:47,242
They then went to the right.

2128
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:48,210
And they ended up

2129
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:51,013
not finding that they got ice

2130
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:55,651
cream.

2131
01:15:55,651 --> 01:15:57,786
The Weak Desire agent first

2132
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:01,290
flips the switch

2133
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,358
and then

2134
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:08,096
with higher confidence goes to the left

2135
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:10,732
and they end up realizing ice cream

2136
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:15,237
in this case of the strong desire agent,

2137
01:16:16,538 --> 01:16:17,372
even though

2138
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:17,839
they have

2139
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:19,207
uncertainty about going left

2140
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:23,111
or right initially, they're in a hurry

2141
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:25,414
or it's urgent

2142
01:16:25,614 --> 01:16:27,783
and they go left immediately.

2143
01:16:29,051 --> 01:16:32,588
And that turns out that it does achieve

2144
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:35,958
getting the ice cream

2145
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:45,534
one one know is like

2146
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:46,935
these are only showing

2147
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:50,072
one run of each of those simulations.

2148
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:54,309
So it's like does the

2149
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:59,948
no desire entity always go to the right

2150
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:07,789
or is that a 5050?

2151
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:09,858
How have people used the BVI

2152
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:12,327
to do quantitative modeling of behavior?

2153
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:17,032
Are moving their verbal

2154
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:18,300
and formal arguments

2155
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,602
from above in the paper

2156
01:17:20,602 --> 01:17:23,405
into a form factor

2157
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:28,744
that will be more amenable or palatable

2158
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:30,412
to people

2159
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:32,781
who are already using these models to do

2160
01:17:33,782 --> 01:17:34,850
behavioral

2161
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:40,155
well.

2162
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:40,889
I think the beauty

2163
01:17:40,889 --> 01:17:43,458
I mean, strictly from the

2164
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:44,760
from the standpoint of here's

2165
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:47,462
what we're watched this agent do,

2166
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:50,365
it kind of it kind of had a 5050 choice.

2167
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:51,099
It was playing

2168
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:52,834
more in the geometry space.

2169
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:54,736
How this is represented

2170
01:17:54,736 --> 01:17:55,871
is more

2171
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:58,140
sort of the Bayesian distribution piece.

2172
01:17:58,740 --> 01:17:59,041
Right.

2173
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:00,642
So you've got a

2174
01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:03,211
a percentage of of an area

2175
01:18:03,412 --> 01:18:06,615
as you're moving from left to right

2176
01:18:06,915 --> 01:18:08,050
that's either

2177
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:11,086
darkened or remains agnostic.

2178
01:18:11,086 --> 01:18:13,321
It doesn't it doesn't sort of change

2179
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:16,892
what what the outcome or what

2180
01:18:17,225 --> 01:18:21,163
the the matching of an outcome and

2181
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:24,666
the expected free energy are.

2182
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:26,334
So I think that it just brings

2183
01:18:26,334 --> 01:18:28,603
more information to the

2184
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:29,938
to the observation

2185
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:31,473
of what's actually going on

2186
01:18:31,473 --> 01:18:34,643
when when the lights either do go on

2187
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:35,210
or don't go on

2188
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:36,745
because that first one,

2189
01:18:36,745 --> 01:18:37,179
the lights

2190
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:39,481
don't go on, I think, and the agent

2191
01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:41,316
either stumbles

2192
01:18:41,316 --> 01:18:44,319
to the right place or doesn't,

2193
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:47,022
but they don't care.

2194
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:50,192
But I do think that what happens is

2195
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:53,428
you can have geometry only

2196
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:55,731
or you can have geometry and

2197
01:18:56,431 --> 01:18:58,734
a proportion or distribution.

2198
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:00,836
And I think that's what this is

2199
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:02,804
kind of laying out for us, that you've

2200
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:05,006
now you've got more information.

2201
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:06,374
And with more information,

2202
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:08,877
hopefully you've got less,

2203
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:09,644
less

2204
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:13,682
in variance.

2205
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:15,484
You've got more variance

2206
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:17,552
being described here than you would

2207
01:19:17,552 --> 01:19:18,186
if you left it

2208
01:19:18,186 --> 01:19:20,222
with a geometric level alone.

2209
01:19:20,222 --> 01:19:23,592
So make sense.

2210
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:24,426
Yes.

2211
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:26,661
And they they follow up

2212
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,698
after the figure

2213
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:34,736
that this magnitude mapping, it's giving

2214
01:19:36,404 --> 01:19:39,307
not just some theoretical detail

2215
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:42,811
to this mapping.

2216
01:19:42,811 --> 01:19:43,945
And they provide

2217
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:45,113
several citations,

2218
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:47,949
many recently with Smith and others

2219
01:19:51,386 --> 01:19:51,853
where it's

2220
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:54,856
used in many different contexts.

2221
01:19:55,157 --> 01:19:57,659
And then I kind of found it

2222
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,662
a also interesting

2223
01:20:00,662 --> 01:20:02,931
in the following

2224
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:05,667
sentences after the paragraph that

2225
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:06,635
I had just quoted

2226
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:11,973
there, this motivating force

2227
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:13,742
could be corresponding to the magnitude

2228
01:20:13,742 --> 01:20:15,811
of the scale divergence.

2229
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:17,345
Scale divergence

2230
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:19,815
between the Q distribution

2231
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:20,882
of observations

2232
01:20:20,882 --> 01:20:23,919
conditioned upon policy divergence with

2233
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:27,055
the preference distribution P of up

2234
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:31,893
within the expected free energy.

2235
01:20:31,893 --> 01:20:33,061
So that's one of the terms

2236
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:35,197
that we've looked at in the GAAP

2237
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:36,865
either asked her

2238
01:20:36,865 --> 01:20:40,535
not to ambiguity term with entropy.

2239
01:20:40,535 --> 01:20:41,169
This is because

2240
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:42,637
stronger preference values

2241
01:20:42,637 --> 01:20:45,607
over rewarding outcomes in p of of t

2242
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:49,010
increase the kill divergence

2243
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:50,378
and lead the agent seek

2244
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:51,847
reward over information.

2245
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:54,516
Gain.

2246
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:56,117
So there's still a knob,

2247
01:20:57,118 --> 01:20:57,485
maybe

2248
01:20:57,485 --> 01:20:59,621
multiple that are slightly interacting.

2249
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:03,358
There's a knob by which more

2250
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:06,261
pure curiosity

2251
01:21:06,261 --> 01:21:08,096
that would be just the ambiguity

2252
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:10,532
resolving but undirected

2253
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,369
mixtures of pure curiosity

2254
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:17,439
and directed curiosity, weak preferences

2255
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,575
with a lot of openness

2256
01:21:20,575 --> 01:21:23,011
and increasingly sharp

2257
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:25,780
preference distributions induce

2258
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:28,750
increasingly urgent,

2259
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:31,219
pragmatic, value seeking outcomes

2260
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:33,054
and

2261
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:35,757
there's a lot of

2262
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:37,158
funny things

2263
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:39,728
that come to mind, like

2264
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:40,962
a question for one person

2265
01:21:40,962 --> 01:21:42,898
might be a survival question

2266
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:43,498
for another,

2267
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:45,500
it might be a research question.

2268
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:45,867
For another,

2269
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:51,406
it might be like a pure curiosity.

2270
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:54,276
Where's the oxygen in this room?

2271
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:56,311
Is that a survival question?

2272
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:58,079
Is that just,

2273
01:21:58,246 --> 01:21:58,546
you know,

2274
01:21:58,546 --> 01:22:00,015
again, are you researching

2275
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:01,616
distributions in rooms

2276
01:22:01,616 --> 01:22:03,718
so you have a target to understand that?

2277
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:06,021
Or are you just curious about that

2278
01:22:06,021 --> 01:22:08,456
thought of Dean? Then do it.

2279
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:10,292
Think that I Daniel that

2280
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:12,193
clearly speaks to a dividend

2281
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:14,062
and we were both mentioning in terms of

2282
01:22:14,062 --> 01:22:16,231
so what's your timeframe here, right?

2283
01:22:16,231 --> 01:22:17,132
So you take off

2284
01:22:17,132 --> 01:22:18,199
and you have a bird strike

2285
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:20,635
and now you don't have enough time

2286
01:22:20,635 --> 01:22:24,205
to land anywhere on the river.

2287
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:26,574
Is that curiosity?

2288
01:22:26,574 --> 01:22:28,610
It's that desire.

2289
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:29,210
Is that

2290
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,112
what is that in terms of

2291
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:33,448
how much time do you have now to manage

2292
01:22:33,815 --> 01:22:34,416
the risk

2293
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:36,518
aspect of

2294
01:22:36,518 --> 01:22:38,553
this this situation

2295
01:22:38,653 --> 01:22:39,888
you now find yourself under?

2296
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:42,223
It's certainly survival.

2297
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:45,360
But yeah, what what what percentages

2298
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,861
or what proportions

2299
01:22:46,861 --> 01:22:47,329
of each

2300
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:48,797
one of these different

2301
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:51,333
parts of the equation

2302
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:54,169
are being calculated at any given moment

2303
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:57,372
relative to the overall time frame

2304
01:22:57,739 --> 01:22:59,774
that you're now constrained under.

2305
01:22:59,774 --> 01:23:00,508
So,

2306
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:02,911
yes, do it.

2307
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:05,547
I mean, you just look at the

2308
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:09,017
refrigerator example that Walker had.

2309
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:10,785
I've been curious,

2310
01:23:10,785 --> 01:23:12,687
you know, earlier during the day

2311
01:23:12,687 --> 01:23:14,556
about the layout of the room.

2312
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:16,124
I might have remembered

2313
01:23:16,124 --> 01:23:17,359
how to get to the fridge later,

2314
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:19,561
but I didn't extend that mental energy.

2315
01:23:19,561 --> 01:23:21,196
So here I am hungry

2316
01:23:21,196 --> 01:23:23,665
and I don't know my surroundings.

2317
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:25,367
And so you have the level of

2318
01:23:25,367 --> 01:23:26,701
if curiosity

2319
01:23:26,701 --> 01:23:28,203
could have provided benefit, but now

2320
01:23:28,203 --> 01:23:28,903
at this point,

2321
01:23:30,038 --> 01:23:30,271
you know,

2322
01:23:30,271 --> 01:23:30,505
you have

2323
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:31,206
the risk factor

2324
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:33,742
while I enjoy myself or eat.

2325
01:23:33,742 --> 01:23:35,610
And I was thinking,

2326
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:35,944
you know,

2327
01:23:35,944 --> 01:23:38,146
like chess or something like, okay, like

2328
01:23:39,647 --> 01:23:43,351
the Alpha Zero is programed

2329
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:43,752
with,

2330
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:43,985
you know,

2331
01:23:43,985 --> 01:23:45,420
the most powerful computers

2332
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,188
for hours and hours

2333
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:49,290
to just understand the game

2334
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:50,492
and then later

2335
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:52,627
it's able to take that and win.

2336
01:23:52,627 --> 01:23:53,728
So like as a person,

2337
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:54,162
it's like, okay,

2338
01:23:54,162 --> 01:23:55,263
I really just like thinking

2339
01:23:55,263 --> 01:23:57,565
about chess and understand the

2340
01:23:57,565 --> 01:23:58,366
but then you look at what

2341
01:23:58,366 --> 01:23:59,601
I have to reproduce,

2342
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:00,935
I have to see to the

2343
01:24:00,935 --> 01:24:02,637
success of my children

2344
01:24:02,637 --> 01:24:03,471
and the offspring.

2345
01:24:03,471 --> 01:24:04,139
I have to,

2346
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:06,441
you know, make money and survive and.

2347
01:24:06,441 --> 01:24:07,208
So, you know,

2348
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:08,043
maybe I could become

2349
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:09,544
a professional chess player

2350
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:10,645
or something like that,

2351
01:24:10,645 --> 01:24:12,213
but then you would come in and well,

2352
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:15,550
if my goal is to,

2353
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:15,784
you know,

2354
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:16,384
reproduce

2355
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:19,220
and see the success of my offspring and,

2356
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:20,522
you know, make money and survive,

2357
01:24:20,522 --> 01:24:22,257
there's better methods to do that

2358
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:23,825
than becoming a

2359
01:24:23,825 --> 01:24:24,793
professional chess player,

2360
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:26,327
even like act of inference

2361
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:27,062
that, okay,

2362
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:29,130
I'm curious about how that stuff works,

2363
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:29,864
but it's probably

2364
01:24:29,864 --> 01:24:31,733
not going to help me reproduce

2365
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:32,801
or make a living.

2366
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:34,135
And if I tried to,

2367
01:24:34,135 --> 01:24:34,335
you know,

2368
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:36,671
take my curiosity about consciousness

2369
01:24:36,671 --> 01:24:39,641
and use that to benefit reproduction

2370
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:41,676
or make it or making a living,

2371
01:24:41,676 --> 01:24:45,380
it's unlikely to see that much

2372
01:24:46,548 --> 01:24:47,582
fruition.

2373
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:49,851
But at the same time, the

2374
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:51,386
I mean, the power of curiosity,

2375
01:24:51,386 --> 01:24:51,953
you don't know

2376
01:24:51,953 --> 01:24:53,588
how it's going to benefit you.

2377
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:55,390
So the ice cream example,

2378
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:55,890
you know, if we

2379
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:57,692
if we had a meeting in the kitchen,

2380
01:24:57,692 --> 01:24:58,593
you know, during the day

2381
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:00,161
and then we all go back to our rooms

2382
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:00,829
to go to sleep,

2383
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:02,197
and then we're hungry at night.

2384
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:03,565
The person who was just curious

2385
01:25:03,565 --> 01:25:04,966
about how the room

2386
01:25:04,966 --> 01:25:07,502
was laid out is going to be able to,

2387
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:07,936
you know,

2388
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:09,003
likely retrieve

2389
01:25:09,003 --> 01:25:09,904
the ice cream

2390
01:25:09,904 --> 01:25:11,306
without any injury,

2391
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:13,108
as were the person who didn't

2392
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:14,609
expand the energy

2393
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:16,444
to be curious about the layer

2394
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:19,180
layout of the room may not achieve

2395
01:25:20,348 --> 01:25:21,015
the ice cream.

2396
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:21,483
And that's why

2397
01:25:21,483 --> 01:25:23,618
I like in my in my own head

2398
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:24,619
it may not be

2399
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:26,087
directly to this paper,

2400
01:25:26,087 --> 01:25:28,590
but it could be in folk psychology.

2401
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:30,125
It would be to

2402
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:31,326
you map this to something

2403
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:32,894
like Maslow's hierarchy of rules,

2404
01:25:32,894 --> 01:25:34,963
which would be in line with neural

2405
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:35,630
neural nets,

2406
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:37,599
that there would be some sort of

2407
01:25:37,599 --> 01:25:39,100
higher order rules

2408
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:41,636
and some sort of ability to

2409
01:25:42,504 --> 01:25:45,406
put the expansion of more energy.

2410
01:25:45,406 --> 01:25:46,207
Like, okay, like

2411
01:25:46,207 --> 01:25:47,542
I thought about chess

2412
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:48,676
and now I'm winning

2413
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:49,944
and I've achieved a little bit

2414
01:25:49,944 --> 01:25:51,212
of social standing or,

2415
01:25:51,212 --> 01:25:53,014
you know, won a little prize money

2416
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:54,582
or even school.

2417
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:56,751
I was curious about consciousness.

2418
01:25:56,751 --> 01:25:58,453
Now I got a bachelor's degree

2419
01:25:58,453 --> 01:25:59,320
and I have enough

2420
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:00,989
proficiency to, you know,

2421
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:03,224
get a job and support a family.

2422
01:26:03,224 --> 01:26:04,592
And now I could exert

2423
01:26:04,592 --> 01:26:06,461
even more energy to it.

2424
01:26:06,461 --> 01:26:08,963
But at the time of the pure curiosity,

2425
01:26:09,297 --> 01:26:11,399
you don't know how it may

2426
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:12,934
you actually benefit you

2427
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:18,206
in terms of reward, great points

2428
01:26:18,206 --> 01:26:19,807
that it's almost like jumping

2429
01:26:19,807 --> 01:26:21,643
through different hoops

2430
01:26:21,643 --> 01:26:23,378
what it might be best

2431
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:25,313
accomplished, pure curiosity

2432
01:26:27,215 --> 01:26:29,751
at a future time point.

2433
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:32,253
So in in again that survival

2434
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:35,190
research and pure curiosity trilemma

2435
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:36,324
there's times

2436
01:26:36,324 --> 01:26:39,160
we're being driven by one or the other,

2437
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:42,263
helps us move

2438
01:26:42,263 --> 01:26:45,833
through complex real world.

2439
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:47,101
If we knew

2440
01:26:47,101 --> 01:26:49,637
the whole story from the beginning,

2441
01:26:49,637 --> 01:26:51,906
then we could just follow along.

2442
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:55,443
But in a highly information worlds

2443
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:58,546
where we don't want our priors to

2444
01:27:01,015 --> 01:27:03,117
lead to ruin, basically,

2445
01:27:03,117 --> 01:27:06,221
then pure curiosity and research

2446
01:27:07,288 --> 01:27:08,122
help

2447
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:11,593
bring things within our survivable limit

2448
01:27:12,293 --> 01:27:14,195
into information gathering spaces

2449
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:14,629
that we wouldn't

2450
01:27:14,629 --> 01:27:16,898
necessarily have traveled to

2451
01:27:17,832 --> 01:27:18,800
limited resources.

2452
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:19,901
I don't know if we could program

2453
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:21,002
that also into the computer.

2454
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:22,770
Also like the limit of resources.

2455
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:23,771
And if that

2456
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:25,173
if you interpret free energy

2457
01:27:25,173 --> 01:27:26,074
principle in general

2458
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:28,443
to be a definition of limited

2459
01:27:28,443 --> 01:27:33,448
energy resources.

2460
01:27:33,448 --> 01:27:33,815
Ali

2461
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:39,787
Well, you're adding to my

2462
01:27:39,787 --> 01:27:42,557
own previous comments about the

2463
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:46,527
subject of consciousness and

2464
01:27:46,527 --> 01:27:47,729
I personally believe

2465
01:27:47,729 --> 01:27:49,697
that the nature of consciousness

2466
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:51,899
is ultimately computational,

2467
01:27:51,899 --> 01:27:55,270
and so it's amenable to modeling and

2468
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:57,205
this simulated simulation.

2469
01:27:57,205 --> 01:27:59,941
But we're we're just not there yet.

2470
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:03,111
But well,

2471
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:06,247
one possible approach to

2472
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:09,984
to achieve such model

2473
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:12,220
could be potentially

2474
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:13,688
the active inference approach

2475
01:28:13,688 --> 01:28:15,990
or other related approaches.

2476
01:28:15,990 --> 01:28:19,861
But you see, curiosity

2477
01:28:19,861 --> 01:28:23,331
is just one aspect of consciousness.

2478
01:28:23,331 --> 01:28:25,833
And I think it should

2479
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:27,869
it could probably be helpful

2480
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:28,836
to distinguish

2481
01:28:28,836 --> 01:28:31,639
between the artificial curiosity

2482
01:28:32,006 --> 01:28:34,809
and the experience of curiosity

2483
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:37,879
or the phenomenology of the curiosity.

2484
01:28:37,879 --> 01:28:39,781
What we see here is

2485
01:28:39,781 --> 01:28:40,682
the agent

2486
01:28:40,682 --> 01:28:43,885
that simulates the artificial curiosity

2487
01:28:44,686 --> 01:28:46,954
and not it's not exactly

2488
01:28:48,556 --> 01:28:51,693
ice morphic with the experience

2489
01:28:51,693 --> 01:28:55,830
we get from our drive to our information

2490
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:57,999
seeking drives.

2491
01:28:57,999 --> 01:29:00,468
And in fact, in this paper,

2492
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:01,869
I think it was in page

2493
01:29:02,937 --> 01:29:04,839
28.

2494
01:29:04,839 --> 01:29:07,442
Yes, it's in page 28

2495
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:10,912
that they states that

2496
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,413
we have not addressed questions

2497
01:29:12,413 --> 01:29:14,215
about the structure of generative model

2498
01:29:14,215 --> 01:29:15,683
would need in order to account

2499
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:19,620
for experience of beliefs and desires.

2500
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:23,658
So well, at least in this paper,

2501
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:25,560
we're not dealing with

2502
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:29,297
the actual experience of curiosity.

2503
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:32,600
We're just trying to somehow model

2504
01:29:32,934 --> 01:29:35,670
and simulate the artificial curiosity.

2505
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:36,437
In fact, this term

2506
01:29:36,437 --> 01:29:37,972
artificial curiosity

2507
01:29:37,972 --> 01:29:40,241
is one favored by our president himself

2508
01:29:40,241 --> 01:29:42,877
in his various other lectures.

2509
01:29:44,245 --> 01:29:47,014
Yes, very good point.

2510
01:29:47,014 --> 01:29:48,516
And it relates to kind

2511
01:29:48,516 --> 01:29:49,717
of the experience view

2512
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:50,952
from the inside

2513
01:29:50,952 --> 01:29:52,687
versus the behavioral modeling view

2514
01:29:52,687 --> 01:29:53,755
from the outside.

2515
01:29:53,755 --> 01:29:56,991
A curious particle or a curious forager

2516
01:29:57,792 --> 01:29:58,826
might be engaging

2517
01:29:58,826 --> 01:30:00,395
in some kind of behavior,

2518
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:03,464
but that isn't the same thing

2519
01:30:04,165 --> 01:30:07,001
as the experience of.

2520
01:30:07,001 --> 01:30:10,171
But they do provide references to other

2521
01:30:10,772 --> 01:30:12,774
work, like including work

2522
01:30:12,774 --> 01:30:14,075
that has been discussed

2523
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:15,743
previously on Live Streams

2524
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:18,079
with White and Ryan Smith

2525
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:20,882
on report paradigms of consciousness.

2526
01:30:22,717 --> 01:30:23,317
As we

2527
01:30:23,317 --> 01:30:27,221
head towards the end here,

2528
01:30:27,221 --> 01:30:29,090
I thought this was very interesting

2529
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:32,059
in the section before the conclusion.

2530
01:30:32,059 --> 01:30:33,094
11 Free Energy

2531
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:35,463
Principle and Direction of Fit.

2532
01:30:35,463 --> 01:30:38,900
And this is kind of a good section to

2533
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:40,201
to carry out

2534
01:30:40,201 --> 01:30:41,602
and bring forward

2535
01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:45,306
into our other discussions on active

2536
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:48,075
for any organism described by the FP.

2537
01:30:48,643 --> 01:30:49,877
The description will contain

2538
01:30:49,877 --> 01:30:51,879
an implicitly normative state elements

2539
01:30:51,879 --> 01:30:52,513
about the states.

2540
01:30:52,513 --> 01:30:54,482
The organism should be in

2541
01:30:54,482 --> 01:30:55,450
and can be described

2542
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,151
as having cognitive desire

2543
01:30:57,151 --> 01:30:58,820
like direction of fit.

2544
01:30:58,820 --> 01:31:02,290
So there's a preference distribution

2545
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:05,193
and as this papers building up

2546
01:31:05,526 --> 01:31:09,197
it can have an interpretation as desire.

2547
01:31:09,263 --> 01:31:12,600
Being a targeted desire,

2548
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:14,702
even beyond the case

2549
01:31:14,702 --> 01:31:15,970
of forward looking decision

2550
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:17,605
making agents.

2551
01:31:17,605 --> 01:31:18,306
Not all

2552
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:19,140
Bayesian beliefs

2553
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:19,740
in the FP

2554
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:22,310
formalism are best characterized as docs

2555
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:25,313
being about belief docs ology.

2556
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:27,615
This perspective

2557
01:31:27,615 --> 01:31:29,383
may expand upon current discussion

2558
01:31:29,383 --> 01:31:31,052
in the FIP literature,

2559
01:31:31,052 --> 01:31:31,519
where it is

2560
01:31:31,519 --> 01:31:32,353
fairly prominent

2561
01:31:32,353 --> 01:31:33,888
to discuss as if beliefs

2562
01:31:33,888 --> 01:31:35,490
in simple systems

2563
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:37,325
whether a mere active entity

2564
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:38,292
like a pendulum

2565
01:31:38,292 --> 01:31:40,862
or adaptive active entities

2566
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:42,230
and just say, I'm not saying

2567
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:43,297
that it really believes

2568
01:31:43,297 --> 01:31:45,633
that it's acting as if it believes that

2569
01:31:47,034 --> 01:31:49,670
that conform to the FIP here.

2570
01:31:50,037 --> 01:31:50,805
Our point is

2571
01:31:50,805 --> 01:31:53,407
they can also equally be described

2572
01:31:53,407 --> 01:31:57,378
as having as if desires

2573
01:31:57,445 --> 01:31:59,747
belief entered the active

2574
01:32:00,548 --> 01:32:03,284
lexicon slash ontology,

2575
01:32:03,284 --> 01:32:05,686
perhaps because belief is used also

2576
01:32:05,686 --> 01:32:07,421
in Bayesian statistics.

2577
01:32:07,421 --> 01:32:09,123
Distributions more generally

2578
01:32:09,123 --> 01:32:10,591
are called beliefs,

2579
01:32:10,591 --> 01:32:13,261
also disjoint from the phenomenology

2580
01:32:13,261 --> 01:32:15,229
of experiencing a belief,

2581
01:32:15,229 --> 01:32:16,898
but rather that's just called belief.

2582
01:32:16,898 --> 01:32:20,101
Updating is like a process

2583
01:32:20,101 --> 01:32:22,470
in Bayesian statistics.

2584
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:25,439
This paper kind of closes

2585
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:27,108
the loop with belief,

2586
01:32:27,108 --> 01:32:29,477
not towards phenomenology,

2587
01:32:29,477 --> 01:32:31,178
but stapling together

2588
01:32:31,178 --> 01:32:32,213
some of the Bayesian

2589
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:34,315
distributional usage of the term

2590
01:32:34,315 --> 01:32:37,018
belief with the docs gnostic

2591
01:32:38,419 --> 01:32:38,853
being

2592
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:40,288
about belief, the about

2593
01:32:40,288 --> 01:32:42,390
ness of those Bayesian beliefs

2594
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:43,357
is the folk

2595
01:32:43,357 --> 01:32:47,862
psychological concept of belief.

2596
01:32:47,862 --> 01:32:50,364
By making that mapping

2597
01:32:50,364 --> 01:32:52,967
and connecting the formalism as a whole,

2598
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:55,403
or at least in the core equations

2599
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:58,439
like the ethnology to the BD model,

2600
01:32:59,073 --> 01:33:01,042
it also allows them to identify

2601
01:33:01,042 --> 01:33:01,842
which Bayesian

2602
01:33:01,842 --> 01:33:03,210
belief distributions

2603
01:33:03,210 --> 01:33:05,846
map to belief in the BDA

2604
01:33:05,846 --> 01:33:07,848
and Bayesian belief distributions

2605
01:33:07,848 --> 01:33:12,420
map to d to the desires in the die.

2606
01:33:13,354 --> 01:33:15,056
And so to the extent

2607
01:33:15,056 --> 01:33:16,857
that somebody can say

2608
01:33:16,857 --> 01:33:20,061
a system has an as if belief

2609
01:33:20,861 --> 01:33:23,598
implicitly in a folk psychological way,

2610
01:33:24,565 --> 01:33:26,567
we can also talk about

2611
01:33:26,767 --> 01:33:29,604
as if desires

2612
01:33:30,738 --> 01:33:33,240
that helps

2613
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:34,709
partition

2614
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,144
but not disregard

2615
01:33:37,144 --> 01:33:38,479
the discussion around

2616
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:40,548
what different systems

2617
01:33:40,548 --> 01:33:41,582
the classic you know

2618
01:33:41,582 --> 01:33:45,119
what is it like to be X but it

2619
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:46,821
at least

2620
01:33:46,821 --> 01:33:48,656
according to this argument

2621
01:33:48,656 --> 01:33:52,026
and perspective, authorizes usage

2622
01:33:52,293 --> 01:33:54,996
of intentions and desires

2623
01:33:55,730 --> 01:33:56,731
intentions arising

2624
01:33:56,731 --> 01:33:58,499
from basically the combination

2625
01:33:58,499 --> 01:33:59,734
of the beliefs and the desires

2626
01:33:59,734 --> 01:34:00,568
in the VDI

2627
01:34:01,636 --> 01:34:03,037
and talking about

2628
01:34:03,037 --> 01:34:05,539
active systems as if they have desires.

2629
01:34:06,607 --> 01:34:10,244
What is that simulation desires of?

2630
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:13,814
And then using its beliefs

2631
01:34:13,814 --> 01:34:14,949
and desires

2632
01:34:14,949 --> 01:34:17,385
to explain its intentional behavior,

2633
01:34:17,385 --> 01:34:18,319
not the experience

2634
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:19,887
of intentionality, experience

2635
01:34:19,887 --> 01:34:20,354
of belief,

2636
01:34:20,354 --> 01:34:21,856
experience of desire,

2637
01:34:21,856 --> 01:34:23,958
but using them in this

2638
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:25,960
view, from the outside,

2639
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:27,695
more deflationary perspective.

2640
01:34:27,695 --> 01:34:30,031
So that's quite interesting.

2641
01:34:30,031 --> 01:34:31,866
And I think something that

2642
01:34:32,066 --> 01:34:32,900
will be

2643
01:34:33,701 --> 01:34:36,270
we'll see how it catches on

2644
01:34:37,304 --> 01:34:39,473
and which will

2645
01:34:44,178 --> 01:34:45,212
are the other sections

2646
01:34:45,212 --> 01:34:47,314
that people want to talk about or what

2647
01:34:47,882 --> 01:34:50,918
will they carry forward into their

2648
01:34:51,986 --> 01:34:52,319
post?

2649
01:34:52,319 --> 01:35:00,661
46 Life?

2650
01:35:00,661 --> 01:35:01,896
I think, Daniel, a couple of things.

2651
01:35:01,896 --> 01:35:03,597
I think the desire is the part

2652
01:35:03,597 --> 01:35:04,532
that you're just talking about.

2653
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:07,501
There are not sure that it's specific

2654
01:35:08,069 --> 01:35:08,936
in nature.

2655
01:35:08,936 --> 01:35:11,172
I think it's more generalizable

2656
01:35:11,172 --> 01:35:13,607
and sort of that scale three

2657
01:35:13,607 --> 01:35:14,141
is that there's

2658
01:35:17,344 --> 01:35:18,779
to to

2659
01:35:18,779 --> 01:35:21,782
some extent that David brought up.

2660
01:35:22,116 --> 01:35:25,319
I think that when you when you

2661
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:28,389
when you start getting getting to know

2662
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:29,123
active interests

2663
01:35:29,123 --> 01:35:29,457
a little bit

2664
01:35:29,457 --> 01:35:31,192
more and I'll speak

2665
01:35:31,192 --> 01:35:33,260
from personal experience

2666
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:34,161
with a focus,

2667
01:35:34,161 --> 01:35:35,262
a little bit of

2668
01:35:35,262 --> 01:35:36,297
sort of personal grooming,

2669
01:35:36,297 --> 01:35:36,931
you become one

2670
01:35:36,931 --> 01:35:38,365
heck of an attractive state.

2671
01:35:38,365 --> 01:35:39,333
And so

2672
01:35:39,333 --> 01:35:40,568
I think you might not make

2673
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:42,570
money off of that, but at this point.

2674
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:44,472
But I think as you get more

2675
01:35:44,472 --> 01:35:47,174
comfortable with the kind of being able

2676
01:35:47,174 --> 01:35:50,344
to take the information and

2677
01:35:50,344 --> 01:35:50,745
use it

2678
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:51,645
across a variety

2679
01:35:51,645 --> 01:35:54,648
of different situations, it's

2680
01:35:54,648 --> 01:35:55,950
it's actually is quite helpful.

2681
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:57,118
I don't think I'll

2682
01:35:57,118 --> 01:35:58,252
ever get rich off of it

2683
01:35:58,252 --> 01:35:58,819
at this point,

2684
01:35:58,819 --> 01:36:02,323
but it is kind of interesting how it's

2685
01:36:02,723 --> 01:36:04,191
I think, it is growing

2686
01:36:04,191 --> 01:36:05,659
in terms of the amount of attention

2687
01:36:05,659 --> 01:36:08,395
that it's getting. So that's kind of my

2688
01:36:09,463 --> 01:36:12,767
my two takes on this so far.

2689
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:14,602
So you're saying it might

2690
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:16,771
influence fitness?

2691
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:18,639
I think it might down the road.

2692
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:22,243
As long as we have enough time and scale

2693
01:36:22,977 --> 01:36:23,410
that,

2694
01:36:25,412 --> 01:36:25,746
you know,

2695
01:36:25,746 --> 01:36:27,414
I've been coaching chess for a while

2696
01:36:27,414 --> 01:36:28,415
and mostly to youth,

2697
01:36:28,415 --> 01:36:31,118
and I'm used to explaining

2698
01:36:31,519 --> 01:36:32,887
somewhat know these concepts.

2699
01:36:32,887 --> 01:36:35,923
Like I want to say that

2700
01:36:36,724 --> 01:36:39,093
people who are just curious about chess

2701
01:36:39,093 --> 01:36:39,393
and how

2702
01:36:39,393 --> 01:36:40,928
the patterns work and other pieces

2703
01:36:40,928 --> 01:36:42,062
work often

2704
01:36:42,062 --> 01:36:43,164
improve much faster

2705
01:36:43,164 --> 01:36:45,332
than people who desire to win,

2706
01:36:45,332 --> 01:36:46,834
and that a lot of times

2707
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:48,502
people will reach a certain strength

2708
01:36:48,502 --> 01:36:51,906
and then the curiosity diminishes

2709
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:54,241
and it's just their desire to win,

2710
01:36:54,241 --> 01:36:55,309
which isn't enough

2711
01:36:55,309 --> 01:36:55,743
that, you know,

2712
01:36:55,743 --> 01:36:56,410
it's just like,

2713
01:36:56,410 --> 01:36:58,078
I want to spend my night thinking

2714
01:36:58,078 --> 01:37:00,147
about these patterns

2715
01:37:01,282 --> 01:37:03,284
versus like I really want to win

2716
01:37:03,617 --> 01:37:05,186
and have some sort of practical

2717
01:37:05,186 --> 01:37:07,588
benefit from my efforts.

2718
01:37:07,588 --> 01:37:09,924
So I have my own

2719
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:12,393
personal goals

2720
01:37:12,393 --> 01:37:13,861
that brought me to active inference

2721
01:37:13,861 --> 01:37:15,596
because I was looking for my own tools

2722
01:37:15,596 --> 01:37:17,231
to advance my own research

2723
01:37:17,231 --> 01:37:19,633
and came on to active inference as

2724
01:37:19,633 --> 01:37:22,069
a method or tool that even though,

2725
01:37:22,369 --> 01:37:22,837
you know,

2726
01:37:23,571 --> 01:37:24,104
it appeared

2727
01:37:24,104 --> 01:37:26,340
that the majority of people are using it

2728
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:27,775
for a different purpose,

2729
01:37:27,775 --> 01:37:29,877
that I would be able to rework it

2730
01:37:29,877 --> 01:37:30,811
for my own purpose.

2731
01:37:30,811 --> 01:37:32,246
But because it's an

2732
01:37:32,246 --> 01:37:33,914
interdisciplinary study

2733
01:37:33,914 --> 01:37:34,281
and like,

2734
01:37:34,281 --> 01:37:35,149
you know, I'm an engineer

2735
01:37:35,149 --> 01:37:36,750
and that like engineering usually works

2736
01:37:36,750 --> 01:37:37,685
that way

2737
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:39,053
where someone has

2738
01:37:39,053 --> 01:37:40,387
professional certification,

2739
01:37:40,387 --> 01:37:41,622
they sign off

2740
01:37:41,622 --> 01:37:42,489
and you could expect

2741
01:37:42,489 --> 01:37:43,757
that they did their part right

2742
01:37:43,757 --> 01:37:46,093
and it's going to work and you could,

2743
01:37:46,927 --> 01:37:47,862
you know, attach

2744
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:49,730
that module to your module

2745
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:50,831
and both modules

2746
01:37:50,831 --> 01:37:51,932
going to do

2747
01:37:51,932 --> 01:37:53,901
what they said they're going to do.

2748
01:37:53,901 --> 01:37:54,335
And then,

2749
01:37:54,335 --> 01:37:55,636
you know, the curiosity will do.

2750
01:37:55,636 --> 01:37:56,804
I really want to understand

2751
01:37:56,804 --> 01:37:58,272
how your module works.

2752
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:58,472
You know,

2753
01:37:58,472 --> 01:37:59,640
do I really care

2754
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:02,743
about Dean and Ali's research or,

2755
01:38:02,743 --> 01:38:03,110
you know, do

2756
01:38:03,110 --> 01:38:04,545
I just want to trust

2757
01:38:04,545 --> 01:38:05,946
that their module works

2758
01:38:05,946 --> 01:38:06,747
and I'm going to be able

2759
01:38:06,747 --> 01:38:08,449
to attach that to my module

2760
01:38:08,449 --> 01:38:12,086
to make make something more powerful.

2761
01:38:12,086 --> 01:38:13,621
And both are probably true to it,

2762
01:38:13,621 --> 01:38:14,088
you know, to

2763
01:38:15,322 --> 01:38:16,290
your limited

2764
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:17,358
energy,

2765
01:38:17,358 --> 01:38:19,159
limited resources that, you know,

2766
01:38:19,159 --> 01:38:20,294
that I would like to understand.

2767
01:38:20,294 --> 01:38:22,029
Dean And at least module

2768
01:38:22,029 --> 01:38:24,465
to the best of my ability, but energy,

2769
01:38:25,032 --> 01:38:26,433
time allocation of

2770
01:38:26,433 --> 01:38:28,636
resources are limited.

2771
01:38:29,236 --> 01:38:30,471
But then, you know, certainly

2772
01:38:30,471 --> 01:38:31,171
you had a module

2773
01:38:31,171 --> 01:38:32,640
that would help my module

2774
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:34,975
and we could plug them in together and,

2775
01:38:34,975 --> 01:38:35,242
you know,

2776
01:38:35,242 --> 01:38:36,977
create a more powerful interface

2777
01:38:36,977 --> 01:38:38,846
so that I'm bullish about

2778
01:38:38,846 --> 01:38:42,049
active inference and as a framework

2779
01:38:42,483 --> 01:38:43,951
that will benefit,

2780
01:38:43,951 --> 01:38:44,118
you know,

2781
01:38:44,118 --> 01:38:45,519
the more and more people

2782
01:38:45,519 --> 01:38:46,320
who get involved.

2783
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,955
And I'm seeing my own direction

2784
01:38:47,955 --> 01:38:49,290
in my own research.

2785
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:50,424
I, you know,

2786
01:38:50,424 --> 01:38:51,492
I think this will be useful.

2787
01:38:51,492 --> 01:38:54,395
And I even think I got

2788
01:38:54,395 --> 01:38:56,030
Jennifer, I think joined the discord.

2789
01:38:56,030 --> 01:38:58,198
And I mentioned to a few other people

2790
01:38:58,198 --> 01:38:59,433
that that might be able

2791
01:38:59,433 --> 01:39:00,868
advance their research

2792
01:39:00,868 --> 01:39:02,636
and then try to understand,

2793
01:39:02,636 --> 01:39:04,638
you know, the current existing modules

2794
01:39:05,873 --> 01:39:07,441
that are out there.

2795
01:39:07,441 --> 01:39:09,310
You know, within the active inference.

2796
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:10,210
And you know,

2797
01:39:10,210 --> 01:39:11,745
I've mentioned the importance

2798
01:39:11,745 --> 01:39:13,580
of interdisciplinary studies

2799
01:39:13,580 --> 01:39:15,616
for, you know, big issues.

2800
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:16,050
You know,

2801
01:39:16,050 --> 01:39:17,685
none of us are going to figure this out.

2802
01:39:17,685 --> 01:39:18,352
It's going to take

2803
01:39:18,352 --> 01:39:20,020
interdisciplinary studies,

2804
01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:21,622
and none of us are going to be able

2805
01:39:21,622 --> 01:39:22,323
to understand

2806
01:39:22,323 --> 01:39:24,692
all of the disciplines necessary

2807
01:39:24,692 --> 01:39:28,562
to piece together the bigger puzzle.

2808
01:39:28,562 --> 01:39:30,030
Nice. Thank you. Yes.

2809
01:39:30,030 --> 01:39:33,133
Interesting point about the curiosity

2810
01:39:33,133 --> 01:39:36,270
driven learning

2811
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:39,406
and how that can be like a

2812
01:39:41,075 --> 01:39:43,711
but even paradoxically more successful

2813
01:39:44,845 --> 01:39:46,413
approach or mentality

2814
01:39:46,413 --> 01:39:47,481
to set off on a journey,

2815
01:39:47,481 --> 01:39:53,620
a learning journey with.

2816
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:54,955
I just think about somebody

2817
01:39:54,955 --> 01:39:56,223
trying to

2818
01:39:56,223 --> 01:39:57,524
learn organic chemistry,

2819
01:39:57,524 --> 01:39:59,793
which I tutored for many years,

2820
01:39:59,793 --> 01:40:01,962
and people who set themselves up

2821
01:40:01,962 --> 01:40:03,664
for the pragmatic value

2822
01:40:03,664 --> 01:40:05,299
and said, I want this outcome.

2823
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:07,935
Sometimes they achieve the outcome.

2824
01:40:07,935 --> 01:40:09,837
Other times they didn't,

2825
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:12,139
but it set up a lot of psychology

2826
01:40:12,139 --> 01:40:12,840
around

2827
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,341
not achieving the outcome

2828
01:40:14,341 --> 01:40:15,376
when it didn't happen.

2829
01:40:15,376 --> 01:40:17,277
On the expected timeline

2830
01:40:17,277 --> 01:40:18,012
and a lot of like

2831
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:20,447
secondary cascading failures.

2832
01:40:22,182 --> 01:40:23,684
However,

2833
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:26,653
there's also the the clear counterpoint,

2834
01:40:26,653 --> 01:40:28,689
which is but if we don't

2835
01:40:28,689 --> 01:40:31,992
want the higher grade, then

2836
01:40:32,893 --> 01:40:34,294
like if we're just going to be curious

2837
01:40:34,294 --> 01:40:34,862
about learning

2838
01:40:34,862 --> 01:40:35,662
organic chemistry,

2839
01:40:35,662 --> 01:40:37,765
like my finals in six weeks.

2840
01:40:38,399 --> 01:40:41,301
So how are we going to balance the

2841
01:40:41,301 --> 01:40:43,504
and the curiosity?

2842
01:40:43,504 --> 01:40:44,605
And I think maybe even

2843
01:40:44,605 --> 01:40:46,673
this paper helped us look at one way,

2844
01:40:47,207 --> 01:40:51,045
which is keep the preference direction,

2845
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:52,046
but understand

2846
01:40:52,046 --> 01:40:54,581
how the urgency of your preference

2847
01:40:57,217 --> 01:41:00,421
influences the way that you take action.

2848
01:41:01,321 --> 01:41:04,558
And just think about what what if you

2849
01:41:04,658 --> 01:41:06,460
what if your final was tomorrow?

2850
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:07,995
How would you go about it?

2851
01:41:07,995 --> 01:41:08,328
Okay.

2852
01:41:08,328 --> 01:41:10,397
Now, what if the final was in 100 years?

2853
01:41:10,764 --> 01:41:11,799
How would you go about it?

2854
01:41:12,866 --> 01:41:15,102
Where are we in that continuum?

2855
01:41:15,102 --> 01:41:17,037
Do we have time for curiosity

2856
01:41:17,037 --> 01:41:18,472
and for openness,

2857
01:41:18,472 --> 01:41:19,139
or is this

2858
01:41:19,139 --> 01:41:21,208
an actual emergency situation?

2859
01:41:22,943 --> 01:41:25,112
And then we can triage where there is

2860
01:41:25,112 --> 01:41:25,879
an emergency

2861
01:41:25,879 --> 01:41:28,849
organic chemistry situation,

2862
01:41:28,849 --> 01:41:31,085
but also hold space for curiosity

2863
01:41:31,085 --> 01:41:32,419
and openness.

2864
01:41:32,419 --> 01:41:34,521
And even in the emergency,

2865
01:41:34,521 --> 01:41:36,723
there has to be information seeking

2866
01:41:36,723 --> 01:41:38,125
it just more directed

2867
01:41:38,125 --> 01:41:39,426
information seeking.

2868
01:41:39,426 --> 01:41:40,327
Okay, we're going to work

2869
01:41:40,327 --> 01:41:41,428
through the practice tests

2870
01:41:41,428 --> 01:41:41,695
and that's

2871
01:41:41,695 --> 01:41:43,597
what we're going to have time for.

2872
01:41:43,797 --> 01:41:44,364
There's still is going

2873
01:41:44,364 --> 01:41:45,399
to be information seeking,

2874
01:41:45,399 --> 01:41:47,501
but not of the same kind.

2875
01:41:47,501 --> 01:41:48,902
If we had more time

2876
01:41:48,902 --> 01:41:51,438
to kind of space out,

2877
01:41:51,438 --> 01:41:53,640
even though in a alternate slash

2878
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:54,374
preferable world,

2879
01:41:54,374 --> 01:41:55,375
perhaps that's the better way

2880
01:41:55,375 --> 01:41:58,112
to learn, the more fun way to learn, or

2881
01:41:58,112 --> 01:42:00,447
so on.

2882
01:42:02,049 --> 01:42:05,352
Any other thoughts?

2883
01:42:07,988 --> 01:42:09,223
Well, one of the things

2884
01:42:09,223 --> 01:42:10,991
I really like about

2885
01:42:10,991 --> 01:42:11,925
active insurance

2886
01:42:11,925 --> 01:42:13,293
research is

2887
01:42:13,293 --> 01:42:14,128
the willingness

2888
01:42:14,128 --> 01:42:16,730
of the researchers in this area to

2889
01:42:17,498 --> 01:42:19,833
seriously address the criticisms

2890
01:42:21,168 --> 01:42:23,570
instead of just judging them and

2891
01:42:24,204 --> 01:42:26,673
their willingness to to constantly

2892
01:42:27,207 --> 01:42:29,743
improving, update the theory

2893
01:42:30,511 --> 01:42:31,879
in order to

2894
01:42:31,879 --> 01:42:35,716
fill the fill the gaps and well,

2895
01:42:35,716 --> 01:42:39,486
and also address the

2896
01:42:41,588 --> 01:42:43,590
well, the weakness or any

2897
01:42:43,590 --> 01:42:45,559
any weakness or loophole

2898
01:42:45,559 --> 01:42:47,394
in the in the theory.

2899
01:42:47,394 --> 01:42:50,631
And that's very

2900
01:42:50,631 --> 01:42:51,331
liberating

2901
01:42:51,331 --> 01:42:54,134
to see such a active area of research

2902
01:42:55,035 --> 01:42:57,638
going going forward

2903
01:42:58,505 --> 01:43:01,441
in a very determined and also

2904
01:43:01,542 --> 01:43:04,311
very open minded, open minded way.

2905
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:05,712
And.

2906
01:43:05,712 --> 01:43:06,680
Well,

2907
01:43:06,847 --> 01:43:09,283
that's one of the things that I think

2908
01:43:09,283 --> 01:43:11,585
sets it apart from

2909
01:43:11,585 --> 01:43:13,921
other than some other

2910
01:43:13,921 --> 01:43:21,161
research areas today.

2911
01:43:21,161 --> 01:43:22,329
It's what we prefer.

2912
01:43:22,329 --> 01:43:24,198
It's what we expect

2913
01:43:24,364 --> 01:43:26,066
to.

2914
01:43:26,066 --> 01:43:30,270
We're curious about it.

2915
01:43:30,270 --> 01:43:31,138
Okay,

2916
01:43:31,538 --> 01:43:32,973
Dean, Ali, David,

2917
01:43:32,973 --> 01:43:34,741
thanks a lot for this fun discussion.

2918
01:43:34,741 --> 01:43:36,843
And Ryan Maxwell

2919
01:43:36,843 --> 01:43:39,112
and Alex for this paper,

2920
01:43:39,112 --> 01:43:41,315
it really capped off a long

2921
01:43:41,315 --> 01:43:43,350
run of livestreams. We've had

2922
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:46,720
quite a nice sequence

2923
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:49,022
going back to the beginning

2924
01:43:49,022 --> 01:43:50,757
of this year,

2925
01:43:51,058 --> 01:43:54,328
getting through many, many discussions.

2926
01:43:55,529 --> 01:43:57,197
Next week, we're going to have

2927
01:43:57,197 --> 01:44:00,734
the second quarterly roundtable meeting

2928
01:44:02,102 --> 01:44:04,271
and then we'll have July off

2929
01:44:04,271 --> 01:44:06,707
of paper discussions

2930
01:44:07,741 --> 01:44:10,644
and we'll be coming back in August with

2931
01:44:10,677 --> 01:44:12,713
paper discussions.

2932
01:44:12,846 --> 01:44:13,213
We don't know

2933
01:44:13,213 --> 01:44:14,915
exactly what they're going to be,

2934
01:44:14,915 --> 01:44:17,517
but we know some of them.

2935
01:44:18,218 --> 01:44:20,721
And we have a few guest streams

2936
01:44:20,721 --> 01:44:22,256
and other streams coming up.

2937
01:44:22,256 --> 01:44:23,023
But

2938
01:44:25,359 --> 01:44:27,394
yeah, it's been a nice run.

2939
01:44:27,394 --> 01:44:28,128
The lab meeting

2940
01:44:28,128 --> 01:44:28,629
next week

2941
01:44:28,629 --> 01:44:31,365
will be a great cup to this season

2942
01:44:31,365 --> 01:44:33,166
slash semester

2943
01:44:33,166 --> 01:44:34,334
and then we'll come back

2944
01:44:34,334 --> 01:44:35,902
for the end of 2022

2945
01:44:35,902 --> 01:44:38,171
with some new changes

2946
01:44:38,171 --> 01:44:39,072
that I think people

2947
01:44:39,072 --> 01:44:40,474
will be really excited about.

2948
01:44:40,474 --> 01:44:43,977
So thanks everybody and see you later.

2949
01:44:43,977 --> 01:44:46,680
Thanks, Dana. Thanks, everyone.

2950
01:44:46,680 --> 01:45:31,024
Thanks a lot.
