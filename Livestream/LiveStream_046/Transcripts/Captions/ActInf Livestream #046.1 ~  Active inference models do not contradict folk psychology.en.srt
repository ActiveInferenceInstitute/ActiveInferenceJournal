15th 2022 and we're here in actinflob

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,079
live stream number 46.1

6
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,840
welcome up and mute the stream if you

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,079

background thank you

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,840
welcome to the active inference lab

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,079
we are a participatory online lab that

11
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,399
is communicating learning and practicing

12
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,879
applied active inference you can find us

13
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,600
at some of the links on the slide

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,039
this is a recorded and an archived

15
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,080
and transcribed and edited and published

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,199
live stream

17
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,040
so please provide feedback so we can

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,640
improve our work

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,479
all backgrounds and perspectives are

20
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,720
welcome and we'll be following good

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,360
video etiquette for live streams

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,680
head over to

23
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,960
activeinference.org to learn more about

24
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,560
live streams and a lot of the other

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,320
projects that are happening

26
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,080
in the lab

27
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,640
so we're here in acting stream 46.1

28
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,960
and we're in our second discussion of

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,600
the paper active inference models do not

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,680
contradict folk psychology

31
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,880
by ryan smith maxwell ramstad and alex

32
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,960
kiefer and

33
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,560
we're gonna go

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,280
i expect in many fun and interesting

35
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,799
directions today

36
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,200
so thanks everybody who's joined the

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,360
panel live and also for those who are

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,200
watching live thanks for adding your

39
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,600
comments in the live chat

40
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,479
we'll begin with some introductions

41
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,439
and then i believe that will introduce

42
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,479
many interesting areas we can continue

43
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,600
from there

44
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,479
so

45
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,199
we can start by just introducing ourself

46
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,440
and then passing it to someone else who

47
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,640
has not yet spoken and will close with

48
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,280
the authors who are here

49
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,599
so i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

50
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,959
california

51
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,680
and the dot zero was very interesting

52
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,560
with jacob and dean and ryan and it

53
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,120
raised many questions that i was excited

54
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,280
to discuss today

55
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,760
just to provide one would be perhaps the

56
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,200
relationship between formalisms of any

57
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,319
kind

58
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,280
and

59
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,519
natural language and just regular

60
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,840
concepts that people have how do we draw

61
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,840
the connection or evaluate connections

62
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,519
that are drawn there

63
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,800
and i'll pass to ali

64
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,319
questions i'd like to ask if they're not

65
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,440
what

66
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,879
oh sorry ellie wait wait uh sorry just

67
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,000
the uh

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,800
audio is set up a little bit differently

69
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,159
so if you could

70
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,239
um just start you can just reintroduce

71
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,360
but go for it thank you

72
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,480
uh okay is it okay yes yes

73
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,239
thank you all right

74
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,560
yeah uh i'm an independent researcher

75
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,760
from iran

76
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,480
and uh as i said i also have a couple of

77
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,200
questions i'd like to ask um if they're

78
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
not addressed during the discussion

79
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
especially when we get to section nine

80
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,480
of the paper

81
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,280
and

82
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,840
yeah i'm very glad to be here and

83
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,400
that's it from me and i'll pass it to

84
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,640
dean

85
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,239
morning uh my name is dean

86
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,400
i'm uh here in calgary

87
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,760
uh

88
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,640
i

89
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
really like this

90
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,599
paper which i kind of indicated in the

91
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,879
last

92
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,040
last live stream my

93
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,760
my curiosity because i really don't know

94
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,640
is

95
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,879
because of my background in education um

96
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,040
when i'm looking at that sort of

97
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,839
qualification quantification

98
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,960
piece and i'm thinking about the desires

99
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,800
as something that we can

100
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,639
see as 0.1 and 0.9 as a distribution i

101
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,400
often thought of

102
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,720
some of my previous conversations around

103
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,120
things like likert scales and so

104
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,639
i know this people haven't addressed

105
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,400
those things specifically but the idea

106
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,919
of being able to

107
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,960
translate into

108
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,000
sort of a numeric form has always been

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,600
interesting to me and that's something

110
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,720
that maybe

111
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,520
today or maybe in the 0.2 we can

112
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,120
we can think about the implications of

113
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,520
that and i'll pass it to

114
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,840
david

115
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,280
hey david kelton here uh thanks for

116
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,639
having me on my first time here on

117
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,520
active infant inference i go

118
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,840
by duvet as a streamer

119
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,560
i'm a civil engineer by uh education and

120
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,800
practice my background linguistics and

121
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,600
uh

122
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,520
physics and psychology

123
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,919
i spent many years in yeshiva rabbinic

124
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,720
study and i've been practicing hindu i'm

125
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,479
more on the mystical side of

126
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,560
consciousness been studying it actively

127
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,840
streaming for

128
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,560
a few years but also the mathematical

129
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,600
uh

130
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,000
materialistic side so yeah this paper

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,560
was very interesting especially you know

132
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,520
dealing with the sense perception

133
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,400
related to motor control which uh you

134
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,639
know my perception of dualism is

135
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,080
something that

136
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,479
the material does actually control so i

137
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,240
like the model i like the paper i was

138
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,160
interested in looking at some of the

139
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,199
more

140
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,479
um

141
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,240
philosophical and even

142
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,080
mystical precursors what what could

143
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,680
actually be explained

144
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,600
what are the assumptions being uh being

145
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,120
made in this paper was definitely a good

146
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,199
start

147
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,000
thank you david and to alex so feel free

148
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,639
to give any introduction and then

149
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,600
provide any context on what brought

150
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,960
about the paper from your perspective

151
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,199
yeah thanks uh so i'm alex kiefer i'm

152
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,360
i'm one of the authors on the paper uh

153
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,240
i'm uh affiliated with with um

154
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,680
monash university and and jakob obi's

155
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,479
cognition philosophy lab there and uh

156
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,479
i currently um

157
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,919
also uh

158
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,039
my my main sort of gig is at uh versus

159
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,319
uh research labs uh in la so

160
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,440
uh we've been doing some really

161
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,600
interesting research there that plugs

162
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
into active inference among other things

163
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,639
um

164
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,400
so as far as uh

165
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,000
context for the paper

166
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,800
um

167
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,360
so this is uh this issue of how how and

168
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,599
whether active inference and

169
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,199
and and theories in the vicinity like

170
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,800
predictive processing uh and all that uh

171
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,160
how those things map onto folk

172
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,280
psychology it's something i've been

173
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,520
interested in for a long time uh before

174
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,039
i uh i

175
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,960
spoke to ryan and maxwell that's about

176
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,000
this paper

177
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,599
uh and um

178
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,759
i won't try to give ryan's uh side of

179
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,759
the of the backstory but basically he he

180
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,479
was

181
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,919
i think planning on drafting something

182
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,599
along these lines for

183
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,720
independently uh we got in touch

184
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,919
um

185
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,960
through carl first and i think and uh

186
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,560
uh you know it was pointed out that i

187
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,120
was drafting something on the same thing

188
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,280
uh and then i ended up just hopping on

189
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,720
board

190
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,400
to work on certain sections and to sort

191
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,800
of to sort of uh help carry through the

192
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,560
argument

193
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,800
so that's a little bit of background

194
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,479
awesome what sections we can look at the

195
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,319
road map

196
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,840
did you um work on or also if you have

197
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,479
any thoughts on this overall structure

198
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,240
of like what sections did you include

199
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,039
and why did you order them in that way

200
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,520
yeah i mean i i guess i mean really we

201
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,879
share credit for it for all of it like

202
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,280
it's there isn't anything you know i i

203
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,879
um

204
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,879
we contributed to the

205
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,199
to the whole paper um

206
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,599
but the the sections that i was more

207
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,520
that i leaned more on maybe and that i

208
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,960
contributed more to

209
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,560
uh were the thing about

210
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,720
uh quantifying the motivational force of

211
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,479
desires um

212
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,720
section seven and then we also had a

213
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,960
bunch of back and forth um about the

214
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,479
last few sections the free energy

215
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,120
principle and direction of fit

216
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,240
um

217
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,799
yeah so i mean ryan being the first

218
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,679
author

219
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,080
definitely definitely did um a lot of

220
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,240
the writing so but those are the

221
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,559
sections that i had more more to do with

222
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,560
directly

223
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,200
awesome and then just one more question

224
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,320
alex so that we can go back to our open

225
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,120
uh

226
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,720
list of topics

227
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,959
what would you characterize the big

228
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,839
question of the paper as what do you

229
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,560
think would bring somebody to this paper

230
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,880
because they were wondering x

231
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,720
yeah i mean so it's pretty i think it's

232
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,880
pretty clear in this in this case right

233
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,560
fortunately it's pretty easy it's just

234
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,160
the question is whether

235
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,839
uh

236
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,920
the active inference formalism uh

237
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,399
particularly a certain strain of that

238
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,959
that the sort of the street decision

239
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,959
uh decision

240
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,200
um model

241
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
uh flavor of active inference is

242
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,760
is consistent with or compatible with

243
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,720
um

244
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,959
folk psychology and the bdi model in

245
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,439
particular

246
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,240
great okay and then also what would you

247
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,080
characterize the bdi model as

248
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,800
and then we'll um open up for more

249
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,480
questions but just to get some of the

250
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,920
prerequisites and you're right that it

251
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,880
is um great that it is clear many papers

252
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,200
have much more esoteric big questions

253
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,440
and this one is very like down the

254
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,320
middle

255
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,080
yeah yeah one thing i liked about about

256
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,040
working with

257
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,880
with ryan is that he

258
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,399
he sort of wanted to just make the title

259
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,640
of a paper a declarative like sentence

260
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,920
that says

261
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,920
this is what we're claiming and i really

262
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,279
like that i'm going to try to follow

263
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,120
that so my own

264
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,920
work

265
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,480
um but the bdi model um i don't think i

266
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,000
have a whole lot to add here either it's

267
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,839
just the

268
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,200
idea fundamentally that beliefs and

269
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,920
desires interact to form intentions

270
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,279
and that that's uh

271
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,279
i would i guess maybe also that

272
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,440
that that's a legitimate way to explain

273
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,880
behavior

274
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,480
for some class of

275
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,720
systems intelligence systems people

276
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,120
agents

277
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:36,959
all right

278
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,720
awesome so

279
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,760
ali dean or duvet if you have any

280
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,680
uh questions you'd like to raise at this

281
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,839
time otherwise we'll go into one of

282
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:46,880
these

283
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,600
pieces we've raced yes stupid

284
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,760
it just uh i'd never heard of hilton or

285
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,079
the folk psychology

286
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,600
bdm model

287
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,480
um

288
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,760
is that

289
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,640
a prominent model you purposely chose or

290
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,760
could

291
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,519
this be uh

292
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,200
you'll fill in for basically any

293
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,079
non-scientific or introspective

294
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,240
or even duelist uh

295
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,079
model for uh

296
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,240
for consciousness or is it specific this

297
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,279
hilton

298
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,079
uh

299
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,360
model and

300
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,200
are you claiming that it fails

301
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,360
as a materialistic uh

302
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,760
model

303
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,519
um

304
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,200
yeah so i think i think part of the

305
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,360
reason we referred to the bdi model was

306
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,959
to just be

307
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,440
to sort of bracket for the purposes of

308
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,279
the paper although i'm happy to discuss

309
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,040
it here um

310
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,480
a lot of questions that might arise

311
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,560
about vocal psychology and what exactly

312
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,399
is meant by that so if we just say we're

313
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,440
talking about

314
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,440
the idea that beliefs and desires

315
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,600
interact to form intentions

316
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,560
then

317
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,800
that's a clear target and then of course

318
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,320
there are many different

319
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,120
conceptions of uh many maybe there are

320
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,680
many different folk psychologies and and

321
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,279
and um

322
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,800
views on

323
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,200
uh in that vicinity but like

324
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,680
uh i guess yeah the vdi uh

325
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,720
models is sort of maybe

326
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,639
supposed to be like an essence that you

327
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,200
can distill from many of those different

328
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,560
perspectives now maybe that's not true

329
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,399
we can talk about whether the bdi model

330
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,160
is really common to

331
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,120
different conceptions of folk psychology

332
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,519
because i i you know

333
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,519
i have to think about that i i kind of i

334
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,920
kind of assume that it is um i'm curious

335
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
about the the materialism dualism issue

336
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,040
i don't see

337
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,519
i guess directly how it plays into

338
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,880
things at this level of description

339
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,480
because um

340
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,079
i guess we're not claiming necessarily

341
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,160
that beliefs and desires are material or

342
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,279
not

343
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,639
uh

344
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,040
at this stage but anyway i'm happy to

345
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,800
get into that

346
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,760
yeah feel free to unpack that david

347
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,839
yeah i mean just classically uh you know

348
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,160
obviously people have had minds for

349
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,680
you know as long as human existence you

350
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,959
know maybe if you believe in julian

351
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,560
james and evolution

352
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,279
that there was an origin to a

353
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,040
consciousness in the mind

354
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,600
at some point but you know historically

355
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,480
uh

356
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,160
most of the western tradition up to a

357
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,760
few hundred years ago believe that these

358
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
things originated

359
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,440
from a non-material source you know

360
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,200
whether it's your soul however you want

361
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,560
to explain it

362
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,279
but you know is the controller from the

363
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,079
a greek model of the soul uh ethos uh

364
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,399
logos pathos or

365
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,399
um and any model

366
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,560
that you know so beliefs and desires

367
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,040
that that would be the controller

368
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,399
that would

369
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,800
be decisive in these uh cognitive

370
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,440
functions don't arise from the material

371
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,920
so if you have a materialistic model

372
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,760
where you're saying that these things do

373
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,880
in fact arise from the brain

374
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,480
you could say that uh you know the

375
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,880
ancients were just incorrect

376
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,920
either either in ascribing

377
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,480
non-material origins to things that have

378
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,240
material origins

379
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,839
or you could say they were completely

380
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,360
incorrect and like in a limited

381
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,600
perspective that there is no such thing

382
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,560
as belief or desire or there is no such

383
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,839
thing as a as like a unified

384
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,639
um eye so if you meant hilton has some

385
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,079
sort of material

386
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,000
division even freud like even even going

387
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,399
back to freud just 100 years ago

388
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,680
the question of the psyche and the

389
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,279
subconscious

390
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,560
you know whether that has material

391
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,199
origins or not is unclear

392
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,240
right

393
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,720
yeah so so i guess i guess my

394
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,320
perspective on this i'm sort of a

395
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,399
methodological materialist about these

396
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,680
things like

397
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,360
i think that you can

398
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,560
uh

399
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,519
insofar as so in terms like the scope of

400
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,519
this of this kind of explanation that we

401
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,040
discussed in this paper

402
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,800
and

403
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,399
active inference in general um

404
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,000
works with i think i think

405
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,800
any anything that you can explain about

406
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,079
the causes of of intelligent behavior

407
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,240
i think you can probably put a material

408
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,519
uh

409
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,639
gloss on that but i i'm not personally

410
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,639
i'm not really committed to the claim

411
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,079
that you can explain everything about

412
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,000
people

413
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,560
uh in terms of input output mappings you

414
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,120
know but but insofar as you can conceive

415
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,199
of some function whether cognition

416
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,199
perception whatever as a sort of input

417
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,839
output mapping in space of behavior then

418
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,240
i think you can explain it using

419
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,320
these frameworks interpreted as

420
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,680
descriptions of brain processes um

421
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,279
so it's interesting that you kind of

422
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,720
contrast

423
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,320
or you suggest that maybe there's an

424
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,240
argument for eliminativism

425
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,360
if

426
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,600
if you were thinking of

427
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,120
mental states as

428
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,279
having us a root or a source in

429
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,240
something non-material maybe then if you

430
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,079
reject that idea then you'd be prone to

431
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,480
limit eliminativism but um

432
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,000
so i'm very much

433
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,839
so coming back to the idea i'm i'm

434
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,279
starting from a sort of methodological

435
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,399
materialist standpoint but i'm

436
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,240
definitely not limited to this i

437
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,199
actually

438
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,639
the one thing i wanted to get into today

439
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,560
is i really don't understand

440
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,519
um

441
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,279
i don't understand

442
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,759
how eliminativism is a tenable position

443
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,360
with respect to folk psychology if

444
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,959
you're a materialist

445
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,440
um because i think that there's just

446
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,440
well i will i'll hold off on getting

447
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,440
into that but um

448
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,519
i think i guess i'll just just one last

449
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,040
comment on this i think the question of

450
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,720
whether beliefs and desires and

451
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,800
intentions and other mental states have

452
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,000
any non-material aspect and the question

453
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,279
of whether they exist and whether they

454
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,519
should be eliminated from ontology are

455
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,000
distinct

456
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,120
thank you i think this is a fine place

457
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,959
we'll have a lot of time to explore

458
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,199
other avenues but it would be awesome if

459
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,000
you could describe the limitivism

460
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,759
and also

461
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,480
um there was a quote in your paper where

462
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,440
it says

463
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,360
if the worry is founded that there's a

464
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,040
tension between active inference and

465
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,440
folk psychology specifically the bdi

466
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,399
model

467
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,399
it could be taken either to imply that

468
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,880
active inference models are implausible

469
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,880
because reasons

470
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,880
or

471
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,480
if and to the extent that the models are

472
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,400
successful to imply that desires should

473
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,640
be eliminated from scientific theories

474
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,839
of psychology so what is a limitivism

475
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,280
and how did you

476
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,480
interact with that topic

477
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,839
right so so eliminativism is uh as we're

478
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,919
using it here is and i think this is the

479
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,599
mainstream stance

480
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,959
is

481
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,799
is just the view well i guess okay the

482
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,559
most general version of the view with

483
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,960
respect to anything is just that

484
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,120
that that thing should be sort of

485
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,280
eliminated from serious discourse or

486
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,360
serious theory uh maybe scientific

487
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,559
theory

488
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,879
um

489
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,120
and i mean the

490
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,720
the

491
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,400
the idea that the church ones have in

492
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,799
defending elimination about

493
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,559
folk psychology is that it's it's like a

494
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,200
failed theory so basically the idea is

495
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,200
if you know theories i suppose um

496
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,960
survive on the basis of their predictive

497
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,480
and explanatory power

498
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,600
and

499
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,840
some other criteria you know theoretical

500
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,480
virtues the ability to evolve and

501
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,039
explain new anomalies apparent anomalies

502
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,559
that crop up so the churchlings

503
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,240
basically

504
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,480
think that uh full psychology has failed

505
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,760
this test

506
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,000
uh so the theory of folk psychology has

507
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,520
been falsified that we should just move

508
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,240
on

509
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,440
and that's

510
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,520
that's i i would say

511
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,559
you know to be sort of uh

512
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,000
precise that's that's a version of

513
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,240
eliminativism applied to

514
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,480
mental states um but that's the view

515
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,600
that we're really talking about here

516
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,439
okay yes david please

517
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,919
yeah i guess there i mean there's

518
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,160
different schools in in elimination but

519
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,520
uh if you want to take that to

520
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,480
consciousness studies in totality

521
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,559
or questions of free will or you know i

522
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,240
can mention the ancient dualistic

523
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,200
understanding of uh

524
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,480
consciousness

525
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,080
is you could take elimination to

526
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,799
consciousness in totality that the the

527
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,120
man is a mechanistic

528
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,600
computer and even

529
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,160
you know as a mystic i would argue

530
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,600
possibly against the strong

531
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,280
interpretation of active inference

532
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,559
that's a

533
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,200
atheistic elimination model and you

534
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,160
might

535
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,080
not you know for philosophical reasons

536
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,240
not want to be eliminativists

537
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,880
and therefore try to defend it uh but uh

538
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,160
then you know what are the mathematics

539
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,520
what are your claims

540
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,440
actually say uh but yeah i mean the

541
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,320
strong levels say that uh there is no

542
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,240
uh there is no belief there is no desire

543
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,880
there is no unified eye

544
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,840
and we're just a automaton that uh

545
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,600
uh has some sort of threshold

546
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,880
interaction

547
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,400
with the environment

548
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,240
and whatever

549
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,840
perception are ahead

550
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,000
that you know we have voices in our head

551
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,840
that might make us think that we're

552
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,760
conscious beings might make us think

553
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,240
that we have self-control

554
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,880
or you know beliefs or even free will

555
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,960
are essentially illusions of the mind

556
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,039
that have nothing to do uh with our

557
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,039
actions

558
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,520
i could just

559
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,960
how do i do follow-up

560
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,480
authors

561
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,280
well

562
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,039
great um

563
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,360
yeah i would just it's a good question

564
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,600
how consciousness fits into this picture

565
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,760
and i i'm not sure whether whether the

566
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
version of eliminativism that i took

567
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,240
myself to be targeting here includes

568
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,640
consciousness or not it's mostly been a

569
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,200
view that's focused on the idea of

570
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,880
discrete mental states that play these

571
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,400
functional roles beliefs and desires and

572
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,360
so forth

573
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,360
so um yeah i definitely think there's

574
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,199
further questions about that um

575
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,360
and i can see

576
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,840
yeah i can see how you might interpret

577
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,120
active inference not just active

578
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,440
inference but almost any mainstream sort

579
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,240
of

580
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,600
um

581
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
you know theory and like neuro

582
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,200
psychology and that vein as as

583
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,880
implying a form of eliminativism if you

584
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,400
think that these mental states aren't

585
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,000
are

586
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,600
by definition

587
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,039
um not

588
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,679
material or not entirely material but

589
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,360
again i'm happy to get into that further

590
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,039
yes um

591
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,200
the uh

592
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,400
the idea that

593
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,720
any kind of modeling

594
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,360
by making it specific

595
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,520
is approaching or on the road or

596
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,760
slippery slope or already reached the

597
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,600
point of eliminating the need for

598
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,320
appeals outside of that description it's

599
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,880
also possible to consider that an entire

600
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,200
category error and say

601
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,520
we're describing

602
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,440
brain processes which is i believe what

603
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,280
you said earlier and no description of a

604
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,960
sunset

605
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,679
is the territory of the sunset math is

606
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,760
not the territory as we hear

607
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,880
often

608
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,799
and so how can one be eliminativist

609
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,760
about

610
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,679
a process

611
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,280
with any kind of description

612
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,480
whether it's predictive processing or

613
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
active inference or

614
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,240
any other kind of

615
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,240
model

616
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,440
um

617
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,919
yeah i raised my raise my hand here um

618
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,360
i'll just raise my actual hand um

619
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,039
yeah i mean another thing i

620
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,039
consistently just said that i should

621
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,280
bring up here is that uh

622
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,799
i mean strictly speaking i suppose

623
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,400
active inference isn't committed to

624
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,919
these being

625
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,600
directly descriptions of brain processes

626
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,960
they're right they're sort of

627
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,960
computational models of decision-making

628
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,440
processes with beliefs and all that and

629
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,440
of course if you take the there's this

630
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,720
whole background of the free energy

631
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,159
principle and all that that links this

632
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,640
to physics and the physic the physical

633
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,200
nature of systems uh and i tend to read

634
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,039
these models as pretty transparently

635
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,480
mapping onto brain processes but

636
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,840
it's not

637
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,679
necessarily the case that that you need

638
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,000
to be committed to that interpretation

639
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,039
of these processes as material processes

640
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,919
when you use active inference

641
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,840
to describe some system at the

642
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,000
psychological level

643
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,120
and there's of course still a lot of

644
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,480
question about how the psychological

645
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,320
description maps on to the physical

646
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,919
description which i have views about but

647
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,520
it's an open question

648
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,919
awesome uh dean and then ali

649
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,000
so in the paper itself on page seven i

650
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,520
think there's a paragraph that kind of

651
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,679
refers to all of this that we've been

652
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,520
talking about i'll just quote it the

653
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,960
relationship between conscious and

654
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,159
unconscious

655
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,600
computation

656
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,120
therefore remains an open question

657
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,280
that said some specific dai models have

658
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,799
been used to describe higher level

659
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,200
cognitive processes that can generate

660
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,960
conscious beliefs and verbal reports and

661
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,520
then it says who the authors are in

662
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,600
these cases the inferential prediction

663
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
error minimization process

664
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,760
can still be seen as subpersonal or

665
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,080
unconscious but the resulting beliefs

666
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,760
and decisions themselves are assumed to

667
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,120
enter awareness

668
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,440
as a general rule however some personal

669
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,640
processes

670
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,919
in dai should not be expected to map

671
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,480
one-to-one with consciously accessible

672
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,159
or personal level processes

673
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,320
great so i've i've copied that up on the

674
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,000
slides and dean what do you think that

675
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,679
spoke to or what made you want to share

676
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,559
that

677
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,640
i just think i think i think the first

678
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,799
author and the and the other authors

679
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,640
were essentially saying

680
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,480
let's make sure that we don't

681
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,640
try to conflate things here that we we

682
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,600
focus in on what we're trying to do here

683
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,120
which is point to

684
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,720
the potential of

685
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,559
these formalisms

686
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,720
explaining something if a person can

687
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,039
self-report if they can't there's still

688
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,279
aspects of this that might apply but i

689
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,600
think i think they were just trying to

690
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,679
clarify exactly what they were pointing

691
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,039
to and not

692
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,360
pointing to

693
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,520
and ryan smith

694
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,799
has made

695
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,799
clearly a line of research as well as

696
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,080
multiple

697
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,799
live streams and exhortations on social

698
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,520
media about this distinction that one

699
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,320
can take a cognitive modeling approach

700
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,640
of report behavior

701
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,640
did you see that or not

702
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,440
and that can be very clearly although

703
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,720
subtly distinguished from the actual

704
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,440
awareness of seeing something it's not

705
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,919
the same thing to have report

706
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,799
um behavior as it is to have the

707
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,200
experiential underpinning

708
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,080
they're

709
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,919
potentially adjacent to questions or

710
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,320
there's a space that they're linked in a

711
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,279
meaningful way but it's quite possible

712
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,880
to blanket

713
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,919
literally

714
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,520
one's uncertainty

715
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,480
about the question of experience even in

716
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,520
a visual or multimodal way

717
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,760
from the question of well let's just say

718
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,200
we had

719
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,320
the

720
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,360
animal

721
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,159
or the computer program in the chair

722
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,919
and now we're making a cognitive model

723
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,840
of its report behavior

724
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,799
different question than can the report

725
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,679
behavior model be one of the same

726
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,000
as what is actually happening because

727
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,760
there could be an inter leaving stage

728
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,720
where they just choose to lie or other

729
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,080
all these other kinds of interesting

730
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,679
things happening

731
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,000
ali

732
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,840
uh yeah and just as a brief side note i

733
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,559
think uh the the term poke psychology

734
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,600
here can also be related to uh the

735
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,240
distinction made by uh wilfred sellers

736
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,559
between manifest image and the

737
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,880
scientific image of human beings and the

738
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,440
manifest image being our understanding

739
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,840
of ourselves are as personal and social

740
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,120
beings and obviously the scientific

741
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,159
image speaks for self so i think the

742
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,080
term folk psychology

743
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,240
can possibly be

744
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,559
equivalent to

745
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,720
this manifest image of ourselves and um

746
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,600
yeah

747
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,279
that's just a side note

748
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,240
i wanted to share

749
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,640
how do you see that alex

750
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,200
yeah i think i mean i i'd almost agree i

751
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,400
would just say maybe

752
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,320
i don't i don't think i would say full

753
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,240
psychology is equivalent to the manifest

754
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,080
image but i think it might be a part of

755
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,120
it which is probably nitpicking but

756
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,360
there just might be more to the manifest

757
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,360
image of ourselves than just

758
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,720
psychology but

759
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,840
anyway i basically agree

760
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,880
yes the the question yeah dean anything

761
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,320
you want to

762
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,520
bring here

763
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,840
no

764
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,039
this reminds me of with

765
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,559
the conversations we've had on

766
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,039
linguistics how there's one view on

767
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,399
language

768
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,520
as a entity like out there body of

769
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,440
knowledge and then there's also the

770
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,840
person's

771
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,480
self-constructed

772
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,640
sense of

773
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,240
language

774
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,480
and they only have a partial subset of

775
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,159
the words or they use them in a certain

776
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,360
way

777
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,760
and there's an analogous

778
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,440
distinction where

779
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,279
there's folk psychology

780
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,960
the academic field of

781
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,559
versus people's inner sense and how do

782
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,200
people generate their inner sense of

783
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,159
manifest image if if that's appropriate

784
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,600
and how can that be

785
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,279
connected and mapped to

786
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,279
again any descriptive model or

787
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,360
disciplinary or transdisciplinary model

788
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,000
on alex and then do it

789
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,159
yeah so so i really should take the

790
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,919
opportunity to say that my my conception

791
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,159
of how folk psychology works is like

792
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,120
thoroughly sellers celerzian it's like

793
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,440
i think he got exactly right so

794
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,960
basically and it's been a long time

795
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,640
since i've tried to recite this but

796
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,559
basically just

797
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,679
um

798
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,799
the idea that there's sort of uh

799
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,360
verbal behavior right that people enact

800
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,039
and engage engage in

801
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,000
that we end up sort of associating with

802
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,600
um other things that are going on

803
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,520
internally and that

804
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,520
through this sort of uh process we end

805
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,000
up sort of inadvertently in the course

806
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,520
of evolutionary history at some point

807
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,880
there's this whole

808
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,640
uh silasian myth about this stuff but

809
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,600
basically

810
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,919
the idea is that folk psychology sort of

811
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,559
arises and introspection things like

812
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,159
that um

813
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,440
and i may be putting a bit more into

814
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,559
sellers than he actually says right now

815
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,080
again it's been a while but basically

816
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,679
the idea that introspection and our

817
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,039
sense of self-awareness and stuff like

818
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,600
that uh sort of

819
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,720
could have developed out of first

820
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,720
um outward behavior

821
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,159
right and then we sort of

822
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,840
become sensitive to correlations among

823
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,760
these outward signals and that develops

824
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,799
sort of an inner sense uh in that way so

825
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,880
um but the idea that the fundamental

826
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,799
idea that's relevant to this discussion

827
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,559
this paper i think is that folk

828
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,159
psychology

829
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,640
is just the name for this this sort of

830
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,919
thing that

831
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,000
naturally developed in the course of

832
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,159
human history i gotta say of course

833
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,000
there isn't just one folk psychology

834
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,080
right there um for one thing people

835
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,399
speak different languages but i do think

836
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,720
the the piece of it that i think is is

837
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,399
pretty

838
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,559
pretty safe to say is true or i i think

839
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,320
and that we meant to capture

840
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,080
this was my take on why we were using

841
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,240
the bdi model is that

842
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,880
i mean pretty much anyone uh this isn't

843
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,559
entirely true there are different you

844
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,559
know um dialects and things but

845
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,080
basically

846
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,520
if you want to understand why somebody

847
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,880
did something you can say oh they

848
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,440
believed x and they wanted y

849
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,279
right and they intended

850
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,159
z

851
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,480
and uh that that's the level at which i

852
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,799
i mean to um

853
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,279
sort of endorse full psychology is just

854
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,960
i don't see how

855
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,760
that sort of psychological

856
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,519
and i gotta say it's not for me my

857
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,640
motivation

858
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,159
for

859
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,440
sort of wanting to defense defensively

860
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,519
psychology isn't really anything to do

861
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,240
with

862
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,480
introspection or consciousness it's just

863
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,960
we obviously use these these terms to

864
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,399
explain behavior and we do it very

865
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,320
successfully and so i don't i don't

866
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,840
think it could be the case that these

867
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,080
terms fail to carry information about

868
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,919
the states that people are in

869
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:20,720
so

870
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
you know uh

871
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,559
i don't this is why i don't quite get

872
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,799
the limit to this argument

873
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,000
um

874
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,159
anyway that's gone a bit far our field

875
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,279
before we started

876
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,399
david and then anyone else

877
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,440
um

878
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,279
yeah well i think i mean

879
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,799
as a

880
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,120
say a spiritualist the limiting argument

881
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,519
is saying that's the natural conclusion

882
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,279
of what you're saying in your drawing

883
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,440
from the dualistic tradition

884
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,080
when you use these terminologies so you

885
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,559
know say that all of the thousands of

886
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,640
years of western tradition that believed

887
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,519
in

888
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,679
the soul and then you want to borrow the

889
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,159
terminology from a materialistic point

890
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,159
of view it may not be uh

891
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,679
be accurate and follow the evidence and

892
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,240
think uh you know jerry fodor

893
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,320
and the modular mind or benjamin

894
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,559
liebet's experiments

895
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,200
that uh you know what is active

896
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,640
inference actually saying it's a

897
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,919
threshold

898
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,440
that is reached

899
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,240
that uh causes activity in you know like

900
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,080
leave its famous experiments where uh uh

901
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,840
the threshold is reached and it could be

902
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,360
measured in the brain

903
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,559
before the

904
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,559
you'll call the active conscious part of

905
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,960
the person recognizes it and if it was

906
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,080
like a modular mind uh

907
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,559
that you have multiple conflicting

908
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,360
uh

909
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,000
parts of the person that could have

910
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,399
beliefs and motivation but what we would

911
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:47,679
call

912
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,760
the you know the module of the mind that

913
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,320
creates the narrative for us is only one

914
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,159
of those and that's just what active to

915
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,480
the person so when i interact with

916
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,559
myself or you interact with another

917
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,440
person through language you only have

918
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,679
access to that one part of the brain

919
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,360
that creates a narrative but you know

920
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,279
said the leave it's experiments

921
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,559
uh

922
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,960
and you know a few a few you know more

923
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,200
recent experience has demonstrated that

924
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,120
uh that's not likely the part that

925
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,640
controls action

926
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,799
and uh your active inference didn't

927
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,600
exist then i mean bayesian mechanics did

928
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,840
but you're saying it's it's a threshold

929
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,519
and there's all sorts

930
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,600
of uh things that cause a person's

931
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,440
threshold to be reached

932
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,519
and uh active inference could

933
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,720
potentially

934
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,799
uh model that and then if you you know

935
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,080
even you put in your paper that you

936
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,640
could include things like

937
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,559
you know if you want to call beliefs or

938
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,200
desires as higher order rules so even at

939
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,760
the point there may not be a mechanistic

940
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,760
understanding of what's the origin or

941
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,559
how these higher order rules operate but

942
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,799
it would be some sort of uh

943
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,120
um your free energy principle some sort

944
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,919
of uh mathematical reduction of a

945
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,600
threshold being reached

946
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,799
where the sum totality of the conscious

947
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,840
and subconscious factors

948
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,239
cause the action and even the person

949
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,239
ourselves through introspection isn't

950
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,598
gonna have full access to that

951
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,280
um

952
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,599
if i can just respond here um

953
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,918
i think first of all just to be

954
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,839
respectful to my co-authors i should say

955
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,359
because i might get into my own views

956
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:24,879
here which they don't necessarily share

957
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,119
that's all but um i should say i think

958
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,599
this paper is really targeted at

959
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,040
explaining

960
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,960
the connections potentially

961
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,320
or clarifying the connections between

962
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,079
folk psychology

963
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:36,879
i think

964
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,960
whatever it's whatever its implications

965
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,119
right even whether whether folk

966
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,320
psychology

967
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,960
carries implications of soul type

968
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,119
things because of its roots maybe it

969
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,960
does but anyway it's it's trying to

970
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,760
clarify the connections between

971
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,520
active inference as just as sort of a

972
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,199
formal theory of decision making and

973
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,800
folk psychology

974
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,920
um

975
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,680
i don't

976
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,400
uh so anyway it's it's neutral

977
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,760
technically on the issue of whether

978
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,440
active inference is

979
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,320
true

980
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,640
or is an exhaustive exhaustive or true

981
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,480
description of

982
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,480
what we are and what we do

983
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,800
um

984
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,240
now maybe there's still an issue there

985
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,599
if you really think that folks

986
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,200
psychology

987
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,440
that the terms very terms of folk

988
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,160
psychology carry dualistic implications

989
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,920
and if you and if you think that active

990
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,960
inference

991
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,880
carries materialistic implications then

992
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,040
there's still a problem i guess

993
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,680
um i guess i'm

994
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,720
i don't i don't really know if i if i

995
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,160
agree with either of those but um

996
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,160
yeah i mean i i

997
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,079
i don't i guess i don't see how

998
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,599
um

999
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,760
the

1000
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,320
i don't see how active inference as such

1001
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,320
implies anything one way or the other

1002
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,079
the other about

1003
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,280
whether there are

1004
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,839
um

1005
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,440
non-material

1006
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,880
origins to

1007
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,640
to behavior

1008
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,760
um

1009
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,960
it's it

1010
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,520
i guess okay i i can see let me try this

1011
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,760
see if i can i'm just trying to see if i

1012
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,560
get your argument david so it's like

1013
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,240
we're saying that active inference or

1014
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,920
let's say active inference as a

1015
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,359
framework says that this is how

1016
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,920
decisions happen you do a

1017
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,680
search over policies which are these

1018
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,880
discrete

1019
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,720
things and you figure out the expected

1020
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,920
free energy which has to do with

1021
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,119
comparing

1022
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,599
sensory data to expected sensory data

1023
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,200
and i guess if you think you think all

1024
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,160
of those

1025
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,599
components are

1026
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,119
pieces of a material thing right

1027
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,119
they're all beliefs or desires or

1028
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,320
something like that

1029
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,560
which you take to be

1030
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,720
i mean

1031
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,720
actually i think i can answer sorry i

1032
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,079
realize i'm this i'm not doing the best

1033
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,359
job of this right now but at least i'm

1034
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,440
getting this is difficult it's i'm glad

1035
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,480
you're bringing this stuff up because

1036
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,560
this is actually this gets quite

1037
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,839
challenging um but i think uh

1038
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,280
so so active inference is this theory of

1039
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,640
of um well dai is this theory of of

1040
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,480
discrete decision making

1041
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,079
that appeals to this

1042
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,359
you know to these

1043
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:22,480
um

1044
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,320
distributions or things that are like

1045
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,079
belief distribution of distributions

1046
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,119
right a belief distribution and a desire

1047
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,200
or a preference distribution

1048
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,320
um

1049
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,079
i don't think it says anything about

1050
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,599
where the preference distribution comes

1051
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,119
from and in particular i don't think it

1052
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,079
says

1053
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,040
um

1054
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,440
that it doesn't come from the soul or

1055
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,200
you know or some

1056
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,960
some deeper thing so that's that

1057
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,960
switched from me trying to

1058
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,040
rationally reconstruct your argument to

1059
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,280
me trying to rebut it sorry about that

1060
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,880
but i'm just trying to make some

1061
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,800
progress

1062
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
let me try to walk through some of these

1063
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,480
steps because i agree it's an important

1064
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,480
distinction so

1065
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,200
the focus of the paper the regime of

1066
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,400
attention of the paper very clearly

1067
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,440
written to remain on a line because

1068
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,680
there's many open threads related to for

1069
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,599
example different cultural folk

1070
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,920
psychologies various folk psychology

1071
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,960
models

1072
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,760
various metaphysical claims the paper

1073
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,640
was focused on identifying

1074
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,560
one possible area of incompatibility

1075
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,880
which would be the relationship between

1076
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,480
the bdi model

1077
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,760
entities the nodes in the bdi graph

1078
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,599
and

1079
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,680
assignments of terms for specific

1080
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,400
parts of the active formalism

1081
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,359
and identifying that will come back too

1082
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,000
now then

1083
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,560
as what has been pointed out today

1084
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,160
one could ask

1085
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,440
if folk psychology carries

1086
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,720
a duelist

1087
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,240
implication

1088
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,680
in the sense of there being material and

1089
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,760
non-material types of things

1090
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,000
whether implicitly

1091
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
or axiomatically or historically but if

1092
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,920
folk psychology has a dualist

1093
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,680
implication

1094
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,640
and

1095
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,480
active inference carries a purely

1096
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,200
materialist implication

1097
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,839
implicitly or explicitly then there

1098
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,599
could be another

1099
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,359
like battlefront

1100
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:24,640
of tension

1101
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,880
which would not be based around mapping

1102
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,839
the nodes in the bdi model to the nodes

1103
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,720
or the formalisms in the actin formalism

1104
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,119
which is like a theory theory ontology

1105
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,560
map question but this would actually be

1106
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,560
a metaphysical

1107
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,280
incompatibility and then

1108
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,440
alex you walked through some steps that

1109
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,440
said if active inference is a framework

1110
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,200
that says

1111
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,800
this is going to be a model of how

1112
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,800
decisions happen

1113
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,839
there's a search over discrete policies

1114
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:58,000
there's the calculation of variational

1115
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,320
free energy and or expected free energy

1116
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,040
and then you added as part of a material

1117
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,960
thing

1118
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,319
then

1119
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,480
it is going to be incompatible with

1120
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,480
anything in material

1121
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,680
however one could also simply say active

1122
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,440
is a descriptive framework saying here's

1123
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,000
how i will model how decisions happen

1124
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,720
as a search over discrete policies and

1125
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,280
as the calculation of fe

1126
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,079
then there might be one two three four

1127
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,079
kinds of things in the universe

1128
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,760
or it could be anything

1129
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,640
but this is where the materialism enters

1130
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,119
is actually as a clause

1131
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,200
in the assumptions

1132
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,720
of that string

1133
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,040
rather than materialism arising as a

1134
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,000
consequence of the neutral descriptive

1135
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,480
formal basis of the framework what do

1136
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
you think about that alex

1137
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,760
yeah thanks

1138
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,839
thanks daniel for articulating that so

1139
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,119
well um

1140
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,480
i think that's

1141
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,560
uh basically right and just as a

1142
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,960
specific example um

1143
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,040
even if you even if you go so far as to

1144
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,960
think that you can map this formula as

1145
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,319
some formalism onto brain states

1146
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:09,520
you don't have to think that brain

1147
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,599
states get their

1148
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,280
uh

1149
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,680
status as desires or beliefs just from

1150
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,400
their material constitution right you

1151
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,200
could

1152
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,040
if you believe that free will arises in

1153
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,760
microtubules for example or something i

1154
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,200
don't know how that works that theory by

1155
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,319
the way i don't mean to disparage it

1156
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,359
either i just i don't know how it works

1157
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,599
but i'm using it as an example um maybe

1158
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,200
you think that free will kind of somehow

1159
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,880
bubbles up through this

1160
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,560
uh free will at smaller scales or

1161
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,400
something right so i just don't think

1162
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,680
that even if we take this as a

1163
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,800
description of the brain that we're

1164
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,319
committed to

1165
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:43,680
anything so heavy as materialism

1166
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,799
thanks alex david

1167
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,400
yeah i i appreciate your research i'm

1168
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,599
not here to like debate uh dualism here

1169
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,440
i just think that uh if we could

1170
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,079
recognize what are the assumptions

1171
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:58,960
or

1172
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,200
axioms so you have questions

1173
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,839
and that's why i like your focus on on

1174
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:04,640
uh

1175
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,560
motor control connected to sense

1176
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,680
perception

1177
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,240
so if there's uh your perception of a

1178
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,760
unified eye

1179
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,119
and even you know like daniel in his

1180
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,680
research on ants or something like that

1181
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,560
that uh okay there's you know david alex

1182
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,760
uh

1183
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,240
you know daniel all the panels to

1184
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,599
ali and dean

1185
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,440
uh that that are talking to each other

1186
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,480
we might refer to ourselves as a name

1187
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,800
but is there a unified eye

1188
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,119
and you know so okay that's an axiom

1189
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,040
that is based on a dualistic tradition

1190
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,280
that may or may not be accurate and if

1191
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,520
you say well there's a sum total

1192
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,440
of forces that are limited through the

1193
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,920
free energy principle that we refer to

1194
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,640
as unified eye that makes decisions

1195
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,280
but that's more a lexical misnomer and

1196
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,760
even if you think daniel's uh research

1197
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,240
and answer something like that that a

1198
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,040
question like is there a unified ant

1199
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,440
that avoids death that tries to survive

1200
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,880
why does the ant

1201
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,200
have some sort of will to live if i

1202
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,200
argue that that's also non-materialistic

1203
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,319
the ants

1204
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,800
will to live or that there's a unified

1205
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,079
force

1206
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,000
so i mean you could have a materialistic

1207
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,400
explanation like higher order rules and

1208
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,079
just leave it that i believe that these

1209
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,520
higher order rules stem from genetics or

1210
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,200
some sort of uh

1211
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,839
uh you know parallel what i call ant uh

1212
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:24,839
reverse

1213
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:26,880
anthropomorphization of machine learning

1214
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,119
where an ant has some sort of will to

1215
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,359
survive and therefore you know if you

1216
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,200
try to step on an ant it's going to move

1217
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,359
the other direction or something like

1218
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,079
that but is there actually unified force

1219
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,480
in the ant that is uh

1220
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,040
telling it to survive that causes it to

1221
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,920
act in a unified way or is it just uh

1222
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,359
you know the free energy principle and a

1223
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,160
reduction of all of the various uh sense

1224
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,359
perceptions

1225
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,720
and uh and and uh you know so we are

1226
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,280
using these axioms from a dualistic

1227
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,000
uh

1228
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
perspective you know like specifically

1229
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,839
or called the unified eye

1230
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,839
uh that makes more sense as a

1231
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,560
non-material force that chooses the eye

1232
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,200
that's not my body chooses to make this

1233
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,319
action

1234
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,079
um and so if active inference is saying

1235
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:15,280
no it's a sum total of sense perception

1236
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,280
some sort of higher order rules that are

1237
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,680
acquired through a combination of uh

1238
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,960
genetics and

1239
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,160
other

1240
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,880
you know machine like processes

1241
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,319
that uh

1242
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,359
that we use the language description as

1243
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:34,160
i

1244
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,000
but uh you know the mathematics is

1245
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,440
really saying that's not really accurate

1246
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,319
and alex to you and i'll also just

1247
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:43,680
recall

1248
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,440
way back when

1249
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,520
in 2222

1250
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,200
when we discussed your paper

1251
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,760
psychophysical identity and free energy

1252
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,760
which very

1253
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,160
directly tackles this question of

1254
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,440
identity materialism physicalism various

1255
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,359
other processes just want to drop that

1256
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:02,240
note

1257
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,520
and feel free to reply that

1258
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,440
yeah that's great um yeah yeah the

1259
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,800
reason i get so excited about this stuff

1260
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,640
is that i i care about it and i

1261
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,839
definitely

1262
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,000
don't take like a sort of

1263
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,599
default materialist position on this

1264
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,280
stuff um

1265
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,839
so i guess i mean overall david like my

1266
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,720
my view here is sort of

1267
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,200
about this self and uh you know the self

1268
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,880
and the self with the capital s maybe in

1269
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,640
some like you know buddhist type

1270
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,440
traditions i'm actually a fairly

1271
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,800
um

1272
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,319
far on the on the mystical end of the

1273
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,880
spectrum myself and and for that reason

1274
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,960
i don't expect no i'm sorry this is

1275
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,640
maybe not addressing what you said in

1276
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,319
all its nuance but basically

1277
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,720
the gist of how i see this is

1278
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,400
you shouldn't expect that thing the

1279
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,680
really special thing that we don't want

1280
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,680
to eliminate you shouldn't expect it to

1281
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,920
show up in our descriptions of things

1282
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,520
because you can't describe it anyway

1283
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,119
it's transcendent

1284
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,119
so uh you know

1285
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,119
even if the brain is identical with the

1286
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,280
mind insofar as we can describe the mind

1287
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,800
the mind isn't identical with the mind

1288
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,480
and so far as we can describe the mind

1289
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,400
right it's the it's the thing it's the

1290
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,400
big self that we can't ever pin down

1291
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,440
with words

1292
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,280
um and actually out of respect for that

1293
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,560
thing um

1294
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,040
i am happy for not to show up in

1295
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,640
the descriptions that we give of how

1296
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,480
this how the material stuff works or

1297
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,319
even how how anything works right

1298
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,240
because insofar as you can reduce it to

1299
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,520
a description it's not that thing

1300
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:29,280
thanks alex and and to kind of add some

1301
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,440
thoughts there um

1302
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,319
the paper clearly delineates two

1303
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,640
variants or applications of the active

1304
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,760
inference formalism which is mai motor

1305
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,200
active inference and dai decision active

1306
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,319
inference and the the two theories

1307
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,920
differ in

1308
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,760
at least two important ways

1309
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,160
uh or two two these two applications of

1310
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,440
the frameworks differ in at least two

1311
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,440
important ways the first is the

1312
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,400
phenomena

1313
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,200
that they are targeting to describe

1314
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,960
whether discrete decision-making and

1315
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,839
planning behavior or whether motor

1316
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,040
behavior

1317
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,319
and then there's the question of

1318
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:08,880
discrete and continuous modeling and so

1319
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,280
for reasons of biology and historical

1320
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,000
precedent the motor models have come

1321
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,280
from the continuous category

1322
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,079
while many of the decision-making models

1323
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:21,839
which often map onto things that are

1324
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,640
legitimately categorical in the world

1325
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,079
like a team maze

1326
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,720
or a planning or sentence generation

1327
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,680
task

1328
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,920
has a discreteness or a categoricalness

1329
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,599
to its basis

1330
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:34,640
and

1331
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,480
that made me think about linear

1332
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,400
regression as i really like to think

1333
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,160
about because

1334
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,319
in the history of linear regressions no

1335
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:45,040
one said you used a linear regression to

1336
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,800
model the stimuli intensity and the

1337
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,960
behavioral response so you think people

1338
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,559
are a linear regression

1339
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,640
and this is another mathematical

1340
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,079
formalism

1341
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,640
that in some ways although i'm happy to

1342
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,640
also update my model on this

1343
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,000
is

1344
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
able to be interpreted but not the only

1345
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,079
interpretation as having an equal

1346
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,400
epistemic claim to the territory

1347
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,240
as a linear model because they're

1348
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,359
formalisms and the least squares error

1349
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:14,160
in a linear aggression that which fits

1350
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,839
which is not the only norm one could

1351
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:18,079
choose but whatever function is used as

1352
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:19,520
the imperative to fit that linear

1353
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,640
regression

1354
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,400
could be playing an analogous role to

1355
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,480
like the calculation of variational free

1356
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,800
energy it could be purely understood as

1357
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,440
a modeling heuristic that's used to make

1358
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,599
statistical comparisons

1359
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,599
within a model

1360
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:34,480
and then

1361
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,960
also the linear regression framework can

1362
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,880
be used to make discrete decisions like

1363
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,960
break point regression where you can

1364
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,280
contrast two different alternative

1365
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,760
models and you can say

1366
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,319
is it more consistent with one

1367
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,559
regression or is it possible that

1368
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,040
there's some break point a two parameter

1369
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,200
model that we're going to identify and

1370
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:55,920
so

1371
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,599
i try to always be

1372
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,920
thinking like we're on the freeway and

1373
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,359
here's the action framework and here's

1374
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:03,359
the linear regression framework and if

1375
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:04,800
there's going to be some claim about

1376
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,160
active inference or free energy

1377
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,559
principle at all

1378
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,880
about what the formalism means

1379
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,880
i always like jumping from car to car

1380
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,200
and thinking would people or do they or

1381
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,640
have they said that about linear

1382
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,839
aggression

1383
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,400
and if they can't there better be a good

1384
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,400
reason why they can't for example people

1385
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,000
who are committed to taking an

1386
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,440
interpretation

1387
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,680
of the territory based upon anything of

1388
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,839
the active

1389
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:31,520
map do they think that that is something

1390
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,760
that's true of all different statistical

1391
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,760
modeling frameworks and they'd apply

1392
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,760
that to a linear aggression

1393
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,319
or is there something different in the

1394
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,559
active inference formalisms that

1395
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:46,160
legitimize or warrant that kind of a

1396
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,040
interpretation beyond the linear

1397
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,319
regression

1398
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,240
that was the first point and then the

1399
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,079
second point was about

1400
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,040
alex very beautifully said with like not

1401
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,280
expecting the transcendence

1402
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,280
and that which cannot

1403
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,079
um be named or however we want to think

1404
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,800
about that space to appear in the

1405
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,319
imminent and in the specific

1406
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,319
realizations

1407
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,000
i think it's very important that the

1408
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,760
axioms are

1409
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,960
stated

1410
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,160
in

1411
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,599
self-contained scientific argumentation

1412
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,599
and rhetoric

1413
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,040
although

1414
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,920
unstated axioms come in at least two

1415
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,960
types

1416
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,440
one are the secret axioms that you made

1417
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,960
and snuck in

1418
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,440
like we didn't mention this issue but

1419
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,119
we're going to use it as if it was an

1420
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,280
axiom in in our deployment of a broader

1421
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,720
argument later in section 9.

1422
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,160
alternatively

1423
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,440
an issue might not be addressed

1424
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,240
because the argument is agnostic or

1425
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,800
orthogonal or blanketed with respect to

1426
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,240
that axiom

1427
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,240
like you didn't mention what color shirt

1428
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,720
you're wearing because

1429
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,720
not you're going to use it

1430
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,119
and slip it into the argument later but

1431
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,480
rather that the argument being made is

1432
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,200
uncorrelated or is not related to the

1433
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,480
shirt color

1434
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,440
so

1435
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,440
i think that the

1436
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,880
um potentially even aware

1437
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,839
avoidance of the metaphysical

1438
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:19,440
baggage

1439
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,800
precursor

1440
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,520
exploration in this paper

1441
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,440
is not to say that the issues are

1442
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,480
unimportant as various other work by all

1443
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,040
the authors actually speaks to

1444
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,160
but rather that this can be understood

1445
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,640
as a specific sequence

1446
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,000
of thoughts and rhetoric and symbols

1447
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,319
that update belief

1448
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:45,200
on the relatively narrow although still

1449
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,040
quite broad question

1450
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,400
of whether the concepts categories of b

1451
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,839
d and i

1452
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,960
can map to aspects of

1453
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,800
the active framework just like the

1454
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,440
linear regression slope could be mapped

1455
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,720
on to the concept influence of x on y

1456
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,480
not that that still wouldn't have some

1457
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,160
ability to be critiqued in the future or

1458
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,319
nuanced by future modeling but

1459
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,400
you could just say the linear regression

1460
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,079
model is not inconsistent does not

1461
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:15,520
contradict

1462
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,839
not that it proves but it does not

1463
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:20,400
contradict

1464
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,040
folk regressionology

1465
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,880
so active inference models do not

1466
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,880
contradict folk psychology

1467
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,280
linear aggression models do not

1468
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,599
contradict or negate folk causal

1469
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,359
inference

1470
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,359
anything that's going to break beyond

1471
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,680
that epistemic map

1472
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,160
is going to need to make a special case

1473
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,520
beyond

1474
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,599
people have interpreted this way or

1475
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:44,800
somebody who wasn't paying attention

1476
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,880
might make the mistake of believing x

1477
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,119
so sorry for the extended piece there

1478
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,559
but i think there's so many important

1479
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,040
aspects that this paper like either

1480
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,800
guides us on

1481
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,800
and also takes us

1482
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,760
to a vista of

1483
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,079
dean

1484
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,720
i'm not going to be able to articulate

1485
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,559
it as clearly as you just did but here's

1486
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,000
my thing so coming at the paper

1487
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,359
with

1488
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:14,559
my background my question ended up being

1489
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,000
so if we're going to compare something

1490
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,559
that adds two things up a belief

1491
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:21,200
and a desire and out pops and an

1492
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,800
intention

1493
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,160
and then last week with alex on or with

1494
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,880
sorry alex with ryan on here

1495
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,119
we started moving to the idea that with

1496
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:33,200
expected free energy

1497
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,800
the the ability to see the discrete the

1498
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,119
difference between the ambiguous

1499
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,480
and the risk

1500
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,359
was a difference so it's not an i'm not

1501
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:44,800
an adding up

1502
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,800
to come to some conclusion it was an

1503
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,720
actual knowing

1504
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,000
that

1505
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,760
we want to try to move things that are

1506
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,440
apart closer together and so

1507
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,200
from the standpoint of writing the paper

1508
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,119
now the question is

1509
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:00,720
can those things

1510
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,599
work

1511
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,200
in concert and one approach which says

1512
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,480
these things add up and then we behave

1513
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,839
accordingly

1514
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:12,240
work at the same time as this other way

1515
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,480
of quantifying which says

1516
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,480
there's a variational part that we're

1517
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,720
trying to minimize and there's an

1518
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,000
expected part that we're trying to

1519
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,440
juggle as well

1520
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,640
and so

1521
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,920
i think

1522
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,599
when you get to the closer to the end of

1523
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,520
the paper and you talk about the world

1524
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,000
to mind and the mind to world

1525
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,559
that isn't necessarily always attitude

1526
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,040
that's still a differential

1527
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,799
but it i don't think

1528
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,000
you

1529
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,119
as as writers of this paper

1530
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:45,359
disqualified what's going on with the

1531
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:46,160
well

1532
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,839
we can add these two things together and

1533
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:50,559
that's what is what pops up all i think

1534
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,119
and it said through paper many times is

1535
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,720
under these particular types of sins

1536
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,880
the difference

1537
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,079
seems to

1538
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,240
seems to also

1539
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:06,319
determine what degree of desire or

1540
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:07,440
belief

1541
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,200
or ducks

1542
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,520
i can't say doxacity

1543
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,880
might pertain to that expected free a

1544
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,119
free ener sorry expected free energy

1545
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:20,400
difference

1546
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,200
so again that's not as eloquent as

1547
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,839
daniel or you can describe it but from

1548
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:28,400
somebody who's way down here and just

1549
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,559
trying to make sure that in my own head

1550
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,720
that image right there that's up there

1551
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,200
where suddenly the circumstances have

1552
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,160
changed and i've gone to a desire that

1553
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,200
says well i can't change gravity so i'm

1554
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,559
going to make the biggest crater i

1555
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:44,079
possibly can

1556
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:45,760
instead of the outcome which i'd like

1557
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,480
which is to continue to exist

1558
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,440
maybe my entity my identity now is how

1559
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,160
big a hole in here i can make

1560
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,640
so that's a difference as opposed to an

1561
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,119
adding up

1562
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:01,119
thanks alex feel free to

1563
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:02,799
respond and also

1564
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,119
we'll look at expected free energy and

1565
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,119
the simulation it'll be great to explore

1566
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:08,400
those

1567
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,400
yeah cool yeah so i think i got the

1568
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,559
point about halfway through i'm i'm

1569
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:13,520
seeing where you're getting it's

1570
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,720
interesting so

1571
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,680
i think

1572
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,720
i mean the

1573
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,839
the

1574
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:21,200
first first my first answer was well um

1575
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,280
okay if we we shouldn't think of belief

1576
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,640
plus desire equals intention as

1577
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,319
literally involving a sum

1578
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:28,400
um you know since i've been doing a lot

1579
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,799
of a lot of writing code lately is for

1580
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:32,559
work and and i would think of it as like

1581
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,240
well we define the sum operator for

1582
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,799
belief and desire as just the thing that

1583
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:39,200
active inference does right essentially

1584
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,319
right basically belief plus desire means

1585
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,720
take the chaotic divergence but a more

1586
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,559
informative answer is

1587
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:47,920
i mean if you want to think of it as a

1588
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,160
mathematical type operation like a sum

1589
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,599
or a difference i think you're right

1590
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:52,880
being that it's much more like a

1591
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,960
difference it's much more like intention

1592
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,280
equals desire minus belief

1593
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,720
right so it's like you have your model

1594
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,559
of the worlds you see what the

1595
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,640
difference is between the belief and the

1596
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,599
and the

1597
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,920
uh sorry between your model and

1598
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,680
currently sorry you have your model of

1599
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,720
what you want the world to be like

1600
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,240
rather you see what the difference is

1601
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,680
between that and your model of what the

1602
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,599
world is like and uh and that gives you

1603
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:16,000
the especially free energy but um i know

1604
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,920
you said we get to this in a second

1605
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,000
daniel but um i think you could pretty

1606
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,240
much literally see this in the expected

1607
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,520
free energy

1608
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,400
um

1609
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,559
in the kl term there right so yeah so

1610
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,920
you could expand that so q of the

1611
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,839
divergence between q and p you can you

1612
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,520
can write this out in a way that's you

1613
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,520
know where you're subtracting one uh

1614
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,440
entropy from another basically and so

1615
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,280
you can see it as literally a difference

1616
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,359
so if you if you want to map it on to

1617
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:43,119
the difference concept that's pretty

1618
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:44,960
straightforward

1619
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,480
and that's one feature of the logarithm

1620
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,680
function

1621
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,160
as a modeling heuristic not metaphysical

1622
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,680
truth that

1623
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,040
division

1624
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,520
is a division of different terms like

1625
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,040
the ratio

1626
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,319
is related to the subtraction of the log

1627
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,240
of the ratio so there's various reasons

1628
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,720
why like log likelihoods are used and

1629
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,799
it's also a core function that's

1630
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:11,440
deployed in the kl divergence as well as

1631
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,480
entropy

1632
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,040
terms and then just

1633
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,040
yes duvet but just to get through the

1634
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,720
variables here

1635
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,160
it's written out in the paper but a kl

1636
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,000
divergence is

1637
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,559
describing a divergence not a distance

1638
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,960
between what are on the two sides of the

1639
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,880
double line

1640
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,960
and this is the q variational

1641
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,400
distribution

1642
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,839
of observations over a time horizon

1643
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:40,480
conditioned upon policy

1644
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,799
which serves also very important

1645
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:45,200
function heuristically especially in the

1646
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,040
discrete case

1647
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,520
and the divergence between that

1648
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,240
observations conditioned on policy

1649
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,280
and

1650
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,240
the

1651
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,040
posterior distribution on observations

1652
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,960
through time

1653
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,200
so just that's what's in the kl term and

1654
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,960
we explore this also more in the dot

1655
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,280
zero and we can return to it as well but

1656
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,680
just wanted to clarify like

1657
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,599
and contextualize this to some of our

1658
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:11,520
early discussions like this is the y

1659
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,799
equals mx plus b

1660
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:18,079
of this framework and the least squares

1661
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:22,160
is like fitting the minimum of something

1662
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,079
and so again to go beyond the

1663
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:26,559
interpretation of linear modeling here

1664
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:28,799
not that this is a linear model

1665
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:31,359
requires sometimes describing this

1666
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,960
either the specifics of this model and

1667
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,480
how it differs or taking a vast or

1668
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,680
potentially extremely untenable position

1669
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,359
about the naive interpretation of

1670
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:44,480
variables in arbitrary equations which i

1671
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,319
think is fair to say is an untenable

1672
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:48,960
position which puts the onus of people

1673
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,960
making metaphysical interpretations or

1674
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,599
claims about this line

1675
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:56,079
into a place where the specifics of this

1676
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:57,040
line

1677
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,440
must be addressed

1678
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,640
dean and then dave

1679
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,520
just real quick i i think

1680
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,359
for me it's it's hard to determine

1681
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:09,599
whether or not

1682
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,200
uh a relationship or a diversion or the

1683
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,880
difference

1684
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,480
is

1685
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,359
material or not and so for me

1686
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:21,440
sometimes that just depends sometimes i

1687
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,000
can actually

1688
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:27,040
see the edges of the relationship and

1689
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,040
sometimes it's very very fluid and it's

1690
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,359
hard to determine whether or not there's

1691
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,760
something material about that and and

1692
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,839
that's actually baked into this formula

1693
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:36,960
too so

1694
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,319
i don't know what others think about

1695
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:40,079
that but i mean there is an aspect of

1696
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:41,119
this that

1697
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,760
is written in but i don't know if we can

1698
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,640
actually

1699
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,400
lock it down and say

1700
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,640
that that thing that relationship there

1701
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,799
is actually material or not

1702
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:52,799
so

1703
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:56,000
thanks dean david

1704
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
yeah i think the

1705
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,079
activity you know just looking at it as

1706
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:02,720
a statistical model could be used

1707
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,400
uh to model

1708
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,400
any higher order rules with a feedback

1709
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,640
mechanism whether the origins of them

1710
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,640
are material or not so we don't have to

1711
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,400
you know go in america around

1712
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,920
uh talking about

1713
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,680
what's the origin of these higher order

1714
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,720
rules

1715
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,760
um

1716
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,440
and yeah i was just thinking the you

1717
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,960
know the phenomena folk psychology

1718
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,520
applying to humans and the belief desire

1719
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,240
and tension model if we were looking at

1720
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,160
a simpler model you know i think like

1721
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,799
obviously you know daniel studied ants

1722
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:33,760
uh but at what level is there

1723
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,280
uh

1724
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,799
sense perception

1725
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:38,400
and motor control

1726
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,280
and

1727
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,799
does that need

1728
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:42,880
um

1729
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,440
a controller it was just a pure feedback

1730
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,760
mechanism like action reaction

1731
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,680
and their decision

1732
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,559
is made based on higher order rules

1733
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:53,760
that

1734
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,039
you know i don't know if you'd consider

1735
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,599
an ant if you you just simplify it like

1736
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:58,640
uh

1737
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,520
um

1738
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,400
eat survive and even you know if an ant

1739
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,799
doesn't have reproduce uh if even you

1740
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,559
eliminate like an ant colony where only

1741
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:09,839
the queen reproduces and and possibly in

1742
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:11,920
humans you could say the only difference

1743
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,359
between a human

1744
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:15,520
and the ant is you add the reproduce but

1745
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,520
you have these higher order rules of

1746
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:21,039
basically um survive and you know maybe

1747
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:22,640
that's maybe there's only one higher

1748
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,400
order rule or maybe you want to give a

1749
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,640
whole bunch of higher order rules

1750
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,039
uh and then you define that in your

1751
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:30,640
free energy principle like okay so you

1752
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,280
have the sense perception

1753
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,440
and then you have

1754
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:36,880
the movement

1755
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,119
and uh you know so how you define the

1756
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:41,680
variables in the feedback mechanism

1757
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,400
um you active inference uh mathematical

1758
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,839
framework could model it no matter how

1759
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:46,559
you

1760
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:47,760
uh

1761
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,079
define it and uh you know this thing

1762
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:52,160
also mean obviously we're focusing on on

1763
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,880
humans but it might be more simplified

1764
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,720
to uh

1765
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,319
focus on uh

1766
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:01,200
you know the most simplified uh species

1767
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,200
even plants maybe that they don't have a

1768
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,799
survive instinct that they i mean they

1769
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:06,960
have some sort of survive instinct but

1770
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,200
like you know insect that could uh try

1771
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,200
to survive if i try to squash an insect

1772
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,599
it's going to move in order to try to

1773
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:15,839
survive and it's a clear example of

1774
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:18,960
sense perception the insect senses me

1775
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,640
you know trying to trying to kill it god

1776
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,359
forbid and then moves out of the way of

1777
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:25,520
what exactly caused it and so you're

1778
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,039
just going to hypothesize well of course

1779
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:29,039
it has some sort of survival instinct

1780
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:32,000
and the sensory perception feeds in to

1781
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,400
uh its motor control movement versus if

1782
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,760
it's just seeking food or like a maslow

1783
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,520
hierarchy of needs

1784
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,520
and uh you know i like the terminology

1785
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,839
you know anthropo if we're

1786
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:45,280
anthropomorphizing you know the ant

1787
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,000
or are we reverse amphetamizing the

1788
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:48,960
machine

1789
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,960
that the fact is in terms of sense

1790
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,880
perception motor control

1791
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,960
we understand how the robot computer

1792
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,119
works much better than the mind

1793
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:59,119
and so are the active inference

1794
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:01,599
equations really more suited to

1795
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:04,960
machine learning uh robotic automation

1796
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,319
and then where you reverse

1797
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:08,400
anthropomorphizing that to uh

1798
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,760
the human mind

1799
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,440
but you know certainly the equations are

1800
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,480
valuable

1801
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,000
because you know largely they could be

1802
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,520
interchanged and defined how you want

1803
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,839
them to

1804
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:19,039
thanks

1805
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:21,920
i'll connect some um

1806
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,960
ant

1807
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,319
thoughts to the skydiver so dean has

1808
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:29,119
returned to this example of the skydiver

1809
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:32,480
as being like well if i can't change

1810
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,280
gravity my policies whether mental

1811
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,160
attention policies prey or no prey

1812
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:41,039
um you know do this motor behavior or do

1813
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:42,480
the speech behavior which is a motor

1814
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,920
behavior as well

1815
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,079
condition on policy i'm not going to be

1816
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:49,039
able to influence gravity and

1817
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:51,599
then once updates there prior that also

1818
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:54,319
conditioned upon various action policies

1819
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:56,240
they're not going to be able to open a

1820
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,920
functional parachute

1821
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,680
then there's this discrete shift as

1822
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,119
you've described to like making the

1823
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:02,559
biggest crater

1824
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:03,280
and

1825
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,880
hearing about the ants

1826
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,480
over the years

1827
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,960
it makes me think about folk biology

1828
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,200
like the notion that people have in

1829
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,039
terms of their received understanding

1830
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:15,920
that there is like a

1831
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:19,359
drive to survive or a drive to reproduce

1832
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,839
or drive to do various numbers of things

1833
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:24,799
it's almost like the bdi of evolutionary

1834
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:27,680
biology or of ecology and i'm thinking

1835
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,839
about the case where uh

1836
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:32,000
a nest mate is out foraging for the

1837
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,839
colony and then they're being like

1838
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:35,520
messed with by somebody with like a

1839
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,039
magnifying glass or being touching them

1840
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:39,119
and at first it's like evading now that

1841
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:42,079
behavior looks a lot like a solitary

1842
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:44,240
insect that might be trying to evade and

1843
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,640
survive ostensibly to reproduce and

1844
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,160
increase like its

1845
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,880
individual offspring if one is still

1846
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,200
within the folk biological realm

1847
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,520
and then it's like there's a switch

1848
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,480
where the nest mate is actually like

1849
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:59,440
no

1850
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,920
the evolutionary unit is the colony and

1851
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,280
so it goes for the biggest crater

1852
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,240
possible and that's even embodied in the

1853
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,799
anatomy of some insects for example with

1854
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:11,039
a hooked stinger where they can't

1855
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:14,720
they're committing six-legged death

1856
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,839
to

1857
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:19,119
compose a broader high fitness entity at

1858
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:21,359
the colony scale and so that's like a

1859
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:23,920
behavioral shift from trying to open the

1860
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,839
individual nest mate

1861
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:28,160
parachute to make the biggest crater on

1862
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,760
the attacker possible for the good of

1863
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,039
the colony

1864
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,799
and that

1865
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:35,440
no matter how hard you try to map that

1866
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,079
to the behavior of a solitary insect

1867
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:39,599
will be

1868
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,760
along a potentially didactic or

1869
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,240
interesting but ultimately facetious

1870
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,720
route because the colony is the

1871
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,440
evolutionary unit for these obligately

1872
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,039
used social species

1873
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:53,520
and so one will be scratching their head

1874
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,920
at various of the behaviors and that's

1875
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,839
why the value of a descriptive framework

1876
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,760
is so important because we're able to

1877
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,920
describe various computational qualities

1878
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:04,799
and

1879
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:08,799
not be inconsistent or contradicting

1880
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:11,440
folk in its psychology

1881
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,839
while also

1882
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:15,520
remaining absolutely

1883
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,000
impartial to questions of what ants

1884
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
think for example

1885
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,720
and so we can have computational

1886
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,559
representations of ant decision making

1887
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:26,880
and cognition perception cognition

1888
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,799
action impact

1889
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:31,039
and we can link it to natural language

1890
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:32,559
descriptions through the active

1891
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:35,119
inference ontology as well as through

1892
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,680
potentially other ontologies like ant

1893
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,480
folk psychology

1894
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,559
and we can take that yes and

1895
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,640
and other people can add other yes ands

1896
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,400
if they want

1897
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,520
but

1898
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,440
they're gonna have to take a different

1899
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,640
tack

1900
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,960
to uncouple the relationship between

1901
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,319
these computational quantities

1902
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:58,720
and try to interject a wedge and say no

1903
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,280
it does contradict folk psychology

1904
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,920
that's a different argument then

1905
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:04,880
that

1906
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,440
relationship is in violating some other

1907
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,119
third belief system that i'm bringing to

1908
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:10,720
the table

1909
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,880
so hope that um

1910
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,880
addresses some of it and thanks blue for

1911
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,679
your questions in the chat there

1912
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:19,040
um ali

1913
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,319
would you like to

1914
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:22,719
raise anything or take us to

1915
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:24,238
a question or area that you want to

1916
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:26,158
focus on

1917
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:28,399
uh yeah and one more thing about this

1918
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:31,279
discussion is uh bringing uh

1919
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:34,080
personal semiotics into table i think

1920
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,120
well

1921
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,600
active inference actually i believe is a

1922
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,640
kind of

1923
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:39,679
uh

1924
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:41,040
iconic

1925
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,198
symbol as opposed to

1926
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:46,719
uh index because you see in person

1927
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,238
semiotics

1928
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:52,879
for index we need to necessarily

1929
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:56,399
allow some kind of a causal relationship

1930
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:57,600
between

1931
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,479
the symbol and the index but

1932
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:02,158
for

1933
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:05,520
icons we only need to have some

1934
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,279
isomorphic

1935
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:10,000
isomorphic similarities i'm not not to

1936
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,080
say similarity because the similarity is

1937
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,040
a

1938
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,000
very vague term some isomorphism between

1939
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,600
the symbol and the icon so

1940
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:23,120
ideally active inference is a kind of um

1941
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:26,000
let's say structure preserving mapping

1942
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,439
between the behavior and the model so uh

1943
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:30,960
i guess if we

1944
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,359
can if we could differentiate between

1945
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:36,799
icons and indices

1946
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:39,520
some of these at least

1947
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,759
confusions could possibly could

1948
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,679
potentially be

1949
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,679
well resolved

1950
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:50,719
so icons indices of process semiotics

1951
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:53,920
thanks for sharing that and it connects

1952
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,440
to some of the discussions we've had on

1953
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,920
process ontologies

1954
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,040
as well

1955
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,960
alex

1956
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,800
yeah just really quickly i mean i gotta

1957
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,400
say i don't know that much about

1958
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,239
processed semiotics but

1959
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:08,239
that way of thinking of active inference

1960
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:09,840
and of theories in general as like

1961
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,000
iconic representations is pretty much

1962
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,280
how i think of

1963
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,520
theories and how i mean the most recent

1964
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,920
thing i published with yaakov movie we

1965
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,880
basically said um

1966
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,320
that you can think of scientific

1967
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,000
theories as relating to the world by a

1968
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,880
process uh non-process a relation

1969
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,840
of sort of structural similarity uh

1970
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,840
isomorphous isomorphism being the sort

1971
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,280
of illuminate case

1972
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,280
um so i just i i agree with that and i

1973
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,239
think it's

1974
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:37,679
it kind of comes right back to a lot of

1975
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:40,560
what we discussed like i i i'm as i get

1976
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,320
older i start to think that maybe

1977
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,920
there's something to the essential

1978
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,400
indexical idea that like i has a special

1979
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,840
role to play

1980
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,679
you know the letter capital i in english

1981
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,840
but um other than that i think things

1982
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,040
pretty much function

1983
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,880
descriptively and uh and i think

1984
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,040
description functions

1985
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,120
via isomorphism or similarities so i

1986
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,760
totally agree

1987
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,120
awesome

1988
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:06,080
that reminds me of um the book anthem by

1989
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,120
rand

1990
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,000
where the word i is not included in the

1991
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,360
linguistics and then the end of the book

1992
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:16,320
not you know spoiler alert um that word

1993
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,080
i is rediscovered

1994
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,920
and so it's kind of an allegory that

1995
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,320
traces some of these questions about the

1996
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,480
potentially special role

1997
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,760
of the bodily identity

1998
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:31,920
but it's very interesting that these

1999
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,239
frameworks actually are

2000
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:35,760
engaging

2001
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,800
or

2002
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,280
with this augmented perspective for

2003
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,520
example that ali has raised

2004
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,440
that these theories can be seen as

2005
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:47,678
already having been engaged in

2006
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:51,840
a discourse that people might not expect

2007
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,760
like predictive processing is what the

2008
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,080
brain is doing do you agree or deny

2009
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,360
what's the evidence for predictive

2010
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,280
processing being active in the brain

2011
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,679
versus not active in the brain is this

2012
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:03,360
neural signal recording that we made

2013
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,280
more consistent with a predictive or

2014
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,280
non-predictive model

2015
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,840
it takes that miso range of what the

2016
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,440
system is doing

2017
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,679
and it partitions it as we heard also

2018
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:15,120
from ryan

2019
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:18,080
previously into like well predictive

2020
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,320
processing can't be

2021
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,760
invalidated

2022
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,000
not nor can linear regression framework

2023
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,400
nor can active inference framework

2024
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,719
any specific model

2025
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,800
is now engaged in a specific model

2026
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,199
evidence comparison and then one can

2027
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:35,040
choose what kind of model comparisons

2028
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,719
they want to make

2029
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,239
knowing that they're not going to be

2030
01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:40,159
able to exhaustively consider all

2031
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:42,640
possible cognitive architectures

2032
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:43,600
but

2033
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:44,960
also

2034
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,679
any invalidation or relative model fit

2035
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:50,080
or adequacy amongst different models at

2036
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,920
this specific

2037
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,520
level

2038
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,040
are speaking

2039
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,960
only rhetorically

2040
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,120
to the truth or the validity or the

2041
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,600
adequacy of the higher level

2042
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,400
inviolable framework

2043
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:08,799
there's a lot there to explore do it

2044
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,320
yeah maybe we could tie this back to the

2045
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:13,679
eliminativism

2046
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:14,719
um

2047
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:17,440
and uh you know the anthropomorphisms if

2048
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,199
you know you ascribe an eye to the

2049
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:21,199
computer you say that's a logical

2050
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:23,600
fallacy of anthropomorphism because

2051
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,080
there is no i it's just following code

2052
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,920
or even to uh the ant if uh

2053
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,920
you know mammals may be uh but but you

2054
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,320
know insects communicate different sense

2055
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,800
pheromones and you want to

2056
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:38,719
anthropomorphize an eye to the ant that

2057
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:40,880
like the the ant is saying i

2058
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,360
want to communicate with my fellow aunts

2059
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:46,080
for a purpose and it's like no no that's

2060
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,000
not that's an anthropomorphism logical

2061
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,040
fallacy the ant is just uh following

2062
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,480
genetic code

2063
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:55,280
and then you say well uh

2064
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,080
really for humans also that you know

2065
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,840
we're morphizing uh the mind and that

2066
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,280
there is no i

2067
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:06,320
related to uh unified eye related to the

2068
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:09,440
me that even right now that you know i

2069
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,920
am communicating with uh with you you

2070
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:13,360
find gentlemen

2071
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,360
but that's a misnomer

2072
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,760
and in terms that it's just uh

2073
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:21,600
me following uh my my predictive coding

2074
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,719
and that uh you know just for the

2075
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:24,400
purpose of language

2076
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,199
i'm referring it to is i talking to you

2077
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,880
but you know that's just like a computer

2078
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,120
sending code to another computer or an

2079
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,880
aunt sending pheromones or whatever

2080
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:36,640
method of communication it uses and

2081
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,400
that's just the language and lexicon

2082
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,719
that we use

2083
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:41,520
yeah

2084
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,120
it's uh

2085
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,840
it's a dialogue that has played out in

2086
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,000
not only girdle escher bach but many

2087
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,480
college dorm rooms many late night

2088
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,760
sessions

2089
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,719
one participant or perspective believes

2090
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:56,960
that they have for example the ability

2091
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:00,080
to choose and have agency and the other

2092
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:03,360
disregards that position or one believes

2093
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,120
that there's something and there's a

2094
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:08,239
divergence in their perspective

2095
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:10,239
i think this is just the heart of the

2096
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:13,280
map territory debate in the distributed

2097
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,719
cognitive setting

2098
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:17,040
as all cognitive systems ultimately are

2099
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,800
even what is called individual behavior

2100
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,719
is just referring to collective behavior

2101
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:22,640
at another scale

2102
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,880
for example one person can say this

2103
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,280
conversation can be modeled using active

2104
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,120
inference or this conversation can be

2105
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,760
modeled using predictive processing just

2106
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,080
like it could be constructed with a

2107
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:35,920
linear regression or family of linear

2108
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,080
regressions and somebody else could say

2109
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:39,760
this conversation is

2110
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,600
nothing but

2111
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,520
linear aggressions nothing but

2112
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,679
predictive processing nothing but active

2113
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:48,159
inference

2114
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:50,719
someone might believe that and if they

2115
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:53,760
believe that it would be true that that

2116
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:56,239
is their perspective

2117
01:15:56,239 --> 01:15:59,360
i don't know if that would make it true

2118
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:00,159
but

2119
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:01,679
they would be taking they would be

2120
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:03,760
stepping into a territory that the

2121
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:06,000
person who remains with both feet in

2122
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,400
instrumentalism i'm choosing to model it

2123
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,080
this way or i'm

2124
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,080
testing a portfolio of different models

2125
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,840
around how we could model our difference

2126
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,560
in perspective

2127
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,880
maybe one can say that they have uh been

2128
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,800
too timid and they haven't actually

2129
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,480
engaged in the real question which is

2130
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,080
what's really happening not with how

2131
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,360
you're modeling it

2132
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,000
but that's a whole another debate

2133
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,320
alex and then do it

2134
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,960
yeah um

2135
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:35,040
i just think i mean this this might tie

2136
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,880
into the stuff in section nine that

2137
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,080
maybe we'll get to we don't have to jump

2138
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,159
to i'm just saying uh

2139
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:42,159
uh basically i

2140
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:43,679
i agree you could raise these questions

2141
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:46,080
for any of these systems people machines

2142
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,679
ants uh

2143
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:50,239
protons whatever and uh

2144
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:51,679
and i think there's an argument to be

2145
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:53,280
made that there's not a clear place to

2146
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,880
draw the line there but it could go

2147
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,480
either way with respect to all of those

2148
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,960
right i i think that you know

2149
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,640
you could be antimorphizing in all of

2150
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,960
those cases or none of them

2151
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,560
it's not easy to

2152
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,320
i don't think it's easy to draw a line

2153
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,480
somewhere along the sort of

2154
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,080
evolutionary continuum or anything like

2155
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,159
that to say although there's an argument

2156
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:13,440
about temporal depth of generative

2157
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,280
models that's interesting that

2158
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,719
touched on a couple of papers here and

2159
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:18,880
there but um

2160
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,159
you know i think

2161
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:21,360
uh

2162
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,880
the the cool thing about

2163
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,880
uh active inference and the free energy

2164
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,640
principle stuff is that it applies

2165
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,000
across scales

2166
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,760
um so i think that to me that means that

2167
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,679
you're faced with a similar problem

2168
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:35,120
um at whatever scale you consider it um

2169
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,719
i just gotta throw out there i probably

2170
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:38,719
gonna have to leave around 12 30 eastern

2171
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:40,719
so i'll say that now so that i can just

2172
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:41,920
abruptly

2173
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:44,960
uh close my window

2174
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,679
so we're in the summary of main argument

2175
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:49,280
section nine

2176
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:50,000
so

2177
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
alex what is the main argument and also

2178
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,320
in the contexts and audiences that

2179
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,960
you've presented it in how do you feel

2180
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,520
like it lands or what cognitive updates

2181
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,239
are you aiming to achieve with this

2182
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:08,000
argument as constructed and communicated

2183
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,360
is this section nine i think actually

2184
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,840
may have been section eight but um sorry

2185
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,120
okay section eight desire is an

2186
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,719
affective statement

2187
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:16,480
i meant ten

2188
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,880
okay um i i don't want to totally bypass

2189
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,159
your question i just think nine is kind

2190
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,480
of a summary of the argument thus far so

2191
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:23,360
all right

2192
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,120
how about ten let's talk about direction

2193
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:26,480
of fit

2194
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,320
yeah so i mean so the

2195
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:29,280
sorry the

2196
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,719
sort of the point here was just that

2197
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:32,400
there's a this

2198
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,679
certainly is relevant to a lot of what

2199
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:35,679
we're discussing there's a

2200
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:37,360
straightforward way to generalize this

2201
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:39,120
beyond systems that you would

2202
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,520
necessarily intuitively describe as

2203
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,199
having beliefs and desires

2204
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,640
and we can just talk about any system

2205
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,560
that's described by active inference

2206
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,480
by this framework or that's describable

2207
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,320
accurately by this framework you can

2208
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,600
talk about the difference between q and

2209
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:52,880
p

2210
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,960
and this i think also ties into

2211
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,719
some of the work that maxwell ramstad

2212
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:58,239
has done on

2213
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:01,360
um just the idea that you know uh

2214
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:02,640
the generative model is sort of

2215
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,800
representation or it's sort of a

2216
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,280
representation embodied by the system if

2217
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,280
it's a representation we still disagree

2218
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,840
about that anyway the generative model

2219
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:12,880
and the

2220
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,480
approximate recognition model are sort

2221
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:17,040
of always there even if you apply these

2222
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,760
frameworks um to describe very simple

2223
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,520
systems and you can you can see

2224
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,480
something desire-like or belief-like in

2225
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,520
those

2226
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,840
and we just remained very neutral on on

2227
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:28,960
that

2228
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,640
in this paper on the question whether

2229
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,480
there really are beliefs and desires in

2230
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,159
these sort of

2231
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:36,719
extended cases by extended i mean

2232
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:39,600
not necessarily paradigmatic right so if

2233
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,080
if beliefs and desires paradigmatically

2234
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,760
apply to like people

2235
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,400
and then maybe to ants and i would say

2236
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,679
definitely dogs you know um

2237
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:52,640
then uh this this stuff in section 10 is

2238
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:55,280
is about what you can say without

2239
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,719
necessarily committing to beliefs and

2240
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:58,560
desires and those in the in the edge

2241
01:19:58,560 --> 01:19:59,600
cases

2242
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,400
um but you can still say that there's at

2243
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:03,920
least an ingredient of beliefs and

2244
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,159
desires which is a direction of fit

2245
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:08,239
um

2246
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:09,280
that's

2247
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:10,800
sums it up

2248
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,920
so how could this be used in one case

2249
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,199
for a human entity in the folk

2250
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:18,800
psychological way

2251
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,840
and in another case for some entity that

2252
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,080
people would maybe say

2253
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,320
that type of folk psychology would be

2254
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:29,280
inadmissible for

2255
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:30,960
um

2256
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,639
i mean as far as how it could be used in

2257
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:33,679
the case of

2258
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:35,600
of people that have beliefs and desires

2259
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,080
or that we think do i think it's pretty

2260
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,199
it's pretty straightforward right it's

2261
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:41,280
just saying well any kind of folks like

2262
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,040
a long physical explanation you can give

2263
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,440
of a person's behavior you can

2264
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,800
it's consistent with the description of

2265
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,880
that person in terms of active inference

2266
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:49,760
um

2267
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,760
i guess then the only question is like

2268
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:55,679
in in case of a system that might be

2269
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:58,159
not clearly

2270
01:20:58,159 --> 01:20:59,600
that you wouldn't necessarily think of

2271
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,719
as having a psychology in the same sense

2272
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:04,320
uh what kinds of things would you want

2273
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,960
to say about it um

2274
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,239
i think

2275
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:09,280
i think there's an example that made

2276
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,280
into a paper about like a a plant

2277
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,639
reaching towards the light or something

2278
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:14,400
or it's sort of these simple

2279
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,560
simpler sort of feedback systems right

2280
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,880
where something there's like a set point

2281
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,880
uh and the thing is approaching the set

2282
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,400
point um

2283
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,480
you can still think of the

2284
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:28,400
of the prior distribution as having a uh

2285
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,320
world to mind direction fit

2286
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,760
right because it's it's the piece of the

2287
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,560
system that brings it about that

2288
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:35,520
um

2289
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,560
that things change so that that

2290
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,840
distribution

2291
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,880
describes

2292
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,800
uh you know reality

2293
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,560
um

2294
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:45,679
yeah so

2295
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:46,639
uh

2296
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:48,480
yeah and so you still have those so so

2297
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,639
that's one example um

2298
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:52,639
i don't know maybe like a bacterium

2299
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:54,080
following some kind of

2300
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,520
nutrient gradient or something i don't

2301
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:58,080
really know about that stuff but

2302
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,320
that's another example that might you

2303
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,760
could you could describe directions of

2304
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:05,280
fit to that creature and

2305
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:08,080
i don't okay last last my last thought

2306
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,360
on this i don't know why it would be

2307
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,760
useful to do that necessarily uh i don't

2308
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,679
know there might be reasons in

2309
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:16,639
studying these systems that you want to

2310
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:18,080
but if you did want to do it you could

2311
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,920
understand it from the framework

2312
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,000
just some brief thoughts and then ali so

2313
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,320
first there's a paper of calvo and frist

2314
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:27,040
in 2017 which is specifically applying

2315
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,360
predictive processing and active to the

2316
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:31,440
um vegetative case

2317
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,679
and i think from the perspective of

2318
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:35,520
behavioral analysis there's also

2319
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:36,639
precedence

2320
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:39,760
in the 1989 paper framework for plant

2321
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,239
behavior by silvertown and gordon

2322
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:44,000
so suffice to say that plants are

2323
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
included within this cognitivist

2324
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,159
modeling perspective and then it made me

2325
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:49,840
think about how the surprise the

2326
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,440
self-information

2327
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:54,080
is an energy function it's what dampens

2328
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,520
the spring and so maybe could you say

2329
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,159
like the heavier ball with folk

2330
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:01,120
ball psychology the heavier ball wants

2331
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,840
to drop faster or it wants to make a

2332
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,600
bigger crater or all these other things

2333
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,560
just

2334
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,560
again it doesn't have the agency to want

2335
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:09,679
otherwise

2336
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:11,199
given the initial conditions and the

2337
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:13,920
rules of physics in that situation but

2338
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,840
it's exactly like a person wanting to

2339
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,520
make a small hole in the paper or

2340
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,280
wanting to make a big hole and then

2341
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,199
realizing that intention would be

2342
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:23,520
analogous to an energy functional being

2343
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,520
reduced by some kind of

2344
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:28,880
purely physical system which does again

2345
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,360
hint towards some of the potentially

2346
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:32,960
non-materialist

2347
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:36,239
implications legacy that do slip in

2348
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:37,040
to

2349
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,400
different

2350
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:42,080
in cultured conversations around mind

2351
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,199
um

2352
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:46,080
yes alex any last thoughts on that just

2353
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,760
real quick get on the ball example i

2354
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:48,719
mean

2355
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:50,960
i think there is a sense of course in

2356
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,120
which this framework applies but i think

2357
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,280
if anything the ball wouldn't

2358
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,960
have a desire or

2359
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,639
if the system involving the bomb line

2360
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:00,560
though right so because the

2361
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,000
the term that would that would pull the

2362
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,040
ball towards the ground or whatever

2363
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,320
wouldn't really be in the makeup of the

2364
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,440
ball

2365
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,360
but and so whether that larger system

2366
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,920
has a proto belief or desire i don't

2367
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,920
know

2368
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,080
ali and again alex you feel free to

2369
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:17,840
depart whenever but ollie go for it

2370
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:20,400
uh well yeah i'm not sure if we have

2371
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,960
enough time to get into this question

2372
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:26,320
i mean if not we can uh discuss it in

2373
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,639
the dark too but

2374
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:31,120
i had a question about

2375
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,719
the aesthetic experience and the

2376
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:34,080
pleasure or

2377
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,159
positive valence we get from engaging

2378
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:39,360
with works of art uh in particular i'm

2379
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:42,639
talking about unexpected plot twists in

2380
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:45,280
movies or novels or different kinds of

2381
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,280
intentional ambiguities and some

2382
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:48,400
artworks

2383
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,480
for instance the works of m.c escher and

2384
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,960
his impossible geometries

2385
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:54,880
will immediately come to mind

2386
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,600
and the sense of excitement and joy they

2387
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:00,320
tend to induce in the audience

2388
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,719
in fact playing around with these kinds

2389
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:03,400
of

2390
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,920
defamiliarizations as literary critics

2391
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,239
like to call them seems to be more of a

2392
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:10,840
rule than an exception in any creative

2393
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:13,440
endeavor on the other hand outside the

2394
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,760
safety of the world of arts

2395
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,600
we generally don't like to be

2396
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,639
encountered with too much unexpectedness

2397
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:22,080
as we've seen

2398
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,400
so i wonder whether or how

2399
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,639
these kinds of aesthetic reactions can

2400
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:28,080
be integrated

2401
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,560
within the formalism of active inference

2402
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:33,120
are they special cases of information

2403
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:36,320
seeking drives or there's a whole other

2404
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:40,120
story going on here

2405
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,920
go for this and then

2406
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,400
thanks again for your time here yeah

2407
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,920
yeah yeah i'll check out after this

2408
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:47,120
thank you so much i love these

2409
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,239
discussions i knew it would be an

2410
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:49,679
interesting interesting crowd

2411
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:51,520
interesting uh topics

2412
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,239
um i gotta say i i don't know much about

2413
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:56,080
what you just asked about um ellie but i

2414
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,400
love this this topic um i'm i'm coming i

2415
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,679
actually come from a background of

2416
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:01,840
aesthetics as well i should say but

2417
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,280
anyway i know there's a lot of work on

2418
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,120
this so i know that predictive process

2419
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,159
under the banner of predictive

2420
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:07,760
processing there's a whole lot of work

2421
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,560
in aesthetics these days on i think

2422
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,000
suggesting a lot of something very

2423
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,120
similar to what you're saying that

2424
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:14,719
there's clearly a relationship here

2425
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:17,199
between surprisal and unexpectedness and

2426
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:18,800
predictions and

2427
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,480
the joy that we get out of and other

2428
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,400
emotions that we get out of artworks and

2429
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,239
i i would love to to know more about

2430
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:25,520
this i haven't had time to look into it

2431
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:28,639
but i i think daniel's put a uh

2432
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:30,880
this was a uh uh also a predictive

2433
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:34,159
processing type paper with a incredible

2434
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:35,360
title

2435
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,360
move me astonish me delight my eyes and

2436
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:40,320
brain and then enter the subtitle

2437
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,280
sequel

2438
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:44,239
title um perhaps in the dot 2 let's

2439
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:46,400
sketch this out let's act let's look at

2440
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,320
the formalisms and let's do some

2441
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,040
mappings so someone said i believe that

2442
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:53,280
mondrian is an amazing painter and i

2443
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,520
want to go to a space where i do see

2444
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,440
beautiful art and i want to have this

2445
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,600
kind of experience or something like

2446
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,080
that but let's explore that in the dot 2

2447
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:04,800
with some of the bdis and the aesthetics

2448
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:08,400
of uncultured experiences

2449
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,840
yeah sure if i could just

2450
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,360
just really quickly i think that the

2451
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,199
challenge there is going to be

2452
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:17,679
that sometimes prediction error is fine

2453
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:19,280
and sometimes it's not we need to figure

2454
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:20,480
out right there's probably some

2455
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,719
complicated way of saying

2456
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:23,840
what the difference is between those

2457
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,600
cases but that's that's as far as my

2458
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,040
intuition goes yeah i'd love to discuss

2459
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,000
it

2460
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,040
um

2461
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,360
thanks again see you later thank you all

2462
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,759
bye bye

2463
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,719
great dean

2464
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:38,400
yeah i just wanted to kind of jump on

2465
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:41,040
that point that wally was making i

2466
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,239
i think that

2467
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:44,480
in the in this in the

2468
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:45,760
i just want to make sure i got the right

2469
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,920
section of the paper here

2470
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,920
uh sorry the free energy principle and

2471
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:52,000
the direction of fit yeah

2472
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,239
sort of to tag on what ali and and alex

2473
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:55,760
were saying there's a there's a

2474
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,199
statement here that says

2475
01:27:57,199 --> 01:27:58,800
holding the value of the observation

2476
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,040
constantly in this equation

2477
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,120
f decreases as the approximate posterior

2478
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:05,679
distribution q of the state approaches

2479
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:07,360
the posterior

2480
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:10,000
the q s term therefore is

2481
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,960
forwardly belief-like mind-to-world

2482
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,960
direction of fit in that its value

2483
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,600
changes to accommodate

2484
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,920
new observations i think that the usher

2485
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:23,040
and the mondrian and every time i go to

2486
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:23,920
a

2487
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:26,320
a sporting event

2488
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:29,760
my openness my accommodation

2489
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,040
to

2490
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:33,520
what is perceived as an uncertain

2491
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,600
outcome is the thing that draws my

2492
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,040
attention

2493
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,280
and i think daniel's point of let's

2494
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:42,960
let's map that out let's see how long

2495
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:45,280
some people are able to hold that

2496
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:46,719
ambiguity

2497
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:47,840
space

2498
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:50,719
and not necessarily see it as a risk

2499
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:51,520
is

2500
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:55,679
both immaterial until it materializes

2501
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:56,400
and

2502
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,159
is a process that i think a lot of

2503
01:28:58,159 --> 01:29:00,080
people want to go through

2504
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:02,400
because there's there's something to

2505
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:03,600
that

2506
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:04,639
that

2507
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,639
isn't just attention

2508
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:08,960
in from it isn't just information

2509
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:11,760
seeking but it may also satiate certain

2510
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,280
desires so i think that is a point to

2511
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,440
mapping that we should

2512
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,520
maybe spend a little bit of time on

2513
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,719
because i don't know that when you open

2514
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:25,920
a space up for something to eventually

2515
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,040
happen

2516
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,199
you're you're

2517
01:29:29,199 --> 01:29:31,920
imposing what the final material

2518
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,320
form should take you're simply leaving

2519
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:37,040
something open in the hopes that

2520
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,960
something interesting

2521
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,000
i.e

2522
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,040
an escher painting might end up being in

2523
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,280
the next room i mean this is what

2524
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:46,800
happens when i

2525
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:49,520
go to museums in spain it's i'm not

2526
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,600
looking to find

2527
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,120
the particular

2528
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:54,159
daly

2529
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:57,280
i'm looking to go into that space and be

2530
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:58,800
surprised

2531
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,679
so i wonder how that actually does map

2532
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:04,159
out using these formalisms

2533
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:06,000
yes it reminds me of when in the dot

2534
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,960
zero ryan described like the different

2535
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:11,280
reasons and the different nuancing the

2536
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:13,600
types of information seeking

2537
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:16,000
that's very relevant i'm navigating

2538
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,440
through this museum to reduce my

2539
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:20,080
uncertainty about where that one piece

2540
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:22,400
that i came to see is

2541
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:26,080
the target driven epistemic foraging

2542
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:29,440
from a more general like i don't know

2543
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,840
what is in that other room

2544
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:33,360
that is going to influence my

2545
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,760
probability of moving room to room and

2546
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:38,000
certainly with the eye cicading

2547
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,040
that is how we maintain a visual field

2548
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:43,199
that appears to have roughly equal

2549
01:30:43,199 --> 01:30:44,400
resolution

2550
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:47,440
via our generative model of vision and

2551
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:50,400
ocular motor cicading to regions of

2552
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,880
maximal information

2553
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,159
distinctly uncoupled from only what

2554
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:58,159
regions are most rewarding though

2555
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:00,320
people's gaze does tend to linger in

2556
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,080
certain regions that might be perceived

2557
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:03,440
as rewarding

2558
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:06,159
that isn't the only imperative

2559
01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:08,480
and that's why it's so special and

2560
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:09,520
relevant

2561
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:10,960
to have a

2562
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:14,159
cross system and multi-scale behavioral

2563
01:31:14,159 --> 01:31:16,639
modeling framework like active inference

2564
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:19,440
that helps us understand the pure

2565
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:22,080
static field eyes trying to latch on to

2566
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,920
anything mode

2567
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,360
from the

2568
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:26,480
gaze

2569
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:29,920
on a candle flame during meditation or

2570
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,840
one region of particular beauty in

2571
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:35,120
another visual scene dean

2572
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,800
yeah just real quick and i think that

2573
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,639
also

2574
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:40,880
ali thank you you raised sembiotics and

2575
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:42,639
i'm a pierce fan so

2576
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:44,480
there's a there's a huge piece of that

2577
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:47,040
involved in this as well as so what is

2578
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,800
the signal

2579
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,480
that that very much there's that there's

2580
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,800
a slide in here that we didn't get to

2581
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:55,440
but when the ice cream cone is looking

2582
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,520
off into the distance at that

2583
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:00,239
at that ice cream truck

2584
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:02,480
where do we where do we place that in

2585
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:04,639
the foreground or in the background and

2586
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:06,880
that is a huge i think that plays a huge

2587
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,080
part in

2588
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:10,239
in their

2589
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:13,600
the role of the third person now looking

2590
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,280
at the the observer looking at the

2591
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:16,800
observer and getting that sort of

2592
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:19,440
recursive aspect involved in this as

2593
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:20,480
well so

2594
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:23,120
again i don't know how that we will have

2595
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,480
to

2596
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:26,480
we'll borrow daniels

2597
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:29,040
how to be able to map that as a nine one

2598
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,840
or as a three seven and then maybe put

2599
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:34,000
it on a likert scale because i think all

2600
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,960
of that kind of is a potential way for

2601
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:40,480
this to sort of make a sense i wasn't

2602
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:43,360
bringing up with alex the idea that

2603
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:46,080
like literally beliefs and desires add

2604
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:48,159
up to intentions i was sort of saying

2605
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:50,239
that tongue-in-cheek just to be able to

2606
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:53,760
show the difference when something is

2607
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:54,960
discreet

2608
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,280
and and how we try to bring them

2609
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,239
together

2610
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:01,600
and this observer of an observer thing

2611
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:04,239
um although it's not i don't think it's

2612
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:06,960
alex's and and the other two authors

2613
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,800
primary goal here

2614
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:11,280
but i but i do think they lower the bar

2615
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:13,360
in terms of bringing

2616
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:16,159
some of the more folk out spoke aspects

2617
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:20,000
of this into the formalism aspects

2618
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,080
yes and it was a very clever and

2619
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:24,480
interesting response which is it depends

2620
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,560
on what is meant by addition what does

2621
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,239
it mean for um

2622
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:30,639
dean bless ali does that mean they're

2623
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:32,480
both going to stand on a scale and we're

2624
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:34,239
measuring their mass

2625
01:33:34,239 --> 01:33:35,840
does it mean that we're going to stack

2626
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:38,239
them head to toe and then consider the

2627
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:40,000
length does it mean that they're going

2628
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,800
to interact in a certain context

2629
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,000
does it mean we're going to blend them

2630
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,320
up i mean there isn't an intrinsic

2631
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,560
definition to what the addition operator

2632
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:51,440
or any operator means in a formal system

2633
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:53,360
and so it opens up the idea that we

2634
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:56,880
could have whether specific symbols or

2635
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,120
just here's how we're using this symbol

2636
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:00,400
here

2637
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:03,440
and use that to refer to relatively

2638
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:05,760
potentially complex and multi-step

2639
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,199
operations

2640
01:34:07,199 --> 01:34:09,360
or operations that can be phrased in

2641
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:10,800
multi-step

2642
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,960
for example a multiplication on the

2643
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,880
processor might happen in a different

2644
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:16,320
way than somebody is cognitively

2645
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,719
thinking about it but that

2646
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:20,000
is um

2647
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,600
as the title hints

2648
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,520
not contradictory

2649
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:26,560
not that one validates or encompasses or

2650
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,040
proves the other but there's so many

2651
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,199
things that are not contradictory an

2652
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:32,960
active inference may be contradictory of

2653
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,159
certain things

2654
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:35,760
let's make a list what is active

2655
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:38,639
inference contradictory of what is folk

2656
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:40,400
psychology contradicting of and we can

2657
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:42,400
make all of that mapping in the right

2658
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,080
knowledge management system

2659
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:45,840
and the claim of the article as i guess

2660
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:46,960
ryan's

2661
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:49,920
imperative was was to make this claim

2662
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:53,280
that as they've operationalized both

2663
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:54,639
active inference models do not

2664
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:56,719
contradict folk psychology and that's

2665
01:34:56,719 --> 01:34:59,840
quite an interesting claim

2666
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,840
yeah just real quick i i think daniel

2667
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,280
the point is

2668
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:05,679
i'm rephrasing it in my own

2669
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:07,520
from my own view which is you raise a

2670
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,760
lot of different joint probabilities

2671
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:10,480
that

2672
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:12,719
by their nature are arbitrary and i

2673
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:14,560
think that's important to keep in mind

2674
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,239
this leaves open

2675
01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:18,320
the possibility of looking at things a

2676
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:20,480
variety of different ways

2677
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,400
yeah and just to speak to the joint

2678
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,560
probability density so the joint

2679
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:26,560
probability density in the bayesian

2680
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:28,800
modeling approach is like where there's

2681
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:31,679
a comma so instead of a conditioned on b

2682
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:33,840
it's like the joint distribution of a

2683
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,119
and b

2684
01:35:35,119 --> 01:35:36,480
right

2685
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:37,679
y

2686
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:41,440
a and b why not b and y

2687
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,199
why not these three

2688
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:44,400
and so

2689
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,159
there's always

2690
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:48,560
something like a periphery that the

2691
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:50,960
model comes from

2692
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:53,840
and we can be blanketed off from it and

2693
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:56,239
that actually serves as a scientific and

2694
01:35:56,239 --> 01:35:58,239
really meta-scientific

2695
01:35:58,239 --> 01:35:59,600
way

2696
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:02,080
to have rigor and accessibility

2697
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,960
potentially of the models to respect

2698
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,960
when we're in the regime of attention of

2699
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:08,960
a model what kinds of claims can or

2700
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,639
cannot be supported what kinds of

2701
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:12,960
contradictions are or not tenable to

2702
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:13,920
make

2703
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:16,880
and then also have the yes and with

2704
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:19,920
respecting that that joint distribution

2705
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,199
was not

2706
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:23,520
handed down from on high it is not the

2707
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:25,199
only possible joint distribution that

2708
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:26,880
could have been selected

2709
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,679
and so we can separate off how did these

2710
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:32,400
real researchers in this real situation

2711
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,560
come to focus on that phenomena and pick

2712
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,639
this joint distribution

2713
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:37,840
from

2714
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:40,800
conditioned on the joint distribution

2715
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:42,560
what was the actual conversation and

2716
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:44,719
consequences and modeling they performed

2717
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:47,119
david

2718
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:52,239
yeah it's all fascinating um

2719
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:54,080
i guess i had

2720
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:56,080
two separate points i wanted to express

2721
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:57,280
and they might be more general because

2722
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:59,360
it's my first time on the stream than

2723
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:01,280
uh uh it's related to this paper but

2724
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,520
specific to active inference in general

2725
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:07,199
and the interdisciplinary studies um

2726
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:09,600
what my streaming partner uh jennifer

2727
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,760
scharf calls herself church of entropy

2728
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:13,760
we've been three years now uh talking

2729
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,840
about consciousness and i showed her the

2730
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:17,199
free energy principle and she

2731
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:18,320
immediately

2732
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:20,480
said that uh isn't that just the least

2733
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:21,920
action principle

2734
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,280
and uh

2735
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:25,119
i mean it's not directly related to this

2736
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:27,360
paper but i could see that in terms of

2737
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,320
uh

2738
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,520
um

2739
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:32,159
you know my second point i'll call gold

2740
01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:35,119
directed behavior in general

2741
01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:37,360
and uh you know if you want to say that

2742
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,920
there's only one motivating force

2743
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,360
in

2744
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,520
active inference and that's the

2745
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:46,000
free energy principle which is basically

2746
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,119
a restating of

2747
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:51,840
the least action principle

2748
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:55,760
and then at a second point uh

2749
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:57,840
i went you know last week in metro

2750
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:59,119
detroit they had the international

2751
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:00,960
automation conference

2752
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:02,960
and uh they had the latest in robotic

2753
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,639
arms and technology

2754
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:07,440
for uh manufacture and they had on

2755
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:09,360
display um

2756
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:11,199
you know a lot of what we'll call sense

2757
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:13,520
perception and motor control

2758
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:17,119
specifically robotic arms that

2759
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:18,880
don't just repeat the same action or

2760
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:20,800
even have like a sensor embedded when

2761
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,920
but have an embedded sensor of a camera

2762
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:26,480
that will recognize the object and then

2763
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:29,679
create a set of rules in order to uh

2764
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:31,760
tell the robotic arm the best uh

2765
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:33,760
trajectory in order to pick up the

2766
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:35,840
object and then in terms of uh like

2767
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:37,360
old-school manufacturer where it would

2768
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:39,679
just been taking an object and setting

2769
01:38:39,679 --> 01:38:42,560
it in one place where it actually has

2770
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,639
some level of machine

2771
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:47,280
learning intelligence where it could uh

2772
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,760
intelligently design where to put the

2773
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:52,080
object in terms of like stacking boxes

2774
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:54,080
where it could uh you know the algorithm

2775
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,920
of the computer could

2776
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:56,960
determine

2777
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:59,600
what's the best way to stack the objects

2778
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:02,639
and then control the robotic arm to uh

2779
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:06,400
to do that if it's like so for humans uh

2780
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,719
just on the pure level of sense

2781
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:10,719
perception

2782
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:13,040
has goal-directed behavior how do i you

2783
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,040
know if we have 100 million

2784
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:18,159
uh cones and rods in her eye how do we

2785
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:20,239
direct uh

2786
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:22,000
our physical

2787
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,480
capabilities of sense perception to

2788
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:26,800
perceive the environment uh and saying

2789
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,639
that could be modeled by these equations

2790
01:39:28,639 --> 01:39:30,239
and uh we'll call you know the free

2791
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:32,880
energy principle least action principle

2792
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:36,320
and then the decision making that uh uh

2793
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:38,639
you know the goal uh directed behavior

2794
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:40,960
like the like the automation computer it

2795
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:44,080
has to have a goal code in order to act

2796
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:46,480
and so it could action reaction sense

2797
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:47,600
perception

2798
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:49,199
uh

2799
01:39:49,199 --> 01:39:52,320
feedback mechanism in order to action

2800
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,239
and then the equation are describing

2801
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:55,520
gold-directed behavior and that's why

2802
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,760
i'm a fan of the active inference model

2803
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:58,880
because uh

2804
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:01,360
as a dualist i mean as a scientist i

2805
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:03,440
could let's describe these in purely

2806
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:05,520
materialistic things and we don't have

2807
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:08,800
to get too much into the theology or

2808
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,320
uh you know what's the origin of these

2809
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:11,840
higher order rules even if you want to

2810
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:14,960
assume that all higher order rules are

2811
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:17,440
material in uh in origin

2812
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:20,320
but i think the equations in general

2813
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:21,760
could model it no matter what their

2814
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:24,000
origin is and it's a you know just a

2815
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,400
good framework to understand uh

2816
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:27,520
um

2817
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,880
you know all these theories the goal

2818
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:31,199
directed behavior at all aspects and

2819
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:33,280
then to put on you know the last spin on

2820
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:35,440
it like the maslow's hierarchy of needs

2821
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:37,600
in uh in like you know what is belief

2822
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:38,639
desire

2823
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:40,639
and uh you know that i would have

2824
01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:43,600
introspection or education that would

2825
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:44,880
give me

2826
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:48,320
um you know morals ethics that okay like

2827
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:51,520
my body uh like i put the pithy and the

2828
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:54,080
the expression i see the heart desires

2829
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:56,560
the mind plots and the limb carry out

2830
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:58,159
that uh that

2831
01:40:58,159 --> 01:41:00,560
i have the capability that my eyes see

2832
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:03,199
my heart desires but my mind stops me

2833
01:41:03,199 --> 01:41:04,800
and says that's wrong

2834
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:07,280
and uh even though

2835
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:09,679
my sense perception saw it and my

2836
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:11,840
desires told me that i should do it

2837
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,280
somehow there's this higher order

2838
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,600
principle of the mind that tells me

2839
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,920
that's wrong and i'm not going to do it

2840
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:20,159
and there's that control factor before

2841
01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:22,639
the limbs carry out

2842
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:24,719
thank you i'll just make some short

2843
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:26,719
points and then we can just close off

2844
01:41:26,719 --> 01:41:28,480
with what we're excited to explore in

2845
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:30,719
the dot 2.

2846
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:32,480
i really just appreciate what a lot of

2847
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:34,960
people shared and i think

2848
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:36,239
over these

2849
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:38,560
discussions and the years

2850
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:41,520
we're finding some clarities

2851
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:44,840
around where are different

2852
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:48,400
implications and consequences

2853
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,800
what is entering into active inference

2854
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:53,440
as a field and a filter and what is

2855
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,119
coming out of it what's happening on the

2856
01:41:55,119 --> 01:41:57,520
playground and so there's just a lot to

2857
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:00,719
explore then um livestream 45 just in

2858
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:02,639
the last few weeks

2859
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:05,119
and not to rehearse outside of this

2860
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:07,440
paper regime of attention but the free

2861
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,840
energy principle as it's rehearsed in

2862
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,119
that paper

2863
01:42:11,119 --> 01:42:14,159
is establishing the particular partition

2864
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:14,960
that's

2865
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:17,520
markov blanketing off the figure from

2866
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:19,600
the ground the thing which is able to

2867
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,199
undergo repeated measurements in the

2868
01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:23,840
quantum sense from the thing that is not

2869
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,840
that thing that's the particular

2870
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:28,719
partition with the sensory active

2871
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:30,560
internal external partition the

2872
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:33,040
autonomous states the blanket states

2873
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:34,880
from sparse coupling

2874
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:36,800
unpacking the implications in terms of

2875
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,880
bayesian inference in other words seeing

2876
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,080
the flow

2877
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:43,280
of those states as doing something that

2878
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:45,760
is slash can be modeled as bayesian

2879
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,760
inference and then finally understanding

2880
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:50,159
paths in terms of a principle of least

2881
01:42:50,159 --> 01:42:52,560
action which has been starting to be

2882
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:55,600
explored from at least the early path

2883
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:58,000
formalizations of active inference years

2884
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:58,800
ago

2885
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:01,679
and i think in the last

2886
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:03,679
two weeks to two years

2887
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:06,080
taking a new view on that

2888
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:07,920
through a lot of the work on geometry

2889
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:11,760
and analysis by dalton maxwell and other

2890
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:14,400
collaborators so indeed this path

2891
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:17,920
formalization is very relevant and the

2892
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:19,760
principle of least action which isn't

2893
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,920
the principle of least motion it's not

2894
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:23,840
the laziest thing it's not the one that

2895
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:25,520
always works it's none of those things

2896
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:28,000
but it's a framework for analyzing

2897
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,199
behavior

2898
01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:31,199
and with that

2899
01:43:31,199 --> 01:43:33,840
what would people be excited to explore

2900
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:35,840
next week or what would be something

2901
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:37,840
that they didn't

2902
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:40,159
have uncertainty or motivational drive

2903
01:43:40,159 --> 01:43:42,480
to explore before today but it has come

2904
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:43,760
onto their horizon through this

2905
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:46,239
discussion

2906
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:54,239
yes ali then dean dude

2907
01:43:56,159 --> 01:43:58,480
uh well it was uh it was a really

2908
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:01,119
fascinating discussion and uh

2909
01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:03,119
i thank you all for bringing such

2910
01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:04,880
interesting

2911
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:06,480
interesting topics

2912
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,400
um

2913
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,440
onto the table but um i'm very much

2914
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:14,639
looking forward to that too and uh

2915
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:17,119
i also had a couple of questions i'm

2916
01:44:17,119 --> 01:44:19,199
interested in exploring uh the

2917
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:21,760
phenomenological aspects of folk

2918
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,320
psychology especially

2919
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,080
belief and desire

2920
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:27,119
and also

2921
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:29,840
the relation of dai to

2922
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:32,960
abnormal psychology which is

2923
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:35,600
just briefly touched on in the paper but

2924
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:36,639
uh not

2925
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:39,199
in detail and uh

2926
01:44:39,199 --> 01:44:42,480
yeah i hope uh the next session

2927
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:45,119
uh will be at least as fascinating as

2928
01:44:45,119 --> 01:44:46,560
this one

2929
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:49,440
thank you ali dean

2930
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,199
i already said what i'm hoping we can

2931
01:44:51,199 --> 01:44:52,880
look at in this point too but i'll just

2932
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,760
add this i think it's really interesting

2933
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:58,400
that the term active inference

2934
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:00,960
um i'll just say in in this calendar

2935
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:03,280
year alone we've had a couple of papers

2936
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:05,440
that have started typing active

2937
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:06,800
inference we've had

2938
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,119
outside the skull or extended active

2939
01:45:09,119 --> 01:45:12,080
inference and now we've got this dai and

2940
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:14,560
mai and i think there's probably going

2941
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:15,760
to be more

2942
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:17,600
and so depending on how many authors are

2943
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:20,159
available next week i might be asking

2944
01:45:20,159 --> 01:45:21,920
them a little bit about that too like is

2945
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:23,440
that does that seem like

2946
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:26,080
a natural roll out when you have these

2947
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:28,960
scale-free ideas that you need these

2948
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:31,840
these scale-friendly qualifiers just so

2949
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:35,280
that it continues to make sense

2950
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:37,040
thank you do it and then i'll make a

2951
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,679
point on that dean

2952
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:41,840
yeah and because this is my first uh

2953
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:43,679
time site a lot of general stuff on

2954
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:46,080
active inference in general and i try to

2955
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:47,199
stick straight

2956
01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:49,040
to this paper um i think it'd be

2957
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:51,119
interesting to cover more i asked the

2958
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:53,119
question you know has active inference

2959
01:45:53,119 --> 01:45:55,360
even explained one qualia

2960
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:57,679
and uh you know that uh

2961
01:45:57,679 --> 01:45:59,600
you know there's actually a model here

2962
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:03,199
in in the equations could we describe

2963
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:05,520
a single process a single

2964
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:08,000
sense perception to decision making

2965
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,560
and uh you know so like the human model

2966
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:13,199
to uh um

2967
01:46:13,199 --> 01:46:16,800
a simpler life form or even say that uh

2968
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,320
is in essence the you know the

2969
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:19,920
automation like the machine learning

2970
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,119
algorithms

2971
01:46:21,119 --> 01:46:23,119
uh for robotic arms

2972
01:46:23,119 --> 01:46:25,600
um is that in essence using these same

2973
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:26,400
active

2974
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:27,440
inference

2975
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:29,280
computers i spoke to you know brac

2976
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:30,800
online who i guess is an entrepreneur

2977
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,400
thinking like real estate

2978
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:35,360
uh but uh is is it

2979
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:37,440
yeah what would the application of this

2980
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:39,040
be uh

2981
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:40,880
to uh

2982
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,560
you know autonomous cars are more

2983
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:44,400
complicated but like something the most

2984
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:47,040
simplified version which is probably uh

2985
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:50,880
robotic sensors and controlled movement

2986
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:54,719
based on machine learning that uh and uh

2987
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:56,239
and then

2988
01:46:56,239 --> 01:46:58,080
you know i said could we

2989
01:46:58,080 --> 01:46:59,760
try to explain

2990
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:02,560
a single qualia in terms of what happens

2991
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:03,920
when

2992
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:05,760
i sent something

2993
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:07,199
and

2994
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:09,119
make some sort of movement

2995
01:47:09,119 --> 01:47:11,119
and then i was talking what would all of

2996
01:47:11,119 --> 01:47:14,480
the axioms uh necessary to in terms of

2997
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:15,520
the

2998
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:18,000
higher order rules or goal-oriented

2999
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,840
behavior if they're not beliefs desires

3000
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:22,560
intentions what are they and how are

3001
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:24,800
they modeled into the equation what

3002
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,800
happens when i perceive something and

3003
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:29,040
that's translated into action uh what

3004
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:31,600
axioms do we have to put into the model

3005
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:34,320
to make it work as opposed to uh or in

3006
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:37,119
comparison to the robotic arm that's

3007
01:47:37,119 --> 01:47:39,600
coded for that does that

3008
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:42,159
thank you to all those returning and

3009
01:47:42,159 --> 01:47:45,280
first time and our second applied active

3010
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:47,199
inference symposium which is going to be

3011
01:47:47,199 --> 01:47:51,360
in july 2022 is on robotics so we can

3012
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:53,040
absolutely address a lot of the

3013
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:54,320
applications

3014
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:55,679
and also

3015
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:57,040
adjacencies

3016
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:59,600
and the the sense that i got maybe just

3017
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:02,320
thinking of that robotic case is like a

3018
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:04,800
little wind-up toy on a table we want to

3019
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:06,080
build it

3020
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:06,880
and

3021
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,320
this discussion

3022
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:11,360
because of how it is constituted and

3023
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:14,159
enacted is helping us understand not

3024
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:16,960
just all of the implications that go

3025
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:19,840
into that wind-up toy but exploring a

3026
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,159
lot of the consequences of the wind-up

3027
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:24,639
toy and then there's people saying but

3028
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:26,159
wasn't the table constructed and

3029
01:48:26,159 --> 01:48:27,840
wouldn't a different table have resulted

3030
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:29,920
in a different wind-up toy behavior and

3031
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:31,840
who placed it on the table and why are

3032
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:34,400
tables designed that way and isn't table

3033
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:36,320
just like a functional consequence of

3034
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:38,320
anything being put on it and what are we

3035
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:40,639
doing here how did we decide on that how

3036
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:42,159
should we decide the next wind-up toy

3037
01:48:42,159 --> 01:48:44,719
and it just takes it in so many amazing

3038
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:47,360
places so thanks to everybody in the

3039
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:49,440
chat and joining live and of course to

3040
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:52,400
the authors for the paper

3041
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:55,759
see you in 46.2

3042
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:57,520
thank you chance

3043
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:00,520
bye

3044
