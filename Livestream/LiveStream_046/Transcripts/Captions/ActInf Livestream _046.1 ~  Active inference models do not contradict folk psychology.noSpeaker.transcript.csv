"Unknown","00;00;28;06","00;00;56;21","Hello and welcome, everyone. It's June 15th, 2022, and we're here in Acton five live stream number 46.1. Welcome up and mute the stream if you have in the background. Doo doo doo doo doo doo Thank you. Welcome to the Active Inference Lab. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference you can find us at some of the links on this slide."
"Unknown","00;00;57;23","00;01;23;00","This is a recorded and an archived and transcribed and edited and published live stream. So please provide feedback so we can improve our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll be following good video etiquette for livestreams. Head over to active inference dot org to learn more about livestreams and a lot of the other projects that are happening in the lab."
"Unknown","00;01;24;08","00;01;55;04","So we're here in Active Stream 46.1, and we're in our second discussion of the paper Active Inference Models Do Not Contradict Folk Psychology by Ryan Smith, Marshall Ramstad and Alex Keefer. And we're going to go I expect in many fun and interesting directions today. So thanks everybody who has joined the panel live. And also for those who are watching live, thanks for adding your comments in the live chat."
"Unknown","00;01;55;21","00;02;32;13","We'll begin with some introductions and then I believe that will introduce many interesting areas. We can continue from there so we can start by just introducing ourself and then passing it to someone else who has not yet spoken. And we'll close with the authors who are here. So I'm Daniel. I'm a researcher in California, and the DART Zero was very interesting with Yaakov and Dean and Ryan, and it raised many questions that I was excited to discuss today."
"Unknown","00;02;33;12","00;03;18;16","Just to provide one would be perhaps the relationship between Formalisms of any kinds and natural language and just regular concepts that people have. How do we draw the connection or evaluate connections that are drawn there? And I'll pass to Ali questions I'd like to ask if they're not but oh, sorry. Sorry. Just the audio is a set up a little bit differently."
"Unknown","00;03;18;28","00;03;23;17","So if you could just start you can just reintroduce, but go for it. Thank you."
"Unknown","00;03;25;22","00;03;48;25","OK, is it OK? Yes. Yes, thank you. All right. Yeah. I'm an independent researcher from Iran. And as I said, I also have a couple of questions I'd like to ask if they're not addressed during the discussion, especially when we get to Section nine of the paper and I'm very glad to be here. And that's it for me."
"Unknown","00;03;48;25","00;03;57;24","And I'll pass it to Dean Morning. My name's Dean. I'm here in Calgary."
"Unknown","00;03;59;28","00;04;34;04","I really like this paper, which I kind of indicated in the last, last livestream my my curiosity, because I really don't know is because my background in education, when I'm looking at that sort of qualification quantification and ease, and I'm thinking about the desires as something that we can see as point one and point nine as a distribution, I often thought of some of my previous conversations around things like Likert scales."
"Unknown","00;04;34;08","00;05;02;28","So I know this paper doesn't address those things specifically, but the idea of being able to translate into sort of a numeric form has always been interesting to me. And that's something that maybe today or maybe in the point to, we can we can think about the implications of that, and I'll pass it to David and David Kelton here."
"Unknown","00;05;03;03","00;05;32;27","Thanks for having me on my first time here, an active inference inference. I go by David as a streamer. I'm a civil engineer by education and practice my background, linguistics and physics and psychology I spent many years in Yeshiva Rabbinic study and have been a practicing Hindu. I'm more on the mystical side of consciousness. I've been studying it actively streaming for a few years, but also the mathematical materialistic side."
"Unknown","00;05;32;27","00;06;02;03","So this paper was very interesting, especially dealing with the sense perception related to motor control, which, you know, my perception of dualism is something that the material does actually control. So I like the model of the paper. I was interested in looking at some of the more philosophical and even the mystical precursors, what could actually be explained, what are the assumptions being being made."
"Unknown","00;06;02;03","00;06;29;11","And this paper was definitely a good start thank you, David, and to Alex. So feel free to give any introduction and then provide any context on what brought about the paper from your perspective. Yeah, thanks. So I'm Alex Keefer. I'm one of the authors on the paper I'm affiliated with with Monash University and Yankelovich. So cognition and philosophy out there."
"Unknown","00;06;29;12","00;07;04;21","And I currently also I mean my main sort of gig is a versus research labs in L.A. So we've been doing some really interesting research there that plugs into active inference, among other things. So as far as the context for the paper, so this is this issue of how, how and whether active inference and ends and theories in the vicinity like predictive processing and all that, how those things map on the folks psychology is something I've been interested in for a long time."
"Unknown","00;07;05;11","00;07;39;11","Before I spoke to Ryan and Maxwell about this paper and I won't try to give Ryan's side of the of the back story, but basically he was, I think, planning on drafting something along these lines for independently we got in touch through Carl first and I think and it was pointed out that I was drafting something on the same thing and then I ended up just hopping on board to work on certain sections and to sort of to sort of help carry through the argument."
"Unknown","00;07;40;22","00;08;02;27","So that's a little bit of background on some what sections we can look at the roadmap did you work on or also if you have any thoughts on this overall structure of like what sections did you include and why did you order them in that way? Yeah, I mean, I guess, I mean, really, we share credit for it for all of it."
"Unknown","00;08;02;27","00;08;32;20","Like it's there isn't anything, you know, I mean, we attribute it to the, to the whole paper, but the sections that I was more that I leaned more on maybe and that I contributed more to were the thing about quantifying the motivational force of desires, section seven. And then we also had a bunch of back and forth about the last few sections three energy principle and direction that yeah."
"Unknown","00;08;32;28","00;08;56;25","So I mean, Ryan being the first author, that definitely, definitely did a lot of the writing. So but those are the sections that I had more, more to do with search. Awesome. And then just one more question, Alex, and then we can go back to our open list of topics. What would you characterize the big question of the paper?"
"Unknown","00;08;57;18","00;09;34;11","What do you think would bring somebody to this paper? Because they were wondering X? Yeah, I mean, so it's pretty I think it's pretty clear in this in this case, right? Fortunately, it's pretty easy. It's just the question is whether the active inference formalism, particularly a certain strain of that of the sort of the street decision decision model flavor of activism is is consistent with or compatible with folk psychology and the model in particular great."
"Unknown","00;09;36;03","00;10;06;28","OK. And then also, what would you characterize the PTI model as a then we'll open up for more questions, but just to get some of the prerequisites in, you're right that it is great that it is clear many papers have much more esoteric big questions. And this one is very like down the middle. Yeah. Yeah. One thing I liked about working with with Ryan is that he he sort of wanted to just make the title of the paper, a declarative sentence that says, well, this is what we're claiming."
"Unknown","00;10;07;12","00;10;30;02","And I really like that. I try to follow that some of work but the video model, I don't think I have a whole lot to add here either. It's just the idea fundamentally that beliefs and desires interact to form intentions and that that's I guess maybe also that that that's a legitimate way to explain behavior for some classes."
"Unknown","00;10;30;02","00;11;13;05","This systems intelligent systems people agents all right. Awesome. So I'll Dean or David, if you have any questions you'd like to raise at this time. Otherwise we'll go into one of these pieces we've raised. Yes, David, it was the I'd never heard of Hilton or the folk psychology building model. Is that a prominent model you purposely chose or could this be your fill in for basically any nonscientific or introspective or even dualist model for for consciousness?"
"Unknown","00;11;13;05","00;11;21;28","Or is it specific this Hilton model in are you claiming that it fails as a materialistic model?"
"Unknown","00;11;25;16","00;11;49;20","Yeah. So I think I think part of the reason we referred to the BDO model was to just be to sort of bracket for the purposes of the paper, although I'm happy to discuss it here, a lot of questions that might arise about folk psychology and what exactly is meant by that. So if we just say we're talking about the idea that beliefs and desires interact to form intentions, then that's a clear target."
"Unknown","00;11;49;27","00;12;22;00","And then of course there are many different conceptions of many maybe there are many different folk psychology and views on in that study. But like I guess, yes, the VDI model is sort of maybe supposed to be like an essence that you can distill from any of those different perspectives. Now, maybe that's not true. We can talk about whether the body model is really common to different conceptions of folk psychology."
"Unknown","00;12;22;12","00;12;45;14","Uh, because I, you know, I have to think about that. I kind of, I kind of assume that it is. I'm curious about the materialism as an issue I don't see, I guess directly how it plays into things at this level of description, because I guess we're not claiming necessarily that beliefs and desires are material or not at this stage."
"Unknown","00;12;45;14","00;13;18;00","But anyway, happy to get into that. Yeah, feel free to unpack that. David. Yeah. Mm hmm. And just classically, you obviously people have had minds for, you know, as long as human existence, you know, maybe if you believe in Julian Jaynes and evolution, that there was an origin to consciousness in the mind at some point. But, you know, historically, most of the Western tradition up till a few hundred years ago believe that these things originated from a non material source, you know, whether it's your soul, however you want to explain it."
"Unknown","00;13;18;20","00;14;07;07","But, you know, as the controller from the Greek model of the soul, ethos, logos, pathos or any model that, you know. So beliefs and desires that that would be the controller that would be decisive in these cognitive functions don't arise from the material. So if you have a materialistic model where you're saying that these things do in fact arise from the brain, you could say that, you know, the ancients were just incorrect either either in ascribing non material origins to things that have material origins, or you could say they were completely incorrect and like in a limited perspective, that there is no such thing as belief or desire or there is no such thing as,"
"Unknown","00;14;07;18","00;14;32;29","as like a unified a so as a way of human Hylton has some sort of material, a division, even Freud like even even going back to Freud just 100 years ago, the question of the psyche and the subconscious whether that has material origins or not is unclear. Right. Yeah. So, so I guess, I guess my perspective on this, I'm sort of a methodological materialist about these things."
"Unknown","00;14;33;25","00;15;21;27","I think that you can it insofar as so in terms like the scope of this, of this kind of explanation that we discuss in this paper and active inference in general works with, I think any, anything that you can explain about the causes of, of intelligent behavior. I think you can probably put a material gloss on that. But I'm not personally I'm not really committed to the claim that you can explain everything about people in terms of input, output, mappings, you know, but, but insofar as you can conceive of some function, whether cognition, perception or whatever, as a sort of input output mapping and space of behavior, then I think you can explain it using"
"Unknown","00;15;22;12","00;15;56;06","these frameworks interpreted as descriptions of brain processes. So so it's interesting that you kind of contrast or you suggest that maybe there's an argument for a limited tourism. If, if you were thinking of mental states as having a root or a source and something not non-material, maybe then if you reject that idea, then you'd be eliminated as but so I'm very much so coming back to the area and I'm starting from a sort of methodological materialist standpoint, but I'm definitely not limited to this."
"Unknown","00;15;56;06","00;16;18;07","I actually the one thing I wanted to get into today is I really don't understand. I don't understand how eliminates terrorism as a tangible position with respect to folk psychology if you're a materialist, because I think that there's just well, I'll hold off on getting into that. But I think I guess I'll just just have one last comment on this."
"Unknown","00;16;18;07","00;17;03;10","I think the question of whether beliefs and desires, intentions in other mental states have any non material aspect. And the question of whether they exist and whether they should be eliminated from our ontology or are distinct. Hmm. Thank you. I think this is a fine place. We'll have a lot of time to explore other avenues, but it would be awesome if you could describe the limits of ism and also there was a quote in your paper where it says If the worry is founded that there is a tension between active inference and folks psychology, specifically the body model, it could be taken either to imply that active inference models are implausible because reasons or if,"
"Unknown","00;17;03;10","00;17;26;00","and to the extent that the models are successful, to imply that desire should be eliminated from scientific theories of psychology. So what is a limit of ism and how did you interact with that topic? Right. So, so limited tourism is as we're using it here is and I think this is the mainstream distance is is just a view."
"Unknown","00;17;26;00","00;17;51;13","Well, I guess OK, the most general version of the view with respect to anything is just that that that thing should be sort of eliminated from serious discourse or serious theory, maybe scientific theory and I mean, the, the, the idea that the persons have in defending eliminated isn't about folk psychology. Is that it's it's like a failed theory."
"Unknown","00;17;51;28","00;18;21;09","So the idea is if, you know, theories, I suppose survive on the basis of their predictive and explanatory power and some other criteria, you know, theoretical virtues, the ability to evolve and explain new anomalies, apparent anomalies that crop up. So the church ones basically think that folk psychology has failed this test. So the theory of folk psychology is to falsify it and we should just move on and that's it."
"Unknown","00;18;21;19","00;18;33;24","That's I would say, you know, to be sort of more precise, that's that's a version of the limits as applied to mental states. But that's the view that we're really talking about here."
"Unknown","00;18;38;07","00;19;05;28","OK, yes. David, please yeah. I guess, I mean, there's different schools in the limited wisdom, but if you want to take that, the consciousness studies in totality or questions of free will or you know, like I mentioned, the ancient dualistic understanding of consciousness is you could take eliminating some the consciousness in totality that the man is a mechanistic computer."
"Unknown","00;19;06;08","00;19;28;15","And even to you as a mystic, I would argue possibly against the strong interpretation of act of inference that the atheistic element of his model and you might not, you know, for philosophical reasons, not want to be a limit of tests and therefore try to defend it. But then, you know, what are the mathematics? What are your claims actually say?"
"Unknown","00;19;29;00","00;20;03;20","But yeah, I mean the strong level say that there is no there is no belief, there is no desire, there is no unified AI and we're just automating that. The has some sort of threshold interaction with the environment and whatever perception or head that, you know, we have voices in our head that might make us think that we're conscious beings, might make us think that we have self control or, you know, beliefs or even free will are essentially illusions of the mind that have nothing to do with our actions."
"Unknown","00;20;06;07","00;20;27;21","If I could just how do I do follow up? This is the path I think the authors questions. Well, great. Yeah. I would just say it's a good question what how consciousness fits into this picture. And I'm not sure whether whether the version of a limited vision that I took myself to be targeting here includes consciousness or not."
"Unknown","00;20;27;21","00;20;39;02","It's mostly been a view that's focused on the idea of discrete mental states that play these functional roles, beliefs, desires and so forth. So yeah, I definitely think there's further questions about that."
"Unknown","00;20;42;03","00;21;12;02","And I can see yeah, I can see how you might interpret act of inference, not just out of interest, but almost any mainstream sort of theory and like neuro psychology and not being as, as implying a form of a lunatic isn't if you think that these mental states aren't by definition not material, we're not entirely material. But again, I'm happy to get into that for yes."
"Unknown","00;21;13;04","00;22;15;26","The the idea that any kind of modeling by making it specific is approaching or on the road or slippery slope or already reached the point of eliminating the need for appeals outside of that description, it's also possible to consider that an entire category air and say were describing brain processes, which is, I believe, what you said earlier and no description of a sunset is the territory of the sunset mouth is not the territory as we hear often and so how can one be limited first about a process with any kind of description whether it's predictive processing or an active inference or any other kind of model yeah."
"Unknown","00;22;15;27","00;22;39;03","I raise my my hand here. I'll just raise my actual head yeah. I mean, another thing, I just like what you just said that I should bring up here is that, I mean, strictly speaking, I suppose active inference is committed to these being directly descriptions of brain processes. They're right. They're sort of computational models of decision making processes with beliefs and all that."
"Unknown","00;22;39;11","00;23;00;06","And of course, if you take the there's this whole background of the free energy principle and all that that links this to physics and the physics, the physical nature of systems. And I tend to read these models as pretty transparently mapping onto brain processes, but it's not necessarily the case that you need to be committed to that interpretation."
"Unknown","00;23;00;06","00;23;28;12","Of these processes as material processes. When you use active inference to describe some system of the psychological level, and there's of course still a lot of question about how the psychological description maps on to the physical description, which I have views about, but it's an open question. Awesome. Dean. And then so in the paper itself, on page seven, I think there's a paragraph that kind of refers to all of this that we've been talking about."
"Unknown","00;23;28;24","00;24;00;12","I'll just quote it The relationship between conscious and unconscious computation, therefore remains an open question. That said, some specific die models have been used to describe higher level cognitive processes that can generate conscious beliefs and verbal reports. And then it says with the authors are, in these cases, the inferential prediction error minimization process can still be seen as sub personal or unconscious, but the resulting beliefs and decisions themselves are assumed to enter an awareness as a general rule."
"Unknown","00;24;00;12","00;24;31;14","However, some personal processes indeed, I should not be expected to map one to one with consciously accessible or personal processes. Great. So I've copy that up on the slides. And Dean, what do you think that spoke to or what made you want to share that? I just think I do think I think the first author and any other authors were essentially saying, let's make sure that we don't try to conflate things here, that we've we focus in on what we're trying to do here."
"Unknown","00;24;31;22","00;25;08;10","Which is point to the potential of these formalisms explaining something. If a person can self-report, if they can't, there's still aspects of this that might apply. But I think I think they were just trying to clarify exactly what they were pointing to and not pointing to And Ryan Smith has made clearly a line of research as well as multiple live streams and exhortations on social media about this distinction that one can take a cognitive modeling approach of report behavior."
"Unknown","00;25;08;22","00;25;57;08","Did you see that or not? And that can be very clearly, although subtly distinguished from the actual awareness of seeing something. It's not the same thing. To have report behavior as it is to have the experiential underpinning. They're potentially adjacent questions or there's a space that they're linked in a meaningful way. But it's quite possible to blanket literally one's uncertainty about the question of experience, even in a visual or multimodal way from the question of, well, let's just say we had the animal or the computer program in the chair, and now we're making a cognitive model of its report behavior."
"Unknown","00;25;57;27","00;26;38;12","Different question than can the report behavior model be one in the same as what is actually happening? Because there could be an inter leaving stage where they just choose to lie or other all these other kinds of interesting things happening. Ali, Yeah. And just as a brief side note, I think the term psychology here can also be related to the distinction made by Wilfred Sellars between manifest image and the scientific image of human beings and the first image being our understanding of ourselves are as personal and social beings."
"Unknown","00;26;38;25","00;27;20;03","And obviously this image speaks for itself. So I think the term folk psychology can possibly be equivalent to this manifest image of ourselves. And yet this is just a side note I wanted to share how do you see that, Alex? Yeah, I think I mean, I'd almost agree. I would just say maybe I don't I don't think I would say folk psychology is equivalent to the manifest image, but I think it might be a part of it just probably nit picking, but there just might be more to the manifested image of ourselves than just folk psychology."
"Unknown","00;27;20;03","00;27;23;23","But anyway, I basically agree. Yeah."
"Unknown","00;27;32;03","00;28;08;21","Yes. The the question, Dean, anything you want to bring here? No, this reminds me of with the conversations we've had on linguistics how there's one view on language as a entity out there, body of knowledge. And then there's also the person's self construct acted sense of language. And they only have a partial subset of the words, or they use them in a certain way."
"Unknown","00;28;09;13","00;28;49;28","And there's an analogous distinction where there's folk psychology, the academic field of versus people's inner sense, and how do people generate their inner sense of manifest image, if that's appropriate. And how can that be connected and mapped to again, any descriptive model or disciplinary or transdisciplinary model? Alex and then do it. Yeah. So so I really should take the opportunity to say that my conception of how folk psychology works is like thoroughly cellar cellars."
"Unknown","00;28;50;09","00;29;21;06","It's like, I think he got it exactly right. So basically, and it's been a long time since I've tried to recite this, but basically just the idea that this sort of verbal behavior, right, that people enact and engage in, engage in that we end up sort of associating with other things that are going on internally and that through this sort of process, we end up sort of inadvertently in the course of evolutionary history."
"Unknown","00;29;21;06","00;29;47;03","At some point, there's this whole philosophy and myth about this stuff. But basically the idea is that folk psychology sort of arises and introspection and things like that. And I may be putting that in for sellers. And he actually says right now, again, it's been a while, but basically the idea that introspection and our sense of self awareness and stuff like that sort of could have developed out of first outward behavior, right?"
"Unknown","00;29;47;04","00;30;08;24","And then we sort of become sensitive to correlations among these outward signals, and that develops sort of an inner sense in that way. So but the idea, the fundamental idea that's relevant to this discussion in this paper, I think, is that folk psychology is just the name for this, this sort of thing that naturally developed in the course of human history."
"Unknown","00;30;09;03","00;30;33;18","I've got to say, of course, there isn't just one folk psychology right there, for one thing, that people speak different languages. But I do think the piece of it that I think is is pretty pretty safe to say is true or I think and that we meant to capture and this is my take on why we are using the PDI model is that I mean pretty much anyone this isn't entirely true."
"Unknown","00;30;33;18","00;31;07;00","There are different, you know, dialects and things, but basically if you want to understand why somebody did something, you can say, oh, they believed X and they wanted Y, right? And they intended to and that that's the level at which I, I mean, to sort of endorse folk psychology is just I don't see how that sort of psychological and I got to say, it's not for me my motivation for sort of wanting to defensive folk psychology isn't really anything to do with introspection."
"Unknown","00;31;07;00","00;31;25;26","Or consciousness. It's just we obviously use these, these terms to explain behavior and we do it very successfully. And so I don't I don't think it could be the case that these terms fail to carry information about the states that people are in. So I don't this is why I don't quite get the element to this argument."
"Unknown","00;31;28;04","00;32;16;14","Anyway, that's going a bit far afield for we started doing it and then anyone else yeah. Well, I think I mean, as a say, a spiritual is the limit of its argument. This thing, that's the natural conclusion of what you're saying and you're drawing from the dualistic tradition when you use these terminologies. So, you know, say that all of the thousands of years of Western tradition that believed in the soul and then you want to borrow the terminology from a materialistic point of view, it may not be be accurate and follow the evidence and think, you know, Jerry Fodor and the modular mind or Benjamin Liebowitz experiments that you what is active inference actually saying"
"Unknown","00;32;16;14","00;32;54;23","that's a threshold that is reached that causes activity. You know like we've it's famous experiments where a the threshold is reached and it could be measured in the brain before the you know called the active conscious part of the person recognizes that and if it was like a modular mind that you have multiple conflicting parts of the person that could have beliefs and motivation but what we would call the you're the module of the mind that creates the narrative for us is only one of those and that's just one active to the person."
"Unknown","00;32;54;23","00;33;19;17","So when I interact with myself or you interact with another person through language, you only have access to that one part of the brain that creates a narrative but, you know, said to leave its experiments and you know, you know, more recent experience has demonstrated that that's now likely the part that controls action. And your act of inference didn't exist then."
"Unknown","00;33;19;25","00;33;42;28","I mean, Bayesian mechanics did. But you're saying it's it's a threshold and there's all sorts of things that cause a person's threshold to be reached. And the act of inference could potentially model that and then if you even you put in your paper that you could include things like, you know, if you want to call beliefs or desires as higher order rules."
"Unknown","00;33;42;28","00;34;25;11","So even at the point there may not be a mechanistic understanding of what's the origin or how these higher order rules operate, but it would be some sort of your free energy principle, some sort of mathematical reduction of a threshold being reached where the sum totality of conscious and subconscious factors cause the action and even the person ourselves through introspection isn't going to have full access to that if I can just respond here, I think first of all, just to be respectful to my coauthors, I should say, because I might get into my own views here, which they don't necessarily share it at all."
"Unknown","00;34;25;22","00;34;56;08","But I should say, I think this paper is really targeted at explaining the connections potentially or clarifying the connection between folk psychology and whatever. It's whatever its implications, right? Either whether whether psychology carries implications of social type things because of its roots. Maybe it does. But anyway, it's it's trying to clarify the connections between active inference as just a sort of a formal theory of decision making and folk psychology."
"Unknown","00;34;58;02","00;35;57;26","I don't so anyway, it's neutral technically on the issue of whether active inference is true or is an exhaustive, exhaustive or true description of what we are and what we do know, maybe there's still an issue there. If you if you really think that folk psychology, that the terms very terms of folk psychology carry dualistic implications and if you and if you think that active inference carries materialistic implications, then there's still a problem, I guess I guess I'm I don't I don't really know if I if I agree with either of those, but yeah, I mean, I, I don't, I guess I don't see how the I don't see how, how active inference as such"
"Unknown","00;35;58;12","00;36;28;13","implies anything one way or the other. The other about whether there are non-material origins to the behavior it's I guess, OK, I can see let me try me try to see if I can. I'm just trying to see if I get your arguments. David. So it's like we're saying that active inference or let's say active inference as a framework says that this is how decisions happen."
"Unknown","00;36;28;19","00;36;55;29","You do a search over policies which are these discrete things, and you figure out the expected free energy, which has to do with preparing sensory data to expected sensory data. And I guess if you think you think all of those components are pieces of the material thing, right? They're all beliefs or desires or something like that, which you take to be I mean, actually, I think I can answer this."
"Unknown","00;36;55;29","00;37;26;09","Sorry. I realize I'm not I'm not in the best job at this right now, but at least I'm getting this is difficult is I'm glad you bring this stuff up because this is actually this gets quite challenging. But I think so so active inference is this theory of of well, DARPA is this theory of of discrete decision making that appeals to this to these distributions or things that are like for distribution, for distributions."
"Unknown","00;37;26;09","00;37;50;27","Right. Belief distribution and desire or preference distribution I don't think it says anything about where the preference distribution comes from. And in particular, I don't think it says that it doesn't come from the soul or, you know, or some some deeper thing. So that's that's switched from me trying to rationally reconstruct your argument to me, trying to rebut it."
"Unknown","00;37;50;27","00;38;18;15","Sorry about that. But I'm just trying to make some progress. Well, let me try to walk through some of these steps, because I agree it's an important distinction. So the focus of the paper, the regime of attention of the paper, very clearly written to remain on a line because there's many open threads related to, for example, different cultural folk psychologies, various folk psychology models, various metaphysical claims."
"Unknown","00;38;19;00","00;39;06;22","The paper was focused on identifying one possible area of incompatibility, which would be the relationship between the BTI model entities and the nodes in the VDI graph and assignment of terms for specific parts of the active formalism and identifying that we'll come back to. Now, then, as has been pointed out today, one could ask if folk psychology carries a dualist implication in the sense of their being material and non material types of things, whether implicitly or axiomatically or historically."
"Unknown","00;39;07;04","00;39;41;18","But if folk psychology has dualist implication and active inference carries a purely materialist implication, implicitly or explicitly, then there could be another like battlefront of tension which would not be based around mapping the nodes in the body model to the nodes or the formalisms in the active formalism, which is like a theory theory ontology map question. But this would actually be a metaphysical core incompatibility."
"Unknown","00;39;42;06","00;40;11;28","And then Alex, you walk through some steps that said if active inference is a framework that says this is going to be a model of how decisions happen, there's a search over discrete policies, there's the calculation of variation of free energy and or expected free energy. And then you added as part of a material thing. Then it is going to be incompatible with anything immaterial."
"Unknown","00;40;12;21","00;40;49;18","However, one could also simply say active is a descriptive framework, saying, here's how I will model how decisions happen as a search over discrete policies and as the calculation of f e. Then there might be one, two, three, four kinds of things in the universe, or it could be anything. But this is where the materialism enters is actually as a clause in the assumptions of that string rather than materialism arising as a consequence of the neutral, descriptive, formal basis of the framework what do you think about that, Alex?"
"Unknown","00;40;50;17","00;41;17;20","Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Daniel, for articulating that so well. I think that's basically right. And just as a specific example, even if you, even if you go so far as to think that you can map this formalized formalism onto brain states you don't have to think that brain states get their status as desires or beliefs just from their material constitution."
"Unknown","00;41;17;20","00;41;35;11","Right. I mean, you could say if you believe that free will arises in microtubules for example or something, I don't know how that works. That that theory, by the way, I don't mean to disparage it. I just I don't know how it works. So I'm using it as an example. Maybe you think that free will kind of somehow bubbles up through this free will at smaller scales or something, right."
"Unknown","00;41;35;18","00;41;45;07","So I just don't think that even if we take this as a description of the brain, that we're committed to anything so heavy as materialism thanks, Alex, to it."
"Unknown","00;41;48;06","00;42;35;09","Yeah. I appreciate your research. I, I'm not here to debate dualism here. I just saying that if we could recognize what are the assumptions or axioms. So you have questions and that's why I like your focus on, on motor control connected to sense perception. So if there is your perception of a unified A and even, you know, like Daniel and his research on ants or something like that, that OK, there's, you know, David, Alex, Daniel, all the panels, the alien dean that that are talking to each other, we might refer to ourself as a name, but is there a unified I and you know, that's an axiom that is based on a dualistic tradition that"
"Unknown","00;42;35;09","00;43;09;11","may or may not be accurate. And if you said, well, there's a sum total of forces that are limited through the free energy principle that we refer to as unified, I that makes decisions, but that's more a lexical misnomer. And even if you think Daniel's research on ants or something like that, that a question like is there a unified and that avoids death, that tries to survive, why does the ant have some sort of will to live if I argue that that's also man materialistic, the ants will to live or that there is a unified force."
"Unknown","00;43;10;06","00;43;34;10","So, I mean, you could have a materialistic explanation like higher order rules and just leave it that I believe that these higher order rules stem from genetics or some sort of, you know, parallel like and reverse anthropomorphic zation of machine learning where an ant has some sort of will to survive. And therefore, you know, if you try to step on an ant, it's going to move the other direction."
"Unknown","00;43;34;20","00;44;09;27","Or something like that. Well, is there actually unified force in the ant that is telling it to survive, that causes it to act in a unified way? Or is it just, you know, the free energy principle and a reduction of all of the various sense perceptions and, and know. So we are using these axioms from a dualistic perspective, you know, like specifically are called the unified I that makes more sense as a man material force that uses the I that's not my body chooses to make this action."
"Unknown","00;44;10;23","00;44;37;20","And so if of inference saying no, it's a sum total of sense perception, some sort of higher order rules that are acquired through a combination of genetics and other machine like processes that that we use the language description in as a but you know the mathematics is real thing that's not really accurate."
"Unknown","00;44;40;02","00;45;16;02","And Alex, to you and I'll also just recall way back when in 2222222 when we discussed your paper Psychophysical Identity and free energy, which very directly tackles this question of identity, materialism, physical ism, various other interests. You just want to drop that note and feel free to reply that. Yeah, that's great. Yeah. Yeah. The reason I get so excited about this stuff is that I care about it and I definitely don't take like a sort of default materialist position on this stuff."
"Unknown","00;45;17;12","00;45;48;12","So I guess, I mean, overall, David, my, my view here is sort of about the self and the self and the self with a capital S, maybe in some Buddhist type traditions. I'm actually a fairly far on the, on the mystical end of the spectrum myself. And, and for that reason I don't expect that. I'm sorry, this is maybe not addressing what you said or not nuanced, but basically the gist of how I see this is you shouldn't expect that thing, the really special thing that we don't want to eliminate."
"Unknown","00;45;48;25","00;46;09;06","You shouldn't expect it to show up in our descriptions of things because you can't describe it anyway. It's transcendent. So, you know, even if the brain is identical with the mind, insofar as we can describe the mind, the mind isn't identical with the mind insofar as people describe the mind, right? It's the, it's the thing. It's the big self that we can't ever pin down with words."
"Unknown","00;46;09;28","00;46;43;24","And actually out of respect for that thing, I am happy for it not to show up in the descriptions that we give of how the how that material stuff works or even how how anything works. Right. Because insofar as you can reduce it to a description, it's not a thing thanks, Alex. And to kind of add some thoughts there, the paper clearly delineates two variants or applications of the active inference formalism, which is an eye motor active inference and DFI decision active inference."
"Unknown","00;46;44;07","00;47;16;10","And the two theories differ in at least two important ways or two to these two applications of the frameworks differ in at least two important ways. The first is the phenomena that they are targeting to describe whether discrete decision making in planning behavior or whether motor behavior and then there's the question of discrete and continuous modeling. And so for reasons of biology and historical precedent, the motor models have come from the continuous category."
"Unknown","00;47;17;10","00;47;47;27","While many of the decision making models, which often map onto things that are legitimately categorical in the world like a teams or a planning or a sentence generation task, has a discrete ness or categorical ness to its basis and that made me think about linear regression, as I really like to think about. Because in the history of linear regressions, no one said, you used a linear regression to model the stimuli, intensity and the behavioral response."
"Unknown","00;47;48;12","00;48;25;02","So you think people are a linear regression, and this is another mathematical formalism that is in some ways, although I'm happy to also update my model on this is able to be interpreted, but not the only interpretation as having an equal epistemic claim to the territory as a linear model because there are formalisms and the least squares error in a linear regression that which fits, which is not the only norm one could choose, but whatever function is used as the imperative to fit that linear regression could be playing an analogous role to the calculation of variation of free energy."
"Unknown","00;48;25;13","00;48;54;23","It could be purely understood as a modeling Harris stick that's used to make statistical comparisons within a model. And then also the linear regression framework can be used to make discrete decisions like breakpoint regression, where you can contrast two different alternative models, and you can say, Is it more consistent with one regression, or is it possible that there is some breakpoint a two parameter model that we're going to identify?"
"Unknown","00;48;55;07","00;49;17;08","And so I try to always be thinking like we're on the freeway and here's the action framework and here's the linear regression framework. And if there's going to be some claim about active inference or free energy principle at all about what the formalism means, I always like jumping from car to car and thinking, would people or do they or have they said that about linear regression?"
"Unknown","00;49;17;29","00;49;51;13","And if they can't, there better be a good reason why they can't. For example, people who are committed to taking an interpretation of the territory based upon anything of the active map, do they think that that is something that's true of all different statistical modeling frameworks and they'd apply that to a linear regression, or is there something difference in the act of inference formalisms that legitimize or warrant that kind of a interpretation beyond the linear regression that is the first point."
"Unknown","00;49;51;26","00;50;26;13","And then the second point was about Alex very beautifully said with like not expecting the transcendence and that which cannot be named or however we want to think about that space to appear in the imminence and the specific realizations, I think it's very important that the axioms are stated in self-contained scientific argumentation and rhetoric. Although unstated axioms come in at least two types."
"Unknown","00;50;26;28","00;50;51;21","One are the secret axioms that you made and snuck in. Like we didn't mention this issue, but we're going to use it as if it was an axiom in our deployment of a broader argument later in Section nine, alternatively, an issue might not be addressed because the argument is agnostic or orthogonal or blanketed with respect to that axiom."
"Unknown","00;50;52;09","00;51;53;00","Like you didn't mention what color shirt you're wearing because not you're going to use it and slip it in to the argument later, but rather that the argument being made is uncorrelated or is not related to the shirt color. So I think that the potentially even aware avoidance of the metaphysical baggage precursor exploration in this paper is not to say that the issues are unimportant as various other work by all the authors actually speaks to, but rather that this can be understood as a specific sequence of thoughts and rhetoric and symbols that update belief on the relatively narrow, although still quite broad question of whether the concepts categories of D and I can map two"
"Unknown","00;51;53;06","00;52;22;07","aspects of the active framework, just like the linear regression slope could be mapped on to the concept influence of X on why not that that still wouldn't have some ability to be critiqued in the future and nuanced by future modeling but you could say the linear regression model is not inconsistent, does not contradict, not that it proves, but it does not contradict folk regression ology."
"Unknown","00;52;23;05","00;53;06;09","So active inference models do not contradict folk psychology. Linear regression models do not contradict or negate folk causal inference. Anything that's going to break beyond that epistemic map is going to need to make a special case beyond people have interpreted this way or somebody who wasn't paying attention might make the mistake of believing X so sorry for the extended piece there, but I think there's so many important aspects that this paper like either guides us on and also takes us to a vista of the I'm not going to be able to articulate it as clearly as you just did."
"Unknown","00;53;06;14","00;53;46;16","Here's my thing. So coming out the paper with my background, my question ended up being, so if we're going to compare something that adds two things up, a belief and a desire and out pops and then an intention and then last week with Alex on the sorry, Alex with Brian on here, we started moving to the idea that with expected free energy, you get the ability to see the discrete the difference between the ambiguous and the risk was a difference so it's not an a not an adding up to come to some conclusion."
"Unknown","00;53;46;16","00;54;23;00","It was an actual knowing that we want to try to move things that are apart closer together. And so from the standpoint of writing the paper now the question is can those things work in concert? Can, can one approach which says these things add up and then we behave accordingly, work at the same time as this other way of quantifying, which says there's a variational part that we're trying to minimize and there's an expected part that we're trying to juggle as well."
"Unknown","00;54;23;17","00;54;49;16","And so I think when you get to the closer to the end of the paper and you talk about the world to mind in the mind world, that isn't necessarily always at it. That's still a differential. But I don't think you as as writers of this paper is qualified. What's going on with the well, we can add these two things together and this is what pops up."
"Unknown","00;54;49;22","00;55;35;27","All I think and it's said paper many times is under these particular types of sins, the difference seems to seems to also determine what degree of desire or belief or DUCs. I can't say doc says that he might pertain to that expected free free and sorry expected free energy difference so again that's not as eloquent as Daniel or you can describe it, but from somebody who's way down here and just try to make sure that in my own head that image right there, that's up there where suddenly the circumstances have changed."
"Unknown","00;55;36;09","00;55;57;13","And I've gone to a desire that says, well, I can't change gravity. So when make the biggest crater I possibly can instead of the outcome, which I like, which is to continue to exist, maybe my entity my identity now is how big a hole in the earth I can make. So that's a difference as opposed to an adding up."
"Unknown","00;55;59;08","00;56;31;09","Thanks Alex, feel free to respond. And also we'll look at expected free energy and the simulation. It'll be great to explore those. Yeah, cool. Yeah. So I think I got the point about halfway through. I'm seeing where you're getting it. It's interesting. So I think, I mean, the first first my first answer was, well, OK, if we we shouldn't think of belief plus desire equals intention as literally involving as some you know, I've been doing a lot of a lot of writing code lately is for work."
"Unknown","00;56;31;09","00;56;53;15","And I would think of it as like, well, we define the sum operator for belief and desire as just the thing that active inference does right essentially. Right. Basically, belief plus desire means take the case of divergence. But a more informative answer is, I mean, if you want to think of it as a mathematical type operation, like a sum or a difference, I think you're right in that it's much more like a difference."
"Unknown","00;56;53;15","00;57;12;16","It's much more like intention equals desire minus belief that. Right. So it's like you have your model of the world. You see what the difference is between the belief in the and the sorry, between your model and currently sorry. You have your model of what you want the world to be like. Rather, you see what the difference is between that and your model of what the world is like."
"Unknown","00;57;12;19","00;57;37;00","And, and that gives you the aspects special free energy. But I know you said we get to this in a second. Daniel but I think you could pretty much literally see this in the aspect of free energy, in this case a term there, right? So yeah. So you could expand that. So Q the divergence between Q and P, you can, you can write this out in a way that where you're subtracting one entropy from another, basically."
"Unknown","00;57;37;07","00;58;03;11","And so you can see it as literally a difference. So if you, if you want to map it on to the difference concept, then it's pretty straightforward. And that's one feature of the logarithm function as a modeling heuristic, not metaphysical truth. That division is a division of different terms like the ratio is related to the subtraction of the log of the ratio."
"Unknown","00;58;03;19","00;58;30;07","So there's various reasons why like log likelihoods are used, and it's also a core function that's deployed in the scale divergence as well as entropy terms. And then just. Yes, David, but just to get through the variables here, it's written out in the paper, but a scale divergence is describing a divergence, not a distance between what are on the two sides of the double line."
"Unknown","00;58;31;01","00;59;05;11","And this is the Q Variational distribution of observations over a time horizon. Conditioned upon policy, which serves also a very important function heuristically, especially in the discrete case and the divergence between that observations conditioned on policy and the posterior distribution on observe actions through time. So just that's what's in the khail term. And we explore this also more on the dot zero and we can return to it as well."
"Unknown","00;59;05;11","00;59;55;26","But just wanted to clarify and contextualize this to some of our early discussions like this is the Y equals X plus B of this framework and the least squares is like fitting the minimum of something. And so again, to go beyond the interpretation of linear modeling here not that this is a linear model requires sometimes describing this either the specifics of this model and how it differs or taking a vaster or potentially extremely untenable position about the naive interpretation of variables in arbitrary equations, which I think is fair to say is an untenable position, which puts the onus of people making metaphysical interpretations or claims about this line into a place where the specifics of"
"Unknown","00;59;55;26","01;00;33;03","this line must be addressed. Dean. And then just real quick, I think for me it's hard to determine whether or not a relationship or a diversion or the difference is material or not. And so for me, sometimes that just depends. Sometimes I can actually see the edges of the relationship and sometimes it's very, very fluid and it's hard to determine whether or not there's something material about that."
"Unknown","01;00;33;15","01;01;10;03","And that's actually baked into this formula, too. So I don't know what others think about that. But I mean, there is an aspect of this that is written in, but I don't know if we can actually lock it down and say that that thing, that relationship there is actually material or not. So thanks, Steve. Devitt, it yeah. I think the activity, you know, just looking at it as a statistical model could be used to model any higher order rules were feedback mechanism, whether the origins of them are material or not."
"Unknown","01;01;10;03","01;01;43;24","So we don't have to go in America around talking about what's the origin of these higher order rules. And yeah, I was just thinking the you know, the phenomenon of folk psychology applying to humans and the belief desire, intention model if we were looking at a simpler model, you know, I think like obviously your Daniel studied ants, but at what level is there a sense perception and motor control and does that need a controller?"
"Unknown","01;01;43;25","01;02;19;25","Is it just a pure feedback mechanism like action reaction? And their decision is made based on higher order rules that, you know, I don't know if you consider an ant, if you're just simplify it like eat, survive. And even you know, if an ant doesn't have reproduce, if even you eliminated like an ant colony where only the queen reproduces, and possibly in humans, you could say the only difference between a human and the ant is you add the reproduce, but you have these higher order rules of basically survive."
"Unknown","01;02;20;10","01;02;48;16","And you maybe that's maybe there's only one higher order rule, or maybe you want to give a whole bunch of higher order rules. And then you define that in your free energy principle. Like, of course, you have the sense perception and then you have the movement and you so how you define the variables in the feedback mechanism act of inference, a mathematical framework could model it no matter how you define it."
"Unknown","01;02;48;26","01;03;14;10","And you know, this thing also mean you obviously were focusing on humans, but it might be more simplified to focus on. You're the most simplified species, even plants maybe that they don't have the survival instinct that they and they have some sort of survival instinct. But like an insect that could try to survive as they try to squash an insect, it's going to move in order to try to survive."
"Unknown","01;03;14;21","01;03;39;01","And that's a clear example of sense perception. The insect senses me. You're trying to trying to kill it, God forbid, and then moves out of the way of what exactly caused it. And so you're just going to hypothesize, well, of course, it has some sort of survival instinct and the sensory perception feeds in to its motor control movement versus if it's just seeking food or like a Maslow's hierarchy of needs."
"Unknown","01;03;39;17","01;04;04;23","And, you know, I like the terminology, you know, anthropology, if we're anthropomorphizing, you know, the and or are we reverse anthropomorphizing the machine that the fact is in terms of sense perception, motor control, we understand how the robot computer works much better than the mind. And so are the act of inference equations really more suited to machine learning, robotic automation?"
"Unknown","01;04;05;04","01;04;55;06","And then where you reverse anthropomorphizing that to a the human mind. But, you know, certainly the equations are valuable because, you know, largely they could be interchanged and defined how you want them to Thanks. I'll connect some ant's thoughts to the skydiver. So Dean has returned to this example of the skydiver as being like, well, if I can't change gravity, my policies, whether mental attention policies prey or no prey or, you know, do this motor behavior or do the speech behavior, which is a motor behavior, is well conditioned on policy, not going to be able to influence gravity and then once updates their prior that also conditioned upon various action policies, they're not going to"
"Unknown","01;04;55;06","01;05;21;14","be able to open a functional parachute then there's this discrete shift, as you describe, to like making the biggest crater and hearing about the ants over the years. It makes me think about folk biology, like the notion that people have in terms of their received understanding that there is like a drive to survive or a drive to reproduce or drive to do various numbers of things."
"Unknown","01;05;21;29","01;05;52;10","It's almost like the body of evolutionary biology or of ecology and I'm thinking about the case where a nest me is out foraging for the colony and then they're being like messed with by somebody with like a magnifying glass or being touching them. And at first it's like evading. Now that behavior looks a lot like a solitary insect that might be trying to evade and survive, ostensibly to reproduce an increase like its individual offspring, if one is still within the folk biological realm."
"Unknown","01;05;53;08","01;06;20;10","And then it's like there's a switch where the nest mate is actually like, no, the evolutionary unit is the colony. And so it goes to the biggest crater possible, and that's even embodied in the anatomy of some insects, for example, with a hooked stinger where they can't they're committing six legged death to compose as a broader high fitness entity at the colony scale."
"Unknown","01;06;20;24","01;06;50;19","And so that's like a behavioral shift from trying to open the individual nest mate parachute to make the biggest crater on the attacker possible for the good of the colony. And that no matter how hard you try to map that to the behavior of a solitary insect will be along a potentially didactic or interesting but ultimately facetious route because the colony is the evolutionary unit for these obligate these social species."
"Unknown","01;06;51;05","01;07;38;23","And so one will be scratching their head at various of the behaviors and that's why the value of a descriptive framework is so important, because we're able to describe various computational quantities and not be inconsistent or contradicting folk and psychology while also remaining absolutely impartial to questions of what ants think, for example. And so we can have computational representations of ant decision making and cognition and perception, cognition, action, impact, and we can link it to natural language descriptions through the active inference ontology as well as through potentially others like ontologies like ant folk psychology."
"Unknown","01;07;40;18","01;08;09;25","And we can take that. Yes. And, and other people can add other. Yes. Ands if they want. But they're going to have to take a different tack to uncouple the relationship between these computational quantities and try to interject a wedge and say, no, it does contradict folk psychology. That's a different argument than that. Relationship is in violating some other third belief system that I'm bringing to the table."
"Unknown","01;08;10;27","01;08;59;22","So hope that addresses some of it. And thanks Blue for your questions in the chat there. Ali, would you like to raise anything or take us to a question or area that you want to focus on? Yeah, and one more thing about this discussion is bringing person semiotics into table. I think well, the act of inference actually, I believe, is a kind of iconic symbol as opposed to index, because you see in person semiotics for index, we need to necessarily allow some kind of a causal relationship between the symbol and the index."
"Unknown","01;08;59;22","01;09;44;19","But for icons, we only need to have some isomorphic isomorphic similarities. And that's not to say similarity because the similarity is a very vague term, some isomorphism between the symbol and the icon. So ideally, active inference is a kind of let's say a structure preserving mapping between the behavior and the models. So I guess if we can if we could differentiate between icons and indices, some of these at least confusions could possibly it could potentially be well resolved."
"Unknown","01;09;45;08","01;10;32;08","Hmm. So icons in indices of process semiotics thanks for sharing that. And it connects to some of the discussions we've had on process ontologies as well. Alex Yeah. Just really quickly, I mean, I got to say, I don't know that much about process semiotics, but that way of thinking of active inference and of theories in general as like iconic representations is pretty much how I think of theories and how I mean, then the most recent thing I published with Yakov over, we basically said that you can think of scientific theories as relating to the world by a process of non process or relation of sort of structural similarity isomers, isomorphism being the sort of in"
"Unknown","01;10;32;09","01;10;58;29","that case. So I just, I agree with that and I think it's, it kind of goes right back to a lot of what we discussed as I, as I get older, I start to think that maybe there's something to the essential index, the whole idea that like I as a special role to play, you know, the letter capital I in English, but other than that I think things pretty much function function descriptively and and I think description functions by isomorphism or similarity."
"Unknown","01;10;58;29","01;11;26;18","So I totally agree you know awesome. That reminds me of the book Anthem by Rand where the word AI is not included in the linguistics and then the end of the book not, you know, spoiler alert, the word AI is rediscovered. And so it's kind of an allegory that traces some of these questions about the potentially special role of the bodily identity."
"Unknown","01;11;27;28","01;12;00;24","But it's very interesting that these frameworks actually are engaging or with this augmented perspective, for example, that he has raised, that these theories can be seen as already having been engaged in a discourse that people might not expect, like predictive processing is what the brain is doing. Do you agree or deny? What's the evidence for predictive processing? Being active in the brain versus not active in the brain?"
"Unknown","01;12;01;01","01;12;31;28","Is this neural signal recording that we made more consistent with a predictive or a non predictive model? It takes that miso range of what the system is doing and it partitions it, as we heard also from Ryan previously, into like well, predictive processing can't be invalidated, not nor can linear regression framework, nor can active inference framework any specific model is now engaged in a specific model evidence comparison."
"Unknown","01;12;32;10","01;13;03;03","And then one can choose what kind of model comparisons they want to make knowing that they're not going to be able to exhaustively consider all possible cognitive architectures, but also any invalidation or relative model fit or adequacy among different models at this specific level are speaking only rhetorically. To the truth or the validity or the adequacy of the higher level inviolable framework."
"Unknown","01;13;04;19","01;13;39;24","There's a lot there to explore do it yeah. Maybe we could tie this back to the limit of wisdom in the anthropomorphism. So if you ascribe an eye to the computer is that that's a logical fallacy of anthropomorphism because there is no way it's just following code or even to the ant if you're mammals may be, but but you know, insects communicate and sense pheromones and you want to anthropomorphize an eye to the ant that like the ant."
"Unknown","01;13;39;24","01;14;15;01","The thing I want to communicate with my fellow ants for a purpose and just like, no, no, that's not that's anthropomorphism logical fallacy. The ant is just following genetic code and then you say, well, really for humans also that you know, we're more facing the mind and that there is no AI related to unified AI related to the me that even right now that I am communicating with with you fine gentleman, but that's a misnomer."
"Unknown","01;14;15;12","01;14;39;07","And in terms that it's just a me following my, my predictive coding and that, you know, just for the purpose of language I'm referring it to as I talking to you but you know, that's just like a computer sending code to another computer or an ant sending pheromones or whatever method of communication it uses. And that's just the language and lexicon that we use."
"Unknown","01;14;40;22","01;15;20;26","Yeah. It's, it's a dialog that has played out in not only girl Esher Bach, but many college dorm rooms, many late night sessions. One participant or prospective believes that they have, for example, the ability to choose and have agency, and the other disregards that position, or one believes that there's something and there's a divergence in their perspective. I think this is just the heart of the MAP Territory debate in the distributed cognitive setting as all cognitive systems ultimately are even what is called individual behavior is just referring to collective behavior."
"Unknown","01;15;21;03","01;15;49;14","Another scale. For example, one person can say this conversation can be modeled using active inference, or this conversation can be modeled using very depressing, just like it could be constructed with a linear regression or family of linear regressions. And somebody else could say This conversation is nothing but linear regressions, nothing but predictive processing, nothing but active inference someone might believe that."
"Unknown","01;15;49;27","01;16;14;24","And if they believe that, it would be true that that is their perspective. I don't know if that would make it true, but they would be taking they would be stepping into a territory that the person who remains with both feet in instrumental ism I'm choosing to model it this way, or I'm testing a portfolio of different models around how we could model our difference in perspective."
"Unknown","01;16;16;22","01;16;42;26","Maybe one can say that they have been too timid and they haven't actually engaged in the real question, which is what's really happening, not with how you're modeling it, but that's a whole nother debate. Alex and then do it. Yeah, I just think this this might tie into the stuff Section nine that maybe we'll get to. We don't have to jump to them to say basically I, I agree."
"Unknown","01;16;42;26","01;17;09;24","You could raise these questions for any of these systems. People, machines, ants, protons, whatever. And and I think there's an argument to be made that there's not a clear place to draw the line there, but it could go either way with respect to all of us. Right. I think that, you know, you could the answer phasing in all of those cases or none of them, it's not easy to I don't think it's easy to draw a line somewhere along this sort of evolutionary continuum."
"Unknown","01;17;09;24","01;17;34;00","Or anything like that, say, although there's there's an argument about temporal depth of generative models. That's interesting that just on a couple of papers here and there. But, you know, I think the cool thing about active inference and the free energy principle stuff is that it applies across scales. So I think that to me that means that you're faced with a similar problem at whatever scale you consider it."
"Unknown","01;17;35;10","01;18;06;24","I just got to throw out there, I probably have to leave around 1230 Eastern. So I'll say that now so that I can just abruptly close my window that's already so we're in the summary of main argument Section nine. So Alex, what is the main arguments? And also in the contexts and audiences that you've presented it in, how do you feel like it lands or what cognitive updates are you aiming to achieve with this argument as constructed and communicated?"
"Unknown","01;18;08;08","01;18;26;25","Is this Section nine? I think actually amendments Section eight, but I'm sorry. OK, Section eight Desires in affective state only. See, I meant ten. OK, I don't want to totally bypass your question. I just think nine is kind of a summary of the argument thus far. So. All right. How about ten? Let's talk about direction of fit. Yeah."
"Unknown","01;18;26;27","01;18;49;26","So I mean, so the sorry, the, the sort of the point here was just that there's a this certainly is relevant to discussing there's a straightforward way to generalize this beyond systems that you would necessarily intuitively describe as having beliefs and desires and we can just talk about any system as described by active inference by this framework or that's describable accurately by this framework."
"Unknown","01;18;50;08","01;19;25;02","You can talk about the difference between Q and P and this, I think, also ties into some of the work that Maxwell Armstead has done on this. The idea that the generative model is sort of a representation or sort of a representation embodied by the system, if it's a representation, we still disagree about that anyway. The generative model and the approximate recognition model are sort of always there, even if you apply these frameworks to describe very simple systems and you can you can see something desire like or belief in those."
"Unknown","01;19;25;22","01;19;57;11","And we just remain very neutral on that in this paper. On the question of whether there really are beliefs and desires in these sort of extended cases, by extended, I mean not necessarily paradigmatic. Right? So if if the beliefs and desires power of a paradigm radically apply to people and then maybe to ants, and I would say definitely if dogs, you know, then this this stuff in Section ten is is about what you can say without necessarily committing to beliefs and desires."
"Unknown","01;19;57;11","01;20;36;19","And those in the in the edge cases but you can still say that there's at least an ingredient of beliefs and desires, which is a direction of it's some sort of. So how could this be used in one case for a human entity? In the folk psychological way and in another case for some entity that people would maybe say that type of folk psychology would be inadmissible for I mean, as far as how it could be used in the cases of people that have beliefs and desires or that we think do."
"Unknown","01;20;36;26","01;21;05;08","I think it's pretty it's pretty straightforward right? It's just saying, well, any kind of full psychological explanation you can give of a person's behavior, you can it's consistent with the description of that person in terms of that inference. I guess then the only question is like in the case of a system that might be not clearly that you wouldn't necessarily think of as having a psychology in the same sense, what kinds of things would you want to say about it?"
"Unknown","01;21;07;04","01;21;29;25","I think I think there's an example of it in the paper about like a plant reaching towards the light or something, or a sort of this simple, simpler sort of feedback systems. Right where something there's like a set point. And the thing is approaching at that point, you could still think of the of the prior distribution as having a world to mind direction of set."
"Unknown","01;21;30;12","01;21;56;25","Right? Because it's it's the piece of the system that brings it about that, that things change so that that distribution describes, you know, reality yeah. So yeah. And so you still have those. So, so that's one example. I don't know, maybe like a bacterium following some kind of nutrient gradient or something. I don't really know about that stuff."
"Unknown","01;21;56;25","01;22;19;10","But that's another example that might you could, you could ascribe directions of fit to that creature. And I don't know my last thought on this, I don't know why it would be useful to do that necessarily. I don't know. There might be reasons and studying these systems that you want to, but if you did want to do it, you could understand it in the framework."
"Unknown","01;22;19;29","01;22;47;07","Just some brief thoughts. And then Allie. So first there's a paper of Calvo and first in 2017 which is specifically applying predictive processing and active to the vegetative case. And I think from the perspective of behavioral analysis there's also precedents in the 1989 paper framework for plant behavior by Silvertone and Gordon. So suffice to say that plants are included within this cognitive modeling perspective."
"Unknown","01;22;47;17","01;23;26;02","And then it made me think about how the surprise the self information is an energy function it's what dampens the spring and so maybe could you say like the heavier ball with folk ball psychology the heavier ball wants to drop faster or it wants to make a bigger crater or all these other things just again it doesn't have the agency to want otherwise given the initial conditions and the rules of physics in that situation, but it's exactly like a person wanting to make a small hole in the paper or wanting to make a big hole and then realizing that intention would be analogous to an energy functional or being reduced by some kind of purely"
"Unknown","01;23;26;02","01;23;59;08","physical system, which does again hint towards some of the potentially non materialist implications legacy that do slip in to difference in culture conversations around mind yes. Alex, any last thoughts on that just real quick? Yeah. On the ball example, I mean, I think there is a sense, of course, in which this framework applies but I think if anything, the ball wouldn't have a desire or if the system involving the ball might though, right?"
"Unknown","01;23;59;16","01;24;22;22","So because the the term that would that would pull the ball towards the ground or whatever wouldn't really be in the up of the ball with it. But and so whether that larger system has a proto belief or desire, I don't know Ali. And again, Alex is offered a part whenever, but I'll go for it well, yeah, I'm not sure if we have enough time to get into this question."
"Unknown","01;24;23;04","01;25;11;15","I mean, if not, we can discuss it in the dark, too. But I had a question about the esthetic experience and the pleasure or positive balance we get from engaging with works of art in particular, and talking about unexpected plot twists in movies or novels or different kinds of intention little ambiguities in some artworks. For instance, the works of M.C. Escher and his impossible geometries will immediately come to mind, and the sense of excitement and joy they tend to induce in the audience, in fact, playing around with these kinds of familiarization as literary critics like to call them, seems to be more of a rule than an exception in any creative endeavor."
"Unknown","01;25;12;02","01;25;43;10","On the other hand, outside the safety of the world of arts we generally don't like to be encountered with too much unexpectedness as we've seen. So I wonder whether or how these kinds of esthetic reactions can be integrated within the formalism of active inference. Are they special cases of information seeking drives, or there is a whole other story going on here Alex, go for this and then thanks again for your time here."
"Unknown","01;25;43;20","01;26;01;10","Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll I'll check out after this. Thank you so much. I love these discussions. I knew it would be an interesting interesting crowd, interesting topics. I got to say, I don't know much about what you just asked about, but I love this topic. I'm I actually come from that because of the esthetics as well, I should say."
"Unknown","01;26;01;10","01;26;22;00","But anyway, I know there's a lot of work on this, so I know that predictive process under the banner of predictive processing, there's a whole lot of work in esthetics there's I think, suggesting something very similar to what you're saying, that there's clearly a relationship here between it's appraisal and unexpectedness and predictions and the joy that we get out of and other emotions that we get out of artworks."
"Unknown","01;26;22;10","01;26;45;05","And I would love to know more about this. I haven't had time to look into it, but I think Daniel's put our this was also a predictive processing type paper with a incredible title Move Me, Astonish Me, Delight my eyes, and Brain, and then enter the subtitle, a sequel title, perhaps in the dot to Let's Sketch This Out."
"Unknown","01;26;45;12","01;27;08;21","Let's let's look at the Formalisms and let's do some mapping. So someone said, I believe that Mondrian is an amazing painter and I want to go to a space where I do see beautiful art and I want to have this kind of experience or something like that. But let's explore that in the dark too, with some of the beady eyes and the esthetics of in cultured experiences yeah."
"Unknown","01;27;09;18","01;27;30;12","Yeah, sure. If I could just just really quickly, I think that the challenge there is going to be that sometimes prediction errors fine and sometimes it's not. We just figure out, right? There's probably some complicated way of saying what the differences between those cases. But that's that's as far as my intuition goes. I'd love to discuss it on thanks again and see you later."
"Unknown","01;27;30;24","01;27;31;28","Thank you. Bye bye."
"Unknown","01;27;34;15","01;28;08;21","Great. Dean and I just wanted to kind of jump on that point Wally was making. I, I think that in, in this, in the, just when I made sure I got the right section of the paper here, sorry, the free energy principle and direction of fit. Yeah. Sort of to tag on what Allie and Alex were saying. There's a, there's a statement here says, holding the value of the observation constant in this equation f decreases as the approximate posterior distribution Q of the state approaches to posterior or the QC term."
"Unknown","01;28;08;21","01;28;40;25","Therefore, as is pretty forwardly believed like mine to world correction of fit in that its value changes to accommodate new observations. I think that the Escher and the Mondrian and every time I go to a sporting event my openness, my accommodation to what is perceived as an uncertain outcome is the thing that draws my attention and I think Daniel's point of let's, let's map that out."
"Unknown","01;28;41;04","01;29;12;23","Let's see how long some people are able to hold that ambiguity space and not necessarily see it as a risk is immaterial until it materializes and is a process that I think a lot of people want to go through because there's there's something to that that isn't just attention and it isn't just information seeking, but it may also satiate certain desires."
"Unknown","01;29;13;03","01;29;44;17","So I think that is a point to mapping that we should maybe spend a little bit of time on because I don't know that when you open a space up for something to eventually happen, you're you're imposing what the final material form should take. You're simply leaving something open in the hopes that something interesting, i.e., and as you're painting might end up being in the next room."
"Unknown","01;29;44;17","01;30;13;00","I mean, this is what happens when I go to museums in Spain. It's I'm not looking to find the particular Dali. I'm looking to go into that space and be surprised. So I wonder how that actually does map out using these Formalisms. Yes, it reminds me of when in the dark zero Ryan described like the different reasons and the different nuancing, the types of information seeking."
"Unknown","01;30;13;21","01;31;03;02","That's very relevant. I'm navigating through this museum to reduce my uncertainty about where that one piece that I came to see is the target driven epistemic foraging from a more general like I don't know what is in the other room that is going to influence my probability of moving room to room and certainly with the ice skating, that is how we maintain a visual fields that appears to have roughly equal resolution via our generative model of vision and ocular motor secreting two regions of maximal information distinctly uncoupled from only what regions are most rewarding, though people's gaze does tend to linger in certain regions that might be perceived as rewarding."
"Unknown","01;31;03;17","01;31;39;18","That isn't the only imperative, and that's why it's so special and relevant to have a cross system and multi scale behavioral modeling framework like active inference that helps us understand the pure static field eyes trying to latch on to anything mode from the gaze on a candle flame during meditation or one region of particular beauty. In another visual scene, Dean Yeah, just real quick, and I think that also I Ali, thank you."
"Unknown","01;31;39;18","01;32;04;05","You raised semiotics and I'm a purist fan, so there's a there's a huge piece of that involved in this as well as to what is the signal that that very much there's a there's a slide in here that we didn't get to but when the ice cream cone looking up into the distance at that at that ice cream truck, where do we where do we place that in the foreground or in the background?"
"Unknown","01;32;04;24","01;32;39;27","And that is a huge I think that plays a huge part in in the role of the third person. Now, looking at the observer, looking at the observer and getting that sort of recursive aspect involved in this as well. So again, I don't know how that works, but what will borrow Daniel's power to be able to map that is a 91 or is a 37 and then maybe put it on a like scale because I think all of that kind of is a potential way for this to sort of make as a sense."
"Unknown","01;32;39;27","01;33;08;07","I wasn't bringing up with Alex the idea that like literally beliefs and desires add up to intentions. I was sort of saying that tongue in cheek just to be able to show the difference when something is discrete and and how we try to bring them together. And this ops observer of an observer thing, although it's not I don't think it's Alex's and the other two author's primary goal here."
"Unknown","01;33;09;01","01;33;33;24","But I, but I do think they lower the bar in terms of bringing some of the more folk arts folk aspects of this into the formalism aspects. Yes. And it was a very clever and interesting response, which is it depends on what is meant by addition. What does it mean for Dean plus Ali? Does that mean they're both going to stand on a scale and we're measuring their mass?"
"Unknown","01;33;34;10","01;34;10;12","Does it mean that we're going to stack them head to toe and then consider the length? Does it mean that they're going to interact in a certain context? Does it mean we're going to blend them up? I mean, there isn't an intrinsic definition to what the addition operator or any operator means in a formal system. And so it opens up the idea that we could have, whether it's specific symbols or just here's how we're using this symbol here and use that to refer to relatively potentially complex and multi-step operations or operations that can be phrased in multi step."
"Unknown","01;34;11;00","01;34;35;04","For example, a multiplication on the processor might happen in a different way than somebody is cognitively thinking about it, but that is as the title hints not contradictory, not that one validates or encompasses or proves the other, but there's so many things that are not contradictory and active inference may be contradictory of certain things. Let's make a list."
"Unknown","01;34;35;04","01;34;58;02","What is active inference contradictory of what is folk psychology contradicting of? And we can make all of that mapping in the right knowledge management system. And the claim of the article, as I guess Ryan's imperative was, was to make this claim that as they've operationalized both active inference models do not contradict folk psychology. And that's quite an interesting claim."
"Unknown","01;34;58;20","01;35;23;25","Dean. Yeah, just real quick, I think, Daniel, your point is I'm rephrasing it in my own from my own view, which is you raise a lot of different joint probabilities that by their nature, arbitrary. And I think that's important to keep in mind. This leaves open the possibility of looking at things a variety of different ways yeah. And just to speak to the joint probability density."
"Unknown","01;35;24;07","01;35;53;09","So the joint probability density in the Bayesian modeling approach is like where there's a comma so instead of A conditioned on B, it's like the joint distribution of A and B, right? Y A and B Y not B and why, why not these three? And so there's always something like a periphery that the model comes from, and we can be blanketed off from it."
"Unknown","01;35;53;22","01;36;26;13","And that actually serves as a scientific and really meta scientific way to have rigor and accessibility potentially of the models to respect when we're in the regime of attention of a model, what kinds of claims can or cannot be supported, what kinds of contradictions are or not tenable to make? And then also have the. Yes, and with respecting that that joint distribution was not handed down from on high is not the only possible joint distribution that could have been selected."
"Unknown","01;36;26;29","01;37;12;01","And so we can separate off. How did these real researchers in this real situation come to focus on that phenomena and take this joint distribution from conditioned on the joint distribution? What was the actual conversation and consequences and modeling they performed do it yeah. It's all fascinating. I guess I two separate points I wanted to express and there might be more general if this is my first time on the stream than it's related to this paper, but specific, the act of inference in general and the interdisciplinary studies what my streaming partner, Jennifer Schaaf, calls herself Church of Entropy."
"Unknown","01;37;12;01","01;37;51;09","We've been three years now talking about consciousness, and I showed her the free energy principle and she immediately said that isn't that just the least action principle? And I mean, it's not directly related to this paper but I could see that in terms of my second point, what I'll call goal directed behavior in general. And, you know, if you want to say that there's only one motivating force in active inference, and that's the free energy principle, which is basically a restating of the least action principle."
"Unknown","01;37;51;28","01;38;34;12","And then at a second point, the I went, you know, last week in Metro Detroit at the International Automation Conference, and they had the latest in robotic arms technology for manufacturer, and they had on display, you know, a lot of what we'll call sense perception and motor control, specifically robotic arms that don't just repeat the same action or even have like a sensor embedded when but have an embedded sensor of a camera that will recognize that object and then create a set of rules in order to tell the robotic arm the best trajectory in order to pick up the object."
"Unknown","01;38;34;12","01;39;03;16","And in terms of like old school manufacturer would just been taking an object and setting it in one place where it actually has some level of machine learning intelligence where it could intelligently design where to put the object in terms of like stacking boxes where it could, you know, the algorithm of the computer could determine what's the best way to stack the objects and then control the robotic arm to do that."
"Unknown","01;39;03;16","01;39;32;10","And if it's like so for humans, just on the pure level of sense, perception has goal directed behavior. How do I you know, if we have 100 million cones and rods in our eye, how do we direct our physical capabilities of perception? To perceive the environment in this thing that could be modeled by these equations and, you know, the free energy principle, at least action principle."
"Unknown","01;39;33;00","01;40;17;01","And then the decision making that, you know, the goal directed behavior like like the automation computer has to have a goal code in order to act. And so it key to action reaction since perception feedback mechanism in order to action and then the equation you're describing goal directed behavior. And that's why I'm a fan of the active inference model because as a dualist, I mean, as a scientist, I could describe these in purely materialistic things and we don't have to get too much into the theology or, you know, what's the origin of these higher order rules, even if you want to assume that all higher order rules are material in in origin."
"Unknown","01;40;17;17","01;41;00;28","But I think the equations in general could model it no matter what their origin is. And it's just a good framework to understand, you know, all these theories, the goal directed behavior at all aspects, and then to put on, you know, the last spin on it, like the Maslow's hierarchy of needs and in like, you know, what is belief desire and you know, that I would have introspection or education that would give me, you know, morals, ethics that, OK, like my body, you know, like I put the pithy and the expression I see the heart desires the main plaques in the limb carry out that that I have the capability that my I see my"
"Unknown","01;41;00;28","01;41;23;08","heart desires. But my mind stops me and says that's wrong. And even though my seventh perception saw it and my desires told me that I should do it, somehow, there's this higher order principle of the mind that tells me that's wrong and I'm not going to do it. And there's that control factor before the limbs carry out thank you."
"Unknown","01;41;23;10","01;41;55;29","I'll just make some short points and then we can just close off with what we're excited to explore in the dot, too. I really just appreciate what a lot of people shared. And I think over these discussions and the years, we're finding some clarity is around where are different implications and consequences. What is entering into active inference as a field and a filter and what is coming out of it, what's happening on the playground."
"Unknown","01;41;56;09","01;42;24;19","And so there's just a lot to explore. Then Livestream 45 just in the last few weeks and not to rehearse outside of this paper regime of attention, but the free energy principle as it's rehearsed in that paper is establishing the particular partition. That's Markov blanketing off the figure from the ground, the thing which is able to undergo repeated measurements in the quantum sense from the thing that is not that thing."
"Unknown","01;42;25;02","01;42;58;15","That's the particular partition with the sensory active internal external partition the autonomous states, the blanket states from sparse coupling, unpacking the implications in terms of Bayesian inference. In other words, seeing the flow of those states as doing something that is can be modeled as Bayesian inference. And then finally, understanding paths in terms of a principle of least action, which has been starting to be explored from at least the early path formalization of active inference years ago."
"Unknown","01;42;58;26","01;43;41;21","And I think in the last two weeks to two years, taking a new view on that through a lot of the work on geometry and analysis by Dalton Maxwell and other collaborators. So indeed, this path formalization is very relevant and the principle of least action, which isn't the principle of least motion, it's not the laziest thing, it's not the one that always works, it's none of those things, but it's a framework for analyzing behavior and with that, what would people be excited to explore next week, or what would be something that they didn't have uncertainty or motivation or drive to explore before today?"
"Unknown","01;43;41;21","01;43;44;14","But it has come onto their horizon through this discussion."
"Unknown","01;43;50;09","01;44;45;23","Yes, Ali, then Dean, do well, it was it was a really fascinating discussion, and I thank you all for bringing such interesting and interesting topics onto the table, but I'm very much looking forward to that, too. And I also had a couple of questions. I'm interested in exploring the phenomenological aspects of folk psychology, especially the belief and desire and also the relation of the eye to abnormal psychology, which has just briefly touched on in the paper, but not in detail and yeah, I hope the next session will be at least as fascinating as this one."
"Unknown","01;44;46;21","01;45;09;23","Thank you, Ali. Dean, I already said what I'm hoping we can look at and as I do, but I'll just add this. I think it's really interesting that the term active inference and I'll just say and in this calendar year alone, we've had a couple of papers that have started typing active inference. We've had outside the skull or extended active inference."
"Unknown","01;45;09;23","01;45;33;16","And now we've got this daily. And I and I think there's probably going to be more. And so depending on how many authors are available next week, I might be asking them a little bit about that, too. Like, is that does that seem like a natural rollout when you had these scale free ideas that you need these these scale friendly qualifiers just so that it continues to make sense?"
"Unknown","01;45;35;27","01;45;54;22","Thank you. Do it then. I'll make a point on that. Dean, yeah. Because this is my first time, so I had a lot of general stuff on active inference in general, and I try to stick straight to this paper, I think be interesting to cover more. I ask the question, you know, has active inference even explained one quality?"
"Unknown","01;45;55;11","01;46;28;05","And you know, that, you know, there's actually a model here in the equations. Could we describe a single process, a single sense perception to decision making? And you know, so like the human model to a simpler life form or even say that is in essence the, you know, the automation, like the machine learning algorithms for robotic arms is that in essence using these same active inference computers."
"Unknown","01;46;28;05","01;47;23;12","I spoke to your back online who I guess is an entrepreneur thinking like real estate but is that you what would the application of this be to you? Autonomous cars are more complicated, but like something the most simplified version, which is probably robotics sensors and controlled movement based on machine learning that and then, you know, said, could we try to explain a single qualia in terms of what happens when I sense something and make some sort of movement and then there was talk of what would all of the axioms necessary to in terms of the higher order rules or goal oriented behavior or not belief desires intentions, what are they and how are they modeled"
"Unknown","01;47;23;21","01;47;50;14","into the equation? What happens when I perceive something and that's translated into action? What axioms do we have to put into the model to make it work as opposed to or in comparison to the robotic arm that's coded for that? Does that thank you to all those returning and first time and our second Applied Active Inference Symposium, which is going to be in July 20, 22 is on robotics."
"Unknown","01;47;50;14","01;48;22;20","So we can absolutely address a lot of the applications and also adjacencies and the sense that I got maybe just thinking of that robotic case is like a little wind up toy on a table. We want to build it and this discussion because of how it is constituted and enacted is helping us understand not just all of the implications that go into that wind up toy but exploring a lot of the consequences of the wind up toy."
"Unknown","01;48;23;05","01;48;40;17","And then there's people saying, but wasn't the table constructed and wouldn't a different table have resulted in a different wind up toy behavior and who placed it on the table? And why are tables designed that way? And isn't table just like a functional consequence of anything being put on it? And what are we doing here? How did we decide on that?"
"Unknown","01;48;40;20","01;48;57;28","How should we decide the next wind up toy? And it just takes it in so many amazing places. So thanks to everybody in the chat and joining live and of course to the authors for the paper. See you in 46.2 thank you, Jets. Bye."
