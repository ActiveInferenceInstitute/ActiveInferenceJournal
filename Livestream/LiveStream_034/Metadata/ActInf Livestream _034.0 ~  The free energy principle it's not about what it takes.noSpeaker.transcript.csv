"Unknown","00;00;29;22","00;00;57;22","All right. Hello and welcome, everyone. It's active. Live, live. Stream number 34.0 on December 3rd. 20, 21. And we're discussing the paper, the free energy principle. It's not about what it takes. It's about what took you there. Welcome to the Active Lab. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links here on this slide."
"Unknown","00;00;58;23","00;01;24;13","This is a recorded and an archived live stream. So please provide us with feedback so that we can improve on our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and will be following cool Dyadic video chat etiquette today. At this Coda site you can find our sortable, searchable, interactive, all and growing database of past and future live streams."
"Unknown","00;01;25;02","00;01;47;03","And if nothing else, isn't this paper going to be about the past and the future? And it's also our last paper discussion that we're kicking off for 20, 21 in November 34. So it's a pretty cool discussion and I'm really looking forward to it. Inactive stream number 34. We're going to be discussing the paper, the free energy principle."
"Unknown","00;01;47;14","00;02;09;24","It's not about what it takes. It's about what took you there by Axel Constant in 2021 and just like all the other dot zeros the video is an introduction to some of the ideas and the context for the paper. It's not a review or an evaluation or a final word. We'll go over the aims and the claims, the abstract and the roadmap of the paper."
"Unknown","00;02;10;04","00;02;33;18","And then there's a couple keywords including some that we haven't seen before. And then we'll walk through the key example, which is the numerical example of a simple signal detecting bacterium. And we'll kind of talk through that example and see where that takes us. And I'll just note, as with all the other zeros, check out the paper if you want to learn more."
"Unknown","00;02;33;27","00;03;07;25","And actually writing is really a pleasure to read and he has deep insight into the FP. So we'll start with just saying hello and anything that we else wanted to say. So I'm Daniel, I'm a researcher in California and what excited me about this paper and got me excited to discuss it was I think Axl's provocative as well as grounded in and respectful approach to dealing with what has and hasn't been done in the FSP."
"Unknown","00;03;08;13","00;03;49;04","And the example is so minimal and pared down, but also insightful that I think it lends itself to a jumping off point for many, many other discussions. Dean Yeah. Thanks, Daniel. I'm Dean. I'm, I'm in Calgary. And I think what excited me about this was that I I didn't start out really understanding what the title of the paper even meant, but then when they when there was a bit of a, an inversion and a bit of a taking things inside out and I don't know if you want to describe that as a reversal of what is typically viewed as the time continuum or not."
"Unknown","00;03;50;26","00;04;16;16","It just opened up a whole bunch of interesting ideas, which I was contemplating as a as a program developer, because I knew that in order for the idea of being able to go from an inference I believed going from an inference which is a very small time frame through a prediction set, and finally into being able to get to a place of modeling or understanding covariates."
"Unknown","00;04;16;16","00;04;49;24","And as a collective, this paper would probably help. And then with each section I went through, it was it was very helpful in terms of being able to sort of bring this idea just as an idea, not in terms of its practical implications, but just as an idea to life. So OK, I'm sure he'll join me now. Just read through some of the big questions and again, these are just the ones that we wrote down."
"Unknown","00;04;50;00","00;05;17;12","So I'll read the first two and then maybe say something. And then Dean, you can take the second two so two of the big questions that the paper raises are what is the free energy principle about and what is the entailment relationship between life and the minimization of free energy? Or another way to read that is what is the Entailment relationship between life and models that emphasize the minimization of free energy?"
"Unknown","00;05;17;26","00;05;47;01","And I just love how the paper dances between both of them and figuring out what the exactly is and isn't. And it's distinction from general Bayesian theories, from active inference. These are really crucial distinctions. Dean Oh, yeah. So the second two questions were one. One was from the author. I'll read the fourth one first from the author or prior subjective or objective of the ATP."
"Unknown","00;05;47;26","00;06;09;18","I put the words with a question mark. Yes, because I actually have a question about this. He he comes to a conclusion but I'm not I'm not sure what the time line is, which leads back to Bullet three, which is what can we say about relationship when we shift from looking at what something is the comparison of life and free energy principle to how long it lasts."
"Unknown","00;06;10;01","00;06;28;23","He talks about duration or the when aspect of that. And that's the thing that kind of adds a twist to this because you can look at it as very momentary or you can look at his things as very cyclic of his expression, episodic and diachronic and you've used Kairos and there's lots and lots of ways to bring that in."
"Unknown","00;06;28;27","00;06;57;03","But when we do things change pretty quickly and it's funny you had to go to the fourth one, but was it really the fourth question? If you read it third right? There we go. So the paper was published on 2222. One could have waited a year and gone for the total two. But I understand you got to get those papers out and a few of the key aims and claims."
"Unknown","00;06;57;10","00;07;27;00","So first, using the author's words, the Entailment problem is the confusion in the Entailment relationship between free energy minimization and life. So if you've never heard the word Entailment never heard free energy, we're going to go into some of these things but the entailment problem is people being confused about Entailment. That's a problem. In this paper, the author dissolves what's called the Entailment problem proposed here by providing a numerical example of free energy minimization in a hypothetical organism."
"Unknown","00;07;28;14","00;07;52;22","I conclude with some brief epistemological knowledge oriented remarks that may be of interest for those who worry about the explanatory power of the FSP. And then this is the last words of the paper, which we'll return to at the end of this livestream. The claim I set up at the start of the paper is that free energy minimization is not sufficient for life microbe Fidell."
"Unknown","00;07;52;27","00;08;04;21","True to the unifying grip of hypotheses in historical sciences, the free energy principle is meant to account for all of that you, me, and the organism understudy in a unifying fashion."
"Unknown","00;08;06;22","00;08;26;28","Any thoughts on those claims will be exploring them and discussing them in the today. Yeah. No, the only thing that I immediately went to visit was a question that I would ask people who were sort of on the other side of whatever it is that they were moving towards in terms of a sort of a professional participate participation."
"Unknown","00;08;27;15","00;08;55;10","And so the intelligent thing for me was is it opportunity over method meaning, method entailing, opportunity or or is it met opportunity being of a method or method being entailed by opportunity? And that is the same kind of question that that axle looks at here. So depending on how you see that entailment things go off in completely different directions."
"Unknown","00;08;55;10","00;09;19;02","So let's go and get into the paper now because yeah, that's something that you can't resolve until post diction. You can expect how it'll be resolved but then you look back and it might have been different. So I'll read the abstract and then feel free to give a thought. And of course anyone watching a long life is always welcome to give comments and questions and lecture."
"Unknown","00;09;19;18","00;09;46;07","So the abstract is I'll read the first and the third one. Yeah, philosophical writings on the free energy principle in the life sciences often give the impression that minimizing free energy is sufficient for life, but minimizing free energy is not a sufficient condition for life. In fact, one can perfectly well conceive of a system that actively minimizes its free energy and for this very reason moves inexorably towards death."
"Unknown","00;09;46;21","00;10;17;18","So where does the assumption of this entailment relation come from? There is indeed an entailment relation, but it goes the other way around. Life entails minimizing free energy. But another way, if you exist now under the right conditions, it's because you've done something like minimizing your free energy. However, the question of whether you exist tomorrow cannot be settled purely by the resorting to the fact that you'll minimize your free energy in order to get there."
"Unknown","00;10;18;18","00;10;37;18","The simple point I make in this paper is that the free energy principle is not concerned with a sufficient conditions of existence, but rather what must have been the case necessary. What must have been the case given that you exist? It's not about figuring out what it takes to be alive. It's about figuring out what took you there."
"Unknown","00;10;39;02","00;10;55;13","And I'd recommend people to put this in a speech text to speech reader. It reads just so fantastically in a robotic voice. I rarely hear that for behaviors, but I was sort of a little bit exercise bike listening to the robot talk about this, and it was just it was hilarious."
"Unknown","00;10;57;22","00;11;19;25","So here's the simple point in the paper. Free energy principle is not concerned with this efficient conditions of existence, but rather with must have been the case given you exist. It's worth restating because it's a simple point, but the depth of how far off one can be by missing this point is vast. It's not about figuring out what it takes to be alive."
"Unknown","00;11;20;01","00;11;43;19","It's about figuring out what took you there, not what took the living system there. So here's the living system, but we can even finesse that it's you. And so the red line is the system. Looking back how did I get here? Or putting kind of in a second person way, looking back at another life line, how did I get here?"
"Unknown","00;11;45;06","00;12;26;14","The question that is often asked by living systems, including us, is, is something alive? That's answering Schrodinger's question. Ramstad at all 2018. It's an active topic of discussion and so here's the line of another system and so it's looking at the past the present and the future of some other system and is the flip about this red arc of the system projecting back and asking what took me there or is it looking out to another system and asking whether it's going to be the ruler of like meter stick of what is alive or not."
"Unknown","00;12;26;28","00;12;53;17","So probably other ways to represent it. Any thoughts on adding. Yeah it's just the what is alive thing now can be can be placed beside and when is alive. And I think that's what this paper really brings forward. If we look only at what is alive, we may over reduce may, but if we include when is alive, as you said, things get real interesting really, really fast."
"Unknown","00;12;55;00","00;13;15;03","And a really influential paper was first in single author 2013 life as we know it. And so that's often seen to be making a claim about the blue because it's like real life as we know it. This is like how we know what's alive. But then it's like even in the title with so few words as we know it, right?"
"Unknown","00;13;15;03","00;13;35;29","So even in there there's a little bit more depth. So this is a, a nice road trip. There's only a few stops, a few sections and figures. So there's an introduction and then minimizing free energy for better or worse, basically, just like you could minimize your potential energy right off a cliff, you can minimize free energy right off a cliff."
"Unknown","00;13;36;16","00;13;58;14","So for better or for worse, assuming life is better, we prefer to be alive There's a section on the conceptual distinctions between Bayes and the Free Energy Principle, which is very didactic. There's a numerical example presented in formalism as well as in a figure which we'll talk about a lot today, and then free energy on a wing and a prior."
"Unknown","00;13;59;16","00;14;37;25","The last section is called Future Direction Free Energy Minimization as a historical scientific principle, which I thought was exciting and appropriate for the paper being in biology and philosophy. So for those who are not steeped deeply in the philosophy game, there's some different terminology, but that's why the whole field is enriched by people bringing these different perspectives to bear so the keywords that are brought up prediction and post diction before and after historical sciences the free energy principle."
"Unknown","00;14;38;05","00;15;04;06","And then I think we added active inference and strong and B claims there are they were given as a key word, but they are key words for this discussion. So let's start with prediction. OK, I'll just say what I have on the slide then, Dean, our resident prediction matter expert. So first, never make predictions, especially about the future."
"Unknown","00;15;04;09","00;15;38;06","Casey Stengel or as they say in trading, either predict the price or the date, but never both. And on the Wikipedia page for prediction, there's so many different related areas. And that just tells you like, well, what is it that's related to all these areas? Things that are spooky and forward thinking, like an omen or an oracle like almost metaphysical or supernatural, all the way to things that are very technical reference, class forecasting, regression trends, expectations, forecasting."
"Unknown","00;15;38;25","00;16;08;27","And I think, in fact, if there's multiple ways that prediction comes into play. So just listing only four of a certain set, there's the prediction or the now casting of sensations, and that's like predictive processing, like the top down priors are modeled as providing predictions about sensory inputs. There's the prediction of or inference of hidden causes in the world from those sensory inputs which are not directly observed."
"Unknown","00;16;10;04","00;16;42;01","There's and importantly, notice that these two predictions are actually almost instantaneous. And then we also talk about prediction through time, like at time t there's the prediction or the anticipation of states at a future time, and those could be internal or external sense action states. So predicted future states. And then there's also the prediction of the consequences of action, which is anticipatory cybernetics, and that can include counterfactuals."
"Unknown","00;16;42;15","00;17;15;00","So what if something were to happen? That's like a prediction about a counterfactual. So there's multiple ways that prediction and act of inference come into play. What do you think about that, Dean? Yeah, I think it's all true. I think it just points, if you will, if we're going to ask how time is included, then we can break out how time has been included, what the difference is in terms of how time is included in an expectation versus how time is included in a trend estimation."
"Unknown","00;17;15;20","00;17;47;19","Because I think that's what causes us to be able to see multiple different ways of prediction. It's not just types of prediction, but then the actual time given over to that particular type. Great those who study prediction might be considered future study ers or future ologists. And that's also an interesting wiki page and search area. Just liked how many frameworks were brought up."
"Unknown","00;17;47;24","00;18;06;17","I mean, they forgot one starts with active and ends with inference but there's a lot of different methods here and I'm sure we could all think of more, but it's kind of like we have prediction as a concept looking forward in time or even to the now, which is kind of forward in time from where we made that prediction."
"Unknown","00;18;07;08","00;18;35;25","And then there's the field around that because we're going to also look at post diction and then the fields that deal with post diction. So just whether you're hearing about active inference for the first time or not, think about what is prediction fundamentally looking forward in time and then what are the attributes of fields that look forward in time for example, they may not have proof because they're making a prediction about something that hasn't yet played out."
"Unknown","00;18;36;22","00;19;17;10","So they might be an estimate that you'll bet the house on. But can one say that they have proof when they're talking about something going forward in time? Now, now, this is where it gets really interesting because if you're an archeologist slash anthropologist and you're trying to figure out whether the Plains of Stalag Bari where Salisbury, where's the originating place for all those rocks to get tipped up, you're actually looking forward into a future that you think is maybe unresolved, even though you're looking into the deep past as well."
"Unknown","00;19;17;22","00;20;05;02","So again, I know the time at Time Zero seems to be going only one direction, but our minds don't seem to necessarily honor that. Exactly. So we can contrast prediction with post diction. And so quoting the paper as a reasoning pattern, the FFP can be used to generate post dict of statements in the sense of, first of all, 2017, which we'll talk about accordingly fip reasoning might be interpreted as a principle akin to those found in the post dict of sciences, a.k.a historical sciences, hashtag keyword like geology, paleontology, archeology, or any science that deals with ere reproducible causes."
"Unknown","00;20;05;13","00;20;34;11","Clement Post active scientific statements are concerned with what must have been the case instead of what will be the case. So Cleland's paper from 2002 is posted here and it's very clear to see how the paper under discussion draws on this one. And just to read the conclusion of the abstract, I show that these different patterns of reasoning are grounded in an objective and remarkably pervasive time asymmetry of nature."
"Unknown","00;20;34;22","00;21;03;24","So there is this like enterprise arrow, times, arrow and that makes talking about the future and the now different than talking about the past. That's the historical sciences. And then the first one at all 2017 paper. Now this is interesting because perspective was only used one time in the paper. Fig. two illustrates the recurrent nature of the message passing that mediates this predictive and post active inference using little arrows."
"Unknown","00;21;04;28","00;21;26;12","One can clearly see that the first outcome can influence expectation about the final hidden state and expectations about the final hidden state. Reach back and influence expectations about the initial step. This will be this will become an important aspect of the deep temporal models considered later. So here's that figure two. It's the partially observable Markov decision process that we know and love."
"Unknown","00;21;27;02","00;21;59;19","With a layer of the message passing added because power and device are authors, and this is like a very I mean 2017 wasn't so long ago, but this was an important work that combined a lot of different areas together. And here's that reach around through time in an interesting way. Dean. Yeah, this is where bringing your history and my history into this interaction creates a new history."
"Unknown","00;22;00;11","00;22;36;17","And I know that symbolically I'm not me. That's a gross oversimplification, but if you were trying to share this with somebody with not as much background, maybe that would be a simple simple tell. I don't know. Cool. And just like we talked about future studies, let's think about the historical sciences. So here we have the past, present, future and historical sciences can refer to history proper, the auxiliary sciences of history or any science that draws from records of past events art experiments, also past events."
"Unknown","00;22;37;11","00;23;05;09","Now the auxiliary sciences include, but are not limited to in their so many fun fields here. Things that are like kind of like subfields of history, like heraldry, paleo graphy. So there's some great vaccinology, a lot of awesome terms in here. And then I was thinking, well, you know, you can't prove something in the future and it hasn't happened yet."
"Unknown","00;23;06;15","00;23;38;15","And then historically you also can't prove it because it couldn't have been otherwise hence you have to only say what must have been the case instead of what will be the case. Like, you can't generalize. You can't say, well, the Galapagos are biodiverse because even just give one singular answer, even putting ten version aside and everything then. So what's left the past, the present and the future and the now is just this kind of moving indicators that we're experiencing."
"Unknown","00;23;38;29","00;24;07;15","And so it doesn't really make sense to prove something only in the now either. So that's just very interesting how there's that, as Cleland calls it, the pervasive time asymmetry of nature and, you know, put your hand down if you disagree, but what does that leave for us to actually work with in terms of scientific modeling and from that tension is actually where FIP and acting are going to be doing some interesting things?"
"Unknown","00;24;09;06","00;24;33;13","Yeah, this is VR this is what I love your the the images that you put up here, because one of the things from from a learning standpoint that I found really helpful is instead of a test being what answers can you can you pull from your memory bank? It was a learning exhibition where the chronology was kind of the slow hand."
"Unknown","00;24;33;13","00;25;02;05","You'd lived out X number of months of working in a professional setting and now in front of a significant audience, you were laying out a chronic chronological timeline where the focus was on this. The feelings now now top down organized and narrated what that pull that entire picture of feelings of working in a professional setting for months actually now came out in terms of a narrative."
"Unknown","00;25;02;05","00;25;30;28","So the historical science piece here is actually an amazing consolidator as well. And that's why that's what I found about this paper. It was actually an incredible consolidator. Agreed. So necessity and sufficiency they're different words. They mean different things. And sometimes it's easy to get it right in a simple case. But then when science going to science, it gets like really mixed up."
"Unknown","00;25;31;16","00;25;57;12","So necessity means that you need it, like the car needs wheels to roll normally if you take it away, it's a loss of function. The wheels are a necessity for the car, but our wheels are sufficiency for the car. Well, no because just four wheels doesn't equal a car. Or you could have all the car, but if there's no gas, like, there's something else that's also necessary."
"Unknown","00;25;57;28","00;26;28;14","So they're very similar terms. They both describe the conditions that are sufficient and or necessary for something being the case, and that's been described discussed in the math. Three MA in this figure in the mathematical case, of course, necessity insufficiency is a key topic in the gene regulatory network case that I've studied where they talk about genes being necessary or sufficient for a given phenotype."
"Unknown","00;26;28;27","00;26;58;00","And then also in a legal case from this Yale Law Journal talking about the most restrictive to the least restrictive like if somebody had no causal role in a crime that inarguably occurred, they're blameless if somebody was necessary and sufficient for something to be caused, it makes sense that they would be guilty of that being occurred. But then there's complex systems in between and there's the difference that makes a difference."
"Unknown","00;26;58;09","00;27;23;28","And there's so many ways to talk about necessity insufficiency. So there's sort of a simple bookmark on both necessity and sufficiency and neither. And then there's a complex space in between all I would say is there's no matter how often you talk about causation, it's amazing how much stuff just gets Roman candle information wise out of that simple word."
"Unknown","00;27;24;07","00;27;52;00","That's all I need to say about that. Last keyword proper is free energy principle and check out active stream number 14, number 32. Number two X. I mean, roll the die. We talk about it a lot, but it's always important to go over it because it may be someone's first time hearing it, and the simple aspects of it are the parts that we want to return to again and again."
"Unknown","00;27;52;07","00;28;30;15","Kind of like a strange attractor in our model, kind of like the FSP we've talked about some of the technical part on the bottom, so check out especially 32 and 26 for the bottom parts and then the free energy principle is this imperative to be self evidencing and antiderivative? If I could only choose two words, potentially those would be it and they're both going to come up today because antiderivative will be equated to persistence, duration of survival, and then evidencing is going to be related to Bayesian approaches to modeling evidence."
"Unknown","00;28;31;23","00;29;08;09","And then where do you go from there? There's so many places to go. Active inference, the corollary process theory and we're going to talk and unpack FFP in a few different domains. So good to move to next slide all right. So how does FFP free energy principle relate to life in this paper? So the paper says minimizing free energy is the process whereby one maintains one's structural integrity in face of environmental perturbations by revisiting one's most probable organization of physiologic states."
"Unknown","00;29;09;04","00;29;42;02","It is in that sense that minimizing free energy is considered a condition for life. One can equate survival with life since one supposes the other under the FFP. And then kind of two slogans, cool sentence structure. If I survived, it means that I maintained my structural integrity in face of environmental perturbations in a dissipated universe, according to the era of time and maintaining my structural integrity is what qualifies me as living from the point of view of the FSP when considering metamorphic organisms."
"Unknown","00;29;42;14","00;30;25;21","It may be said that the life cycle that corresponds to the thing whose integrity is maintained over time, e.g. over evolutionary time, not the specific form that the system takes at one stage of its development, e.g. the adult form of a frog or ants in this case, the FSP within the realm of process ontology versus substance ontology. And I just have to say that Bucky Fuller talks about structural integrity as being like the house that stays up through time, but pattern integrity is in his ontology, a system that recapitulates itself, and so it retains dynamical integrity."
"Unknown","00;30;26;13","00;31;01;10","And then that's connected to the idea of process ontology versus substance ontology, which we'll discuss more in the next slide. But it just also like this is an ants in ants has a lifecycle but then you can almost pull back and say, well, really the integrity of this egg becoming an adult, it's related to the nurses feeding that egg so even if that egg to adults transition reminds us of a solitary organism, the integrity that's being regenerated generation after generation, is like the colony."
"Unknown","00;31;01;27","00;31;26;07","And so what are we talking about? The persistence of when you never step into the same river twice. Like in one sense, there is no integrity being maintained because things are always changing. And so the FSP framing life in that way is very interesting. What do you think? Yeah, this is where it's I would often say to people, I want you to go into this situation."
"Unknown","00;31;26;07","00;31;50;20","I know it's new for you, but I want you to go to this situation. With both eyes open and with one of the eyes. I want you to see the project at hand, potentially, and with the other, I want you to be able to see the system at hand potentially. That's very confusing because, I mean, the best that we most of us can do is just deal with the complexity of the project or the complexity of the system, not the complexity of both concurrently."
"Unknown","00;31;50;20","00;32;20;29","But having said that, the better you can work at knowing both are present, regardless of what you decide is your focal point in that particular moment, the better you'll have an opportunity to sort of get the whole picture going on here. It's hard. In fact, it takes it takes some moving away from the way that most people are trained, try to look at things."
"Unknown","00;32;21;07","00;33;03;08","So it's really hard, to be honest. Let's dig into process versus substance ontology. Perfect. So the 2020 to pre paper is cited life as process and also just a cool kind of coincidence that it's a bilingual abstract if not paper with English and Russia and check out the paper and all the citations if you want to read more but just to read the highlighted parts that kind of get the essence of the abstract the metaphysics that has dominated Western philosophy in that currently shapes most understanding of life and the life sciences sees the world as composed of things and their properties."
"Unknown","00;33;04;11","00;33;30;00","While these things appear to undergo all kinds of changes like metabolism, development, context changes, it has often been supposed that this amounts to no more than a change in the spatial relations of their unchanging parts. From antiquity. However, there has been a rival to this view the process ontology associated in antiquity with the fragmentary surviving writings of Heraclitus four process ontology."
"Unknown","00;33;30;13","00;33;50;10","What most fundamentally exists is change or process. What we are tempted to think of as constant things are in reality, merely temporary stability is in this constant flux of change, eddies in the flux of process. My main claim in this paper will be that of metaphysics. Of the latter kind is the only kind of adequate to making sense of the living world."
"Unknown","00;33;50;28","00;34;35;29","And also related research is this causally powerful processes from earlier in 2021 by degree in Synthes. So this is a fascinating line of research about moving from a substance to a process based view and where causation comes into play. With that, with respect to the historical sciences, there's so many other ways to take this. Another quote that one of my philosophy professors would always say, I think it was a quote from Kant was There will never be a Newton for a blade of grass because there isn't a mechanistic explanation that's timeless for a blade of grass in the way that there plausibly could be for like Newton's cradle."
"Unknown","00;34;37;12","00;35;18;03","So I wanted to ask you, did you find this? Had you known about this before reading this paper? Or did the paper cause you to go and look and find papers on process ontology? Because two of our colleagues talk about flux Blue and Stephen a lot. And so when you brought this forward, I thought, OK, so this Dan, you've been hiding this from me all along because these kind of known about this stuff or or did the paper, in effect, create a situation where you wanted to know more about process, ontology, I followed the stigma."
"Unknown","00;35;18;08","00;35;48;23","You write in the paper, it says it's unclear whether it might be argued life and survival refer to an enduring process that advocates of process ecology would call organism in the sense of the pre 2020 went down to the citations. There was no yeah I knew this photographer I knew this philosopher but I hadn't read this paper. Yeah so exactly process ontology now generating due process ontologies variation upon variation."
"Unknown","00;35;48;23","00;36;20;18","Right. And still in the FPP still at that MVP narrow timeframe it's it's that goes back to, as I said, I'm not sure if it's just subjective or subjective and objective. So anyway, I'm glad you found this because now I got to read the pre because. Yeah. Anyway, oh, substance. Where are they staying so how does the FFP relate to active inference?"
"Unknown","00;36;22;11","00;36;46;10","What kind of getting ahead in the paper in one sense, so we'll be coming back around to it. But the FIP on its own is a principle, namely a foundation for reasoning about things, e.g. living things. In this paper we approach the FIP as such. However, the FIP can also be read more broadly as a research program that uses FIP reasoning patterns to generate scientific hypotheses."
"Unknown","00;36;46;29","00;37;25;17","This involves implementing FIP reasoning into a theory called active inference, which is routinely used to study various cognitive functions. When you go to the footnote, there's only one. It's important to note that FIP includes processes other than free energy minimization. It also includes expected free energy minimization and generalized free energy minimization while minimizing free energy endows the organism with post active inference, which we're going to go into in the example, talk about more minimizing expected free energy in the organism with predictive inference."
"Unknown","00;37;26;13","00;37;58;25","So fip is post dictum. It looks at the oncoming stream of data and it compares that to basically what must have been the case but active or any other predictive theory. That's about expectations. It kind of has to be different because the consequences of action are in the future. So it has to be these two different modes. And then we're going to come back to these ideas."
"Unknown","00;37;58;25","00;38;27;00","But fip reasoning yields historical hypothesis is not just like epic or legendary, but they're about the past because it operates a historical evidentiary pattern and provides a compelling unifying causal story. It operates a curious evidentiary pattern though, because it assumes that both the investigator and the thing under investigation conform to that evidentiary pattern that pattern is free energy minimization per se, right?"
"Unknown","00;38;27;23","00;38;57;26","So if you're making fewer prediction errors, you are you're you're time frame carries on, but you actually do become I don't know if you want the label, but you do become some re more versed in perspective what do we want to call them? Perspective confirmations. I don't even know what to how to describe it, but this was a research thing for me."
"Unknown","00;38;58;07","00;39;52;03","Post dictator. Yeah, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. We talk a lot about prediction markets, but where's the post addiction market? And what if organisms are so good at post addiction? It looks predictive. So let's. Yeah, is it got to be you know, they got disclaimers whenever you read the forward looking statements right like this it post detective is now a new term that I can they can pull into those conversations around the disclaimer it's like if something is not predictive it's either about right now or it's post active right exac let's get to the core terminology that Axel is bringing up here and like this is what reading the paper means is to understand like why"
"Unknown","00;39;52;04","00;40;33;05","this Entailment problem is framed, what responses exist to that problem implicitly, explicitly how it's addressed in this paper and what the implications are going forward. That's like you'll have read the paper to have known those things. Right? This was an earlier quote that sometimes arguments in the literature in the FIP give the impression that in order to be alive e.g. sufficiency, one must minimize free energy such a claim does not straightforwardly apply to the FIP, however, and this is what the paper will demonstrate minimizing free energy does not until life candles minimize effi to."
"Unknown","00;40;33;25","00;41;12;10","Rather, the argument is that if your life it probably means that you have done something like minimizing your free energy, which is the base optimal thing to do when your life depends upon solving complex inference problems. This is a subtle but crucial point to getting the story straight I shall call this the entailment problem. That is the confusion in the Entailment relation between first between free energy minimization and life here, the notion of Entailment refers to the implication, i.e. first order logical property between free energy minimization and the fact of displaying some life related processes."
"Unknown","00;41;12;23","00;41;41;02","So let's think about two different islands minimizing free energy and life. So we could think of it as like a Venn diagram. They can be overlapping, they can be partially overlapping, they could be not overlapping. Arrows can be drawn anywhere as long as you label them axle frames. They're to be two different kinds of threads, like two archetypes of framings in the literature."
"Unknown","00;41;42;00","00;42;10;03","The first is the strong claim. The strong claim is that or what's called the overly generous claim by Kirchhoff in Frost 2017 is minimizing free energy is a sufficient condition for life. So we're going to go out there with our free energy ometer and things that are minimizing free energy are alive because it's sufficient the other claim is the weak claim."
"Unknown","00;42;11;04","00;42;39;14","If a system is currently alive, it means that it minimized its free energy in other words, minimizing free energy was necessary but not necessarily sufficient for being alive. Such a claim does not assume the FP is designed to set the bar for the sufficient conditions of life or meant to predict what things may or may not be. Life rather, it limits the scope of application of the principle to beings that we think are alive now."
"Unknown","00;42;41;05","00;43;04;24","What made us think that that's not in theory and enables us to know the necessary conditions under which those beings can be living, i.e. can actively resist the loss of structural integrity? What took them there? Right. What do you think about that? Well, I just think it's interesting that he talks later on we'll get to this is the that you need to correct or right priors."
"Unknown","00;43;04;29","00;43;48;19","And if you go with the strong argument, you assume that the right priors going forward will continue to just materialize versus the weak argument which says it's not until afterwards whether we know whether or not the right priors were the ones picked yeah. There's so many funny examples. So let's talk about Bayesian organisms, Bayesian approaches to animal behavior, whether it's Bayesian approaches to foraging or the Bayesian brain proposed that one can model red light, one can model not that organisms are right, one can model."
"Unknown","00;43;48;19","00;44;14;12","So just to forestall any kind of map territory distinction, which we always return to, but can't be returned to enough, one can model organisms as representing their relation to environmental states using priors and a likelihood let's call those representations Bayesian beliefs, not in the organism. It's our representation of that in the model. On the basis of those beliefs, organisms generate adaptive behavior."
"Unknown","00;44;15;26","00;44;45;16","Bayes beliefs can represent the probability of environmental states prior to observing a signal that's called a prior means before, and the relation between environmental states and the observed environmental signals a.k.a a likelihood based theorem from which terms such as the prior likelihood come from, is typically expressed as an evidentiary relationship between some prior hypotheses p of H and the observation or hand or data that's E."
"Unknown","00;44;45;17","00;45;29;26","So E is going to be like evidence or empirical h is for like hypothesis in the way that this sentence is read this expression. This is Bayes theorem, and it's read as the probability of the hypothesis, given the evidence vertical bar means given or conditioned on. So the probability of the hypothesis, given the evidence equals there's the equal sign both sides of the same the probability of the evidence, given the hypothesis multiplied by the probability of the hypothesis that's in the brackets divided by the probability of the evidence that's based."
"Unknown","00;45;29;26","00;45;57;12","Theorem people use Bayes Theorem to model all kinds of things about different systems. The free energy principle is a Bayesian formulation of the manner in which organisms infer the posterior probability of their prior beliefs after having inferred observed an environmental signal with a given likelihood in in doing so, infer some hidden or unobserved variables. Same equation as last slide."
"Unknown","00;45;58;18","00;46;26;07","What stands for the H are unobserved variables whose prior probability forms the hypothesis and what stands for E are the sensory signals organisms receive the data. So this is like I think it's equally likely that it's day or night like it's 12 and 12. So 5050. On whether the latent cause of the world the hypothesis is daytime or nighttime, but you can observe daytime or nighttime all you get are photons on the retina."
"Unknown","00;46;27;05","00;46;52;22","So then it's like you have a prior that's like 5050 and then evidence comes in photons. And then if there's a lot of photons you update your prior to get the posterior and then you think, OK, it's daytime because I'm getting a lot of photons hence it is often said that under the free energy principle, organisms are viewed as embodying a hypothesis, belief or best guess about the cause of their sensations."
"Unknown","00;46;53;05","00;47;21;17","Or sensory signals that they receive. That's because the evidence for an organism are its onboard sensors and so the hypotheses are about causes of what is giving rise to sensation. Just like in the daylight example, it was a hypothesis about what was giving rise to the photons because beliefs are embodied by the organism, hashtag embedded, enacted, et cetera."
"Unknown","00;47;22;02","00;47;46;24","And thus the organisms own states. The uncertainty and the likelihood in the prior can be viewed as representing uncertainty inherent to the biological apparatus instead of uncertainty in the world, as would be the case under typical Bayesian models. Under the FIP, uncertainty should be thus read as reporting a Bayesian credence or credibility score over the organisms own beliefs."
"Unknown","00;47;47;16","00;48;22;25","As it reports the probability of a state or hypothesis relative of two other possible hypothesis. What do you think well, I'm going to I'm going to. What do I think? I'm going to ask you a question back. So is this another way of saying an account of uncertainty right. So that that that sounds like wait a second, how how can we have an an account of something that we don't know?"
"Unknown","00;48;22;25","00;48;43;18","But is that what he's I know I don't want to interrupt the math because I really like the the way he step by step goes through this. But I when I read this again, when I read this the first time, I went, oh, OK. Well, this is an account of uncertainty. Wait a second. How can that be so yes."
"Unknown","00;48;44;12","00;49;26;13","Uncertainty is about the hypothesis giving rise to the. So it's the win it takes place over a duration because the updating of priors is happening through time. So it's like as my tummy is sending me signals, the body is as if determining whether I'm hungry or not. And then that uncertainty is the probability of a state or hypothesis relative to other hypotheses."
"Unknown","00;49;27;03","00;50;15;04","Yeah. So the traditional models or methods that we use to try to account for what has been learned doesn't necessarily take this into consideration when in fact this is the basis for moving forward and for learning. Yes, I think there'd be some interesting one. And to discussions about uncertainty, infrequent ism versus Bayesian probability and about what it means for a frequentist p value driven understanding of certainty or not, I fail to reject hunger at the point of five P value versus the Bayesian credible interval or the Bayes factor of being hungry is this or that relative to this condition on the sensory."
