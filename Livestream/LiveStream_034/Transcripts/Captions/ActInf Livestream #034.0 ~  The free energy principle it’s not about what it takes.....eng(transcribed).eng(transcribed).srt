00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,399
all right hello and welcome everyone

4
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,000
it's active lab live stream number 34.0

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,800
on december 3rd 2021 and we're

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,879
discussing the paper the free energy

7
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,200
principle it's not about what it takes

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,920
it's about what took you there

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,559
welcome to the actin flap

10
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,199
we are a participatory online lab that

11
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,760
is communicating learning and practicing

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,920
applied active inference you can find us

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,640
at the links here on this slide

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,719
this is a recorded and an archived live

15
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,160
stream so please provide us with

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,239
feedback so that we can improve on our

17
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,438
work

18
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,600
all backgrounds and perspectives are

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,479
welcome here and we'll be following

20
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,200
cool diatic video chat etiquette today

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,840
at this coda site you can find our

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,799
sortable searchable interactable and

23
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,840
growing database of past and future live

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,040
streams

25
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,840
and if nothing else isn't this paper

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,960
going to be about the past and the

27
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,000
future

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,240
and it's also our last paper discussion

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,200
that we're kicking off for 2021 in

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,600
number 34. so it's a pretty cool

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,200
discussion and i'm really looking

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,439
forward to it

33
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,159
in actin stream number 34 we're going to

34
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,479
be discussing the paper the free energy

35
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,799
principle it's not about what it takes

36
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,960
it's about what took you there by axel

37
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,600
constant in 2021

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,920
and just like all the other dot zeros

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,399
the video is a introduction to some of

40
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,719
the ideas and the context for the paper

41
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,040
it's not a review or an evaluation or a

42
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,960
final word

43
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,439
we'll go over the aims and the claims

44
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,199
the abstract and the roadmap of the

45
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,599
paper and then there's a couple keywords

46
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,440
including some that we haven't seen

47
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,640
before

48
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,520
and then we'll walk through the key

49
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,080
example which is the numerical example

50
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,959
of a simple signal detecting bacterium

51
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,080
and we'll kind of talk through that

52
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,360
example and see where that takes us

53
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,160
and i'll just note as with all the other

54
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,239
dot zeros check out the paper if you

55
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,200
want to learn more and axel's writing is

56
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,599
really a pleasure to read and he has

57
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,640
deep insight into the fep

58
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,239
so we'll start with just

59
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,239
saying hello and

60
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,040
anything that we else wanted to say so

61
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,120
i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

62
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,640
california

63
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,239
and

64
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,959
what excited me about this paper and got

65
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,680
me excited to discuss it was i think

66
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,360
axel's provocative as well as grounded

67
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,720
and respectful

68
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,360
approach to dealing with what has and

69
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,800
hasn't been done

70
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,400
in the fep

71
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,080
and the example is so minimal and paired

72
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,680
down but also insightful that i think it

73
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,400
lends itself to a jumping off point for

74
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,879
many many other discussions

75
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,319
dean

76
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,200
yeah uh uh thanks daniel i'm dean i'm

77
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
i'm in calgary

78
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,760
and uh i think what excited me about

79
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,599
this was that i um i didn't start out

80
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,120
really understanding what the title of

81
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,799
the paper even meant

82
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,319
but then when there when there was a bit

83
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,280
of a

84
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,120
an inversion and a bit of a taking

85
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,200
things inside out and

86
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,400
i don't know if you want to describe

87
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
that as a reversal of what is typically

88
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,680
viewed as the

89
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,680
time continuum or not

90
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,720
um

91
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,959
it just opened up a whole bunch of uh

92
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,640
interesting ideas which i was

93
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,159
contemplating as a

94
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,640
as a program developer because

95
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,560
i knew that

96
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,959
um in order for

97
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,560
the idea of being able to go from an

98
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,640
inference i believed going from an

99
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,159
inference which is a very small time

100
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,560
frame through a prediction set and

101
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,480
finally into being able to get to a

102
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,680
place of modeling or understanding

103
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,160
co-variation as a as collective

104
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,600
uh this paper would probably help and

105
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,079
then with each section i went through

106
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,919
it was it was very helpful in terms of

107
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,800
being able to sort of bring this idea

108
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,400
just as an idea

109
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,080
not in terms of its practical

110
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,280
implications but just as an idea

111
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,100
to life so

112
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,169
[Music]

113
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,000
okay

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,880
i'm sure he'll rejoin

115
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,639
i'm gonna just read through some of the

116
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,280
big questions and

117
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,120
again these are just the ones that we

118
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,479
wrote down so all read the first two and

119
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,080
then maybe say something and then dean

120
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,320
you can take the second two so two of

121
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,199
the big questions that the paper raises

122
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,240
are

123
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,520
what is the free energy principle about

124
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,479
and what is the entailment relationship

125
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,160
between life

126
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,080
and the minimization of free energy or

127
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,520
another way to read that is what is the

128
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,840
entailment relationship between life and

129
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,320
models that emphasize the minimization

130
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,840
of free energy

131
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,520
and

132
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,080
i just love how the paper dances between

133
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,199
both of them

134
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,759
and figuring out what the fep exactly is

135
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,000
and isn't in its distinction from

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,960
general bayesian theories from active

137
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,080
inference

138
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,039
these are really crucial distinctions

139
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,960
dean

140
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,280
yeah so the the second two questions

141
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,840
were one one was from the author i'll

142
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,120
read the fourth one first from the

143
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,840
author are prior subjective or objective

144
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,440
under the fep

145
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,280
um i put the words

146
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,440
and with the question mark yes

147
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,120
because i actually have a question about

148
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,520
this he he comes to a conclusion but i'm

149
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,400
not

150
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,120
i'm not sure what the timeline is switch

151
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,440
leads back to bullet three which is

152
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,120
what can we say about relationship when

153
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,800
we shift from looking at what something

154
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,600
is

155
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,680
the comparison of life and free energy

156
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,319
principle to how long it lasts he talks

157
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,800
about duration or the when aspect of

158
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
that and that's the thing that kind of

159
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,120
adds a twist to this because you can

160
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,280
look at it as very momentary or you can

161
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,280
look at his things as very cyclic

162
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,039
obviously expression episodic and

163
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,759
diachronic and you've used kairos and

164
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,840
there's lots and lots of ways to bring

165
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,900
that in but when we do

166
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,160
[Music]

167
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,360
things change pretty quickly

168
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,720
and it's so funny you had to go to the

169
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,080
fourth one

170
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,400
but was it really the fourth question

171
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,479
if you read it third

172
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,440
right

173
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,479
there we go

174
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,160
so the paper was published on two two 2

175
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,280
2 1

176
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,720
could have waited a year and gone for

177
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,400
the total too but

178
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,919
i understand you got to get those papers

179
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:54,880
out

180
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,440
and a few of the key aims and claims so

181
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,680
first using the author's words the

182
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,319
entailment problem is the confusion in

183
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,240
the entailment relationship between free

184
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,080
energy minimization and life so if

185
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,599
you've never heard the word entailment

186
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,199
never heard free energy we're going to

187
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,120
go into some of these things but the

188
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,039
entailment problem is people being

189
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,960
confused about entailment that's a

190
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,599
problem in this paper

191
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,680
the author dissolves what's called the

192
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,319
entailment problem proposed here by

193
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,400
providing a numerical example of free

194
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,319
energy minimization in a hypothetical

195
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,319
organism

196
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,599
i conclude with some brief

197
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,919
epistemological knowledge oriented

198
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,080
remarks that may be of interest for

199
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,080
those who worry about the explanatory

200
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,000
power of the fep

201
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,479
and then this is the last words of the

202
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,720
paper which we'll return to

203
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,479
at the end of this live stream

204
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,000
the claim i set up at the start of the

205
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,160
paper is that free energy minimization

206
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,879
is not sufficient for life

207
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,080
mic drop

208
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,759
fidel true

209
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,000
to the unifying grip of hypotheses in

210
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,160
historical sciences the free energy

211
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,759
principle is meant to account for all of

212
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,479
that

213
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,520
you me and the organism under study in a

214
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,560
unifying fashion

215
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,800
any thoughts on those claims we'll be

216
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,240
exploring them and discussing them in

217
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,039
the

218
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,960
today yeah no the only thing that i

219
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
immediately went to is was it was a

220
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,199
question that i would ask people who

221
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,720
were sort of on the other side of

222
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,479
whatever it is that they were moving

223
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,160
towards in terms of a

224
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,080
sort of a professional

225
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,840
um

226
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,280
participation participation

227
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,599
and so the entailment thing for me was

228
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,000
is it opportunity

229
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,919
over method

230
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,039
meaning method entailing opportunity or

231
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,240
or is it

232
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,760
met

233
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,440
opportunity being over method or method

234
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,519
being entailed by opportunity

235
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,680
and that is the same kind of question

236
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,720
that that axel looks at here

237
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,760
so

238
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,959
depending on how you see that entailment

239
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,560
things go off in completely different

240
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,040
directions so let's go and get into the

241
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,279
paper now because yeah that's something

242
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,080
that you can't resolve until

243
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,680
post-diction

244
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,640
you can expect how it'll be resolved but

245
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,600
right

246
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,519
then you look back and it might have

247
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,279
been different so

248
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,720
i'll read the abstract and then feel

249
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,480
free to give a thought and of course

250
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,399
anyone watching along live is always

251
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,399
welcome to give comments and questions

252
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,440
in the live chat so the abstract is

253
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,480
i'll read um the first and the third one

254
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,399
philosophical writings on the free

255
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,399
energy principle in the life sciences

256
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,680
often give the impression that

257
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,240
minimizing free energy is sufficient for

258
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,120
life

259
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,120
but minimizing free energy is not a

260
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,959
sufficient condition for life

261
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,519
in fact one can perfectly well conceive

262
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,000
of a system that actively minimizes its

263
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,160
free energy and for this very reason

264
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,640
moves inexorably towards death

265
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,440
so

266
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,040
where does the assumption of this

267
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,160
entailment relation come from

268
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,240
there is indeed an entailment relation

269
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,480
but it goes the other way around life

270
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,959
entails minimizing free energy

271
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,839
but another way if you exist now under

272
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,680
the right conditions

273
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,519
it's because you've done something like

274
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,000
minimizing your free energy however

275
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,920
the question of whether you exist

276
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,040
tomorrow

277
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,640
cannot be settled purely by the

278
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,040
resorting to the fact that you'll

279
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,120
minimize your free energy in order to

280
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,399
get there

281
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,720
the simple point i make in this paper is

282
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,640
that the free energy principle is not

283
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,040
concerned with the sufficient conditions

284
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,360
of existence but rather what must have

285
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,079
been the case necessary what must have

286
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,560
been the case given that you exist it's

287
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,640
not about figuring out what it takes to

288
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,959
be alive it's about figuring out what

289
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,959
took you there

290
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,560
and i'd recommend people to put this in

291
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,760
a speed text-to-speech reader it reads

292
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,480
just so fantastically in a robotic voice

293
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,880
i rarely do that for papers

294
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,800
but i was on my i was on my exercise

295
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,959
bike listening to the robot talk about

296
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,480
this and it was just

297
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,360
it was hilarious

298
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,279
so here's the simple point in the paper

299
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,200
free energy principle is not concerned

300
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,480
with the sufficient conditions of

301
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,640
existence but rather with what must have

302
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,880
been the case given you exist it's worth

303
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,720
restating because it's a simple point

304
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,399
but the depth

305
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,200
of how far off one can be by missing

306
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,440
this point is vast

307
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,880
it's not about figuring out what it

308
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,800
takes to be alive it's about figuring

309
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,399
out what took

310
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,279
you

311
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,560
there

312
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,720
not what took the living system there so

313
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,880
here's the living system

314
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,640
but we can even finesse that it's you

315
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,440
and so the red line is the system

316
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,560
looking back how did i get here

317
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,519
or

318
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,120
putting kind of in a second person way

319
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,959
looking back at another lifeline how did

320
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,120
i get here

321
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,680
the question that is often asked by

322
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,920
living systems including us is is

323
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,079
something alive that's answering

324
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,079
schrodinger's question ramstead at all

325
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,279
2018. it's active topic of discussion

326
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,760
and so here's the line of another system

327
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,360
and so it's looking at the past the

328
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,279
present and the future of some other

329
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,560
system

330
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,440
and

331
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,040
is the fep

332
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,519
about this red arc

333
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,560
of the system projecting back and asking

334
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,320
what took

335
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,120
me

336
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,240
there

337
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,200
or

338
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,320
is it looking out to another system

339
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,240
and asking whether it's going to be the

340
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,399
ruler of like the meter stick

341
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,279
of

342
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,600
what is alive or not so probably other

343
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,200
ways to represent it any thoughts on

344
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,440
that dean yeah it's just what is alive

345
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,360
thing now can be can be

346
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,120
placed beside and when is alive and i

347
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,200
think that's what this paper really

348
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,480
brings forward

349
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,120
if we look only at what is alive we may

350
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,560
over reduce

351
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,440
may

352
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,079
but if we include when is alive as you

353
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,639
said things get real interesting really

354
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,959
really fast

355
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,279
and a really influential paper was

356
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,399
fristen's single author 2013 life as we

357
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,360
know it and so that's often seen to be

358
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,880
making a claim

359
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,959
about the blue because it's like real

360
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,560
life as we know it this is like how we

361
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,920
know what's alive

362
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,920
but then it's like even in the title

363
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,639
with so few words as we know it

364
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,120
right so even in there there's a little

365
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,800
bit more depth

366
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,920
so this is a nice road trip there's only

367
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,480
a few stops few sections and figures so

368
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,079
there's an introduction

369
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,240
and then minimizing free energy for

370
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,560
better or worse basically just like you

371
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,480
could minimize your potential energy

372
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,639
right off a cliff you can minimize free

373
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,480
energy right off a cliff

374
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,200
so

375
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,680
for better or for worse assuming life is

376
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,920
better we prefer to be alive

377
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,360
there's a section on the conceptual

378
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,199
distinctions between bayes and the free

379
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,880
energy principle which is very didactic

380
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,360
there's a numerical example presented in

381
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,680
formalism as well as in a figure which

382
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,760
we'll talk about a lot today

383
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,000
and then free energy on a wing and a

384
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,440
prior

385
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,880
the last section is called future

386
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,360
direction free energy minimization as a

387
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,560
historical scientific principle which

388
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,320
i thought was exciting and appropriate

389
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,040
for the paper being in biology and

390
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,240
philosophy

391
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,240
so for those who are not

392
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,040
steeped deeply in the philosophy game

393
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,680
there's some different terminology but

394
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,560
that's

395
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,480
why the whole field is enriched by

396
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,920
people bringing these different

397
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,800
perspectives to bear

398
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,839
so the key words that are brought up

399
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,959
prediction and post addiction

400
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,959
before and after

401
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,560
historical sciences

402
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,480
the free energy principle and then i

403
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,360
think we added active inference

404
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,560
and strong and weak claims

405
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,800
they're argued they were given as a

406
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,199
keyword but they are key words for this

407
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,399
discussion

408
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,000
so let's start with

409
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,560
prediction okay i'll just

410
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,880
say what i have on the slide then dean

411
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,480
our resident prediction matter expert so

412
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,880
um first never make predictions

413
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,480
especially about the future casey

414
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,279
stengel or as they say in trading either

415
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,680
predict the price or the date but never

416
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,880
both

417
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,760
and on the wikipedia page for prediction

418
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,680
there's so many different

419
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,160
related areas and that just tells you

420
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,839
like well what is it that's related to

421
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,880
all these areas things that are spooky

422
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,519
and forward thinking like an omen or an

423
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,560
oracle

424
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,480
like almost metaphysical or supernatural

425
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,800
all the way to things that are very

426
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,040
technical reference class forecasting

427
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,519
regression trends expectations

428
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,720
forecasting

429
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,199
and i think in active there's

430
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,040
multiple ways that prediction comes into

431
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,759
play so just listing only four of a

432
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,279
certain set

433
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,279
there's the prediction or the now

434
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,519
casting of sensations and that's like

435
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,920
predictive processing like the top down

436
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,000
priors are

437
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,480
modeled as providing predictions about

438
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,399
sensory inputs

439
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,240
there's the prediction

440
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,399
of or inference of

441
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,399
hidden causes in the world from those

442
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,240
sensory inputs which are not directly

443
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,000
observed

444
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,320
there's uh and importantly notice that

445
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,399
these two predictions are actually

446
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,920
almost instantaneous

447
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,839
and then we also talk about prediction

448
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,639
through time like at time t

449
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,839
there's the prediction or the

450
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,160
anticipation of

451
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,399
states at a future time and those could

452
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,639
be internal external sense action states

453
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,079
so predicted

454
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,759
future states

455
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,680
and then there's also the prediction of

456
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,320
the consequences of action which is

457
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,040
anticipatory cybernetics and can that

458
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,120
that can include um

459
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,839
counterfactuals so what if

460
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,440
something were to happen that's like a

461
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,639
prediction

462
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,800
about a counterfactual

463
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,720
so there's multiple ways that prediction

464
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
and active inference come into play

465
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,480
what do you think about that dean

466
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,240
yeah i think it's all true i think it

467
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,360
just points

468
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,720
if we're

469
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,959
if we're going to ask how time is

470
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,480
included

471
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,440
then

472
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,839
we can break out how time has been

473
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,679
included like what the difference is in

474
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,760
terms of how time is included in an

475
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,559
expectation versus how times you is

476
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,520
included in a trend estimation

477
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,599
because i think that's what causes us to

478
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,480
be able to see multiple different ways

479
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,079
of prediction

480
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,559
so not just types of prediction but then

481
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,400
the actual

482
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,160
time given over to

483
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,840
that particular type

484
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,480
great

485
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,440
those who study prediction

486
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,640
might be considered um future studiers

487
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,559
or futurologists

488
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,200
and that's also an interesting wiki page

489
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,960
and search area

490
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,960
just like how many frameworks were

491
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,039
brought up i mean they forgot one it

492
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,320
starts with active and ends with

493
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,360
inference

494
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,160
but

495
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,679
there's a lot of different

496
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,160
methods here and i'm sure we could all

497
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,679
think of more but it's kind of like we

498
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,760
have prediction as a concept looking

499
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,200
forward in time or even to the now which

500
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,520
is kind of forward in time from when we

501
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,120
made that prediction

502
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,880
and then there's the field around that

503
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,480
because we're going to also look at

504
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,760
post-diction

505
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,679
and then the fields that deal with

506
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,880
post-diction

507
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,200
so just whether you're hearing about

508
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,880
active inference for the first time or

509
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,120
not think about what is prediction

510
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,520
fundamentally looking forward in time

511
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,120
and then what are the attributes of

512
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,559
fields

513
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,240
that look forward in time

514
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,480
for example they may not have proof

515
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,919
because they're making a prediction

516
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,520
about something that hasn't yet played

517
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,559
out

518
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,919
so they might

519
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:38,720
be

520
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,520
an estimate that you'll bet the house on

521
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,320
but can one say that they have proof

522
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,679
when they're talking about something

523
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,480
going forward in time

524
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,520
now

525
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,799
now this is where it gets really

526
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,919
interesting because if you're an

527
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,360
archaeologist

528
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,679
slash anthropologist and you're trying

529
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,200
to figure out whether

530
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,679
the plains of salivary where

531
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,240
salisbury was the originating place for

532
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,760
all those rocks to get tipped up

533
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,080
you're actually looking

534
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,559
forward into a future

535
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,240
that your you think is maybe unresolved

536
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,760
even though if you're looking into the

537
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,160
deep past as well so again

538
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,400
i know that time time 0 seems to be

539
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,799
going only one direction but our minds

540
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,880
don't seem to necessarily honor that

541
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,320
exactly

542
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
so we can

543
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,240
contrast

544
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,960
prediction with post-diction

545
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,600
and so quoting the paper

546
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,080
as a reasoning pattern the fep can be

547
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,720
used to generate postdictive statements

548
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,200
in the sense of first in it all 2017

549
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,760
which we'll talk about accordingly fep

550
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,600
reasoning might be interpreted as a

551
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,120
principle akin to those found in the

552
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,520
post-dictive sciences aka historical

553
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,600
sciences hashtag keyword like geology

554
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,039
paleontology

555
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,200
archaeology or any science that deals

556
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,360
with irreproducible causes

557
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,880
cleland

558
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,559
postdictive scientific statements are

559
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,240
concerned with what must have been the

560
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,200
case instead of what will be the case

561
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,080
so

562
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,960
clelland's paper from 2002 is posted

563
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,000
here

564
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,960
and

565
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,080
it's very clear to see how the paper uh

566
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,919
under discussion draws on this one and

567
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:24,960
just to

568
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
read the conclusion of the abstract i

569
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,480
show that these different patterns of

570
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,679
reasoning

571
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,200
are grounded in an objective and

572
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,919
remarkably pervasive time asymmetry of

573
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,799
nature so there is this like entropies

574
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,960
arrow times arrow

575
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,679
and that makes talking about the future

576
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,280
and the now different than talking about

577
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,720
the past

578
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,039
that's the historical sciences

579
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,840
and then the first general 2017 paper

580
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,200
now this is interesting because

581
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,679
postdictive was only used one time in

582
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,200
the paper

583
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,799
figure 2 illustrates the recurrent

584
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,559
nature of the message passing that

585
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,640
mediates this predictive

586
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,200
and postdictive inference using little

587
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,799
arrows

588
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,640
one can clearly see that the first

589
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,480
outcome can influence expectation about

590
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,720
the final hidden state and expectations

591
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,400
about the final hidden state reach back

592
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,000
and influence expectations about the

593
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,360
initial step

594
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,960
this will be this will become an

595
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,559
important aspect of the deep temporal

596
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,240
models considered later so here's that

597
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,919
figure too

598
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,320
it's the partially observable markov

599
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,039
decision process that we know and love

600
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,520
with a layer of the message passing

601
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,640
added

602
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,400
because um

603
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,840
par and devry are authors and this is

604
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,919
like a very

605
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,919
i mean 2017 wasn't so long ago but this

606
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,080
was an important work

607
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,480
that combined a lot of different areas

608
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,600
together

609
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,480
and here's that reach around

610
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,840
through time

611
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,880
in an interesting way

612
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,760
dean

613
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,919
yeah this is where bringing your history

614
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,760
and my history into this interaction

615
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,240
creates a new history

616
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,400
and i know that's symbolically

617
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,919
i'm not made that's a gross over

618
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,640
simplification but if you were trying to

619
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,000
share this with

620
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,600
somebody with not as much background

621
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,520
maybe that would be a simple

622
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,440
simple tell i don't know

623
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,400
cool

624
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,840
and just like we talked about future

625
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,880
studies

626
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,240
let's think about the historical

627
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,440
sciences

628
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,440
so here we have the past present future

629
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,080
and historical sciences can refer to

630
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,000
history proper

631
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,400
the auxiliary sciences of history or any

632
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,320
science that draws from records of past

633
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,520
events

634
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,200
aren't experiments also past events

635
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,840
now the auxiliary sciences is include

636
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,679
but are not limited to

637
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,159
and there's so many fun fields here

638
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,520
things that are like kind of like

639
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,880
subfields of history like heraldry

640
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,600
um

641
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,280
paleography

642
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,000
so there's some great you know

643
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
vexillology

644
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,559
a lot of awesome terms in here

645
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,679
and then

646
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,039
i was thinking well

647
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,000
you know

648
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,159
you can't prove something in the future

649
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,400
and it hasn't happened yet

650
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
and then historically you also can't

651
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,000
prove it

652
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,200
because it couldn't have been otherwise

653
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,440
hence

654
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,120
you have to only say what must have been

655
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,640
the case instead of what will be the

656
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,799
case like you can't generalize you can't

657
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,880
say well the galapagos are biodiverse

658
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,400
because

659
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,120
and then just give one singular answer

660
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,480
even putting 10 virgin aside and

661
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,159
everything then

662
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,600
so what's left

663
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,919
the past the present and the future and

664
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,080
then the now is just this like kind of

665
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,799
moving indicator that we're experiencing

666
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,080
and so it doesn't really make sense to

667
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,039
prove something only in the now either

668
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,360
so that's just very interesting how

669
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,320
there's that

670
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,360
as clelland calls it the pervasive time

671
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,840
asymmetry of nature and you know put

672
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,679
your hand down if you disagree

673
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:54,880
but

674
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,960
what does that leave for us to actually

675
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,640
work with in terms of scientific

676
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,080
modeling

677
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,400
and from that tension is actually where

678
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,159
fep and active are going to be doing

679
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,120
some interesting things

680
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,600
yeah this was if you're this is what i

681
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,279
love your the

682
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,919
the images that you put up here because

683
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,600
one of the things from from a learning

684
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,520
standpoint that i found really

685
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,640
helpful

686
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,400
is instead of a test being what answers

687
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,440
can you

688
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,279
can you pull from your memory bank it

689
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,520
was a learning exhibition where the

690
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,279
chronology

691
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,080
was kind of the slow hand you'd lived

692
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,799
out

693
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,640
x number of months of

694
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,320
working in a professional setting and

695
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,120
now

696
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,120
in front of a significant audience you

697
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,480
were laying out a chronological timeline

698
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,400
where the focus was on

699
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,320
this the feelings now now top down

700
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,440
organized and narrated but that whole

701
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,600
that entire picture of feelings of

702
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,760
working in a professional setting for

703
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,840
months

704
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,520
actually now came out in terms of a

705
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,120
narrative so

706
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,200
the historical sciences piece here is

707
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,840
actually an amazing consolidator as well

708
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,760
and that's why that's what i found about

709
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,320
this paper it was actually an incredible

710
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,720
consolidator

711
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,760
agreed

712
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,360
so necessity and sufficiency

713
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,840
there are different words they mean

714
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,240
different things and sometimes it's easy

715
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,039
to

716
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,440
get it right in a simple case but then

717
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,000
when science gonna science it gets like

718
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,440
really mixed up

719
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,320
so

720
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,679
necessity

721
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,559
means that you need it like the car

722
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,080
needs wheels to roll normally if you

723
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,480
take it away it's a loss of function

724
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,279
the wheels are a necessity for the car

725
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,919
but are wheels a sufficiency for the car

726
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,640
well no because just four wheels doesn't

727
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,440
equal a car or you could have all the

728
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,200
car but if there's no gas like there's

729
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,840
something else that's also necessary

730
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,640
so

731
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,080
they're very

732
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,400
similar terms they both describe the

733
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,520
conditions

734
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,840
that are sufficient

735
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,159
and or necessary for something being the

736
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,440
case

737
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,360
and that's been described discussed in

738
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,600
the math threama

739
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,240
in this figure in the mathematical case

740
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,000
of course necessity insufficiency is a

741
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,520
key topic

742
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,480
in the

743
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,039
gene regulatory network case

744
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,520
that i've studied where they talk about

745
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,440
genes being necessary or sufficient for

746
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,760
a given phenotype and then also in a

747
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,720
legal

748
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,320
case from this yale law journal

749
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
talking about the most restrictive to

750
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
the least restrictive like if somebody

751
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,159
had no causal role

752
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,760
in a crime that inarguably occurred

753
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,039
they're blameless

754
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,679
if somebody was necessary and sufficient

755
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,039
for something to be

756
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,000
caused

757
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,520
it makes sense that they would be guilty

758
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,120
of that being occurred

759
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,200
but then there's complex systems in

760
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,960
between and there's the difference that

761
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,960
makes a difference and there's so many

762
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,400
ways to talk about necessity and

763
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,679
sufficiency

764
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,520
so there's sort of a simple bookmark on

765
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,520
both necessity and sufficiency and

766
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,559
neither

767
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,960
and then there's a complex space in

768
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,279
between

769
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,360
all i would say is no matter how often

770
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,159
you talk about causation it's amazing

771
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,120
how much stuff just gets roman candle

772
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,640
information wise

773
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,559
out of that simple word that's all i

774
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,440
need to say about that

775
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,399
the last

776
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,840
key word proper is free energy principle

777
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,600
and check out

778
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,880
active stream number 14 number 32 number

779
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,200
26 i mean

780
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,559
roll the die

781
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,399
we talk about it a lot but it's always

782
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,960
important to go over it because

783
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,880
it may be someone's first time hearing

784
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,679
it and the simple aspects of it are the

785
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,440
parts that we want to return to again

786
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,039
and again kind of like a strange

787
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,120
attractor in our model

788
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,960
kind of like the fep

789
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,399
we've talked about some of the technical

790
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,000
part on the bottom so check out

791
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,279
especially 32 and 26 for the bottom

792
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,480
parts

793
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,960
and then the free energy principle is

794
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,960
this imperative

795
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,520
to be self-evidencing and

796
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,080
anti-dissipative if i could only choose

797
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,320
two words potentially those would be it

798
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,640
and they're both going to come up today

799
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,520
because anti-dissipative will be equated

800
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,720
to persistent duration of survival

801
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,799
and then evidencing is going to be

802
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,080
related to

803
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,679
bayesian approaches to modeling evidence

804
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,120
and then where do you go from there

805
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,279
there's so many places to go active

806
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,640
inference the corollary process theory

807
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,320
and um

808
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,159
we're going to talk and unpack fep in a

809
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,159
few different domains so good to move to

810
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,360
the next

811
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,840
slide all right so

812
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,480
how does fep free energy principle

813
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,880
relate to life in this paper

814
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,919
so

815
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,799
the paper says

816
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,799
minimizing free energy is the process

817
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,200
whereby one maintains one's structural

818
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,440
integrity in phase of environmental

819
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,679
perturbations by revisiting one's most

820
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,679
probable organization of physiologic

821
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,960
states

822
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,720
it is in that sense that minimizing free

823
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,159
energy is considered a condition for

824
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,200
life

825
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,679
one can equate survival with life since

826
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,640
one supposes the other under the fep

827
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,039
and then kind of two slogans

828
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,679
cool sentence structure if i survived it

829
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,520
means that i maintained my structural

830
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,279
integrity in face of environmental

831
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,039
perturbations

832
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,720
in a dissipative universe according to

833
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,080
the era of time

834
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,720
and maintaining my structural integrity

835
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,440
is what qualifies me as living

836
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,520
from the point of view of the fep when

837
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,640
considering metamorphic organisms it may

838
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,799
be said that this the life cycle that

839
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,640
corresponds to the thing

840
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,279
whose integrity is maintained over time

841
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,679
eg over evolutionary time

842
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,679
not the specific form

843
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,600
that the system takes at one stage of

844
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,880
its development

845
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,960
e.g the adult form of a frog or ant

846
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,679
this casts the fep within the realm of

847
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,080
process ontology versus substance

848
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,240
ontology and i just have to say that

849
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,480
bucky fuller talks about structural

850
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,679
integrity as being like the house

851
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,919
that stays up through time

852
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:16,799
but

853
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,080
pattern integrity is in his ontology

854
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,799
a system that recapitulates itself and

855
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,399
so it retains dynamical integrity

856
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,559
and um then

857
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,960
that's connected to the idea of process

858
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,279
ontology versus substance ontology which

859
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,279
we'll discuss more on the next slide but

860
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,039
it's just awesome like

861
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,480
this is an ants an ant has a life cycle

862
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,159
but then you can almost pull back and

863
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,880
say well really the integrity of this

864
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,520
egg becoming an adult is related to the

865
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,559
nurses feeding that egg so even if that

866
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,880
egg to adult transition reminds us of a

867
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,799
solitary organism

868
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,840
the integrity that's being regenerated

869
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,159
generation after generation

870
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,840
is like the colony

871
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,200
and so

872
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,840
what are we talking about the

873
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,679
persistence of

874
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,360
when you never step into the same river

875
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,720
twice

876
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,880
like in one sense there is no integrity

877
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,320
being maintained because things are

878
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,799
always changing and so

879
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,200
the fep framing life in that way is very

880
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,200
interesting what do you think

881
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,159
yeah

882
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,440
this is where it's

883
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,039
i would often say to people i want you

884
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,559
to go into this situation i know it's

885
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,399
new for you but i want you to go into

886
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,880
this situation with both eyes open

887
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,399
and with one of the eyes i want you to

888
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,039
see the project at hand potentially and

889
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,480
with the other i want you to be able to

890
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,640
see the system at hand potentially

891
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,559
that's very confusing because

892
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,880
i mean the the best that we most of us

893
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,720
can do is just deal with the complexity

894
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,960
of the project or the complexity of the

895
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,840
system not the complexity of both

896
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,840
co currently but

897
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,799
get

898
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,679
having said that

899
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,159
the better you can

900
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,720
work at knowing both

901
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,880
are present regardless of what you

902
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,120
decide is your focal point in that

903
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,799
particular moment

904
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,360
the better you'll have a an opportunity

905
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,080
to sort of get the whole picture

906
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,200
going on here it's hard it in fact it

907
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,240
takes

908
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,000
it takes some moving away from the way

909
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,159
that most people are trained to try to

910
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,200
look at things so

911
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,240
it's really hard to be honest

912
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,039
let's dig into process versus substance

913
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,399
ontology

914
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,519
perfect so the 2020 dupree paper is

915
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,720
cited

916
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,760
life as process and also just a cool

917
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,440
kind of coincidence that it's a

918
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,880
bilingual

919
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,519
abstract if not paper with english and

920
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,640
russian

921
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,760
and

922
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,679
check out the paper and all the

923
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,840
citations if you want to read more but

924
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,360
just to read the highlighted parts that

925
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,600
kind of get the essence of the abstract

926
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,679
the metaphysics that has dominated

927
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,760
western philosophy and that currently

928
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,440
shapes most understanding of life and

929
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,519
the life sciences sees the world as

930
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,159
composed of things and their properties

931
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,000
while these things appear to undergo all

932
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,640
kinds of changes like metabolism

933
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,279
development context changes

934
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,120
it has often been supposed that this

935
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,880
amounts to no more than a change in the

936
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,880
spatial relations of their unchanging

937
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,840
parts

938
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,919
from antiquity however there has been a

939
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,720
rival to this view the process ontology

940
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,799
associated in antiquity with the

941
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,799
fragmentary surviving writings of

942
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,559
heraclitus

943
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,799
for process ontology what most

944
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,559
fundamentally exists is change or

945
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,159
process

946
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,600
what we are tempted to think of as

947
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,760
constant things are in reality merely

948
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,000
temporary stabilities in this constant

949
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,240
flux of change eddie's in the flux of

950
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,279
process

951
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,440
my main claim in this paper will be that

952
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,440
a metaphysics of the latter kind is the

953
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,519
only kind adequate to making sense of

954
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:50,880
the living world

955
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,679
and also related research is this

956
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,480
causally powerful processes from earlier

957
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,360
in 2021 by dupreeh in synthese

958
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,679
so this is a fascinating line of

959
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,039
research

960
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,320
about

961
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,840
moving from a substance to a

962
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,919
process-based view

963
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,000
and where causation comes into play with

964
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,119
that

965
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,119
with respect to the historical sciences

966
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,960
there's so many other ways to take this

967
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,520
another quote that one of my philosophy

968
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,359
professors would always say and i think

969
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,918
it was a quote from kant was there will

970
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,119
never be a newton for a blade of grass

971
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,879
because there isn't a mechanistic

972
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,159
explanation

973
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,560
that's timeless for a blade of grass in

974
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,239
the way that there plausibly could be

975
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,359
for like newton's cradle

976
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,560
so i wanted to ask you did you find this

977
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,359
have you known about this before reading

978
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,799
this paper or did the paper

979
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:50,879
um cause you to go and look and find

980
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,679
papers on process ontology because

981
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,440
two of our colleagues

982
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,040
talk about flux blue and and stephen

983
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,119
a lot and so when you brought this

984
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,200
forward i thought okay so has daniel

985
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,960
been hiding this from me all along

986
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,480
because he's kind of known about this

987
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,599
network or did the paper

988
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,280
in effect

989
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,960
create a situation where you wanted to

990
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,079
know more about process ontology

991
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,960
i followed the stigmergy

992
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,720
right

993
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,480
in the paper it says it's unclear

994
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,400
whether um it might be argued life and

995
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,160
survival refer to an enduring process

996
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,400
that advocates of process oncology would

997
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,839
call organism

998
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,560
in the sense of depre 2020

999
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,640
went down to the citations there was

1000
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,240
yeah i knew this philosopher i knew this

1001
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,280
philosopher but i hadn't read this paper

1002
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,680
yeah so exactly process entology now

1003
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,040
generating new process ontologies

1004
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,000
variation upon variation right and still

1005
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,920
in the fep

1006
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,680
still at that fep narrow time frame

1007
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,560
it's it's that's goes back to as i said

1008
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,359
i'm not sure if it's um just subjective

1009
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,800
or subjective and objective

1010
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
so anyway i'm glad you found this

1011
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,119
because now i got to read dupree

1012
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,640
because yeah

1013
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,960
anyway oh substance where are they sting

1014
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,359
so

1015
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,920
how does the fpp relate to active

1016
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,240
inference

1017
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,359
we're kind of

1018
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,839
getting ahead in the paper in one sense

1019
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:28,079
so we'll be coming back around to it but

1020
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,200
the fep on its own is a principle

1021
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,040
namely a foundation for reasoning about

1022
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,960
things eg living things

1023
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,880
in this paper we approach the fep as

1024
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,599
such however the fep can also be read

1025
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,920
more broadly as a research program that

1026
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,640
uses fep reasoning patterns to generate

1027
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,800
scientific hypotheses

1028
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,599
this involves implementing

1029
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,520
fep reasoning into a theory called

1030
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,520
active inference which is routinely used

1031
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,040
to study various cognitive functions

1032
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,520
when you go to the footnote

1033
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,880
there's only one

1034
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,720
it's important to note that fep includes

1035
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,400
processes other than free energy

1036
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,599
minimization

1037
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,599
it also includes expected free energy

1038
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,680
minimization and generalized free energy

1039
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,359
minimization

1040
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,680
while minimizing free energy endows the

1041
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,560
organism with post-dictive inference

1042
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,560
which we're gonna go into in the example

1043
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,079
and talk about more

1044
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,800
minimizing expected free energy endows

1045
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,400
the organism with predictive inference

1046
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,520
so

1047
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,920
fap is postdictive

1048
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,119
it looks

1049
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,119
at the oncoming stream of data

1050
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,079
and it compares that to basically what

1051
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,160
must have been the case

1052
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,440
but active or any other predictive

1053
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,800
theory that's about expectations

1054
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,880
it kind of has to be different because

1055
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,480
the consequences of action are in the

1056
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,680
future

1057
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,160
so it has to be these two different

1058
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,440
modes

1059
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,800
and then

1060
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,960
we're gonna come back to these ideas but

1061
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,839
fep reasoning yields historical

1062
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,240
hypotheses and not just like epic or

1063
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,560
legendary but they're about the past

1064
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,079
because it operates a historical

1065
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,839
evidentiary pattern

1066
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,680
and provides a compelling unifying

1067
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,119
causal story

1068
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,200
it operates a curious evidentiary

1069
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,400
pattern though

1070
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,680
because it assumes that both the

1071
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,440
investigator and the thing under

1072
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,280
investigation conform to that

1073
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,960
evidentiary pattern

1074
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,040
that pattern is free energy minimization

1075
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,400
per se

1076
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,680
right

1077
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,839
so if you're making fewer prediction

1078
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,359
errors

1079
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,760
you are your your

1080
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,520
time frame

1081
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,020
carries on but you actually do become

1082
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,599
[Music]

1083
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,280
i don't know if you want the label but

1084
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,200
you do become

1085
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,040
somebody more versed and post-dictive

1086
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,079
um

1087
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,599
what do we want to call them

1088
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,040
post-dictive

1089
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,200
um confirmations i don't even know what

1090
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,160
to

1091
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,760
how to describe it

1092
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,160
but this was a huge thing for me

1093
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,680
post-dictator

1094
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,359
yeah

1095
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,839
i guess

1096
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,920
yeah we talk a lot about prediction

1097
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,000
markets but where's the post-diction

1098
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,040
market

1099
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,480
and what if

1100
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,920
organisms

1101
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,200
are so good at post-diction it looks

1102
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,280
predictive

1103
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,280
so let's see yeah it's going to be you

1104
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,040
know they've got disclaimers whenever

1105
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,079
you read

1106
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,839
the forward-looking statements right

1107
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,440
like this it

1108
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,599
postdictive is now a new

1109
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,040
term that i can

1110
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,760
i can pull into those conversations

1111
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,440
around the disclaimer it's like if

1112
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,760
something's not predictive

1113
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,400
it's either about right now

1114
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,000
or it's post-active

1115
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,960
right

1116
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,599
let's get to the core

1117
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,400
terminology that axel is bringing up

1118
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,280
here and like this is what reading the

1119
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,079
paper means is to understand like why

1120
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,960
this entailment problem is framed

1121
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,920
what responses exist to that problem

1122
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,320
implicitly explicitly how it's addressed

1123
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,839
in this paper and what the implications

1124
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,160
are going forward that's like you'll

1125
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,000
have read the paper to have known those

1126
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,119
things

1127
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,480
right

1128
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,440
this was an earlier quote that sometimes

1129
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,000
arguments in the literature in the fep

1130
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,520
give the impression that in order to be

1131
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,839
alive eg sufficiency

1132
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,560
one must minimize free energy

1133
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,079
such a claim does not straightforwardly

1134
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,000
apply to the fep however and this is

1135
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,440
what the paper will demonstrate

1136
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,760
minimizing free energy does not entail

1137
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,520
life

1138
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,760
candles minimize fe too

1139
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,440
rather the argument is that if you're

1140
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,520
alive it probably means that you have

1141
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,680
done something like minimizing your free

1142
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,640
energy

1143
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,119
which is the bay's optimal thing to do

1144
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,520
when your life depends upon solving

1145
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,000
complex inference problems

1146
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,599
this is a subtle but crucial point to

1147
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,760
getting the story straight i shall call

1148
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,400
this the entailment problem that is the

1149
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,119
confusion in the entailment relation

1150
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,800
between first between free energy

1151
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,640
minimization and life

1152
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,720
here the notion of entailment refers to

1153
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,079
the implication

1154
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,040
i.e first order logical property between

1155
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,839
free energy minimization and the fact of

1156
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,640
displaying some life-related processes

1157
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,440
so

1158
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,640
let's think about two different islands

1159
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,480
minimizing free energy

1160
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,440
and life so we could think of it as like

1161
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,760
a venn diagram they could be overlapping

1162
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,440
they could be partially overlapping they

1163
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,599
could be non-overlapping arrows can be

1164
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,720
drawn anywhere as long as you label them

1165
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,240
actual frames there to be two different

1166
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,040
kinds of

1167
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,240
threads like two archetypes of framings

1168
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,920
in the literature

1169
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,560
the first is the strong claim

1170
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,960
the strong claim is that or what's

1171
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,640
called the overly generous claim by

1172
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,800
kirschoff and froze 2017

1173
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,599
is

1174
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,760
minimizing free energy is a sufficient

1175
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
condition for life so we're going to go

1176
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,440
out there with our free energy

1177
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,640
thermometer

1178
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,480
and things that are minimizing free

1179
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,560
energy are alive

1180
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,839
because it's

1181
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,400
sufficient

1182
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:06,920
the other

1183
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,160
[Music]

1184
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,040
claim is the weak claim

1185
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,359
if a system is currently alive it means

1186
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,160
that it minimized its free energy in

1187
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,280
other words minimizing free energy was

1188
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,960
necessary

1189
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,440
but not necessarily sufficient

1190
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,359
for being alive

1191
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,680
such a claim does not assume the fap is

1192
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,440
designed to set the bar for the

1193
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,440
sufficient conditions of life or meant

1194
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,040
to predict what things may or may not be

1195
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,880
alive

1196
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,000
rather it limits the scope of

1197
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,839
application of the principle to beings

1198
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:41,119
that we think are alive now

1199
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,280
what made us think that that's not in

1200
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,720
the theory

1201
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,040
and enables us to know the necessary

1202
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,880
conditions under which those beings can

1203
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,359
be living i.e can actively resist the

1204
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,599
loss of structural integrity

1205
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,599
what took them there

1206
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:56,640
right

1207
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,640
what do you think about that well i just

1208
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,079
think it's interesting that he talks

1209
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,319
later on we'll get to this is that that

1210
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,119
you need the correct or right priors and

1211
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,440
and if you go with a strong argument you

1212
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,599
assume that the right priors

1213
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:10,880
going forward

1214
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,720
will continue to just

1215
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,640
materialize versus the weak argument

1216
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,640
which says it's not until afterwards

1217
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,560
whether we know whether or not the right

1218
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,240
priors were the ones picked

1219
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,720
yeah

1220
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,040
there's so many fun examples so let's

1221
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,880
talk about bayesian organisms

1222
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,760
bayesian approaches to animal behavior

1223
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,280
whether it's bayesian approaches to

1224
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,599
foraging or the bayesian brain

1225
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,920
proposed that one can model

1226
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,280
red light

1227
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,720
one can model

1228
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,119
not that organisms are

1229
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,240
right one can model so just to forestall

1230
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,240
any kind of map territory distinction

1231
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,839
which we always return to but can't be

1232
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,200
returned to enough

1233
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,560
one can model

1234
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,520
organisms as representing their relation

1235
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,359
to environmental states using priors and

1236
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:02,800
a likelihood

1237
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,640
let's call those representations

1238
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,480
bayesian beliefs

1239
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,160
not in the organism it's our

1240
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,640
representation of that in the model

1241
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,960
on the basis of those beliefs organisms

1242
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,680
generate adaptive behavior

1243
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,119
bayes beliefs can represent the

1244
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,160
probability of environmental states

1245
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,240
prior to observing a signal that's

1246
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,960
called a prior means before

1247
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,760
and

1248
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,599
the relation between environmental

1249
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,280
states and the observed environmental

1250
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,000
signals aka a likelihood

1251
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,839
bayes theorem from which terms such as

1252
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,079
the prior and likelihood come from is

1253
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,000
typically expressed as an evidentiary

1254
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,440
relationship between some prior

1255
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,040
hypotheses p of h and the observation or

1256
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,800
hand or data that's e so e is going to

1257
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,359
be like evidence or empirical h is for

1258
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,040
like hypothesis

1259
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,560
and the way that this

1260
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,960
sentence is read this expression

1261
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,280
this is bayes theorem

1262
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,160
and it's read as the probability of the

1263
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,480
hypothesis given the evidence

1264
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,200
vertical bar means given or conditioned

1265
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,760
on so the probability of the hypothesis

1266
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,599
given the evidence

1267
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,760
equals there's the equal sign

1268
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,720
both sides are the same

1269
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,119
the probability of the evidence given

1270
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,440
the hypothesis

1271
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,440
multiplied by the probability of the

1272
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,920
hypothesis that's in the brackets

1273
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,359
divided by

1274
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,560
the probability of the evidence

1275
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,440
that's

1276
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,800
bayes theorem

1277
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,760
people use bayes theorem to model

1278
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,680
all kinds of things about different

1279
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,920
systems

1280
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,000
the free energy principle is a bayesian

1281
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,319
formulation of the manner in which

1282
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,000
organisms infer the posterior

1283
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,480
probability of their prior beliefs after

1284
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,720
having a verve observed an environmental

1285
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,640
signal with a given likelihood

1286
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,200
and in doing so infer some hidden or

1287
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,960
unobserved variables

1288
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,480
same equation as the last slide

1289
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,040
what stands for the h are unobserved

1290
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,160
variables

1291
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,000
whose prior probability forms the

1292
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,800
hypothesis and what stands for e are the

1293
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,960
sensory signals organisms receive the

1294
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,520
data so this is like i think it's

1295
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,119
equally likely that it's day or night

1296
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,240
like it's 12 and 12. so 50 50 on whether

1297
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,760
the latent cause of the world the

1298
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,880
hypothesis is daytime or night time but

1299
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,599
you can't observe daytime or night time

1300
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,040
all you get are photons on the retina

1301
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,400
so then

1302
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,599
it's like

1303
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,000
you have a prior that's like 50 50 and

1304
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,480
then evidence comes in photons

1305
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,400
and then if there's a lot of photons you

1306
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,359
update your prior to get the posterior

1307
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,119
and then you think okay it's daytime

1308
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,839
because i'm getting a lot of photons

1309
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,359
hence it is often said that under the

1310
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,119
free energy principle organisms are

1311
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,000
viewed as embodying hypothesis belief or

1312
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
best guess about the cause of their

1313
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,560
sensations or sensory signals that they

1314
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,240
receive

1315
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,400
that's because the evidence

1316
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,400
for an organism are its onboard sensors

1317
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,079
and so the hypotheses are about causes

1318
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,880
of what is giving rise to

1319
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,960
sensation just like in the daylight

1320
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,640
example it was a hypothesis about what

1321
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,319
was giving rise to the photons

1322
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:17,839
because beliefs are embodied by the

1323
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:19,920
organism

1324
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,920
embedded enacted etc

1325
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,319
and thus the organism's own states the

1326
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:25,760
uncertainty and the likelihood in the

1327
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,359
prior can be viewed as representing

1328
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,520
uncertainty inherent to the biological

1329
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,599
apparatus

1330
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,319
instead of uncertainty in the world

1331
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,079
as would be the case under typical

1332
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,400
bayesian models

1333
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,640
under the fep uncertainty should be thus

1334
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,119
read as reporting a bayesian credence or

1335
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:44,720
credibility score

1336
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,440
over the organism's own beliefs

1337
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,760
as it reports the probability of a state

1338
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,280
or hypothesis relative to other possible

1339
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,960
hypotheses what do you think dean

1340
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,800
well i'm gonna i'm gonna what do i think

1341
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,880
i'm gonna ask you a question back so

1342
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,280
is is this another way of saying an

1343
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,079
account of uncertainty

1344
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,480
right like so that that that that sounds

1345
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,119
like wait a second how how can we have

1346
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,000
an account of something that we

1347
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,720
don't know but is that what he's

1348
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,559
i know i don't want to interrupt the

1349
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,319
math because i really like the the way

1350
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,559
he step by step goes through this

1351
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,960
but i when i read this again when i read

1352
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,960
this the first time i went oh okay well

1353
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,680
this is an account of uncertainty wait a

1354
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,759
second how can that be so

1355
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,319
yes

1356
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:47,279
uncertainty

1357
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,559
is about um

1358
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,880
the hypothesis giving rise to so the way

1359
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,920
so so the when

1360
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,520
it takes place over a duration because

1361
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,440
the updating of priors is happening

1362
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,720
through time

1363
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,480
so it's like as

1364
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,040
my tummy is sending me signals

1365
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,680
the body is as if

1366
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,200
determining whether i'm hungry or not

1367
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,559
and then

1368
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:17,520
that

1369
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,240
um uncertainty

1370
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,200
is the probability

1371
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,200
of a state or hypothesis relative to

1372
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,040
other hypotheses

1373
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,960
yeah so the traditional models are

1374
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,640
methods that we use to try to account

1375
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,240
for what has been learned

1376
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,640
doesn't necessarily take this into

1377
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,200
consideration when in fact

1378
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,200
this is the basis

1379
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,480
for moving forward and for learning

1380
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,680
yes

1381
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,559
i think there'd be some interesting

1382
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:49,119
1.1.2 discussions about uncertainty

1383
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,119
in frequentism

1384
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,040
versus bayesian

1385
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,480
probability

1386
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,400
and about what it means for a

1387
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,800
frequentist

1388
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,079
p-value-driven understanding of

1389
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,520
certainty or not

1390
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,240
i fail to reject hunger at the 0.05

1391
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,520
p-value

1392
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,559
versus

1393
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,640
the bayesian credible interval or the

1394
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,200
base factor of being hungry

1395
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,839
is this or that relative to this

1396
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:16,000
conditioned on the sensory inputs

1397
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,119
literally

1398
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:20,319
hypothesis hungry or not conditioned on

1399
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:21,599
the inputs yes

1400
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:22,800
yeah

1401
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,680
yeah anyway just it was again i don't

1402
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,599
want to take this off an intention let's

1403
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,440
get back to the math because he does a

1404
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,200
brilliant job of clearing this up

1405
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,240
this is such a cool discussion the

1406
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,480
simple answer to the question of whether

1407
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,960
priors are objective or subjective under

1408
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,720
the fep is that

1409
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,400
they're subjective

1410
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,040
where's my gavel it's it's over

1411
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,040
as we said they track the confidence

1412
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,960
over a system's belief

1413
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,319
under the fep

1414
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,160
priors do not conform to irrationality

1415
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,160
beyond the rationality of the inference

1416
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,319
per se but nor are they rationally

1417
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,079
unconstrained

1418
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:00,800
so

1419
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,880
this always makes me think of like sort

1420
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,800
of the new atheist like if you were

1421
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,240
rational you would believe like we

1422
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,280
believe

1423
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,760
and then that kind of absolutist

1424
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,200
rationality

1425
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,079
making way for a multi-perspective

1426
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:16,640
rationality like i guess different

1427
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,400
people with different

1428
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,599
priors and sensory inputs

1429
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:24,160
implement their own local rationality

1430
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,160
and they come to different conclusions

1431
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,440
fancy that

1432
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,040
yeah there's a rationality beyond

1433
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,720
bayesian rationality comes from the way

1434
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,480
variational base is realized by the

1435
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,319
system and we're going to talk about

1436
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:35,760
that later

1437
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,520
it basically

1438
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,000
embeds when

1439
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,319
into that process

1440
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:43,520
because

1441
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,440
the approximation to the posterior in

1442
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,079
the variational bayesian inference q

1443
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,319
is the prior used in the next cycle of

1444
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:52,640
inference

1445
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,480
the rational constraint over priors is

1446
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,240
the fact that the approximate subjective

1447
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,839
posterior cue

1448
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,559
will not only be bayesian but will also

1449
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,559
always be the best guess relative to

1450
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,960
what the true posterior ought to be

1451
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,960
in short under the fep

1452
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,720
even though priors refer to

1453
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,800
psychological states of the system or

1454
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,720
internal states of the system

1455
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,720
updates of the system make those priors

1456
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,480
an approximation of what they should

1457
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,520
have been

1458
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,760
had the prior been updated with exact

1459
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,119
base

1460
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,000
thus

1461
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,319
it might be said that priors under the

1462
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,880
fep cut across the objective

1463
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,200
subjective dichotomy

1464
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,280
they are subjective

1465
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,520
just like the gavel said above

1466
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,079
while satisfying a rational constraint

1467
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:39,040
mandated by the existence of the system

1468
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,280
per se

1469
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,760
yeah this is the precise approximation

1470
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,359
argument that comes up often meaning

1471
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:48,240
you

1472
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,720
it's not a question of do we need both

1473
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,000
we do but how do how do we have both

1474
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,920
available to us well we've got to keep

1475
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,839
both eyes open we've got to look at both

1476
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,839
the system and the project which is

1477
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:02,319
really hard because it's much easier to

1478
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,480
just one or the other and give our

1479
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,880
attention over to that thing

1480
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,240
that's why post-diction is

1481
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,400
a little bit

1482
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,920
easier maybe hindsight isn't 20 20. as

1483
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,720
we'll prove in this paper but it's still

1484
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,240
better than

1485
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:20,530
than

1486
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,839
[Music]

1487
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,400
making that making that bet with with

1488
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,359
absolutely no priors

1489
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:29,280
we talked about substance versus process

1490
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,559
ontology

1491
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,720
right and then we have this subjective

1492
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,119
objective so it's almost like substance

1493
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,440
ontology maps with objective because

1494
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,359
it's like the object it's the substance

1495
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:42,480
yeah the what

1496
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,880
and then process ontology maps to

1497
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,040
subjective because subjective is

1498
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,599
relational and dynamic it entails

1499
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:52,160
something different the win yeah and

1500
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,040
then we can kind of lean more on one

1501
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,480
side or the other

1502
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,920
but really it's like they're nested

1503
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,240
within each other yeah we can't let if

1504
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,400
we let if we drop one or the other or if

1505
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,480
you hear people dropping one or the

1506
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,760
other you kind of have to bring them

1507
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,960
back to

1508
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,640
no they're both here they're both

1509
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,800
present and they're both available

1510
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,640
regardless of what you choose to make

1511
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,559
your focal point that's that's when they

1512
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,400
go well that's like just

1513
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,319
your opinion man

1514
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,240
right exactly

1515
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,720
yep so let's go to the

1516
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,119
crux of the paper which is the numerical

1517
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:26,559
example

1518
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,359
okay

1519
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,160
so um

1520
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,480
there's a there's some other pieces you

1521
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,240
know we're giving a linear ordering and

1522
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,720
kind of jumping through the paper

1523
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,799
we're going to think about a organism

1524
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,960
like a bacterium that's going to infer

1525
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,960
whether a or b occurs externally

1526
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,119
for the organism a and b are part of the

1527
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,799
class r

1528
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:51,119
and the representations by the organism

1529
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,599
are a or b so r

1530
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:57,119
can kind of be read like receptor states

1531
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,440
a and b are inferred when receiving a

1532
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,000
chemical signal part of the class s like

1533
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,119
for signal

1534
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,359
which can be alpha or beta so s is the

1535
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:06,960
signal molecule

1536
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,359
alpha or beta

1537
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:11,280
we have we assume that before observing

1538
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,839
any signal so prior the probability of a

1539
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:16,000
is p and the probability of b is one

1540
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,839
minus p so they're mutually exclusive

1541
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:20,640
and they form a probability together

1542
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,480
then the numbers

1543
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,599
are

1544
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:24,880
given

1545
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,680
for

1546
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,040
a and b

1547
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,200
the prior and then the conditional

1548
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,960
probabilities

1549
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,319
and then

1550
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,160
this is where life and death enters the

1551
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,359
picture

1552
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,280
you got to guess correctly

1553
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,960
if it's um

1554
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,920
a if alpha is out there and you guess a

1555
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,040
you live

1556
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,880
if alpha's out there and you guess wrong

1557
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,040
you die so you want to be like on the

1558
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,119
diagonals you want a and alpha to go

1559
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:50,960
together and b and beta but you don't

1560
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,319
want the off diagonals you'll die

1561
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:55,280
okay

1562
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,200
let's look at it graphically in figure

1563
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,319
1.

1564
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:00,160
so the right panel is a visual

1565
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,640
representation of the organism inferring

1566
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,799
its prior beliefs about the cause of the

1567
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:07,040
observations it makes and then it

1568
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,319
restates um several of these pieces

1569
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:12,960
so we have like the um

1570
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,119
prior and then we have the signals a and

1571
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:16,559
b out there

1572
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,280
um here's something really important for

1573
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,920
all you active heads out there

1574
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,319
there's no action involved in our

1575
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,240
example

1576
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,440
we're not talking about active inference

1577
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,359
in more biologically realistic

1578
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:33,599
descriptions of behavior like chance at

1579
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,000
all 2020 which is where this example is

1580
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,559
a simplified version of

1581
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:41,359
we need to discuss active inference

1582
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:43,119
in active inference behavior is the

1583
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:45,680
result of a different inference process

1584
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,559
that of an action policy this involves

1585
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,720
more priors namely about the transition

1586
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,559
between hidden states

1587
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:54,559
and often about preferred sensory

1588
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:57,200
outcomes so that would entail a model

1589
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,359
where it's like okay there's a

1590
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:01,599
probability of transition between alpha

1591
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:03,920
and beta out there

1592
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,760
and then there's gonna be a preference

1593
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,319
for alpha and then i'm doing action

1594
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:11,920
selection on tumble or not

1595
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,000
based upon whether things are going well

1596
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,480
for me or not so that's

1597
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,720
several more pieces to the model

1598
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,319
right but it's a toy toy example

1599
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:24,079
that's going to make the point

1600
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,559
that minimizing free energy

1601
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:28,799
is not sufficient for being alive but it

1602
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:30,240
is necessary

1603
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,400
and so we're just

1604
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,200
distilling to the simplest possible

1605
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,760
sensory processing example

1606
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,000
that doesn't even have action so maybe

1607
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,920
someone could argue that well adding

1608
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,680
action somehow

1609
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,200
makes this example null and void or

1610
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,240
whatever but i don't think that's the

1611
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,440
case

1612
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,079
and so um this does involve more priors

1613
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,599
and action is then distinguished from

1614
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,359
inferring hidden states it's about

1615
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:55,520
inferring another hidden variable which

1616
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,040
is policy

1617
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,839
so the first line is the generative

1618
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:00,720
model

1619
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,880
the joint distribution which is

1620
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,160
multiplying the prior and the likelihood

1621
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,640
the second and the third line these two

1622
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,960
represent the prior and the likelihood

1623
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,200
so here's the prior it's 80 percent a

1624
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,119
priori that it's

1625
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:17,599
um that i perceive a and 20 percent a

1626
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:19,680
priori i perceive b

1627
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,359
and then there's this mapping with a and

1628
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:23,040
alpha and there's like more density

1629
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,440
there and then b and beta more density

1630
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,960
there and the off diagonals are like

1631
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,559
less

1632
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:31,040
the fourth line is a possible bayesian

1633
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,440
algorithm that could be used

1634
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,280
and then the fifth line is a variational

1635
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,280
free energy minimization which we'll

1636
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,359
talk more about but that's kind of this

1637
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:41,760
example is we're just thinking about the

1638
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,359
sensory processing of a bacteria or cell

1639
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:49,359
that is needing to correctly guess

1640
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,680
the cause

1641
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,040
outside

1642
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,599
when it's only getting a receptor

1643
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,760
on its membrane for example

1644
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:58,799
what do you think

1645
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:00,880
daniel do you think people will will

1646
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:01,760
know

1647
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,040
what the difference is between the

1648
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,880
process that you

1649
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,599
and i and steven

1650
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:10,079
walk through in 33 2 and what we're

1651
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,240
looking at right here will they will

1652
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,280
they know just how different

1653
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,559
those two

1654
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,920
representations are what do you think

1655
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,799
it's a good question we can

1656
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:25,520
re-state that this is not an active

1657
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,160
inference model right it's also not even

1658
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,839
trying to be the most awesome bayesian

1659
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:33,280
bacteria model ever right this is like

1660
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,000
just using bayes theorem

1661
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,079
right to show that

1662
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:39,040
simply

1663
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,880
minimizing free energy

1664
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,960
is not gonna cut it for being alive

1665
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,839
under this contrived setting but um when

1666
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:50,160
we were in 32 or yeah 33.2

1667
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,599
yeah and we walked through the the

1668
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,440
matrices where there was a preference

1669
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,200
and there was the hidden states it was

1670
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,640
quite different

1671
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,880
yeah so check it out do you see do you

1672
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,400
see co-variation

1673
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,480
happening at all

1674
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,960
in this

1675
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,680
co-variation um

1676
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,559
one example of co-variation is like you

1677
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,720
need to believe that you have accurate

1678
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,760
sensors

1679
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,240
if you there needs to be a covariation

1680
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,400
between a and alpha

1681
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,920
okay

1682
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,000
if you don't have them and you don't

1683
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,520
assume that you have them are you not

1684
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,240
dead eventually or pretty quickly

1685
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,359
that's sort of the um gentle

1686
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,799
invisible hand of selections sweeping

1687
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:35,359
those kinds of systems off the table

1688
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:37,440
yeah yeah okay and i'm just asking

1689
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,839
because when i saw this i the first

1690
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:42,640
thing i said to myself is my goodness

1691
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,640
this if there was a continuum between 33

1692
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,520
2

1693
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,839
and figure 1 of 33 or 34 0 man this

1694
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,839
would these two things are really really

1695
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:56,319
far apart

1696
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,839
they are

1697
01:00:57,839 --> 01:00:59,440
um well you know

1698
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,280
let's

1699
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,799
let's go to 33.2

1700
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,559
so in 33 2

1701
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,000
this is like looking um here's what we

1702
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,359
had done

1703
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:15,520
just like last week or whatever earlier

1704
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,559
this week

1705
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:18,319
yeah um

1706
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:19,839
here

1707
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:22,559
the observations

1708
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,960
are getting mapped to this prediction

1709
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,680
about internal about hidden states

1710
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,400
so that's actually this a matrix

1711
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,359
um

1712
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:32,799
is also

1713
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,559
the mapping matrix

1714
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:36,480
maybe it could have been a little bit

1715
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,760
clearer because also a is like the

1716
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,480
hidden state that's being inferred but

1717
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,760
um this bacterium

1718
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,079
is just reflecting

1719
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,559
this part right here

1720
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:50,480
so the prior comes in

1721
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,319
it's like just this sort of right angled

1722
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:54,240
neighborhood where you have the prior

1723
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,079
beliefs and then we're going to have

1724
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,920
observations coming in

1725
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,440
and then a mapping to the hidden states

1726
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,440
what active inference brings in is this

1727
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,880
whole tree

1728
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,720
where we're going to

1729
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,520
influence through policy selection how

1730
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,359
hidden states change through time and

1731
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:13,119
that entails the preferences free energy

1732
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:16,480
minimization and the affordances

1733
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,680
so this is like just a sub component of

1734
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:20,960
active

1735
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,480
right all right

1736
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,760
so

1737
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,799
we're going to assume that the

1738
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:26,960
computation is conformant to bayes

1739
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,400
theorem

1740
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,280
and that the posterior probability after

1741
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,599
observing the signal is going to

1742
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,079
basically update the prior

1743
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:37,920
towards what is most likely given what

1744
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,359
was observed

1745
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,440
we're going to infer the posterior

1746
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,240
probability of a

1747
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,079
after observing alpha

1748
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:49,920
so the prior on a was 0.8

1749
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,440
and then the

1750
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,559
the probability of alpha observing alpha

1751
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:58,000
contingent on a was 0.7

1752
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,079
so if it's a

1753
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:03,920
in reality then 70 percent of the time

1754
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,799
you you hear about alpha that's what is

1755
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:09,119
actually on the receptor

1756
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,680
and then the b is just one minus such

1757
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,280
and so seven point seven point three

1758
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,640
okay

1759
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,880
bayes rule is applied

1760
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,079
and you know you carry through the math

1761
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:21,599
and basically

1762
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:24,880
after you've observed alpha

1763
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,880
your probability of estimating that the

1764
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,799
external state was a

1765
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:30,559
went from point eight

1766
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:33,359
to point nine zero

1767
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:34,400
three two

1768
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,200
so it didn't take you to a hundred

1769
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,039
but it bumped you up

1770
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:40,160
and then

1771
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,960
that is bayes updating

1772
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,760
so that's a bayesian bacterium

1773
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,000
updating its

1774
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,240
belief about a hidden state of the world

1775
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,359
based upon a molecule that actually only

1776
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:56,160
has a 70 30 accuracy

1777
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,240
right and that's really important to

1778
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,200
know

1779
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,280
like it sounds like 70 30 it sounds like

1780
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,960
that should almost like degrade your

1781
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,880
accuracy

1782
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:08,160
but it actually even if it were 51.49 it

1783
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,720
would still upgrade your accuracy a tiny

1784
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,760
tiny tiny bit now if it were

1785
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,400
1 0 0 1

1786
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,280
well then yeah observing it if it's

1787
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,760
perfectly associated is going to update

1788
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,000
your belief a lot

1789
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,680
but even something that's relatively

1790
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,680
noisy like 70 30

1791
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:28,799
can still

1792
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:32,000
make you go from 80 to 90 percent sure

1793
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,160
this is just basically taking whether or

1794
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,559
not you've got a decontextualized

1795
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:38,000
instead of information versus a

1796
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,680
contextualized one

1797
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,160
and what the benefits of adding the

1798
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,920
contextualization does i think

1799
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,079
again maybe i'm over oversimplifying but

1800
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:48,559
i think that

1801
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,920
okay so with exact bayesian inference

1802
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,440
um

1803
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,680
this could be computed but potentially

1804
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,920
that's not tractable in biological

1805
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,000
systems especially if you start to think

1806
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,920
about how there could be like

1807
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,680
500 metabolites

1808
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,079
um and that's called the black box

1809
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:08,400
problem or the solipsism or seclusion

1810
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,960
problem variously in the fep literature

1811
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,599
so how does the fep get around that

1812
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:16,000
in order to bypass the problem the fep

1813
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,160
models that inference as a proximate

1814
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,359
base

1815
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,839
approximate bayes bypasses the direct

1816
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:24,400
evaluation of the likelihood

1817
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,520
and

1818
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,000
that makes it a lot more tractable

1819
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,559
the central claim of the fep

1820
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,720
interesting to read is that changes

1821
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,880
leading to behavioral and

1822
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,839
neurophysiological responses in living

1823
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:38,160
systems conform to a form

1824
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,000
of approximate bayesian inference known

1825
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,680
as variational base

1826
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,400
so check out active number 26 to learn

1827
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,799
more about variational bays which

1828
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:48,799
basically relates to we're going to

1829
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,760
control the family of equations and then

1830
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,680
we're going to do model fitting on a

1831
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,280
family of equations

1832
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,920
and that'll be easy like we're going to

1833
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,200
constrain our equation to y equals mx

1834
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,920
plus b linear model well then we can fit

1835
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,319
it with a least squares error it's going

1836
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:09,680
to be a convex optimization we can do it

1837
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,599
these are different types of problems

1838
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:13,440
but similarly we're going to have a

1839
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,000
certain family of equations that we

1840
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,400
parameterize and that's variational base

1841
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,359
what citations did you add

1842
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:23,200
all i put in here was some stuff that

1843
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,680
i've been looking at like over a decade

1844
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,039
ago now

1845
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:29,039
and some conversations that i've had

1846
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:32,240
with people like morris moskovitch

1847
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,280
and reyna

1848
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,400
around the idea that

1849
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:39,119
neurobiologically is there some sort of

1850
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:41,119
an analog between

1851
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:42,640
walking

1852
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,880
an elephant walking across the savanna

1853
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,880
once and not really seeing the desire

1854
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:47,680
line

1855
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:48,720
versus

1856
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,960
if a trace is going if traces are going

1857
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,960
through multiple times

1858
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,200
how does that affect potential gene

1859
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,039
folding in the neurons and stuff like

1860
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:58,240
that and so

1861
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,920
it doesn't really it doesn't really i

1862
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,799
don't

1863
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:02,799
i don't think it builds on the idea

1864
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:04,319
of what you're talking about in terms of

1865
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,079
how we can

1866
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:07,680
how we might want to be able to set up

1867
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,720
software recognition software but i but

1868
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,319
over a decade ago

1869
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:14,400
um the idea that

1870
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,520
how something is grooved in eventually

1871
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,359
an approximation becomes something

1872
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:21,440
clearer and the energy that you have to

1873
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,640
put into that

1874
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,200
and that's where you had the one the

1875
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,280
above the top cat

1876
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:30,799
being maybe enter too energy intensive i

1877
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:32,000
just think it's really interesting

1878
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,119
because back

1879
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:36,000
over a decade ago fmris were supposed to

1880
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,440
be the thing that was going to give us a

1881
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,960
clearer picture

1882
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,480
and there were people even back then

1883
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,799
they were saying wait a second

1884
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:45,280
we want to be able to talk about when a

1885
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,079
really blurry picture becomes a more

1886
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:51,359
clear picture as opposed to this is what

1887
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:54,319
a bump in in in energy

1888
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:56,640
tells us they kind of tried we're trying

1889
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:00,559
to kill that idea more than a decade ago

1890
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,799
cool

1891
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:04,240
now

1892
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,400
in that example everything went well for

1893
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,680
the bacteria right it perceived a a

1894
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,400
perceived alpha it updated a

1895
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,319
it's all good

1896
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:16,158
um

1897
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:18,238
so the following numerical example will

1898
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:20,238
demonstrate that minimizing free energy

1899
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:21,839
is not sufficient for life

1900
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:23,600
as it can lead to the exact opposite

1901
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,640
death

1902
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,399
this is really key

1903
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:28,319
fep haters out there

1904
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:29,759
note that the scope of the following

1905
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:31,439
numerical example is deliberately

1906
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:33,439
limited the goal is to demonstrate

1907
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:35,040
minimizing free energy can lead to

1908
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,359
maladaptive inference when performed

1909
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:40,399
with the wrong priors

1910
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:42,719
all things being kept fixed

1911
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,399
if the priors are allowed to update the

1912
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:45,920
inference should lead to adaptive

1913
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,198
behavior

1914
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:49,759
so it's a contrived example this isn't

1915
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:51,759
how you would do fep modeling if you

1916
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:54,000
wanted your system to work

1917
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,479
adaptivity is guaranteed

1918
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:57,759
to the extent which priors match

1919
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,359
environmental constraints

1920
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:01,359
more than by the machinery

1921
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:03,520
employed to perform the inference so

1922
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,238
just saying we used bays

1923
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:08,719
it's like this isn't a sales pitch you

1924
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:11,120
could have the wrong priors we used free

1925
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,600
energy minimization in our software

1926
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,520
okay well

1927
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,359
you're going right off a cliff

1928
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:18,960
so you can think

1929
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,520
have the prior this is fine

1930
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,080
so it's not enough to hide behind the

1931
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:27,198
methodology the priors have to be

1932
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:29,920
stated and they have to be adaptive

1933
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,679
it's not enough just to say well free

1934
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:33,520
energy minimization occurred

1935
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,920
so things worked right

1936
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,120
no it's not just like your one stop shop

1937
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:40,880
it's like a linear model

1938
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:41,920
but a little bit different and more

1939
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,040
complex

1940
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,560
so

1941
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,158
the following example of free energy

1942
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:48,158
minimization is provided with the sole

1943
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:50,080
purpose of supporting our response to

1944
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,479
the entailment problem which is to say

1945
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,480
supporting the weak and refuting the

1946
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,000
strong claim

1947
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,840
the goal is to give a formal intuition

1948
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,000
as to why minimizing free energy is not

1949
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,600
sufficient for life

1950
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,040
understood as the preservation of

1951
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,560
structural integrity

1952
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,000
by no means should the following

1953
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,600
numerical example be viewed as an

1954
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,600
exemplar of the manner in which free

1955
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,880
energy minimization operates

1956
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,600
mathematically okay so this is not an

1957
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,840
fep model

1958
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:16,880
it's just

1959
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,080
not it's an fep like model that we're

1960
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,719
using to make some important claims

1961
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,400
about fep

1962
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:28,080
and so here is the um in equation four

1963
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,480
is the free energy formulation

1964
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,080
this is the variational inference which

1965
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:35,760
we're not gonna go into um right now

1966
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,920
but um

1967
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,480
what we'll note is just the q r

1968
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,480
q of r that r is remember the receptor

1969
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,960
state like alpha beta corresponds to the

1970
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,040
proposal recognition or approximate

1971
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,880
posterior density

1972
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,360
referred to in the fpp literature

1973
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,120
it is q of r

1974
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,040
the recognition density remember we're

1975
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,719
only making a sensory model

1976
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:01,199
that is embodied by the organisms not to

1977
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:03,120
be confused with the p of r and alpha

1978
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,640
which would be the joint distribution or

1979
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,120
generative model so way back in live

1980
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,800
stream number six

1981
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,800
we talked about how there's like the

1982
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,480
recognition model

1983
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,480
which is from the data to the hyper

1984
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,640
parameters that's from the observation

1985
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,159
of alpha or beta to a or b

1986
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:22,000
and that's related to perception the

1987
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,320
world is handing us alpha or beta

1988
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,560
and then we're updating our causal model

1989
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,920
of the world

1990
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,560
but then we're not here discussing

1991
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,480
action

1992
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:33,199
so

1993
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:35,520
it's kind of a limited example it's more

1994
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,080
like a unidirectional example but adding

1995
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,840
in the second direction doesn't get

1996
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,840
around the fact that perceptual free

1997
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,080
energy was minimized and that doesn't

1998
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:47,360
always work so let's look at it not work

1999
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,599
um

2000
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:55,040
so we're going to

2001
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,719
it's like and it works because it

2002
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:58,880
doesn't so let's assume our organism

2003
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,040
operates under variational bays and

2004
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,960
still represented a with the same level

2005
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,400
of confidence

2006
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,640
so here's what happens this is actually

2007
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,360
a good variational base case okay so

2008
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,400
here

2009
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,080
a is observed

2010
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:16,080
and the fe is calculated at 0.47

2011
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,520
and then

2012
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,120
in six

2013
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,840
beta is observed or b it's a question of

2014
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,159
whether b has a higher free energy

2015
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:26,400
contingent on observing a

2016
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,400
right so that gives a free energy of

2017
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,520
2.297

2018
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:33,120
2792 so

2019
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,600
minimizing free energy is better

2020
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,480
so under the variational model we still

2021
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:41,760
would have selected the right outcome

2022
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,159
so this is actually the variational

2023
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,320
equation working we're going to change

2024
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,600
it in a second

2025
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,520
variational equation works

2026
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,970
person's like yeah

2027
01:12:51,970 --> 01:12:55,060
[Music]

2028
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,280
keep going minimizing free energy leads

2029
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,719
to survival only under the right

2030
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:04,800
conditions which is if you have the

2031
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,719
right priors so now we're going to

2032
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:09,440
imagine the same scenario with inverted

2033
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:12,320
maladaptive priors okay so you're dumped

2034
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,520
into the desert but the priors are for

2035
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,640
um

2036
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,960
the ocean or something so here the p of

2037
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,960
b is 0.8

2038
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,080
so now

2039
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,239
after there's an update

2040
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:27,199
the energy free energy of representing b

2041
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:30,239
after sensing a is 0.96

2042
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,159
and the free energy when representing a

2043
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,920
after sensing alpha which is like the

2044
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,400
correct thing to do is higher it's over

2045
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,159
one

2046
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:39,280
okay

2047
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,440
so the minimal free energy would be

2048
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,920
representing b after sensing alpha

2049
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,760
because you had such an overwhelming

2050
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,040
belief

2051
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,239
in

2052
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:49,360
b

2053
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,679
that even observing a

2054
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:53,600
doesn't push you all the way to

2055
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,440
believing a

2056
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,120
i think there's a typo in the paper

2057
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,400
because it says represented state b with

2058
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,000
0.63 percent confidence but it's

2059
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,800
actually 63 percent or

2060
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,640
0.63

2061
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,480
right but the point is

2062
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,920
if you started at 80 believing in b

2063
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,480
then you got alpha

2064
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,960
you dropped from 0.8 to 0.63 so you're

2065
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,800
still 63 you're less

2066
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,199
confident but still you're two-thirds

2067
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:23,120
believing in b

2068
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,719
so in other words

2069
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:27,199
free energy minimization just happened

2070
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,360
and you just picked the wrong thing

2071
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,480
because your priors were wrong

2072
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,880
that bacteria is gonna die

2073
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,679
so that's the hand sweeping those

2074
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:40,080
maladaptive priors off the table that's

2075
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,719
like evolution by natural selection

2076
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:45,120
hence minimizing free energy per se does

2077
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,480
not entail life

2078
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,640
not under the wrong prior

2079
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,199
right not dress like that you don't

2080
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:53,840
but right it's just again making a

2081
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,360
simple

2082
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,880
important point

2083
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,120
minimizing free energy is not sufficient

2084
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,480
for being a life

2085
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:04,799
it is necessary for being alive

2086
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,719
although free energy minimization is not

2087
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:08,239
sufficient for life

2088
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:10,159
the numerical examples suggest there may

2089
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:11,679
be an entailment that goes the other way

2090
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:13,760
around if you're alive it might very

2091
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,199
well be because you did something like

2092
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:18,080
minimize free energy

2093
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,560
so that's the weak relationship

2094
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,960
so we kind of invalidated the strong

2095
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:23,840
claim

2096
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:24,560
of

2097
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,560
sufficiency but we're actually finding

2098
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,280
support for the weak claim of necessity

2099
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,800
this makes the fep an interesting

2100
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,159
epistemic

2101
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:34,080
principle for researchers interested in

2102
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:35,280
development

2103
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,159
of themselves of cities of organisms in

2104
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,159
a reverse engineering fashion if we

2105
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,760
observe a free energy minimizing

2106
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,360
organism still living at the time that

2107
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,560
we observe it

2108
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,440
just like all things that we observe are

2109
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,120
we can trust it has good enough priors

2110
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,640
to remain alive

2111
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,400
like i look at the ants i think

2112
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,600
whatever

2113
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,800
they're doing

2114
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,320
as the world has changed they've been

2115
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:59,440
doing it for 120 million years

2116
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:00,960
that's what we know about that oh well

2117
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,040
how do they know what to do when there's

2118
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,640
a break in the trail well the ones that

2119
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,800
didn't aren't here and the ones that are

2120
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,800
here did it well enough and that's like

2121
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,280
a first pass at an answer

2122
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,840
and then also on a wing and a prior

2123
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,440
on a wing um

2124
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,440
means like sort of like a few different

2125
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,400
things but it reminded me of the winged

2126
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,920
snowflake the 2007 paper and then moth

2127
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,120
to a flame

2128
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,360
and so um if you're observing these

2129
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,640
snowflakes

2130
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,159
the ones you observe

2131
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:31,920
are going to increasingly be the ones

2132
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,360
that have wings

2133
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,840
that can stay solid

2134
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,679
because the ones that don't

2135
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:39,520
don't exist

2136
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,640
so that's fep on a wing and a prior

2137
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,880
yep

2138
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:48,640
one could rightfully say that minimizing

2139
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,920
free energy when equipped with the right

2140
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,800
prior beliefs is sufficient for life

2141
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,560
i.e all you need to be qualified is

2142
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,400
living

2143
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,000
or maintaining your structural integrity

2144
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,600
under the fep

2145
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,840
the point here is the choice of prior

2146
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,440
whether under bayesian or approximate

2147
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,840
bayesian regime is a real concern since

2148
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,679
the entailment relation between life and

2149
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:10,080
fep entirely depends on the adaptivity

2150
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,880
of those priors

2151
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,320
interestingly some have argued the

2152
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,239
adaptivity of priors can also be

2153
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:18,239
guaranteed by a free energy minimization

2154
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:20,000
operating at the population level as a

2155
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,840
form of natural selection

2156
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:26,080
the citation there was to hesp 2019

2157
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,400
a multi-scale proposal

2158
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,719
of the emerging complexity of life

2159
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:33,199
um with hesp ramsay constant bad

2160
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:34,800
kirchhoff and fristen

2161
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,360
and here's a figure from there

2162
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,679
i'll say though that upcoming there will

2163
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:42,080
be a paper with myself

2164
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,679
axel blue

2165
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:46,239
par in fristen that will go into a lot

2166
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:48,000
more detail on this

2167
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,040
so it's absolutely a great point and i

2168
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,880
believe that it's the case

2169
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,440
dean what did you write here

2170
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,679
well i was just wondering um from the

2171
01:17:57,679 --> 01:17:59,040
perspective of

2172
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:02,080
what a prior is

2173
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,840
like is it available

2174
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,760
there and in terms of

2175
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,320
something that we can leverage off of

2176
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,360
and then of what what

2177
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,040
then what do we do

2178
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:16,480
because we have some sort of previous

2179
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,679
marker from which to

2180
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:20,880
to infer

2181
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:23,280
eventually so i was wondering if that's

2182
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,800
if that's the essence of what an

2183
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,840
adaptive adaptive as function as an

2184
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,199
action

2185
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:31,120
um requires but

2186
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,040
but i think i'll wait until

2187
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,120
we bring up that paper with five authors

2188
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,480
because

2189
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,760
well

2190
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,960
yeah exactly we will discuss it um

2191
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,360
it's like

2192
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,719
we'll have fun things to discuss i can

2193
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:48,880
think of more examples but i'll save

2194
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:49,760
them

2195
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:53,440
so in the future direction last section

2196
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:54,880
the dissolution of the entanglement

2197
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:57,199
problem you know again

2198
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:59,199
write a paper if you don't think that

2199
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:01,520
the entitlement problem is adequately

2200
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,679
parsed and dissolved in this paper it's

2201
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,120
a great paper if somebody wanted to

2202
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,000
write it

2203
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,600
puts us in a good position to move to

2204
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,520
another related difficulty in the

2205
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,679
philosophical literature on the fep

2206
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:16,320
which is this time of an exegetic kind

2207
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,239
look at these synonyms

2208
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:20,000
hermeneutical there's an awesome fristen

2209
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,280
paper about the hermeneutics of

2210
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,719
communication

2211
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:23,760
right

2212
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,840
these are just nice adjectives

2213
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,520
if minimizing free energy is not

2214
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,760
sufficient for life or survival

2215
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,760
how should we interpret statements such

2216
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:32,560
as

2217
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,400
the minimization of free energy may be

2218
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:35,600
necessary

2219
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,440
if not sufficient characteristic of

2220
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,000
evolutionary successful system systems

2221
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,120
fristen

2222
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,360
and steph in 2007

2223
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,820
way way way back

2224
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:46,960
[Music]

2225
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,640
postdictive scientific statements are

2226
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,159
concerned with what must have been the

2227
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:54,080
case instead of what will be the case

2228
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,679
like saying that

2229
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:58,239
the hawks gene duplication

2230
01:19:58,239 --> 01:20:01,199
allowed for this body plan to change it

2231
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:03,040
doesn't say about what will happen but

2232
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,880
it is about what was necessary for

2233
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,080
happening

2234
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,679
so a statement such as the minimization

2235
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,520
of free energy may be a necessary if not

2236
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:10,639
sufficient characteristic of

2237
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,800
evolutionary successful systems this

2238
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:13,760
quote

2239
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,520
is probably such a post-dictive

2240
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,400
statement

2241
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,080
the statement should be interpreted as

2242
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,920
claiming that free energy minimization

2243
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,239
must have occurred if a system is

2244
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:26,080
evolutionarily successful

2245
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,560
not the other way around

2246
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,199
we're looking at living creatures and

2247
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:33,280
postdicting

2248
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,040
what got them there

2249
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,000
not

2250
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,360
looking at

2251
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:40,080
the class of all systems hypothetical

2252
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,960
failing etc and then saying what will

2253
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,320
make them alive

2254
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,560
because you can again minimize your free

2255
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,320
energy right off a cliff

2256
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,000
burn yourself out like a candle that'll

2257
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,920
minimize free energy too you could have

2258
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,320
maladaptive priors and also be

2259
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,719
minimizing your free energy

2260
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:58,159
daniel do you think this talks about the

2261
01:20:58,159 --> 01:20:59,600
difference between

2262
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,120
deductively

2263
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,440
realizing when and inductively

2264
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:06,639
realizing when or is that

2265
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:08,960
let's let's let's talk about um

2266
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,040
deduction

2267
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:14,239
induction and abduction

2268
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:16,080
i think that's the win the win piece of

2269
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,800
this again i don't want to push this

2270
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,480
too far into the future because we're

2271
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,480
almost at the end here but i'm just

2272
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,159
maybe that's a point one thing i'm not

2273
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:25,040
sure

2274
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,840
yeah it's a it's a definite point one

2275
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:28,639
so

2276
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:31,040
the final slide

2277
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:31,920
um

2278
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,679
it's also the final lines of the paper

2279
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:37,840
so

2280
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,880
um it's a little bit of a

2281
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,800
personal you know it's interesting to

2282
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,199
read a paper with i it's a first off one

2283
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:46,880
author paper but it's also more of like

2284
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,800
a philosophy and dupri's papers are

2285
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,320
written in this way as well when they're

2286
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,560
single author it's like i argue that

2287
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:53,920
this so that's kind of an interesting

2288
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,400
style that um

2289
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:59,199
stem papers usually don't have

2290
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:00,080
so

2291
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,760
um

2292
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,440
this is axel kind of bringing it all

2293
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:06,080
together as a person who used the free

2294
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,600
energy principle in the numerical

2295
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,360
example above

2296
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:10,800
the puzzling trace for which i was

2297
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,280
seeking a causal explanation for

2298
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:15,280
was the survival of the organism that

2299
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:16,960
was my observation

2300
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,360
the causal story or hypothesis for that

2301
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:21,280
observation under the conditions we

2302
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:22,960
imposed to our simulated organism was

2303
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,960
the free energy principle the inference

2304
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,880
over which led me to write the paper you

2305
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,199
are reading at the moment

2306
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:30,639
and the live stream you're listening to

2307
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:32,159
at this moment

2308
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:33,840
that paper functioned as sensory

2309
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,320
evidence for my hypothesis eg when

2310
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:37,840
writing down the number and seeing they

2311
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,360
were adding up

2312
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,960
and that paper

2313
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,239
live stream

2314
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:44,239
is the observation that you are using to

2315
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:46,159
evidence your hypothesis

2316
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:47,679
concerning the claim i said at the start

2317
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:49,760
of the paper namely that free energy

2318
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,360
minimization

2319
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,280
is not sufficient for life

2320
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:56,159
so if you had wildly out of whack priors

2321
01:22:56,159 --> 01:22:57,679
on that claim

2322
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:00,000
maybe even listening to us talk you

2323
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,080
still believe what you believe

2324
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,520
that's okay

2325
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,400
it's all consistent and good

2326
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,960
fidel to the unifying grip of hypotheses

2327
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,639
in the historical sciences the free

2328
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:12,480
energy principle is meant to account for

2329
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:13,520
all of that

2330
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,000
you me and the organism under study in a

2331
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,679
unifying fashion

2332
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:19,520
so here is

2333
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:20,480
axel

2334
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:23,040
looking at his figure one and then we're

2335
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,040
reading the paper and then like active

2336
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,440
lab and the broader ecosystem

2337
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:29,360
is observing that and there's other

2338
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:31,120
things observing us

2339
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:34,639
so fep all i see

2340
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:35,840
yeah

2341
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,440
yeah again back to the question of

2342
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:38,639
whether

2343
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:41,199
it can be both objective and subjective

2344
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:43,199
at the same time and when whether that

2345
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:44,719
fits within the

2346
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:47,600
rel relatively

2347
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,840
small time frames of what we're looking

2348
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,760
at when we're talking about fep and this

2349
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:55,520
is even a smaller version of fpp than

2350
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,440
maybe others looking in terms of the

2351
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,600
unit of analysis

2352
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,920
anyway i i just think it

2353
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,920
the way he was able to

2354
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,440
use math

2355
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,440
to show

2356
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:10,480
there that there is a way of arriving at

2357
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:13,040
knowing what is the

2358
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,360
um numerator and what's the denominator

2359
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,280
here was pretty

2360
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,760
a a was clear

2361
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,360
b it was pretty concise given the

2362
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,199
complexity and see it's pretty

2363
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:25,600
compelling so

2364
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,520
agree with all of that

2365
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,679
really looking forward to the dot one

2366
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:32,159
and dot two of course axel and anyone

2367
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:34,239
else is welcome to join in those

2368
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:36,960
discussions and then we have just so

2369
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,560
many more papers to discuss in the

2370
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:41,600
coming years

2371
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:43,199
we're gonna just

2372
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:45,520
do what we do in the dot one and dot two

2373
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,600
we're gonna be in the bathtub phase be

2374
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,360
in the thick of it be in the forest for

2375
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:50,639
the dot one

2376
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:53,360
and then we're gonna have our our

2377
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,040
springboard in our jumping off in the

2378
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,400
dot two

2379
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:57,760
and

2380
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,880
we looked forward to this dot zero but

2381
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:01,760
soon

2382
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,760
we're going to be looking back on it

2383
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,719
what we did yeah exactly perfect perfect

2384
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:09,760
setup okay thank you so much

2385
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,600

2386
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,920
