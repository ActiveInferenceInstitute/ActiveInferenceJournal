00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,480
action flab

5
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,360
live stream number 34.2

6
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,280
it's december 14th 2021

7
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,440
welcome to the actin flab

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,000
we are a participatory online lab that

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,160
is communicating learning and practicing

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,160
applied active inference

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,640
you can find us at some of the links

12
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,719
here on this slide

13
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,719
this is a recorded and an archived live

14
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,640
stream so please provide us with

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,840
feedback so that we can improve our work

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,159
all backgrounds and perspectives are

17
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,439
welcome here

18
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,439
and we'll be following good video

19
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,720
etiquette for live streams

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,880
if you check out this coda link which i

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,960
will post into the youtube live chat

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,880
right now you can see a lot of

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,560
information on past present and future

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,759
live streams and also more information

25
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,479
on if you want to participate because

26
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,479
that's what a participatory lab is if

27
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,759
you're hearing this you have the

28
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,960
affordance to get involved

29
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,240
today in active stream 34.2 we're going

30
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,119
to be having our third discussion on the

31
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,079
paper

32
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,840
free energy principle it's not about

33
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,920
what it takes it's about what took you

34
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,720
there

35
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,759
by axel constant from 2021

36
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,720
and we're just going to be having a fun

37
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,119
dot 2 jumping off

38
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,920
we'll go over any parts of the paper

39
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,680
that we want to look at

40
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,439
return to some of the formalisms and

41
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,360
then also we've written down

42
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,200
a few questions specifically to address

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,520
but of course anything people raise or

44
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,599
anything that people ask in the live

45
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,239
chat we can get to that

46
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,120
and

47
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,400
usually it says

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,120
next week we will discuss other papers

49
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,959
or we'll be discussing the same paper

50
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,160
but actually it's next year because this

51
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,680
is the last regularly scheduled

52
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,080
weekly journal discussion that we're

53
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,959
doing

54
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,200
and we'll have a little bit of an encore

55
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,640
on this thursday with uh

56
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,280
32.3

57
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,319
when conor hines will join for a dot

58
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,840
three that's kind of like the triple

59
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,000
jump the the hop skip in the jump

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,720
uh rather than just the mirror jump

61
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,959
but this is kind of the

62
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,640
ending of a really awesome year of

63
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,200
discussions and we haven't quite set

64
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,599
which papers to discuss next year so if

65
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,440
you have suggestions or you want to get

66
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,159
involved in the dot-coms organizational

67
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,599
unit where we make these kinds of

68
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,720
decisions collectively then just contact

69
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,200
us through any channel

70
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,040
okay

71
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,000
so we'll begin with an introductions and

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,200
warm-up section so people can say hello

73
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,120
and they can address any of these

74
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,720
warm-up questions like what they're

75
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,800
excited to talk about today

76
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,120
or just anything else they want to

77
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,239
mention

78
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,319
so this should be fun and thanks to

79
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,640
everybody who's joining on the video

80
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,640
stream and those who are watching live

81
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,760
on youtube

82
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,920
so i'll start i'm daniel i'm a

83
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,840
researcher in california

84
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,959
and

85
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,200
i think today i'm a little bit excited

86
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,879
about talking

87
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,519
about how we got here where we are and

88
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,000
then where we go what is the free energy

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,640
principle and active inference say about

90
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,920
where we go

91
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,518
and i'll pass to blue

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,239
hi i'm blue i'm an independent research

93
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,720
consultant in new mexico

94
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,560
and i am excited to talk about um

95
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,360
the difference between

96
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,080
living and non-living systems and where

97
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,799
the

98
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,799
fep may come into play there

99
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,478
all right how about dean

100
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,630
sorry

101
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,810
[Music]

102
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,840
i actually don't hear dean

103
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
hi sorry about that i'm dean i'm

104
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,560
obviously not fully awake and i'm still

105
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,160
warming up because

106
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,120
i'm in canada in the mountains and it's

107
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,440
snowing as we speak

108
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,759
um what's interesting to me about this

109
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,759
paper and about

110
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,800
its role in terms of fep and active

111
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,560
inference is so once we have identified

112
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,960
the entailment problem then what happens

113
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,880
and i'll pass it over to

114
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,199
stephen

115
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,120
hello steven here

116
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,120
i'm in toronto

117
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,160
and i'm interested in

118
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,120
this

119
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,960
reframing um

120
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,560
i think this paper does i think it's

121
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,320
helpful um

122
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,000
maybe thinking about

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,840
you know where was i in the river of

124
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,039
life

125
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,039
when something happened

126
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,919
to take me to where i am rather it sort

127
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:22,960
of

128
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,600
might be never fully known but the

129
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,440
principles might be useful

130
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,520
i like that rather than

131
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,759
this is the calculation of what happened

132
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,240
which is that temptation so i think

133
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,680
there's something about that going on

134
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,160
here so look forward to pursuing that

135
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,840
more i'm going to pass this over to dave

136
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,160
the two things i'm excited about are

137
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,840
that in this city north of manila which

138
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,080
has rougher the population of pittsburgh

139
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,680
or anaheim or manchester we had one new

140
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,000
case of coven yesterday and zero today

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,319
and also as soon as daniel pulled his

142
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,400
pope alexander the sixth routine and

143
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,039
said when will you make an end suddenly

144
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,280
maria and i are just barreling through

145
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,240
the redaction of the

146
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,160
seminar

147
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,880
who

148
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,240
who is there anybody

149
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,319
that's all yeah dave was just mentioning

150
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,759
there the um imminent completion of the

151
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,479
firstin symposium transcript

152
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,560
where we're taking the symposium that we

153
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,240
had earlier in the year

154
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,400
and enriching it into something that can

155
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,479
be used for closed captioning as well as

156
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,479
translations and enrichment and

157
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,080
connections to other aspects of our

158
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,800
knowledge base so that will be very fun

159
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
and it's also

160
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
speaks to how we got here and where

161
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
we're going i think because eventually

162
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,520
we'll give that kind of a treatment to

163
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,000
all of these live streams

164
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,800
and

165
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,960
that will be quite interesting

166
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,720
so

167
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,479
steven yes please

168
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,080
i'm actually so because we're using a

169
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,160
slightly different jitsi um let's just

170
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,639
get all of our emojis out of the way if

171
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,560
you go to the hand and then you do

172
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,160
emojis it does like

173
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,319
okay oh perfect disable sounds for all

174
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,000
please disable it

175
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,639
okay now feel free to use emojis you can

176
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,880
signal by repeatedly clicking

177
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,039
how shocked you are for example at what

178
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,599
dean says

179
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,520
okay stephen please

180
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,199
yes

181
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,319
okay

182
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,520
this actually

183
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,680
it works a bit more cleanly as well i

184
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,319
think this this interface um

185
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,800
i was gonna say that i'm interested as

186
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,639
well um

187
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,479
the the question of scale the question

188
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,400
of scale i think there's something in

189
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,280
this is like we're saying um it's not

190
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,199
how you got there well

191
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,840
what scale is you is it scale free is it

192
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,360
scale friendly i know we've been talking

193
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,560
about that but

194
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,599
is is there um

195
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,199
is this is this

196
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,720
you

197
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,639
um

198
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,400
like the royal one

199
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,319
is it like a very broad term or is it

200
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,800
something that's like very much

201
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,120
um at the scale of an agent

202
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,240
um

203
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,479
is it across scales

204
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,000
nested scales

205
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,160
um i'm not saying this necessarily goes

206
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,919
into that but i think because i'm

207
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,400
interested in okay

208
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,199
taking this philosophical

209
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,840
underpinning which at first looks like

210
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,560
it adds an extra burden or becomes a

211
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,399
side issue for a more applied context

212
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,919
actually i think it it does help

213
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,799
um

214
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,200
just back up a bit it helps back up and

215
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,360
in doing that backing up i think it

216
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,679
keeps us with that unifying

217
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,519
principle

218
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,279
um approach rather than a unified theory

219
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,480
temptation

220
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,519
which i think is what often happens

221
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,320
to everyone right we so i think that

222
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,519
keeping it

223
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,279
at that slightly more nascent

224
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,360
understanding may

225
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,680
give us a way to like understand the

226
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,920
types of principles that could be seen

227
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,440
to have played a part which could

228
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,560
therefore be seen to have been useful in

229
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,399
other people trying to do something

230
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,800
similar which is not the same as a

231
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
unified theory of

232
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,160
why something

233
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,560
happened

234
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,839
thanks steven dean

235
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,320
so

236
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,040
what the paper brings out for me and and

237
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,720
it kind of ties into what stephen was

238
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,120
just saying is that you

239
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,680
have an entailment question

240
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,920
that you want to have answered

241
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,959
and now

242
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,440
you have to think of that in terms of

243
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,959
what's necessary and what's sufficient

244
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,240
if you look at that

245
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,600
uni-directionally meaning through the

246
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,279
course of time as

247
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,279
the flow or the river or whatever

248
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,959
metaphor you want to apply here if you

249
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,440
look at that one directionally

250
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,480
that's going to kick out one version

251
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,680
and what

252
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,640
this paper points out is that there's

253
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
two directions at the same time so

254
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,680
there's a relationship between

255
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,839
meaning and a different form of

256
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,200
entailment

257
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,920
not one causing the other necessarily

258
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,480
but the fact that there are two

259
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,360
and now they are somehow relating to one

260
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,399
another

261
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,959
which is a which is a different animal

262
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,480
and so i think

263
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,760
what i'm going to be really curious

264
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,040
about in terms of the point two of this

265
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,360
of what we're doing here today is

266
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,040
seeing whether or not

267
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,640
we can

268
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,440
address what each one of those things

269
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,560
one

270
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,200
unilater unidirectionally through the

271
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,519
course of time and the other strictly

272
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,040
relationally

273
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,240
in terms of how to how do two things

274
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,480
that we know are present

275
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,760
interact with one another i'm going to

276
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,600
be really curious to see what other

277
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,120
people think

278
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,880
might be the difference between those

279
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,200
two very two different views because i

280
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,279
think that's what the author

281
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,320
asks us to entertain is not just

282
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,920
the one

283
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,399
but both

284
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,720
cool i think to to steven's question

285
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,040
about scale i think it's also a

286
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,600
important thing to keep in mind so the

287
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,160
example in the paper which we talked

288
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,959
about in the dot zero and not one was

289
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,360
this bacterium so this is the toy

290
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,760
example that shows that

291
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,000
first off the differences between

292
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,320
the bayesian bacterium and the

293
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,560
variational bayesian free energy

294
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,560
minimizing bacterium

295
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,839
and then shows how it's not simply

296
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,800
sufficient to be minimizing free energy

297
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,880
but rather one has to be minimizing free

298
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,440
energy with the appropriate priors so

299
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,560
it's not enough to be doing just

300
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,160
bayesian statistics

301
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,680
you have to have the right priors in

302
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,120
order to make the right kinds of

303
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,320
decisions

304
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,240
and then the relationship

305
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,000
between free energy minimization and

306
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,440
life is

307
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,200
what is discussed as the entailment

308
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,440
problem so we talked about those earlier

309
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,720
so just go back and check if you'd like

310
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,959
but what is the scale at which the

311
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,760
entailment problem

312
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,279
is even applying

313
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,000
is it the cell membrane of the bacterium

314
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,079
it just aligns perfectly with the

315
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,440
physical scope of the agent

316
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,240
or

317
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,720
is it the colony of bacteria

318
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,120
or is it the bacteria and its niche that

319
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,160
has to be explained how it got there

320
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,079
aren't we always going to have supra

321
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,519
systems

322
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,160
that are going to need their own

323
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,600
explanation

324
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,760
and i think that really speaks to

325
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,120
also what you said stephen about the

326
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,680
difference between the unifying approach

327
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,000
versus the unified theory this is like

328
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,200
past tense

329
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,360
it's been unified what else do we need

330
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,519
to know there's only one

331
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,120
versus unifying is this ongoing process

332
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,959
and it's an approach where we might have

333
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,079
some

334
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,560
guidebooks or tools

335
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,600
or

336
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,839
memes for the road but

337
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,440
it's not over yet we're still

338
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,720
approaching

339
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,560
some other question but then how did we

340
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,119
get that other question

341
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,399
yes stephen and also i don't think that

342
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,240
people need to raise their hand

343
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,760
maybe they can throw up an emoji

344
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,480
silently because it still blinks a

345
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,920
little bit but i think if you just use

346
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,240
for example laughs

347
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,600
then i'll i'll see a flurry of laughter

348
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,240
oh nice

349
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,399
then i'll be laughing as well

350
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,079
that's not probably a bad thing make me

351
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,760
a bit more cheerful um

352
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,199
yeah

353
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,959
i've got this vision of these little

354
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,040
faces now um

355
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,639
there's um

356
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,079
there's something

357
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,279
i'd be interested in a bit more on what

358
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,639
you were just saying there basically

359
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,040
because you you said um

360
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,000
um

361
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,760
there needs to be more

362
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,519
um i'd be interested what people's

363
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,360
thoughts are around

364
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,199
um

365
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,000
what makes this helpful from an applied

366
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,440
perspective

367
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,600
so because one of the big

368
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,519
so i think one of the key things often

369
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,000
in in a more applied perspective is

370
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,920
um there's maybe the application of some

371
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,240
kind of minimal model theory that's been

372
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,600
shown

373
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,399
to

374
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,160
give a type of

375
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,600
transitional

376
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,360
structuring for instance what some

377
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,639
cognitive agent who might be

378
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,399
engaging with the world more like

379
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,399
someone with autism

380
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,880
the nature of how they process sensory

381
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,279
information or other types of situations

382
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,160
so that kind of general

383
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,399
sense of the types of ways

384
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,800
can then be used and maybe applied at a

385
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,440
bigger scale but

386
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,760
generally speaking you also once you get

387
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,399
if you if the applied side of it is

388
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,600
starting to go beyond

389
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,600
a fairly low dimensional model

390
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,000
and into these more complex

391
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,760
um

392
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,320
real life that's not the right term but

393
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,760
applied context

394
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,040
then

395
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,639
these heuristics might be more broad

396
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,279
like the unifying approach is is going

397
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,519
to be maybe more valid and i'm wondering

398
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,680
how does the jump from a biological

399
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,319
philosophy

400
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,040
mindset

401
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,440
that's informing this paper

402
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,519
translate into those so i'd be curious

403
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,120
just what others thoughts are on that

404
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,680
good question how does philosophy

405
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,560
impact or influence application

406
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,399
how do

407
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,720
basic or theoretical biology questions

408
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,279
influence the day-to-day and the way

409
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,880
that different projects are carried out

410
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,000
because

411
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,240
it seems almost

412
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,199
um trivial to say that the projects that

413
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,040
we're implementing whether it's a road

414
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,519
construction or whatever it is

415
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,120
it kind of

416
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,560
has a biological component it's by us

417
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,680
for us

418
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,680
and then it has a philosophical

419
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,320
component even if only implicitly in the

420
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,639
top-down structuring so we're talking

421
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,800
about philosophy and biology i think

422
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,839
that's even what journal the paper is in

423
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,959
so then what does that

424
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,360
mean for how we apply and yeah what else

425
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,480
is part of the approach

426
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,759
i think these are

427
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,279
interesting questions

428
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,199
yeah go for it

429
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,440
one thing i've been very interested in

430
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,199
there's a new field by michael quinn

431
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,720
patton around

432
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,199
principles focused evaluation

433
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,040
which sort of extends his utility

434
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,279
focused evaluation and developmental

435
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,639
evaluation

436
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,600
where you you know your your things are

437
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,319
unfolding so the evaluator is not

438
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,720
it's not evaluating after the fact

439
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,880
but is it part of the strategic journey

440
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,400
to see well what

441
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,959
what sort of um

442
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,240
you could say

443
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,559
in our case what sort of

444
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,280
free energy like minimizing

445
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,959
um

446
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,319
incidents happened that looks

447
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,199
significant to the context

448
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,840
okay so it's it's it's not completely

449
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,799
noisy it's not completely unknown

450
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,520
yet it's complex enough that we're not

451
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,720
following

452
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,000
um a rolled out system that's kind of

453
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,960
relatively dead and relatively um

454
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,720
slapped down on the table each time like

455
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,400
a piece of meat that's dead

456
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,160
it's something that's kind of

457
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,840
evolving and going and i think there's

458
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,240
something quite nice here

459
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,280
to that principles approach um

460
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,720
you know you you and what principles are

461
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,799
going to be useful

462
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,919
when you're looking at understanding

463
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,520
if

464
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,559
there were particular choices in the

465
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,640
particular stream that happened to have

466
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,240
been present

467
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,799
that made free energy minimizing happen

468
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,080
or maybe

469
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,080
when it didn't happen

470
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,720
when the agent didn't manage to

471
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,320
make the

472
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,760
choices and things started to unravel

473
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,520
that could also be interesting because

474
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,760
often it's more interesting to see

475
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,000
you don't really know which one made the

476
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,400
difference when something has been kept

477
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,919
on track

478
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,280
because it it never fully uh you know

479
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,440
spiraled out and magnified but what were

480
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,160
the times when suddenly went wrong

481
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,360
and or

482
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,000
can we find out trace where that

483
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,640
perturbation that started to

484
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,919
rock other parts of the system of uh

485
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,240
interest came from and that that might

486
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,559
be somewhere this type of work

487
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,240
ties in as a thought

488
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,799
daniel can i can i ask a question

489
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,559
without raising my hand

490
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,240
yeah i think we can just go for it in

491
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,360
this one

492
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,120
so

493
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,520
so here's my question and it ties in

494
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,080
directly with this paper

495
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,799
i don't think the author is asking in

496
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:21,919
the

497
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,000
in the generic sense which came first

498
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,320
the chicken or the egg any more than i

499
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,080
think he's when he's looking at an

500
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,720
entailment problem which came first

501
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,840
sensing or acting which came first

502
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,240
internal or external

503
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,679
which came first um in all aspects of

504
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,559
the philosophical sense of

505
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,039
what's the relationship between

506
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,039
internal external

507
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,039
sensing acting

508
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,799
i think what trips people up and what

509
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,360
gets them on that unidirectional

510
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,080
linear kind of approach is

511
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,280
asking what's first instead of holding

512
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,600
up the relationship between

513
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,640
and then

514
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,720
seeing what falls out the other side

515
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,679
so

516
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,320
if it's an entailment question

517
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
is

518
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,799
internal

519
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,039
necessary for external

520
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,039
linearly speaking you could make that

521
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,520
argument but i don't know that that

522
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,760
necessarily holds then if you're saying

523
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,280
does external

524
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,799
then make necessary internal however

525
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,159
if

526
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,039
you look at it as a relationship between

527
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,400
internal and external

528
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,559
both are necessary

529
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,600
so one can be satisfactory for the other

530
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,840
if you're looking at it unidirectionally

531
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,799
but if you're looking at it

532
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,760
bi-directionally now all of a sudden

533
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,679
the frame shifts and

534
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,600
both become necessary

535
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,520
in a relationship in order for the

536
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,120
relationship

537
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,039
to continue forward

538
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,679
so i think for a lot of people

539
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,679
asking which came first the chicken or

540
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,159
the egg from a relational standpoint

541
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,600
doesn't matter

542
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,919
they both have to exist

543
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,240
for the question to continue

544
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,240
not which came first but do both exist

545
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,840
and i think that's the entailment

546
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,039
question that this author is asking us

547
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,720
to

548
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,600
at least contemplate a little bit are we

549
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,559
are we

550
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,960
holding ourselves to one view

551
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,600
that unilateral view when really what we

552
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,280
should be doing is looking at the

553
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,840
relationship and what entails the other

554
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,360
as being either

555
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,719
status satisfying or necessary

556
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,360
great stephen thought on that

557
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,360
and so following on from dean there's

558
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,520
maybe is like you say

559
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,360
when we get into do they exist now we're

560
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,760
into the structural

561
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,360
stuff we're into the structures we're

562
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,960
into the structures where action and

563
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,360
interaction happens as opposed to

564
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,960
a meta system

565
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,520
of egg and you know there's a structure

566
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,679
and i suppose the question can also be

567
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,840
is

568
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,360
do they sufficiently exist

569
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,200
and at what point

570
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,120
so for instance at what point maybe

571
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,559
through

572
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,799
pollution lack of calcium and diet

573
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,640
kinetic

574
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,080
impact

575
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,240
are they no longer sufficiently

576
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,919
persistent

577
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,799
and suddenly one of the eggs can't make

578
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,360
another chicken

579
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,320
okay so that that that could become

580
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,200
you know that then maybe is out of the

581
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,559
how did 50 000 eggs get made

582
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,679
well maybe it's more useful so when

583
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,480
at what point did

584
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,880
point one percent of those eggs

585
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,919
not

586
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,840
continue what was

587
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,159
then outside of

588
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,080
the

589
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,480
pullback attractor or whatever way we

590
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,880
want to say it that was needed to keep

591
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,240
it within

592
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,480
a viable um

593
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,600
a viable living

594
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,960
trajectory so one

595
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,679
kind of funny answer to which came first

596
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,640
the chicken or the egg

597
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,799
from an instrumentalist perspective you

598
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,760
go oh in your sentence chicken

599
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,679
just that's the answer the way you spoke

600
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,200
that question it was chicken and someone

601
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,400
said well what came first the egg or the

602
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,640
ch okay then the egg came first in how

603
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,840
you asked it

604
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,640
so what came first in your model

605
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,080
but that question

606
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,760
smacks of realism

607
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,600
we start thinking about the the actual

608
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,200
way that things might have played out

609
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,919
and is it more the case that there was a

610
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,279
chicken that

611
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,600
that's the realism question

612
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,320
and then when we take this relational

613
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,799
instrumentalist perspective

614
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,640
um there are different kinds of time

615
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,320
relationships falling out and i don't

616
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,919
know if these are the right words but

617
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,360
just a few of them

618
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,080
so

619
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,840
one thing is about the internal and

620
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,679
external that dean mentioned the

621
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,600
partition is simultaneous when we do

622
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,520
a particular partition

623
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,840
of internal external and their

624
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,080
corresponding blanket states

625
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,080
those are all co-instantiated at the

626
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,360
same time in model time or in the

627
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,600
relational instrumental time that

628
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,400
doesn't mean that they had to have been

629
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,440
coming into existence as actual external

630
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,400
entities whether that static structural

631
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,679
ontology or a dynamical process ontology

632
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,080
but once we're in the modeler's time the

633
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,159
partitioning comes into

634
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,559
existence at the same time

635
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,840
and then we have things that are

636
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,520
changing through time

637
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,240
so there's the intra model actin

638
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,440
formalism

639
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,600
like the subscript next to the letter

640
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,760
when we're talking about stay at time

641
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,159
one two three four that's

642
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,240
within the model within the active

643
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,400
formalism changes through time

644
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,760
then there's the

645
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,440
extra formalism like outside of the

646
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,600
kernel of the model which is the

647
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,559
iterated modeling which is also changing

648
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,360
through time because it's not like

649
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,600
any program is just produced and then

650
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,360
that's the final version there's always

651
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,480
an iteration process in the real world

652
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,559
so that's changes through time

653
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,240
and then

654
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,400
somehow spinning that

655
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,679
around

656
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,919
we actually get to this

657
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,039
timeless

658
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,440
and momentary

659
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,799
relationship

660
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,520
that's like the complex entailments

661
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,559
where

662
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,960
we start to

663
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,320
ask about the relationship that's

664
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,960
actually not conditioned on a given

665
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,640
moment but

666
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,320
not sure exactly if that's the right way

667
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,679
to talk about that but there is

668
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,159
something that's it's not time travel

669
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,480
but it's not just forward in time but

670
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,039
it's not merely

671
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,279
reflection or memory on the past

672
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,919
so daniel here's a here's a thing to

673
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,600
think about if

674
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
you start with the model

675
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
if you begin with the model

676
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,200
you you start it

677
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,000
at

678
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,440
near time zero in even in the model that

679
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,080
axel brings out it's simple then by its

680
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,200
place in the time continuum if you end

681
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,799
with the model

682
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,200
it's got to be much more sophisticated

683
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,960
because a whole bunch of things have

684
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,799
happened a whole bunch of new

685
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,679
information has been available now to

686
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,840
include in the prior

687
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,720
so i don't know that it's it's

688
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,679
complex entailment happens the further

689
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,520
out you wait

690
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,080
for the model to appear if you start

691
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,279
with the model

692
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,360
you're going to get a different result

693
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,400
than if the model is closer to the end

694
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,360
of the loop closure

695
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,520
that's that's what this entailment

696
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,559
question

697
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,840
is actually

698
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,440
surfacing for us

699
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,720
it's when

700
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,480
the model

701
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,200
so where did that come from space time

702
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,000
means when the model when did the model

703
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,960
appear

704
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,600
so that we close one loop and start the

705
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,559
the next update

706
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,200
that's that's where the sufficiency

707
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,279
and the necessity part gets really

708
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,880
strange because it's it's essentially

709
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,279
a space-time question and if we include

710
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,080
two arrows we're now including space and

711
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,399
time

712
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,918
thanks dean stephen

713
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,440
and

714
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,159
within that space and time

715
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,240
i think as daniel has mentioned we can

716
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,320
have these implicit assumptions just in

717
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,399
the way we frame in our questions

718
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,799
which uh would be subliminal but it's

719
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,880
it's sitting there right like you say

720
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,720
by it by even talking about things in

721
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,640
certain ways it privileges a certain

722
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,240
type of thinking and i

723
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,520
i'm really interested um

724
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,279
even in this paper we talk about what

725
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,159
did it take for you to get here okay

726
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,760
so there's also it's almost like that

727
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,039
picture of like

728
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,760
you know the beautiful puppy it's like

729
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,679
and i can imagine asking how did it take

730
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,120
what did it take for you to get here

731
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,799
right but there's also those really

732
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,880
inspiring moments when you see

733
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,840
the really sort of

734
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,159
starved small dog that's kind of in a

735
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,320
really bad shape right and i was

736
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,399
thinking what does it need to get back

737
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,840
to there or something like that i.e a

738
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,520
relatively

739
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,799
viable healthy thriving type of

740
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:31,919
animal

741
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,000
so that's also and i think that often is

742
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,399
like the priors in some ways when things

743
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,399
have gone out of kilter

744
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:39,679
there's a need

745
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,520
there's been a prior set of experiences

746
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,279
which have been non-optimal

747
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,799
but hasn't killed the animal

748
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,120
well how do those what priors need to be

749
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,559
fed in to get back on track

750
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,320
although the word track is not the right

751
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,200
term but to get closer to something and

752
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,399
even there i'm struggling i think this

753
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,080
is where the ontology should i be saying

754
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,600
get back to a non-equilibrium steady

755
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,480
state to an attractor to a thriving and

756
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,919
maybe it doesn't need to at that point

757
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,840
maybe there's there's some concept that

758
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,440
doesn't have to be in the free energy

759
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,720
principle exactly it's like some idea of

760
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,240
a thriving type of organism but that

761
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,679
that that

762
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,039
that situation has taken

763
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,960
um has taken the the the

764
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,559
living entity

765
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,640
away from the stream

766
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,960
that would be

767
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,320
desired and has to find a way back

768
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,120
or it won't survive

769
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,120
blue

770
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,919
so

771
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,799
i i was like just to kind of hit on both

772
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,520
what dean and steven were saying like

773
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,320
how did we get here like you i often

774
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,360
think of here as like um like a physical

775
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,399
place but it's also like to this present

776
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,240
time point or here like how did we

777
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,360
become

778
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,799
alive and get to this like

779
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,960
non-equilibrium steady state

780
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,200
so it makes me wonder what dean was

781
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,520
saying like here is also a when right

782
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,799
like so what are all the things that

783
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,520
brought you to this moment

784
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,320
um

785
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,039
and really like

786
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,880
i don't know like so all of the

787
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,159
circumstances that have made you

788
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,399
in this present moment who you are like

789
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,159
whatever you are separated by your

790
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,279
partition

791
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,919
like is the present uh

792
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,080
part of the steady state like like that

793
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,200
that's what makes me think of that i

794
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,360
mean the present can't be like a steady

795
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,840
state system so

796
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,360
it it's because it's like always

797
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,840
constantly like going forward

798
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,880
and

799
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,240
so i don't know it makes me think of

800
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,919
that as an attractor is the present

801
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,480
moment can that be an attractor like is

802
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,880
is that possible stay in the moment stay

803
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,320
in the present when we think about

804
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,480
mental action like like what does that

805
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,840
mean to stay in the moment like can that

806
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,919
be like an attractor state like is the

807
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,000
future an attractive state i don't know

808
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,039
just make me think about that

809
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,799
certainly some kind of

810
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,360
pull from the future

811
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,600
is

812
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,360
what's happening with free energy

813
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,799
minimization

814
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,159
in the physical

815
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,320
gibbs free energy sense

816
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,240
it's as if there's a pull from the

817
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,559
future down the hill but

818
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,519
it's actually this sort of instantaneous

819
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,559
movement

820
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,799
of the reaction

821
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,880
yet it does act as if there's this

822
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,799
long-term pull

823
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,880
and also maybe the necessity and

824
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,519
sufficiency so what does it take to get

825
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,480
here

826
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,279
it depends how

827
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,919
stringent we want to be with what's here

828
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,360
and now because even some tiny tiny

829
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,039
gravitational factor of some other

830
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,200
planet or some

831
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,080
object on the other side of the planet

832
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,440
it's safe to say that some molecule in a

833
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,279
given body would be in a different

834
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,559
orientation

835
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,760
even if trivially so so then is that

836
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,440
going to

837
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,559
mean that everything is

838
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,840
sufficient

839
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,919
like we it was everything that it was

840
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,679
there was sufficient to get us here but

841
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,679
also everything was necessary

842
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,399
is that too stringent or how loosely do

843
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:17,760
we hold

844
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,399
the system and i think instrumentalism

845
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,640
gives us an answer which is just

846
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,039
how detailed is our model and then

847
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,279
that's the level of stringency which

848
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,600
variables are we going to include

849
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
and what precision will we have over

850
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,039
those variables

851
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,159
and then just to the question about

852
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,240
thriving i guess that stephen asks

853
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,240
whether that's in the active ontology or

854
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,480
not so it'll be fun to

855
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,320
find out what is and isn't in the

856
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,679
ontology and then translations or

857
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,320
transpositions

858
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,120
of memes from active to apply to those

859
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,080
other cases so like for example

860
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,640
the person looking at the puppy

861
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,880
and thinking here are the physiological

862
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,039
variables that i can measure there's the

863
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,880
shine on the code and there's the blood

864
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,279
sugar and there's the cortisol level

865
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,679
that's my instrumental model there's

866
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,360
other things happening that i don't know

867
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,720
but those are the ones

868
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,279
and my preference

869
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,279
for the attractor

870
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,480
would be

871
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,760
dot dot dot

872
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,399
and so what policies can i take in

873
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,200
relationship to this animal

874
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,720
so that

875
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,559
its attractor

876
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,039
is now as if it's

877
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,519
here in that three-dimensional space of

878
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,320
shine and blood sugar and cortisol

879
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,880
rather than the current attractor that

880
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,320
it appears to be

881
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,679
orbiting

882
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:42,640
so then

883
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
we can just talk about preferences and

884
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,559
expectations and policies

885
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,399
of the caretaker

886
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,360
and then we've kind of transposed this

887
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,399
sort of like floating obligation

888
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,880
for the puppy to be healthy but then

889
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,000
things do

890
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,120
die

891
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,480
so

892
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,240
we've transposed this kind of

893
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,240
implicit philosophy around a floating

894
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,760
obligation

895
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,399
into a specific relationship

896
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,320
and the policies that a specific

897
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,960
caretaker in their model

898
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,240
are going to engage in

899
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,359
that's uh that's a good point and

900
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,918
i think actually this is when we we find

901
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,639
ourselves getting back into the core of

902
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,879
what's the agent's journey

903
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,879
in different contexts and getting into

904
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,159
that and becomes contextual

905
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,359
and

906
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:38,800
what's the expectations what's the

907
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,239
surprise

908
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,679
and

909
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,280
when you're into the agent's journey

910
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,520
what was surprising or what's relevant

911
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,119
out of all the

912
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,119
huge amount of surprises that can be

913
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,119
going on across all levels

914
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,599
is kind of what becomes important

915
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,200
potentially

916
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,359
because that becomes where choices were

917
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,640
being made

918
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,040
or not been made

919
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,280
and i think that when we talk about or

920
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,480
when

921
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,400
often there's this question about the

922
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,440
minimal conditions for life

923
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,640
that becomes a sort of false question

924
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,560
because it's again it's in that kind of

925
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,240
the fruit what's the minimal questions

926
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,680
to get life now that's great

927
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,880
if

928
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,040
someone's applied active inference work

929
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,599
is to create life from scratch

930
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,440
i can't see anyone doing that for a long

931
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,960
time

932
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,240
so

933
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,359
however if we want to know

934
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,520
what were the key expectations surprise

935
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,520
or policy shifts

936
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,720
in a living

937
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:46,000
entity that got them to this new living

938
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,960
entity

939
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,960
because there's changed right i've got

940
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,440
the scars on my hands but maybe i cut

941
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,240
myself with a knife and i had to heal

942
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,320
what were the what were the kind of

943
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,640
journeys on that route and those are the

944
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,720
things outside of a monty python foot

945
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,320
coming down in my head in which case i

946
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,680
don't have much surprise or because i'm

947
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,720
gone

948
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,000
is i'm is what were those

949
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,839
that i think is more interesting and

950
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,280
that is maybe

951
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,200
what this talks about because one of the

952
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,520
key things he talks about is structural

953
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,800
integrity

954
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,480
how to resist

955
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,040
the loss of structural integrity he

956
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,200
doesn't say how to keep the system going

957
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,359
doesn't matter what we see the system to

958
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:28,320
be

959
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,480
it's if it's acting it's got structural

960
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,359
integrity to be

961
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,640
a thing

962
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,960
with the ability to act

963
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,640
whether that thing is now looked at as a

964
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,760
system

965
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,640
is academic

966
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,359
in the discussion on the metamorphic

967
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,960
systems

968
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,200
where

969
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,240
the paper writes it may be said that the

970
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,160
life cycle that corresponds to the thing

971
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,240
whose integrity is maintained over time

972
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,160
is the process integrity using

973
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,920
bucky fuller's ontology rather than the

974
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,240
structural integrity the structure of

975
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,960
the egg is always being broken down

976
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,040
the larva is always breaking down the

977
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,800
pupa is always the adult is always

978
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,760
breaking down and forming but

979
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,520
there doesn't need to be

980
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,560
structural integrity or the retention of

981
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,720
change at any point

982
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,960
there's a higher order

983
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,960
uh integrity

984
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,280
in the reproductive process

985
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,119
and then that's the question is

986
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,040
okay so can we just look at one nest

987
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,040
mate do we have to look at the colony

988
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,200
colony in the symbionts

989
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,320
colony and the aviotic niche

990
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,320
what is that

991
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,400
life cycle thing

992
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,359
what's the thing's life cycle

993
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:50,560
is that

994
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,079
gonna be

995
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,599
like a realist

996
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,480
answer where there's kind of one

997
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,000
true

998
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,800
thing

999
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,400
whose

1000
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,520
pattern integrity is being retained

1001
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,880
or

1002
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,200
might there be multiple possible

1003
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,200
answers for which thing is having its

1004
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,839
life cycle maintained

1005
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:12,880
so then

1006
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,240
there wouldn't be

1007
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,839
a answer

1008
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,520
for

1009
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,760
what is life or is are things alive it'd

1010
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,040
be model

1011
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,320
dependent

1012
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,240
and i think that's what we've

1013
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,839
one of the things that we've

1014
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,680
wrote down to explore

1015
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,680
about like what is life obviously

1016
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,280
classic questions

1017
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,880
and

1018
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,680
how

1019
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,320
does the fep and actimf

1020
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,160
apply to

1021
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,400
all kinds of

1022
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,400
identified systems

1023
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,839
animate meaning

1024
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:48,160
with activity and motion

1025
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,240
sentient meaning with sensation

1026
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,160
inanimate without

1027
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,680
motion

1028
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,800
and an incentive without

1029
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,599
perception

1030
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:02,720
and

1031
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,960
yeah which systems

1032
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,359
is it a slam dunk for and where is it

1033
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,040
going to be

1034
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,400
where is it

1035
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,960
overpowered where is it underpowered

1036
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,400
what changes would it need to be more

1037
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,599
adequate in those different areas

1038
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,160
can i add something daniel if i'm a rock

1039
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,000
without

1040
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,839
anthropomorphizing this if i'm a rock i

1041
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,960
can be now and now and now

1042
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,119
or i can be then and then and then but

1043
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,280
it would seem to me what the free energy

1044
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,280
principle tells us is

1045
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,920
there is some relationship

1046
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,400
to these living things because they

1047
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,800
whether they can articulate it or not

1048
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,680
they have some sense of the relationship

1049
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,720
between

1050
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,680
now and then whether then is in the past

1051
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,839
and they have a prior or then is in the

1052
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,560
future and they have a projection

1053
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,079
they're not like

1054
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,800
the non-living things which don't

1055
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,480
require some relationship between

1056
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,079
time points

1057
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,920
and i think that's one of the things

1058
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,720
that again axel is trying to point to in

1059
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,520
terms of an entailment question yes i

1060
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,960
can be in the moment and i can be

1061
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,119
mindful but the only reason why i'm

1062
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,240
aware that i'm in this moment and not

1063
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,040
then

1064
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,200
in the past or then in the future is

1065
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,680
because there is something other than

1066
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,720
now

1067
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,640
and i think that that again kind of

1068
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,319
speaks to

1069
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,920
when we can take this and look at it as

1070
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,520
bi-directionality as opposed to

1071
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,040
unidirectionality

1072
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,520
just entropy carrying out what entropy

1073
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,520
does

1074
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,520
stephen

1075
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,240
when

1076
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,720
when we think about this free energy

1077
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,560
principle applying

1078
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,520
and like

1079
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,200
dean mentioned you know entropy will be

1080
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,000
doing what it does

1081
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,200
you mentioned earlier about the

1082
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,319
flickering flame okay now i've got a gas

1083
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,720
flame okay if i maintain the input of

1084
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,760
gas there will be a structural integrity

1085
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,440
of the flame over time

1086
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,680
so the flame

1087
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,720
as a

1088
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,440
at one scale with one

1089
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,880
perception of what it means to be a

1090
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,920
flame it could be seen to be persistent

1091
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,480
however

1092
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,040
does that mean that it on that is time

1093
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,319
average in trying to maintain

1094
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,079
if the lens is

1095
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,280
a

1096
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,920
flame-like structure which maybe if

1097
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,839
coupled to our niche somehow we are

1098
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,920
trying to make it do that

1099
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,839
um

1100
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,400
but then becomes the question of

1101
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,280
where is the variational free energy

1102
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,160
being looked at is is it

1103
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,520
about

1104
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,800
free energy minimization

1105
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,640
or is it about

1106
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,960
leveraging the fact that there is a free

1107
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,880
energy principle happening there is free

1108
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,480
energy minimization

1109
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,319
there's but there's also just free

1110
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,240
energy variation

1111
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,280
so i could look at that and i maybe get

1112
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,839
some insight by seeing the flickering

1113
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,400
flame which isn't structurally hasn't

1114
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,880
got that much integrity but it has a

1115
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,240
form

1116
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,440
that is

1117
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,560
always changing yeah has a certain at

1118
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,079
some

1119
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,920
scale of information

1120
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,920
i know i should say scale of information

1121
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,319
or something but some qualitative nature

1122
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,800
of information persists

1123
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,880
over time

1124
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,200
where is that flame

1125
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,040
in relation to

1126
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,880
is it just because there's a

1127
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,280
fluctuation that i can extract the

1128
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,520
information from the persistence and the

1129
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,359
variation even if there's no inherent

1130
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,240
motion to reduce

1131
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,520
dissipation per se

1132
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,800
interesting i think that if we return to

1133
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,680
the entailment problem

1134
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,400
and the strong and the weak claims

1135
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,079
so the strong claim

1136
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,400
minimizing free energy is sufficient for

1137
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,440
life

1138
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,960
the overly generous claim and then the

1139
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,960
weakness st if the system is currently

1140
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,079
alive

1141
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,000
which as we looked at with that

1142
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,040
metamorphic slide means that it has

1143
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,839
persisted in its pattern integrity

1144
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,520
which i know it was used as structural

1145
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,280
integrity but that's actually a static

1146
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,319
concept

1147
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,480
it means that it minimized its free

1148
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,079
energy

1149
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,040
so

1150
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,960
the flame burning

1151
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,920
is kind of the canonical

1152
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,280
free energy chemical minimizing system

1153
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,880
it's dissipating

1154
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,520
literally the chemical potential energy

1155
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,680
and it's described perfectly

1156
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,240
by the dissipation

1157
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,280
of free energy into its environment

1158
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,119
and it's even that metaphor of like oh

1159
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,280
wait a minute if you put a candle under

1160
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,720
a glass jar

1161
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,280
it burns out the oxygen and then

1162
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,800
no more

1163
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,040
same thing happens with

1164
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,520
life forms that require oxygen to do

1165
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,720
respiration

1166
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,720
which basically is just

1167
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,880
taking that big drop

1168
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,000
in free energy that you can get from

1169
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,800
high energy molecules like fats

1170
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,079
and then just trickling that

1171
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,200
and yes making some heat but also

1172
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,440
using it to structure

1173
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,640
other

1174
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,880
macromolecular systems

1175
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,400
internal and external that allow

1176
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,440
other fats to get eaten

1177
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,480
so

1178
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,119
yeah blue

1179
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,640
so i want to push back on dean for a

1180
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,960
minute um he's like got me stuck in this

1181
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,000
like temporal like i don't know zone so

1182
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,440
you were talking a little bit about um

1183
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,000
the relationship like a rock has now and

1184
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,839
iraq has net then

1185
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:01,599
but but i was not clear i want you to

1186
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,440
clarify i'm gonna really like push hard

1187
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,200
on you i want you to clarify what you

1188
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,240
mean

1189
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,480
uh like what is the difference there

1190
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,240
between a rock and something that's

1191
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,640
alive is it a relationship between now

1192
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,560
and then be it past or future or is it

1193
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,760
awareness

1194
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,760
of the past and the future and how do

1195
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,839
you know a rock is not aware or that a

1196
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,400
bacterium is aware so can you clarify

1197
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,520
like what

1198
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,200
actually is like this now then

1199
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,319
nest

1200
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:29,520
sure okay

1201
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,560
so so what i'm saying is i don't need i

1202
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,240
don't i don't believe

1203
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,760
if if you could i said i don't want

1204
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,079
anthro anthropomorphize it but if you

1205
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,319
could ask a rock does it need both the

1206
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,720
now and then i think the answer it would

1207
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,359
give back is i need one or the other i

1208
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:46,960
don't need both

1209
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,119
and to the point about the flame

1210
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,000
if i if i consider myself metaphorically

1211
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,160
to have it a fire burning inside of me

1212
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,920
if i'm an engine

1213
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,359
i have to know

1214
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,000
that in order to keep the fire going i

1215
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,440
have to bring in

1216
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,960
more energy

1217
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,920
i can't just like a candle burn myself

1218
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,880
out

1219
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,839
so i can't go unilaterally towards the

1220
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,319
conclusion i have to continue to bring

1221
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:15,280
up now and then oh i guess i'm getting

1222
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,319
closer to the end of my my energy cycle

1223
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,920
i have to now

1224
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,440
recapitulate

1225
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,319
and and bring myself back up to that

1226
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,400
place where i can continue to burn

1227
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,119
energy so that's what i'm why i'm saying

1228
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,720
i think if we want to look at this

1229
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,920
from the standpoint of of what

1230
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,359
what is actually using now and then

1231
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,480
versus

1232
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,599
what can continue to exist in it

1233
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,680
and i don't know if the word is entropic

1234
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,839
but a world of entropy

1235
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,440
that's one of those things that we could

1236
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,079
look at in terms of what free energy

1237
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,440
principle is asking us to

1238
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,319
incorporate in terms of a relationship

1239
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,480
not just not just the relationship

1240
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,839
between two

1241
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:05,520
objects in space but the amount of time

1242
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,760
that's incorporated in that relationship

1243
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,880
the now

1244
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,400
and the then

1245
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,400
i don't i'm not i'm not asking us to pin

1246
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,800
down what exactly that is i'm saying

1247
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,520
let's hold that up as as

1248
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,520
as either continuing or not

1249
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,359
so

1250
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:27,119
like i think that um

1251
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,319
iraq must have a past

1252
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,480
in order to exist

1253
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,599
in the now

1254
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,359
to you

1255
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,280
to you and your relationship with that

1256
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,760
rock

1257
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,640
well even for the rock

1258
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,240
to be

1259
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,200
itself it didn't just appear out of

1260
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,960
nowhere or did it maybe right yeah

1261
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,079
that's what i'm saying i don't think it

1262
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,240
has a cell because it doesn't have it

1263
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,160
then

1264
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,680
well so so perhaps

1265
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,400
what is necessary

1266
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,280
or

1267
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,960
what is necessary for something to be

1268
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,800
alive

1269
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,520
is a delta

1270
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,240
between now and then like a rock was a

1271
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,520
could have been a rock

1272
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,160
then in the past and could be a rock

1273
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,000
then in the future

1274
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,880
but but doesn't require any kind of

1275
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,599
delta between now and then like any kind

1276
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,440
of change at all in its structure

1277
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,040
although it does change right i mean

1278
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,480
like pieces of it fall off and it

1279
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,000
crumbles away and turns to dust et

1280
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,440
cetera entropy right yeah right right so

1281
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,680
i mean it does change over time but but

1282
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,319
it doesn't require that that

1283
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:39,280
change and so so perhaps that delta

1284
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,119
is one of the things like i need to be

1285
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,800
different now

1286
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,520
than i was in the past and i need to be

1287
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,280
different now than i'm going to be in

1288
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,839
the future in order to be alive maybe

1289
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,960
here's a a meme it made me think of

1290
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,920
eternal sunshine of the spotless mind

1291
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,160
it's like a book or whatever

1292
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,640
spot it's kind of like a particle

1293
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,200
we talk a lot about particular states

1294
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,920
so eternal sunshine of the

1295
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,920
partic

1296
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,440
particle-less mind

1297
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,440
like if you don't have a particular

1298
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,640
state

1299
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,640
which is the internal and the blanket

1300
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,920
states those are the particular states

1301
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,839
if you don't have the existence of a

1302
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,040
partition

1303
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,040
it's kind of eternal

1304
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,760
it's just like an empty field

1305
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,680
now that doesn't have to be a realist

1306
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,480
claim about like what was there before

1307
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,880
the big bang and or genesis 1

1308
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,760
it can just be like in the model

1309
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,160
before a partition

1310
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:44,160
and a time scale has been applied

1311
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,559
there was no distinctions

1312
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,880
but then once you engage a particular

1313
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,960
partitioning

1314
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,520
then if it is going to persist through

1315
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,599
model time and then maybe more

1316
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,319
speculatively through real time it does

1317
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,079
have to

1318
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,680
engage

1319
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,319
at least in looking like it's making

1320
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,400
adequate policy selection

1321
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,040
so one rock we're going to be scratching

1322
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,880
our heads over for a long time

1323
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,960
but then if we had a field of rocks

1324
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,119
some of them would be at and then there

1325
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,000
was like um one side of the

1326
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,680
rock field had some

1327
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,640
corrosive acid and one part didn't like

1328
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,760
the rocks that did take the policy to be

1329
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,280
on the other side

1330
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,599
those would be the ones

1331
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,040
that would look like they were

1332
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,040
persisting

1333
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,280
and so when we kind of zoom out to the

1334
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,520
population level which is also what

1335
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,640
happens at the end of this paper

1336
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,559
when we look at the population level of

1337
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,359
a similar type of entities

1338
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:52,240
then we start to see

1339
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:56,079
the strategies that lead to persistence

1340
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,640
versus the ones that don't

1341
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,760
so

1342
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,760
like when people think about the rock i

1343
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,480
don't know they rarely talk about other

1344
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,079
rocks and about differentiating which

1345
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,119
ones are more lifelike or less lifelike

1346
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:10,720
but rather when you only have one

1347
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,480
reference point you can't really have a

1348
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,559
delta dean

1349
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,559
yeah and that that's

1350
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,720
this is where i think we can we all of

1351
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,640
us that are looking at this free energy

1352
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,119
and active inference thing can actually

1353
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,280
see a difference between

1354
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,280
three rocks on the ground

1355
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,880
and a domain

1356
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,359
then now and then can be looked at two

1357
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,200
ways they were just three rocks on the

1358
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,160
ground

1359
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,720
and now they're stacked

1360
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,640
there's a now and then but that's

1361
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,000
different than the partition between

1362
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,839
us as living things

1363
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,760
and those things that have now be been

1364
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,240
reordered and that's what this paper is

1365
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,319
asking us to look at do we want to look

1366
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,200
only at the way that the rocks have been

1367
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,839
reordered or do we want to look at the

1368
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:59,359
now and then of our relationship

1369
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,720
to the rock

1370
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,800
if we can include both we get a

1371
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,079
completely different picture

1372
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,240
and of course we even used the rock

1373
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,359
example

1374
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,160
back in the day back in the dot zero

1375
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,040
yeah so here was sort of the two

1376
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,720
um life lines

1377
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,720
or trajectories because both the person

1378
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,000
and the rock

1379
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,480
got there there was how

1380
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,240
they got there or what it takes to get

1381
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,079
there for both

1382
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:28,800
so here is a restatement of the

1383
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,839
point of the paper which is our strange

1384
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,119
attractor the simple point i make in

1385
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,559
this paper is that the free energy

1386
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,240
principle is not concerned with the

1387
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,960
sufficient conditions of existence

1388
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,160
but rather

1389
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,760
with what must have been the case

1390
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,559
necessity given that you exist

1391
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,240
it's not about figuring out what it

1392
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,839
takes to be alive

1393
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:49,760
it's about figuring out what took you

1394
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,720
there

1395
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,960
so here's the lifeline of another system

1396
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,480
and um schrodinger's question at least

1397
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,839
as it's framed

1398
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:00,000
is kind of like asking you know give me

1399
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,400
the binary is it alive or not

1400
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,640
but that is

1401
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,319
predicated on

1402
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:11,119
us thinking we're alive

1403
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:12,800
i think that's fair to say it's not

1404
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,880
stated in there that humans are alive

1405
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,400
and that's my reference point or i'm

1406
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,079
alive or the writer of this article is

1407
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,920
alive but

1408
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,040
that

1409
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,359
is a very different question so figuring

1410
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:26,559
out what took you there

1411
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:27,920
is a different question than asking

1412
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,359
whether the past and the present the

1413
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,119
future of the rock

1414
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:32,559
is alive

1415
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:33,599
now

1416
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,480
both entities to exist

1417
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,720
in a dissipative world

1418
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,040
will have done something like minimized

1419
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,040
free energy

1420
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,160
whether with respect to a complex

1421
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,720
boundary condition and a complex policy

1422
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,720
space like a human

1423
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,520
or

1424
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,960
a simpler

1425
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,119
boundary condition and potentially a

1426
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:57,520
negligible afford in space

1427
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,160
like a rock

1428
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,440
like it's almost like

1429
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,880
people talk about where the rocks are

1430
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,400
alive but then are we alive

1431
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,559
and we should have a little bit of an

1432
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:14,640
answer there or what is alive

1433
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:18,559
what scale are we alive at

1434
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,319
so can i add to that daniel so if we

1435
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:23,200
look at some lots and lots of those

1436
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,160
those figures and we see t

1437
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,720
and then we see t plus one and then we

1438
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,440
see t plus two we can look at that two

1439
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,359
different ways now

1440
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:34,640
those are then

1441
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,200
and then and then

1442
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,280
in a linear way

1443
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,599
or we can look at it as

1444
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:45,359
then as an in relationship to now

1445
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,119
and again that's what i think axel is

1446
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:50,400
asking us to contemplate is both

1447
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,079
if we look at it simply as then and then

1448
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:53,760
and then and then

1449
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,920
i could be a rock

1450
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,680
but if i'm now

1451
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,760
relating it to some other time point

1452
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,119
that's when

1453
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,359
whatever whatever else free energy

1454
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:08,720
principle speaks to it says it isn't

1455
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,680
just

1456
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,880
another point on a continuum

1457
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,880
it's in a relationship with something

1458
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,160
else

1459
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,680
and i think that's what makes it really

1460
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,400
interesting in terms of the entanglement

1461
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,040
question what's necessary and what's

1462
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,119
sufficient

1463
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,799
because you can actually look at it as

1464
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:29,839
as another point on a continuum

1465
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:33,359
and it actually kicks out as sufficient

1466
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:35,280
but if you look at it as it a

1467
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,480
relationship

1468
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,400
to for example now

1469
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,799
it becomes necessary and that's the i

1470
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,520
think

1471
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,720
without

1472
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,160
going too far off on the tangent that's

1473
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,119
kind of

1474
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:46,960
where it gets really interesting it's

1475
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,520
how you are looking at it because

1476
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,200
there's a you

1477
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,799
asking how did i get here

1478
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,599
so i modified the slide a little bit

1479
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:00,480
now the living

1480
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,400
red line creature so we're just gonna

1481
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,280
say

1482
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,880
alive like me

1483
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,680
that's the kind of one that matters

1484
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,520
in the sense that it has a

1485
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,880
quasi-crystalline aperiodic information

1486
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,040
structure and it's negantropic those are

1487
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,400
the two answers that schrodinger

1488
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,240
provides in

1489
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,040
1944 what is life

1490
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:21,839
and

1491
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:23,599
we just can't ignore

1492
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,119
this

1493
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,119
this is where

1494
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:28,079
we're

1495
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,559
looking through our lens and our

1496
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,720
perspective on the system

1497
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,000
so it's not like we get a sort of

1498
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,960
um

1499
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,559
transparent look

1500
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:41,599
at or an objective or a

1501
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,640
monolithic look at the rock it's through

1502
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,400
our perception of the past present

1503
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,079
future of the rock

1504
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:50,000
and that's where like the specific time

1505
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,240
scale that we choose to model it at

1506
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,119
because over if you speed up the rock

1507
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:56,480
it's just going to be burning like the

1508
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,599
candle

1509
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,760
now maybe that takes like millions of

1510
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,440
years just in

1511
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,680
as the surface reacts with oxygen and

1512
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,000
gets oxidized but isn't the candle

1513
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,280
oxidizing

1514
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,799
and then weren't we just talking about

1515
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:11,119
how we were oxidizing

1516
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:12,880
and then maybe the special part of our

1517
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,160
systems

1518
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,240
is that we're doing like

1519
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,400
this or something

1520
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,160
something like that like

1521
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,680
we're

1522
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,480
back casting

1523
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,480
with our metacognitive model

1524
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,240
how we got here

1525
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,640
well it's been this many years well

1526
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,000
since what

1527
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:34,960
since

1528
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,240
the hospital signed your birth

1529
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,359
certificate

1530
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:40,319
or since you were conceived as a zygote

1531
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:42,640
or conceived as an idea

1532
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,640
or what exactly

1533
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,520
is

1534
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,839
that starting point and i think that's

1535
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,760
kind of why the starting point here is

1536
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:50,799
just

1537
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:52,240
off the edge

1538
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,520
because again

1539
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,240
we may never know what is sufficient and

1540
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,040
sufficiency may include everything

1541
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,079
but when we talk about necessity

1542
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,839
we can actually do

1543
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:05,839
counter factuals we can do loss of

1544
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:07,440
function experiments

1545
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,720
necessity can be explored

1546
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,960
for complex systems in a way that

1547
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,880
sufficiency

1548
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,760
may never suffice

1549
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:20,000
blue

1550
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:20,720
so

1551
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,240
like you were talking about since you

1552
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,119
were

1553
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:25,920
you know born conceived since you were

1554
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,480
an idea but what about like since you

1555
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,280
were recycled from like previously

1556
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,079
existing organic matter like like

1557
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,400
i mean literally we are all stardust

1558
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,079
right so

1559
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:39,760
like there's

1560
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,880
somehow

1561
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,880
some kind of partition

1562
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,480
gets created

1563
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,559
around us like

1564
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:49,200
at conception at birth at when right

1565
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,400
like so this whole

1566
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,599
temporal

1567
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:52,720
um

1568
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,960
thing is is very interesting and it's

1569
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,319
like um

1570
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:57,440
you know

1571
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,760
would you exist could you exist without

1572
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,400
a mother or a father or someone to care

1573
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,280
for you as an infant like no um but i

1574
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,880
mean and that that distinction is um

1575
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,720
very different for different life forms

1576
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,559
like bacterium they don't need any care

1577
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:14,960
um they just but but is perhaps like the

1578
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,520
reproduction like the act of even binary

1579
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,440
vision is that sufficient

1580
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,000
care you know like what does that that

1581
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,119
relationship um look like in life and in

1582
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:26,640
aliveness and

1583
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,319
um you know we talk about like one of

1584
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,079
the necessary

1585
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:32,720
um qualities of of life or or you know i

1586
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,559
mean i'm not sure we can look at if have

1587
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:36,880
they changed but like the ability to to

1588
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,280
reproduce oneself is one of the the

1589
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,119
necessary um

1590
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,319
qualities for for being alive and um

1591
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:45,680
you know

1592
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,359
lots of things we produce that are not

1593
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:49,839
considered alive like i mean lots of

1594
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:54,079
things so um viruses nanobots uh you

1595
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:55,440
know

1596
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,280
i don't know it's interesting sorry i'm

1597
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,920
like off on a random tangent yeah thanks

1598
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,240
blue dean

1599
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,240
blue i don't really think that's

1600
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,640
that's tangential i think

1601
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,839
without without collapsing to like

1602
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:12,400
first year philosophy classes

1603
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,720
the fact that we can hold up two things

1604
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,000
as important

1605
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,839
one of the things that's important is

1606
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:19,680
which came first

1607
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,319
we spend a lot of time trying to figure

1608
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,960
out order through that lens

1609
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,720
the second lens is

1610
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,599
there's a there's a here and now and a

1611
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:30,640
then

1612
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,680
it doesn't matter which came first it's

1613
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,480
just that we understand that the two

1614
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,480
things are different

1615
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,880
that's the second lens open

1616
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,920
they don't they don't play well together

1617
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,680
because the the one that wants to figure

1618
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,079
out the order is literally trying to

1619
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:49,440
find a source

1620
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,839
the other is just saying we're not going

1621
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,000
to collapse to one we're going to hold

1622
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,880
up two things as long as we possibly can

1623
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,040
they're bad playmates we shouldn't put

1624
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,640
them on a play date because they're

1625
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,079
inevitably going to fight with one

1626
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:06,240
another but if we have both of our eyes

1627
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,359
open

1628
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:09,359
what does that say then about us being

1629
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:11,680
able to get a better

1630
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,799
grip so that we can let go

1631
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:17,680
when free energy principle is included

1632
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,240
or incorporated in these

1633
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,960
these sloped moments because i think

1634
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,599
it's the two the figuring out which came

1635
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,680
first and

1636
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,000
here's the relationship between the two

1637
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,559
it's not one matters more than the other

1638
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:35,440
that creates the actual slope

1639
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,040
that's where as i said i don't want to

1640
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,880
turn it into a philosophy course but i

1641
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,359
don't think that's a tangent i think

1642
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:44,319
that's what we're trying to reconcile

1643
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,559
because we called it attention

1644
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,079
we can call it a

1645
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,000
you know they don't they don't play well

1646
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,319
together whatever but the bottom line is

1647
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:54,319
is that as long as we understand

1648
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:57,119
there are multiple arrows

1649
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,520
sometimes we can break them up as then

1650
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,839
and then and then and then and then

1651
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:03,520
and sometimes it's about the now and

1652
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,480
then

1653
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,880
and i think that's the part that for

1654
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,799
for most of the stuff that we've seen in

1655
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:11,200
terms of how it's represented it's as

1656
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,839
daniel pointed out it's that spontaneity

1657
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:15,680
of partition part

1658
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,079
that we have to also include and if we

1659
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:19,760
do

1660
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,520
doesn't make it any easier they still

1661
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,960
don't get along

1662
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,200
but at least it tells us

1663
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,880
what's what

1664
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,359
what might be at play

1665
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:31,440
that's why i keep coming back to play

1666
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,000
it's uncertain who's going to win out in

1667
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,280
any particular moment

1668
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:39,200
well i think like while we're discussing

1669
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,520
when i think when was the partition

1670
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,079
created it is

1671
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,559
is important and like you know i mean in

1672
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:48,079
something like binary fission it's

1673
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:49,760
pretty easy to see

1674
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,400
you know like when the two you know

1675
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,119
cells separate and become you know by a

1676
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:57,680
certain distance by any distance that's

1677
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,680
that's when you know the partition is is

1678
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,680
made and perhaps that's true for all of

1679
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,559
the

1680
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:05,280
the reproducing things or or perhaps not

1681
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,200
i mean i don't know like the chicken is

1682
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,799
separate from the egg

1683
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,240
right going back to the chicken and the

1684
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,400
egg but they separate very early so like

1685
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,680
the the

1686
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,839
you know maybe the separation physical

1687
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:18,799
separation isn't sufficient um like at

1688
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:20,000
that moment you don't have your own

1689
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,799
partition because the the baby chick or

1690
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,880
the egg could not fully develop without

1691
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,440
the mother chicken sitting on it even

1692
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,280
though they're physically separated so

1693
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,520
so it's this really sticky

1694
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,079
situation like where when is the

1695
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:36,319
partition made that makes

1696
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:38,319
someone an individual and that's why i

1697
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:39,839
always go back to that david crack power

1698
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:42,079
paper like when there's a bi-directional

1699
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,559
information flow

1700
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:46,559
upward and downward and that that's like

1701
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,480
what makes you um

1702
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,039
an individual and so like

1703
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,119
i don't know that um

1704
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,839
an egg a developing egg has

1705
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:58,880
that bi-directional information flow

1706
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,359
yet like maybe there's no downward

1707
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:03,440
causation in the egg there's no ability

1708
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,359
for the egg to act on its own other than

1709
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:08,000
do anything except develop like the

1710
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,640
capability for action or like the the

1711
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,400
downward causation like an egg is still

1712
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,240
in this emerging it's still going

1713
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,559
through emergence but you have to have

1714
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:18,960
both like you know emergence and

1715
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,760
downward causation for for individuality

1716
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,880
to exist i always go back to that so so

1717
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:27,760
i don't know in a rock is there

1718
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,599
downward causation

1719
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,680
or emergence like either one of those

1720
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,559
things do those exist and so that really

1721
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,480
that paper like just nailed it for me

1722
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,559
for for what um

1723
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:39,520
you know i don't know that it's

1724
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,520
necessarily the answer to schrodinger's

1725
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:42,559
question

1726
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:44,400
but i think um

1727
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,039
it does a good job of getting us

1728
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:48,960
somewhere

1729
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,440
and i completely agree and and

1730
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,799
i guess what i'm suggesting is

1731
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:55,280
entanglement is a feature

1732
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,000
not a flaw and and we can enter and in

1733
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,799
that entanglement feature set

1734
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:02,160
we can look at

1735
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,599
order

1736
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:06,000
right and which came first and we can

1737
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,680
look at relation

1738
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,280
and so

1739
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,960
i know that if if there was an

1740
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,599
entanglement even though it's it's it's

1741
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,520
multiple light years away that

1742
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,839
entanglement tells me what the spin

1743
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:20,960
is and it's not the same direction

1744
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,799
there it's it's an opposite it's a

1745
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:25,920
polarness right so

1746
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,079
i agree with you

1747
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:31,359
and i think that's the feature here

1748
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:34,480
the feature here isn't we have to we can

1749
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,480
only do one or the other

1750
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,039
it the reason why we're even speaking to

1751
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:41,359
this is because it has to be both

1752
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:44,319
in order for that slope

1753
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:45,760
to eventually

1754
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,799
model out like i'm a big fan of model at

1755
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,640
the end i think that's way more

1756
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,960
sophisticated because i'm prepared to

1757
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,079
let the order and the relationship

1758
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:58,640
hang for a while breathe a bit do some

1759
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,000
back and forth

1760
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
scrap ufc

1761
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,559
punch one another and then

1762
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:06,559
i i get my model at the end now i

1763
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:08,720
understand why model at the beginning

1764
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,880
but i don't think that's the only way to

1765
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:11,680
go

1766
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,559
i think if we can do model at the end

1767
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:15,520
that's

1768
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,920
even more sophisticated because we have

1769
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:18,720
now

1770
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,480
included more

1771
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,000
it's complexity in play

1772
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,119
let's return to now

1773
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:28,799
v3

1774
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:30,559
of our

1775
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:31,760
figure

1776
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:32,720
so

1777
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,480
these the colors are subject to change

1778
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,480
all right but red is realism

1779
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,960
blue is instrumentalism our favorite

1780
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,039
statistical instrument is

1781
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,480
the actin

1782
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,039
process theory which is a corollary of

1783
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:47,119
more axiomatic

1784
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:49,119
more general less applied free energy

1785
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:50,240
principle

1786
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,319
and then this is another system and the

1787
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:54,880
system of interest in this paper was a

1788
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,400
bacterium

1789
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,839
so

1790
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,839
whether were structural realists or

1791
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:01,440
pretty much any stance other than the

1792
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,319
most

1793
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:04,559
hardcore denialism

1794
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:07,119
we exist like if we're not alive then

1795
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:09,839
what is the conversation to be had

1796
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:12,319
but when we ask how did i get here which

1797
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:14,880
is really happening or when we look at

1798
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,640
another system that's also really

1799
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,280
happening those are real events

1800
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,319
but both the reflexive question

1801
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:23,559
and the

1802
01:07:23,559 --> 01:07:25,200
exteroceptive

1803
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,280
scientific modeling question

1804
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,760
are going to get filtered through

1805
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,760
instrumentalism

1806
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,240
i don't know if there's some way out of

1807
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,359
that

1808
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:36,559
it's kind of like the difference between

1809
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,400
saying well you can escape plato's cave

1810
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,079
but then can you escape like using your

1811
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:41,119
eyes

1812
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:42,880
or using your generative model it's like

1813
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,400
a whole nother

1814
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,400
level of cave

1815
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,599
and then

1816
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:48,799
we have

1817
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:50,160
like

1818
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,920
active and the free energy principle

1819
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,839
this classic figure

1820
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:55,760
organism and the environment

1821
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,880
and then that is shown in the case of a

1822
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,160
brain

1823
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,880
as well as in a bacillus

1824
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,359
that particular partitioning

1825
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:06,880
about how we can think about the

1826
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,119
perception cognition in action and

1827
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:13,200
impact of autonomous systems

1828
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,640
once you're past

1829
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,640
the veil

1830
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,560
you're all within your instrumental

1831
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,520
model

1832
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,880
so that's where the question like well

1833
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,960
what were those priors

1834
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,679
in my bayesian bacterium and then the

1835
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:28,080
future is unknown because we can say

1836
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,479
well in my model the bacteria is

1837
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:32,880
minimizing free energy or i'm talking

1838
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,799
about this bacterium and i think

1839
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:36,560
physical systems minimize free energy

1840
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,158
it's a physical system so i think it's

1841
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:40,238
going to minimize free energy but as we

1842
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:41,359
established

1843
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:42,719
in this paper

1844
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,158
free energy minimization isn't

1845
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:45,679
sufficient to be alive it's not

1846
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:47,439
sufficient to persist because the candle

1847
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:49,679
is minimizing free energy too

1848
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:52,560
so we don't know just because it has

1849
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,198
existed and is minimizing free energy

1850
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:57,279
that it will exist in the future so

1851
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:59,359
that's kind of the unknown

1852
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:01,479
and then once we're

1853
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:03,359
post-partitioned

1854
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:07,439
we're all in the instrumentalism world

1855
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:08,640
so

1856
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,080
even the framing of what is life

1857
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:15,040
it's an implicit realist

1858
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,719
playing field

1859
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:19,439
versus how do we model life

1860
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:20,399
and then

1861
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:22,560
the answers that schrodinger provides

1862
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,799
look for the information rich according

1863
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:27,279
to your information theory quasi crystal

1864
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:28,319
structure

1865
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:31,439
or look for using your thermometers and

1866
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:33,120
your heat sensors

1867
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,880
look for systems that appear to be

1868
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,359
locally creating order but then creating

1869
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:39,520
disorder surrounding them

1870
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,120
i don't know if anyone really denies

1871
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,839
that those are good ways to study life

1872
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:45,839
or that those are

1873
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:48,799
heuristics that can be applied it's just

1874
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:51,839
like saying well your instrumentalism

1875
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:55,040
doesn't align with my realism

1876
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,159
okay

1877
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:58,159
but what is your realism and who told

1878
01:09:58,159 --> 01:09:59,760
you about it and how did you find out

1879
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,040
about it what are you gonna do about it

1880
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,320
what instrument are you going to use to

1881
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,640
investigate it

1882
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:05,600
so

1883
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,920
it's interesting how the paper

1884
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,280
shines a light

1885
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:12,080
on how the entailment problem is really

1886
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,920
linked to some of the biggest themes

1887
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,760
that we talked about this year

1888
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,920
with realism and instrumentalism

1889
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,080
because again the

1890
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,480
entailment problem runs through and

1891
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,719
through

1892
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:26,400
what do you think dean

1893
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,080
yeah i would say

1894
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,400
that nails it because if you want to

1895
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,679
look at it as

1896
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,520
which is more important realism or

1897
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,840
instrumentalism fine but if you're

1898
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,920
looking at the relationship

1899
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,120
between

1900
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,040
realism and instrumentalism and how they

1901
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,320
relate to

1902
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,800
that's going to make a fuller picture it

1903
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,199
doesn't necessarily make it a cleaner

1904
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:49,280
simpler picture in fact it makes a

1905
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:52,719
messier more complex picture

1906
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:54,800
oh well sorry

1907
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,640
there's a relationship between those two

1908
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,120
things get over it grow up

1909
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,000
time to grow a nice long white beard and

1910
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,320
and smile because guess what it ain't

1911
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,640
going away just because it's more

1912
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,360
complicated

1913
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,640
so i have a problem with like

1914
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,880
i don't know realism overall because

1915
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,880
like what is even real

1916
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,000
like i

1917
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,159
view the brain as just an instrument

1918
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:23,840
through which we you know act and infer

1919
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,320
like this is this is it and every living

1920
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:29,199
system in my mind has like this

1921
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:31,920
um you know kind of computational input

1922
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,320
output that they use but but it's an

1923
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,880
instrument that they use and like the

1924
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:41,040
idea of realism is very um icky to me

1925
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,000
because

1926
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,159
it's so subjective like what is even

1927
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:47,199
real i just don't i can't buy into the

1928
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:49,679
notion of some kind of shared reality

1929
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:51,280
for anyone we all have different

1930
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,120
affordances different preferences like i

1931
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,600
don't even know if i see the same color

1932
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,320
when i see yellow that daniel sees or

1933
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,920
dean sees like well you know how i

1934
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,600
perceive yellow can be totally different

1935
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,440
from how you perceive yellow and and

1936
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,040
that's why we all have different colors

1937
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,320
like favorite colors right with

1938
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,440
different colors that we like more and

1939
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,400
like less

1940
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,320
so you know i mean and people are color

1941
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,840
blind and so we know that it's just not

1942
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,440
that way so

1943
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,719
i don't know

1944
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:17,520
like it's all instrumentalism in my

1945
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,719
like

1946
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:21,040
world like we're instruments

1947
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,840
i don't know

1948
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,480
i think it returns to the unifying

1949
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,199
approach versus unified theory

1950
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:33,120
we've been really

1951
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,840
mired in the

1952
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:38,560
mix-up of realism and instrumentalism

1953
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,480
and it sometimes is very

1954
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,920
slippery

1955
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,080
like how things are

1956
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,440
but then that's the twist with the

1957
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:48,400
theory of everything

1958
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,640
and all the free energy principle for a

1959
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,120
particular physics and all of that it

1960
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,880
uses

1961
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,080
sometimes even some of the same

1962
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,960
terms like thing

1963
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,239
but then

1964
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:07,199
by thing within the act infontology

1965
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:09,920
we might be referring

1966
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,040
to this

1967
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,960
particular thing

1968
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,760
so the blanket and the internal states

1969
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:19,520
and this particular thing is a cognitive

1970
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,520
model of

1971
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:24,000
and then could we have a model of those

1972
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,679
kinds of things

1973
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:27,199
maybe

1974
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:30,000
but could we have a model of

1975
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:30,960
the

1976
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,560
real things or would this always be

1977
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,719
a sort of blurry discussion because

1978
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:38,480
everybody would be

1979
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,640
talking about their model anyway and

1980
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,120
it's also a lot like um

1981
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,960
the layers that existed

1982
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,120
in 32

1983
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,080
which we'll return to in two days

1984
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,800
where there was the lorenz system that's

1985
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,400
like the realist

1986
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,080
system now it's one that we defined but

1987
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,080
it's really that way the time evolution

1988
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,239
of the lorenz system truly is defined by

1989
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:02,800
those equations that were granted to it

1990
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,360
so that's sort of the realism claim and

1991
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,920
then there was a first and a second

1992
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:11,040
order approximation to it

1993
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,840
which are also

1994
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:17,120
things but they got cleaner and cleaner

1995
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,600
and more tractable

1996
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:23,239
as we instrumentalized

1997
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:26,159
the thing we were looking at

1998
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:27,520
and then

1999
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,000
the question is always well how much of

2000
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,600
the attributes

2001
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,760
of the real system

2002
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,960
does the instrument retain

2003
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,400
do we retain

2004
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,159
false positives like kind of things

2005
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:43,280
about the territory that end up not

2006
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,199
helping our map

2007
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:46,800
do we have false negatives like we

2008
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,719
simplified the map a ton but we ended up

2009
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:50,159
missing

2010
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:51,760
really important features of the

2011
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:52,880
territory

2012
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,600
and if the territories are complex as we

2013
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,920
suspect they are to have persisted this

2014
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,640
way in a negentropic world

2015
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,960
well if they're complex

2016
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,159
then

2017
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:05,440
how will we

2018
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,960
thread the needle

2019
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,520
with the appropriate coarse grainings

2020
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,440
as not to include false positives and

2021
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,920
false negatives in our map

2022
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,840
because just having the full description

2023
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:19,679
of the system is not going to be useful

2024
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,360
and then

2025
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,280
anything simpler

2026
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:26,640
we're going to be at super risk of

2027
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,679
dropping features that matter

2028
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:32,560
and so 32 showed that it was possible

2029
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,320
just at the mathematical level for

2030
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:38,480
example to make an approximatable

2031
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,560
laplacian

2032
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,640
approximation so tractable laplacian

2033
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,159
approximation

2034
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:46,159
but still retain

2035
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:48,239
the lyapunov exponent characteristic of

2036
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:49,840
a chaotic system

2037
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,600
so we we

2038
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:55,280
abstracted or we made approximations too

2039
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,120
but we still retained one of the

2040
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,159
essential features of

2041
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:01,040
and so

2042
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,159
maybe

2043
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:03,920
it's going to be harder to do that to a

2044
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,560
bacterium than a lorenz system because

2045
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,320
the reality of the loren system is just

2046
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,000
numbers whereas the reality of bacteria

2047
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,320
is something probably different

2048
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:15,920
but it's a similar kind of question

2049
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:16,800
and

2050
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,560
maybe we have some of the early versions

2051
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,120
of the tools that we would at least want

2052
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:24,800
to have in the future dean

2053
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,120
yeah and i'm not defending either

2054
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:31,040
realism or instrumentalism but i think

2055
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:33,440
in this paper and that paper which we're

2056
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,199
going to go back to

2057
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:38,640
if we if we use real or realism

2058
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,719
what they both point to is we can get it

2059
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:42,320
really right

2060
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:46,239
or we can get it really wrong or some

2061
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:49,600
degree of that i think that's where

2062
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:50,960
realism

2063
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,920
as a as a concept comes in it's not an

2064
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,120
absolute

2065
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,280
it's not a truth

2066
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,520
it's the variable

2067
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,320
as opposed to the instrument the

2068
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,239
instruments is trying to find out the

2069
01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:05,440
precision

2070
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:08,800
and reality is about imprecision

2071
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,040
so again it's the relationship between

2072
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,880
those two things i'm not looking at

2073
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:16,159
realism in the classic definition of how

2074
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,679
other people see it

2075
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:19,120
i'm comparing it

2076
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,960
to the instrument which is trying to

2077
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,960
gain the precise

2078
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:26,239
and then so so what's the not precise

2079
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:27,840
okay i'll just i'll just throw that

2080
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,719
under realism for now that's how i

2081
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:33,199
square it

2082
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,840
so so dean we're on the same page then

2083
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:38,640
because like accuracy is relevant

2084
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,480
yeah exactly

2085
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,640
exactly so i i don't think you and i are

2086
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,199
apart or even remotely

2087
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:47,120
you know distant

2088
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,320
but it's how you see that relationship

2089
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,960
if you if you frame it one way something

2090
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,960
kicks out and if you frame it a

2091
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,560
different way something else kicks out

2092
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,239
and i'm not going to tell people who

2093
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:00,080
frame it the other way that they're

2094
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,679
wrong

2095
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:03,199
they're relatively

2096
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:05,840
safe in in their frame but it's got to

2097
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,120
be two frames

2098
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,840
at minimum otherwise

2099
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:13,320
we're we're lost

2100
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:16,560
we're a stone

2101
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:17,760
per se

2102
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,000
we're just going along for the ride

2103
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,800
and i don't know that that's

2104
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:26,400
i don't know that that's fair to stones

2105
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,640
well i don't know that we have any other

2106
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,719
choice but to go along for the ride

2107
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:32,239
honestly i mean

2108
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:32,960
like

2109
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,800
and this goes back to you know the

2110
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,400
discussions that i've had about free

2111
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,800
will and um i discussed this with mike

2112
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,440
levin and i i mean really like you know

2113
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,880
if if we are just the sum of our

2114
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,800
generative model like if that if we

2115
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,719
that's just us we have no choice but to

2116
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:51,120
act accordingly

2117
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:55,280
unfortunately or or fortunately for us

2118
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,280
blue how's your i just the confusion's

2119
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,360
built in sorry i just wanted to say i

2120
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,440
think the confusion is built in i think

2121
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:04,880
the uncertainty part of this is built in

2122
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,440
we know that we're eventually our demise

2123
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,800
is near we just don't know when

2124
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,480
right and that's why i keep coming back

2125
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,960
to the where where did how did i get

2126
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,920
here is essentially asking

2127
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,040
when

2128
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,120
and that goes back to way back when we

2129
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,440
were talking about people with um

2130
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,760
alzheimer's and in the hippocampus

2131
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,719
integrating where and when

2132
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:31,600
yeah and the the grid cells and the

2133
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,520
mirror neurons and

2134
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,600
all kinds of ideas

2135
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,840
that people have frames

2136
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,159
that are

2137
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:42,159
instrumental

2138
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:43,440
takes

2139
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,040
that blur the line because they're about

2140
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:47,440
real systems but then

2141
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:48,960
we can

2142
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,199
bring a little bit of an actin flavor to

2143
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:51,920
it

2144
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:52,719
so

2145
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:53,679
just

2146
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:56,320
i have one note then a question

2147
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:57,440
so here

2148
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,000
here's the red living system now it's

2149
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,880
shrunk and turned into an image

2150
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,400
and then here's here's the orange person

2151
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,199
studying bacteria

2152
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:11,679
so now it's like the blue and the orange

2153
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:13,199
person

2154
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:16,159
they can be having a conversation

2155
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:18,159
through the scientific literature or on

2156
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:19,760
a live stream

2157
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,760
or whatever like this is where we start

2158
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,120
to go from that

2159
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:26,000
rock is it alive or not to here's a

2160
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,760
population of rocks

2161
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,360
which ones are

2162
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:32,000
succeeding at being lifelike versus

2163
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,800
failing in terms of their dissipation

2164
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,400
so now here we have

2165
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,719
a minimum two people looking at the

2166
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:40,679
bacillus each with their own

2167
01:20:40,679 --> 01:20:43,120
autoreflexive timelines and maybe the

2168
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,840
orange person

2169
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,920
doesn't like active

2170
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,760
that's fine they're using some other

2171
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,080
framework but they're not breaking out

2172
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,920
of the instrumentalism

2173
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:54,880
trap

2174
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,800
they're just doing some other

2175
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:57,920
instrument

2176
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,600
and then they're looking at the bacteria

2177
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,000
through their lens

2178
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,520
and then there's a conversation to be

2179
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,040
had

2180
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:07,520
but it's almost like the more layers the

2181
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:10,960
more super systems you add here

2182
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,600
it starts to be like

2183
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,520
i don't know less and less about the

2184
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,880
bacteria

2185
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,800
and oh well in your culture you were

2186
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,800
raised to think this way about this kind

2187
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,280
of scale or this kind of system and

2188
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:26,560
this is an interesting conversation

2189
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:29,520
but it's still nucleated around that

2190
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,159
bacteria and the model

2191
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:34,400
and then blue my question for you was

2192
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:35,920
over 21

2193
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,120
how has your

2194
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:41,480
feelings on free will changed

2195
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,159
um

2196
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:47,520
so like you know after i i'd say like

2197
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:51,120
the real the real um

2198
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,400
like mindset change shift happens more

2199
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:58,480
like at 25. um at least for me

2200
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,199
but um i don't know like you know i

2201
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:03,440
think that the whole experience of being

2202
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:06,480
a teenager is like identity seeking and

2203
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:07,360
like

2204
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:09,120
putting yourself under the illusion that

2205
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,679
you have free will or you have like such

2206
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:13,840
a desire to have free will that that

2207
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,679
there's um

2208
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:17,920
i i mean like that's what it is to be a

2209
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,199
teenager is like you go through this

2210
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:20,639
like identity crisis and then you

2211
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:22,560
liberate from the parents right

2212
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,400
and so i think that there's that like i

2213
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,080
definitely experienced that if that's

2214
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:29,040
what you're asking

2215
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,840
she already underwent the phase

2216
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,000
transition

2217
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:34,800
yeah

2218
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,520
yeah i mean the phase like i already

2219
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,760
yeah i think um

2220
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,159
you know as teenagers we have like this

2221
01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:45,280
illusion of and desire for freedom

2222
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,120
that is um

2223
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,000
like

2224
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,920
what we're supposed to have and feel at

2225
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,400
that at that phase in life

2226
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,719
in order to break free and and maybe the

2227
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:56,639
age is irrelevant i mean maybe in some

2228
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,320
ancient prehistoric cultures they felt

2229
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:59,520
that at 10.

2230
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:00,560
but the

2231
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,800
the point is is that the desire to you

2232
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,600
know

2233
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:04,480
um

2234
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,560
is it physical separation or or to

2235
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:07,840
solidify

2236
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,400
your own partition right like um the

2237
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:13,280
desire to be your own independent person

2238
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,040
so i think like i i

2239
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,880
thought that you know freedom and free

2240
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:17,920
will

2241
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,520
existed at that point and now like um

2242
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,679
i mean i feel like we're

2243
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:27,679
essentially enslaved by our generative

2244
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:30,000
model we're enslaved by the past and the

2245
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,040
future in the now

2246
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:36,719
i think that takes us to one of the last

2247
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:38,000
prepared

2248
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,120
questions we had

2249
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:42,639
one of the key words of the paper was

2250
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:44,880
historical science

2251
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,400
and

2252
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,719
we talked in the dot zero

2253
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:50,159
about how

2254
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:52,880
there's all these historical sciences

2255
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,239
you won't see

2256
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:56,320
chemistry biology

2257
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,159
physics not those

2258
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:00,080
stem

2259
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,280
sciences

2260
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,600
but history

2261
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,360
and then all these other

2262
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:07,199
sciences

2263
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:09,199
that draw data from records of past

2264
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:10,400
events

2265
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:11,840
as opposed to experimental or

2266
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,080
operational science but asked it then

2267
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:17,120
and asked it now aren't experiments in

2268
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,239
the past

2269
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:20,080
i don't see how

2270
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:23,199
merely having hypothesized and planned

2271
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:25,040
and then

2272
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:27,199
acquired data

2273
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:28,880
when you're analyzing it it becomes in

2274
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,400
the past

2275
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,239
so somebody who's studying heraldry

2276
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:34,719
could hypothesize oh in this library on

2277
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:36,159
this shelf in this book i might find

2278
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:38,159
something important and i'll analyze it

2279
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:39,040
then

2280
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,679
and then that data is in their past

2281
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:42,560
so

2282
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,719
the historical sciences are

2283
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:46,239
contrasted with

2284
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:48,320
maybe what we could call the

2285
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,560
future sciences so not like the future

2286
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,880
of science which we hope is awesome and

2287
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:55,440
participatory and accessible and whatnot

2288
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:58,480
but science is about the future

2289
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,159
which range from

2290
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:02,400
the sort of speculative

2291
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,560
and almost metaphysical

2292
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,639
to the extremely

2293
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:08,639
applied

2294
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:10,960
where do we sit now

2295
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,080
with historical and anticipatory or

2296
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:17,440
future oriented sciences in the now

2297
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,759
dean

2298
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,040
so i'd like to try and take a a first

2299
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,239
stab at that

2300
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:25,920
let's and let's use it let's use the

2301
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,159
free will question

2302
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:31,920
if we looked at it historically as

2303
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,440
bring out the scrolls this is what

2304
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,840
happened or we look into the future and

2305
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:36,719
say

2306
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:37,760
oh

2307
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,840
this this person's thought a lot about

2308
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,840
what's going to happen tomorrow let's

2309
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,400
build the scroll for tomorrow

2310
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,480
that's one way of looking at the

2311
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:49,840
question of what is free and will

2312
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:52,400
if we look at as a relationship we could

2313
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:53,679
look at it as

2314
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:55,440
free will or

2315
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:59,280
follow will meaning i can't break free

2316
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:02,560
i'm i'm entrapped or whatever

2317
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,159
and then what we could do is we look at

2318
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,679
the relationship

2319
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:07,120
as an ongoing

2320
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:11,199
an ongoing exercise between free and

2321
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:14,080
follow now neither

2322
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,920
neither the free or follow are going to

2323
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:20,719
fall neatly and tidally into a scroll

2324
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:22,960
but they have a relationship

2325
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:25,600
whether we scroll it out

2326
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:28,320
as a historical thing or we scroll it

2327
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,800
into as a projecting thing

2328
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,920
but the ability to do both not just

2329
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,679
examine free will as a linear

2330
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:39,040
question

2331
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:40,800
but also

2332
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,840
be able to relate it to so what's

2333
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:47,199
what is non-free will it's like

2334
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:48,800
will follow

2335
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:51,120
and then now compare the follow and the

2336
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:52,400
free

2337
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,520
give it kicks out a different model

2338
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,639
the one that's one that's messier

2339
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:01,120
one that's up for debate

2340
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,600
and i think putting putting both of them

2341
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,960
up on the shelf and examining both is to

2342
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,239
look at

2343
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:09,760
philosophy

2344
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:12,400
essentially

2345
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:14,880
so

2346
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,360
i think that i i recently just learned

2347
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:19,840
that futurology is a science

2348
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:23,040
um which which was super fascinating to

2349
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,159
me um

2350
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:26,560
like the study of of predictive methods

2351
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:27,840
right

2352
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:28,960
um

2353
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,520
and there's so many ways that that we

2354
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,600
you know have used to predict but um

2355
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,600
something that i thought was was really

2356
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,880
really interesting was um

2357
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:39,679
they

2358
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:41,600
used to before the internet was like

2359
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,080
trolled by bots you used to be able to

2360
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:46,560
take like message boards and chat boards

2361
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,400
and like you know essentially twitter

2362
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:51,840
streams um and i'm not sure how accurate

2363
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:54,239
this is anymore because there's so much

2364
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:56,639
like just artificially generated text

2365
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:59,120
but when it was humans creating the text

2366
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:00,400
they used to actually

2367
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,199
do

2368
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:03,600
text mining as as like a study of the

2369
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:04,560
future

2370
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:05,360
um

2371
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,920
like so like a prediction analysis based

2372
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:09,280
on text

2373
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,840
analysis so it's um and was very

2374
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:14,400
effective so i hear but i think that

2375
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,199
this like study of future predicting be

2376
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:20,080
it oracles or astrology or what have you

2377
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:22,000
is really kind of fascinating because

2378
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,520
you can

2379
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:25,360
use all kinds of things active inference

2380
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:29,120
for prediction or anything right so um

2381
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,560
i don't know i think it's interesting to

2382
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,880
compare and contrast the different ways

2383
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,239
and um

2384
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:36,400
the ways that

2385
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,880
if you're open to accepting insight from

2386
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,280
tarot cards or the iching or the oracle

2387
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,400
of delphi

2388
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,440
or

2389
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:45,280
active inference or

2390
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,840
you know text analysis if you're open i

2391
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:50,320
think that

2392
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:53,360
all of the future

2393
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,760
or potential potential future avenues

2394
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:58,080
can can be very insightful like

2395
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:01,440
that's a possibility if only opening you

2396
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:04,000
up to the fact that that's a possibility

2397
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,840
i think that that that's the the real

2398
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:08,639
value in in

2399
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:11,840
futurology thanks blue dean

2400
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,199
yeah i think you're i think you're right

2401
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:15,360
i think the law of large numbers

2402
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,040
and the fact that we now have the

2403
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:19,920
ability to look at much larger data sets

2404
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,600
and and apply

2405
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,440
probability and statistics to those

2406
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,760
things should give us

2407
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,320
some sense of direction that we probably

2408
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,280
didn't have affordances to before

2409
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:33,520
and the messiness and this is why a lot

2410
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:36,400
of times philosophers and scientists are

2411
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:39,920
in that same tension of relating to is

2412
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:41,360
because

2413
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:44,080
that still doesn't collapse down to

2414
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:47,199
i go and see my my tarot card reader

2415
01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:49,840
and he gives me an answer and i believe

2416
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:50,880
it

2417
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,719
because that's not a law of large

2418
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:58,320
numbers so now do i follow or am i free

2419
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:00,320
i don't know

2420
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:04,320
it's messy right so yeah anyway well and

2421
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,239
does history repeat itself right like

2422
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:07,920
there's the old adage history repeats

2423
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:11,679
itself can we use history oh

2424
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:14,080
can we use history to um

2425
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,480
predict the future

2426
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:17,360
right

2427
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:21,360
that's where it's sort of mobius strips

2428
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,440
strange loops around

2429
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:26,239
when you make the model based upon the

2430
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:27,440
past

2431
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:30,800
that's anticipating the future

2432
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,199
and then you start acting that way going

2433
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:35,040
forward in the future

2434
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,960
it's almost like the timeline has folded

2435
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,520
because now the past is

2436
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:41,280
influencing the future

2437
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,960
in a in a way that

2438
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:45,280
might start to diverge

2439
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:47,440
from not like what it would have done

2440
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:49,440
obviously any policy is going to diverge

2441
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,120
from some counterfactual

2442
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,120
but

2443
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,840
it starts to um potentially

2444
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,120
lose its

2445
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:59,040
model adequacy

2446
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:01,280
because

2447
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:03,199
events from the past

2448
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:05,600
whose context has changed

2449
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,040
like let's just say the correlation

2450
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,320
between

2451
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:09,920
two cryptos

2452
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:12,239
we look at the past correlation but the

2453
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:14,400
context is changing

2454
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:15,920
so we're gonna have a model that's fit

2455
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,719
on their correlation in the past

2456
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:20,960
and then especially action on that but

2457
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,199
even without our action on that

2458
01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:25,120
that relationship may

2459
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,560
change

2460
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,159
and i think that's something interesting

2461
01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:30,880
about actin that it it

2462
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:34,239
puts perception cognition and action

2463
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:36,000
in the same loop

2464
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,520
always unfolding kind of like uda

2465
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:42,080
so that there always is the opportunity

2466
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:44,639
for flexibility

2467
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:48,239
as surprises come in

2468
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:49,679
and then also what you were saying about

2469
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:51,199
like

2470
01:31:51,199 --> 01:31:53,360
free will following well freeing

2471
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:55,199
following

2472
01:31:55,199 --> 01:31:56,840
and then to bring it back to realism and

2473
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,960
instrumentalism like

2474
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:02,159
here's the free will module in my model

2475
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:04,400
it's like here's how it works here's

2476
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,840
what it does here's the inputs here's

2477
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,320
the outputs so does the thing have free

2478
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,960
will yep in my model it does

2479
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,360
what about the actual thing

2480
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:15,360
i thought i told you

2481
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,040
we stopped talking about that a few

2482
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,960
years ago or something like that like

2483
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:21,920
we're not talking about that or

2484
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:24,880
that's an interesting question but

2485
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,960
now we're at square zero with what is

2486
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:28,400
real

2487
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,639
instead of i made a hypothesis about

2488
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:32,480
free will module that's just what i'm

2489
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,480
calling it that's not a free will module

2490
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,719
that's a random number generator or

2491
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:39,040
that's something that is doing its own

2492
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,960
prediction and then makes a decision

2493
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,199
based upon something else or that's like

2494
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:45,920
a preference vector

2495
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:46,800
okay

2496
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,400
dean

2497
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,400
yeah and again today

2498
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,880
i don't i don't think it matters i know

2499
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:54,880
most people would say it does but i

2500
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,400
don't think it matters whether you start

2501
01:32:56,400 --> 01:33:00,080
with a slide that has a blue silhouette

2502
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,480
looking at a gray rock

2503
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:04,960
or you start with a slide

2504
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:08,400
that seems appears to be much more

2505
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:11,040
more um that's what's the word for it

2506
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,199
much more further along in terms of

2507
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:14,639
orange lines

2508
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:17,760
you can go both directions yay

2509
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,280
that's the thing that we should be

2510
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:20,960
celebrating

2511
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:23,760
like it may appear from a from a

2512
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:25,280
constructivist

2513
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,280
point of view which came first

2514
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:29,360
that there's no way that you could have

2515
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:31,360
started with the orange and ended up

2516
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,040
with the much

2517
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:34,960
much less

2518
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:36,480
um

2519
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:39,760
informational 10 but yes you could

2520
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:42,000
and we oftentimes do

2521
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,120
that's that's actually if you go from 13

2522
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,440
to 10 in the slide deck that is free

2523
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:48,639
energy

2524
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:50,800
playing out yeah we could look at this

2525
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:53,360
one and we could go oh that's minimizing

2526
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:54,320
we're

2527
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,639
we're talking about instrumentalism so

2528
01:33:56,639 --> 01:33:58,639
we just know that when we draw an arrow

2529
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:00,320
of some agentic system we know that

2530
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:03,280
we're talking about instrumentalism

2531
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:04,480
and we know that the instrument that

2532
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:05,920
we're talking about is free energy

2533
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:07,440
principle active inference so that's how

2534
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:09,920
you step back from here to here

2535
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:12,000
and then just go okay so and then we

2536
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,920
know that models have their own internal

2537
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,679
time and that that's not the same as

2538
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:18,159
like real time so let's just simplify

2539
01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:18,960
that

2540
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:20,400
and then let's just

2541
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,000
a little bit less academic not worried

2542
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,840
about which paper i should write let's

2543
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,840
just focus on the motivation of that

2544
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:28,560
paper is it alive it's like

2545
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:30,320
we step back

2546
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:31,679
now

2547
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:33,679
i don't know is that

2548
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:35,520
it's like backwards and forwards in

2549
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,360
kairos

2550
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:40,800
as we move forward in kronos dean

2551
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,320
and that's where

2552
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:44,159
instructionalism and i forget what that

2553
01:34:44,159 --> 01:34:46,080
it was a hippolyta paper i think yeah

2554
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,679
interactive construction

2555
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:49,840
performance where the action is

2556
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,040
yeah

2557
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:52,560
that's where this that's where those

2558
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:55,440
four slides prove out her paper

2559
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:59,040
or at all paper because the reality is

2560
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:00,639
it's not

2561
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:02,800
simply constructivism it's

2562
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:05,199
disentanglement

2563
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:06,960
there's there's a product at the end of

2564
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:09,199
it that appears to be a construction

2565
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:10,800
don't get me wrong

2566
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:14,320
however what actually generates four

2567
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:17,440
versions four iterations is a dis

2568
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:20,800
entanglement not an integration

2569
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:23,760
and we have to be able to hold up both

2570
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,520
if we're actually going to get to a

2571
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:28,560
place where we understand house

2572
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,639
understanding

2573
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:32,159
emerges

2574
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:33,920
and that's where i that's where i find

2575
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:35,440
this stuff really exciting because if

2576
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:39,759
it's about interaction here's the proof

2577
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:43,920
let's in the last few minutes

2578
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:46,560
where do we go

2579
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:49,060
so not where we came from

2580
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:50,320
[Laughter]

2581
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:53,360
or when do we go

2582
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:58,480
um mom are we there then

2583
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,320
um

2584
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:08,159
blue will be working on some fun

2585
01:36:08,159 --> 01:36:10,400
literature analysis the history of

2586
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:11,840
active inference literature and free

2587
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:15,440
energy principle half 22.

2588
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:16,960
we hope to

2589
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,199
see many new papers

2590
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:20,239
coming in

2591
01:36:20,239 --> 01:36:21,119
from

2592
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:23,440
authors that we know as well as from new

2593
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:26,239
authors and new perspectives

2594
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:28,800
and selecting

2595
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:31,360
cutting edge papers and recent papers

2596
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,920
that are coming out and preprints ones

2597
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:35,760
that might not be done see where the

2598
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:37,440
live stream can

2599
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:39,840
insert itself into that literature

2600
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,520
stigma g

2601
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:44,080
maybe go back to some earlier

2602
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:45,520
classics

2603
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:48,159
for contrast and understanding how ideas

2604
01:36:48,159 --> 01:36:52,000
change through time and where we are now

2605
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,080
who we are now all these other variants

2606
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:56,239
of the question that we talked about

2607
01:36:56,239 --> 01:36:57,600
i mean

2608
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,760
we're gonna be doing it on wednesdays

2609
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,679
uh next year

2610
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:03,920
starting one hour later

2611
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:08,880
at uh i think 16 utc at 8 am pacific

2612
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:10,080
so

2613
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,360
for

2614
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:15,119
the weekly paper discussions or just any

2615
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:17,840
other system of interest

2616
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,840
where are we going or what will we do

2617
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:22,880
differently in 22

2618
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:30,880
i'm curious to see we're going to have

2619
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,960
our 40 second or 40 second live

2620
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,560
livestream that's gonna be epic we have

2621
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:37,040
to like choose wisely choose choose a

2622
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:39,760
paper wisely and also like our first

2623
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:42,239
paper of the year is gonna maybe set the

2624
01:37:42,239 --> 01:37:45,440
tone for what we're gonna you know learn

2625
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:46,960
and do and be about this year what was

2626
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:49,360
our first paper last year in 21 daniel

2627
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:51,520
it was um

2628
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:55,520
adam saffron and colleague 13.1 let's

2629
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:57,920
look on the coda site

2630
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,400
um oh we haven't updated it yet but it

2631
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:04,560
was 13. on the cybernetic big five

2632
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,400
oh that was epic too that was really

2633
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,800
good and actually like you know the big

2634
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,719
five was that was my first time learning

2635
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:12,560
about it and it was kind of

2636
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:14,800
we covered all of those this year uh

2637
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,360
several times so we'll have to have to

2638
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:18,480
similarly choose like an

2639
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:20,080
all-encompassing

2640
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:22,159
first paper

2641
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:24,239
hopefully we go into more participation

2642
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:25,679
and

2643
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:28,000
more expansion and

2644
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:28,960
more

2645
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:31,040
broad acceptance or recognition of the

2646
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:34,880
fep i hope that's where we go

2647
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,960
that would be cool

2648
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,639
do we have any other

2649
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:42,480
comments or we can give sort of a yes

2650
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:43,679
dean please

2651
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:44,960
one last thing

2652
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:46,080
i think

2653
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,239
i didn't come in i wasn't there a year

2654
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:49,520
ago

2655
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:51,679
but one of the things that has recently

2656
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:53,840
happened is that we've introduced

2657
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:56,080
another walnut shell the potential for a

2658
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:57,360
0.3

2659
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:59,360
which i actually think for most people

2660
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:01,360
would be like yeah okay so what you're

2661
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:03,360
gonna you're gonna stare at your navel

2662
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:05,040
longer but i actually think it's a

2663
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:08,280
really exciting

2664
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:15,360
all right pete dean yeah

2665
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:16,480
um

2666
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:18,000
dean

2667
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,480
please from the from the oh wow

2668
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,480
all right dean yeah but the doctor

2669
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:24,239
affordance is cool so that's a really

2670
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:27,360
good point dean um the walnut shell the

2671
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,679
navel gazing the dot three

2672
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:31,360
continue

2673
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:33,760
yeah i just was gonna say i think it's

2674
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:36,000
it's actually a really exciting time

2675
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,800
because when we add another shell we're

2676
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:41,119
actually practicing the active inference

2677
01:39:41,119 --> 01:39:42,800
instead of just

2678
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:45,440
talking to it in different versions

2679
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:48,080
and that that to me is if next year

2680
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:50,239
means that there's

2681
01:39:50,239 --> 01:39:51,119
more

2682
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:52,880
reveal more

2683
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:53,600
q

2684
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:55,040
unknown

2685
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:56,880
and we actually have to play with that

2686
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:59,199
uncertainty space as opposed to walking

2687
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:01,280
into it and saying well we've now had

2688
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:04,800
this many live streams so

2689
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,719
now we could no we should actually be

2690
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:08,880
doing more shells

2691
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,080
1p

2692
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:11,840
and more options

2693
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:12,800
hidden

2694
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:15,760
that's when it gets really exciting so

2695
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:17,760
that's what i'm looking forward to so

2696
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,679
that's a super good point dean and so if

2697
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:22,480
people have other live streams that they

2698
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:24,800
wish that they were a part of or you

2699
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:27,119
know other authors want to come back for

2700
01:40:27,119 --> 01:40:30,000
a revisit to do a dot 3 of any live

2701
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,840
stream that they've been on before like

2702
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:32,960
reach out

2703
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:35,040
we always have the affordance to make an

2704
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:36,639
anything.3

2705
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:37,440
um

2706
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:40,159
so yeah like we can revisit old things

2707
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:42,960
and move on to new things and um do both

2708
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,880
of them together history the weird

2709
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:46,320
folding right

2710
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,400
yeah we can do guest streams all kinds

2711
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:51,199
of fun stuff and then also just so

2712
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:53,119
people know

2713
01:40:53,119 --> 01:40:55,440
um if you're ever part of the live

2714
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:58,080
stream you'll see this slide

2715
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:00,320
asking you to go through a checklist

2716
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:03,119
this is our 21 version

2717
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:04,960
and we hope people go through it i think

2718
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:07,199
sometimes they do

2719
01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:11,679
lots of information on participation

2720
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:15,440
on things to check before you start

2721
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:17,600
if you're a participant so not like the

2722
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:19,360
author of the paper

2723
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:21,360
um but just somebody who's

2724
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:24,000
gonna be hanging out and

2725
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,159
giving any thoughts on a paper

2726
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:28,159
there's some checklist for you for a

2727
01:41:28,159 --> 01:41:30,000
presenter like an author who's gonna be

2728
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,600
presenting a talk

2729
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:33,360
there's information for them

2730
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,360
there's also the broadcast

2731
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:36,560
role

2732
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:38,239
so that's the person with a stable

2733
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:40,480
internet and a computer that can run a

2734
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,639
streaming software

2735
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:44,840
there's a conversational

2736
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:48,320
facilitator yeah exactly

2737
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:49,679
dean's cabin

2738
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:52,000
dot stream um a little stream through a

2739
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,159
tin can

2740
01:41:54,159 --> 01:41:56,639
then there's the organizers checklist

2741
01:41:56,639 --> 01:41:58,639
and then we're always

2742
01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:01,520
growing and changing as active inference

2743
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,040
lab because

2744
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:04,639
we're a participatory lab and that

2745
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:07,360
includes every single possible role

2746
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,760
including many that are not listed here

2747
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:10,639
so

2748
01:42:10,639 --> 01:42:12,080
if it's something that you're interested

2749
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:13,520
in and if you're listening and your

2750
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,520
regime of attention has extended this

2751
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:16,560
far

2752
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:18,000
then

2753
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,400
maybe you'd like to join a live stream

2754
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,480
or make a suggestion

2755
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:25,280
or play one of these other roles because

2756
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:27,199
it is a multiplayer game

2757
01:42:27,199 --> 01:42:29,760
and i hope we're having fun when we get

2758
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,920
to do it so

2759
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:34,400

learned a lot by doing and updated our

2764
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:47,520
generative models

2765
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:51,199
