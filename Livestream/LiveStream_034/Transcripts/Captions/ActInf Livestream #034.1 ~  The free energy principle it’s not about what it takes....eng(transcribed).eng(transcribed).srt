00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,559
hello and welcome everyone to actin flab

3
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,600
live stream number 34.1

4
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,760
it's december 7th 2021.

5
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,680
welcome to actinflab

6
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,920
we are a participatory online lab that

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,640
is communicating learning and practicing

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,960
applied active inference you can find us

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,399
at some of the links

10
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,239
here on this page

11
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,160
this is a recorded and an archived live

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,000
stream so please provide us with

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,399
feedback so that we can improve on our

14
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,000
work

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
all backgrounds and perspectives are

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,400
welcome here and we'll be following good

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,000
video etiquette for live streams

18
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,920
all acting flap activities are

19
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,080
participatory so let us know if you want

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,119
to join in or co-organize we have

21
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,680
three organizational units education

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,000
communication and tools and weekly

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,759
meetings for each of those units a ton

24
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,680
of interesting projects to get involved

25
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,960
in

26
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,320
coda.io at activeinferencelab activelab

27
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,000
you'll find a searchable and sortable

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,640
site where you can learn more about the

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,799
past and upcoming live streams that we

30
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,119
have

31
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,640
today in acting stream number 34.1 we're

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,960
going to be learning and discussing

33
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,399
about this

34
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,280
fun paper the free energy principle it's

35
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,759
not about what it takes it's about what

36
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,079
took you there by actual constant in

37
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,000
2021

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,240
and in

39
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,960
34.0

40
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,680
dean and i had a great time we talked

41
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,080
about the paper so check out the dot

42
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,959
zero

43
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,800
and of course read the paper if you want

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,720
to learn more

45
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,200
today in 34.1 we can go over some of the

46
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,800
key claims

47
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,360
we can look at some of the examples

48
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,440
again and differentiate the bayesian

49
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,080
approach versus the free energy approach

50
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,760
and just really take it anywhere that

51
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,599
people think is interesting so if you're

52
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,280
watching live

53
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,160
just

54
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,000
ask questions in the live chat and we'll

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,959
be keeping our eye on that and we will

56
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,680
just introduce ourselves go around and

57
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,040
then we'll

58
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,360
take it wherever we take it

59
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,560
so

60
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,280
we can introduce ourselves we can say hi

61
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,360
and say maybe something that was

62
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,440
exciting about the paper

63
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,599
that we remembered or something that

64
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,599
we'd like to reduce our uncertainty on

65
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,760
by the end of this discussion

66
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,840
so i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

67
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,120
california

68
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,239
and

69
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,840
i'm actually just looking forward to

70
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,400
seeing if anyone in the live chat has

71
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,159
some questions to ask because there's so

72
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,440
many cool adjacencies to this paper and

73
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,280
just the

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,120
beginnings of the thread were explored

75
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,480
by dean and i in the dot zero so

76
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,480
exploring the implications and what

77
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,239
people see as relevant in this paper i

78
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,159
think will be really exciting

79
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,599
and i will pass it to dean

80
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,360
thanks daniel i'm dean i'm calgary um

81
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,720
i'm just curious again to see how

82
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,440
as you start pulling on a thread

83
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,840
discovering how many things are actually

84
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,959
there as opposed to just the threads so

85
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,400
yeah i think today should be a pretty

86
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,000
interesting day and i'll pass it over to

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,760
david

88
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,159
i'm dave i'm

89
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,159
live north of manila

90
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,680
i did natural language processing with

91
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,000
big computers and

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,319
studied cybernetic learning theory and

93
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,200
i'm

94
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,599
excited that he's given us some simple

95
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,000
math actual axle constant is kind of

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,599
bringing it down to those of us who

97
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,599
stalled by the end of calculus one

98
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,360
just to sort of

99
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,959
lead-in question dave in the area of

100
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,639
cybernetics

101
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,560
is there any

102
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,720
analogous work anyone who said well it's

103
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,479
not really about being a cybernetic

104
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,720
system it's about how you came to be

105
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,800
that cybernetic system like are there

106
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,479
any parallels

107
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,160
in the cybernetics literature for the

108
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,520
kinds of things that are explored in

109
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,280
this paper

110
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,490
well there are yeah um in terms of um

111
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,520
[Music]

112
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,240
not so much necessarily the origins well

113
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,960
yes in cybernetic learning systems this

114
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,680
theory um a branch called

115
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,919
conversation theory

116
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,960
uh they completely cut loose the

117
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,840
notion of the physical embodiments of

118
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,080
systems from the

119
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,280
mimetic

120
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,360
or functional or conceptual or cognitive

121
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,080
aspects of systems in fact even types of

122
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,360
systems uh very much like what richard

123
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,039
dawkins did

124
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,960
30 plus years ago on separating

125
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,280
genetics from my medics which in his

126
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,360
case originally was just a proof of

127
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,039
principle not something he wanted to

128
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,520
pursue especially and it has been

129
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,560
pursued um in cybernetic learning theory

130
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,759
um the individual

131
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,960
is equated to the conversation

132
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,840
is equated with a s a type of system

133
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,639
that originates that persists

134
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,759
that merges into other systems

135
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,320
that may very well function through many

136
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,520
bodies

137
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,280
so you have distributed intelligence

138
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,360
right out of the gate

139
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,039
um

140
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,000
as well as internal differentiation

141
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,080
internal self-definition of each

142
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,160
individual as a conversation

143
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,160
so

144
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,120
definitely

145
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,039
the

146
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,800
there and there's a lot of math even

147
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,280
going way back to the 60s and 70s they

148
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,080
they

149
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,120
uh

150
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,919
there were cyberneticians who took

151
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,520
precise quantitative work very seriously

152
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,960
and dug down

153
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,759
uh very carefully on quantified

154
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,840
attention quantified uncertainty

155
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,560
resolution of uncertainty and the

156
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,479
qualitative

157
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,280
uh

158
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,120
consequences

159
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,319
of deciding

160
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,479
what's really happening what my plan

161
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,479
really is very much uh the sort of

162
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,919
fun

163
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,440
abrupt and

164
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,319
often irreversible changes that

165
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,360
uh

166
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,280
the world looked at in a lot of depth

167
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,720
when catastrophe theory burst upon the

168
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,840
world sudden catastrophic perhaps an

169
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,440
improvement but a catastrophic a

170
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,080
suddenly relatively irreversible change

171
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,550
um

172
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,840
[Music]

173
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,479
and here it is still working on it in

174
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,639
deeper and deeper in detail and wider

175
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,080
scope so good for mr dr cost

176
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,759
pretty

177
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,319
interesting it makes me think about like

178
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,840
a friendship

179
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,360
and how

180
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,599
maybe it's not just about

181
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,599
what the friendship is

182
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,680
or what it takes to have a friendship

183
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,960
but it's about the specific

184
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,919
conversations that take you there

185
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,160
so let's just kind of

186
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,599
look at the main

187
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,919
aims and claims and parts of the paper

188
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,080
and then either of you raise your hand

189
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,280
of course

190
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,039
maybe some others will join and anyone

191
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,199
in the live chat please just ask any

192
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,319
question or

193
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,560
make a comment we're just chilling

194
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,319
so the center

195
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,479
topic that's raised and it's a term

196
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,639
that's introduced in this paper

197
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,720
uh not the word but its usage in this

198
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,520
situation is the entailment problem

199
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,400
and just like the dog and the tail as

200
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,599
they say

201
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,440
the entailment problem is about

202
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,520
the relationship the

203
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,120
necessity and the sufficiency

204
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,280
relationship which ones following which

205
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,879
and under what situations they're

206
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,639
following each other

207
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,120
the entitlement problem is the confusion

208
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,199
in the entailment relation between free

209
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,319
energy minimization and life so

210
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,800
is free energy minimization

211
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,760
necessary for life is it sufficient

212
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,880
those are

213
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,200
the core pieces of the entailment

214
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,399
problem

215
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,200
and what happens in this paper

216
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,880
is a

217
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,560
simple dissolution through a trivial

218
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,600
toy

219
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
simplified example

220
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,080
of that entailment problem and we're

221
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,000
gonna probably walk through it again

222
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,959
today

223
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,279
but this numerical example which is very

224
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,360
stripped down it's not full active

225
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,120
there's no action in the loop it's just

226
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,120
a perceptive example

227
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,600
and it just shows that free energy

228
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,959
minimization does not always lead to the

229
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,959
correct choices

230
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,240
it's also conditional upon the priors

231
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,720
in other words how you got there it's

232
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,240
about what took you there because the

233
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,920
priors don't come from nowhere they come

234
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,120
from the past

235
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,760
so this kind of connects this

236
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,720
uh rigorous logic

237
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,200
within the action perception loop or in

238
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,959
this case just a simplified perception

239
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,959
loop to the

240
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,800
often ill or a logical way that things

241
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,360
happened to get the way they are so it's

242
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,560
going to be that

243
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,080
tension between

244
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,160
is this a rational analysis is it

245
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,640
locally rational maybe globally

246
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,279
irrational all those kinds of topics

247
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,839
come up and just to

248
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,040
skip to the final words of the paper

249
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,720
the claim

250
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,480
in this paper that's explored is that

251
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,880
free energy minimization is not

252
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,440
sufficient for life so not that fep has

253
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,959
nothing to say about life not that

254
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,959
actinf is irrelevant but that free

255
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,680
energy minimization is not sufficient it

256
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,600
turns out that it's necessary to be

257
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,200
doing something like free energy

258
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,959
minimization to persist in a dissipative

259
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,920
world but it's not sufficient it can't

260
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,839
be all that you have the wheels are

261
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,079
necessary for the car to go round and

262
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,839
round round and round but they're not

263
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:26,959
sufficient

264
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,800
and then that last sentence

265
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,720
the free energy principle is meant to

266
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,399
account for all kinds of systems

267
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,279
you the listener slash reader

268
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,200
the author of the paper

269
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,680
and the system of interest the organism

270
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,160
under study in a unifying fashion so we

271
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,560
should also explore like what is the

272
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,720
unifying

273
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,200
lens or what is the framing

274
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,279
under which

275
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,600
the research scholar and the person

276
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,440
who's just sort of like what is the free

277
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,320
energy principle and the bacterium and

278
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,720
what is that unifying principle and what

279
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,640
does the free energy principle have to

280
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,439
do with that

281
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,839
okay

282
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:10,720
so

283
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,560
dean where do you think we should jump

284
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,720
in or what would be um a fun question or

285
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,120
place to start here

286
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,120
well so i have

287
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,320
i have an interest

288
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,480
a little bit history with this so what

289
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,560
what took you there so if i'm meeting

290
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,720
somebody and they're an expert at

291
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,360
something i don't typically ask why are

292
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
you an expert because that's kind of

293
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,399
offensive but to ask what

294
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,399
what got you here what got you to the

295
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,399
place where you now

296
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,839
bear this title

297
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,000
the weight of that title isn't is an

298
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,079
interesting way of going about

299
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,079
trying to figure out

300
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,680
what

301
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,560
what logics they have applied in the

302
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,519
past

303
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,320
to

304
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,200
untangle problems and resolve things

305
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,040
that may be somebody

306
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,200
with less expertise

307
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,959
struggles with her or doesn't seem to be

308
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,639
able to overcome

309
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,880
so that's where this paper was really

310
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,079
helpful to me

311
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,120
instead of

312
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,200
why do i have to do this or why are you

313
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,560
such an expert

314
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,720
asking where did you come from

315
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,079
and then when being specific in terms of

316
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:16,959
so

317
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,959
how did you resolve something that i

318
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,200
still find

319
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,959
difficult to resolve like why do i have

320
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,120
to tie my shoes and then the expert says

321
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,320
well because you're going to trip over

322
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,760
your shoelace and fall down well i

323
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,839
haven't tripped over my shoelace instead

324
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,680
of going down that path

325
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,440
figuring it out in a slightly more

326
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,480
sophisticated way

327
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,760
cool thank you um i'm not gonna read

328
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,440
this blate quote but of course we have

329
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,040
to write it down

330
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,920
it makes me think about how why

331
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,079
which is an important question

332
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,519
often lends itself towards

333
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,399
generalization like why are you studying

334
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,320
machine learning well it's really

335
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,760
important and it's going to become

336
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,600
increasingly important and i wanted to

337
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,320
have a good job and other people told me

338
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,720
it was relevant it kind of generalizes

339
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,079
out

340
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,959
whereas what took you there is always

341
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,800
going to be a trajectory it's kind of a

342
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,959
path and that's where you get the answer

343
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,240
that's more like

344
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,399
well i met this mentor and then i was

345
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,399
curious about this specific topic and

346
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,800
then we did this program

347
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,839
so

348
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,680
what took you there is about the

349
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,680
specifics and

350
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,279
what

351
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,320
is broached in why questions is often

352
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,600
generalizations and we know that there's

353
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,000
not even a single answer to why like

354
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,959
we've talked about aristotle's whys and

355
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,240
about tin bergen why like why

356
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,880
is always going to be a plurality of

357
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,000
answers

358
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,519
whereas what took you there is going to

359
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,000
be a specific path and so that's the

360
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,440
tension

361
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,360
in living systems

362
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,160
is we want to understand something

363
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,839
general like surely there are some

364
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,600
generalizations we can make across

365
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,240
single-celled life or across mammals

366
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,199
but

367
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,920
also we're explaining specific systems

368
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,720
so

369
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,760
which

370
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,160
aspects are going to be generalizable

371
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,480
and which ones aren't and i think again

372
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
free energy principle as a theory of

373
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,000
everything

374
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,760
and something that does clearly make

375
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,160
generalizations across systems at least

376
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,160
apply to different systems

377
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,519
how does this

378
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,800
hyper

379
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,920
specific

380
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,199
trajectory based way of approaching

381
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,959
answering a question

382
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,519
relate to more of a mean field

383
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,440
approximation

384
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,880
averaged over

385
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,560
multiple categories

386
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,720
i think it's that tension that's really

387
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,800
interesting to describe so one is this

388
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,279
general versus specific tension

389
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,480
and then

390
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,720
if we can go to the simple point that's

391
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,880
made in the paper

392
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,880
that the free energy principle is not

393
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,120
concerned with the sufficient conditions

394
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,680
of existence but rather with what must

395
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,839
have been the case given that you exist

396
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,399
so this is related to necessity and

397
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,399
sufficiency which we talked about in the

398
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,959
dot zero they're similar words so we

399
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,240
should use them differently they're

400
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,600
different words

401
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,839
in other words it's about necessity but

402
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:08,959
not

403
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,279
necessarily sufficiency

404
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,199
and then it's not about what figuring

405
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,519
out what it takes to be alive it's about

406
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,600
figuring out what took you there

407
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,399
so

408
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,519
the title

409
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,880
is restated and turned around many many

410
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,639
different times because it is such a

411
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,040
distillable and simple yet important

412
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,680
concept and i think the piece that

413
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,639
i'd like to explore a little more is

414
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,880
really the pronoun use

415
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,880
i understand why the paper is written

416
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,959
from an i perspective because that's

417
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,120
convention with single author philosophy

418
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,160
papers

419
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,040
but

420
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,199
it's about figuring out what took you

421
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,399
there

422
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,320
so there's a sort of rhetorical element

423
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,120
of speaking to a reader which is

424
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,040
returning at the end of the paper those

425
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,680
last few lines about you me and the

426
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,440
system under study

427
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,279
but then also it's almost like

428
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,000
about how the free energy principle

429
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,639
is about systems looking at their own

430
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,720
timeline and trajectory

431
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,680
and perhaps not as much as looking out

432
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,440
so i'm curious about what does that

433
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,360
relational

434
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,320
element

435
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,160
mean here with the person relating to

436
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,519
their past and

437
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,079
us as systems relating to other systems

438
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,079
dean

439
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,399
yeah so the necessity might be you show

440
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,440
up

441
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,079
you attend in order for

442
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,759
things to

443
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,279
sort of continue on but the sufficiency

444
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,480
part is how available you are so you can

445
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,120
show up and turn all your senses off you

446
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,399
can be present but not necessarily

447
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,360
be taking in anything

448
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,279
or at least trying to actively avoid

449
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,360
taking information in and so

450
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,040
that's the part again i would agree with

451
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,240
you that's the part i found really

452
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,880
interesting because

453
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,000
to to not understand or appreciate that

454
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,440
there's a difference between what is

455
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,720
necessary

456
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,919
i'm i'm here i'm in part of this live

457
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,720
stream now but then i could be

458
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,400
distracted in all different directions

459
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,720
not really be able to be available

460
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,240
to what

461
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,400
is going on around me is is a whole

462
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,160
different matter and i think that's what

463
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,160
axel has done a really good job of

464
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,839
bringing it down to that personal level

465
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,079
sufficiency

466
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,240
has to be exhaustive

467
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,480
to say what's truly sufficient for the

468
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,559
bacteria to live

469
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,240
it it's going to include things like

470
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,840
well you need the laws of physics and

471
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,360
you need gravity and you need um just

472
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,200
everything it's like really you're

473
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,080
giving

474
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,600
almost a bit by bit play-by-play

475
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,360
so sufficiency

476
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,559
it requires an exhaustive account

477
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,840
because if you're missing something

478
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,280
that's necessary

479
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,000
you didn't capture what was sufficient

480
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,799
necessity allows us to just focus on

481
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,000
some aspect that we know is relevant

482
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
and then talk about

483
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,640
the why and the what and the how of

484
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,080
necessity

485
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,840
while acknowledging that we're just

486
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,520
focusing on one piece like that

487
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,640
one line in that one kandinsky painting

488
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,960
it's necessary for my interpretation of

489
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,760
it

490
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,039
it's not sufficient because the

491
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,840
sufficiency of the interpretation of art

492
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,679
would just send you off into the whole

493
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,440
universe maybe you need all of human

494
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,760
cultural history including from cultures

495
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,520
that you wouldn't even directly

496
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,960
acknowledge

497
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
for the sufficiency

498
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,160
to be

499
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,840
garnered in that interpretive setting

500
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,080
but necessity is a lot easier to point

501
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,480
your finger to

502
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,799
that relates to what

503
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,919
um

504
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,320
are distinguished as the strong and the

505
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,600
weak

506
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,799
responses to the entailment problem

507
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,880
so let's look over at this and again

508
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,160
anyone with any kind of a question

509
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,760
please just ask it because we're

510
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,039
chilling and

511
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,720
looking forward to your questions

512
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,039
so this is where in the paper the

513
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,640
entailment problem is

514
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,600
specified arguments in the literature on

515
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,360
the free energy principle give the

516
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,160
impression that in order to be alive

517
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,320
to count as a living system one must

518
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,039
minimize free energy

519
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,400
and so

520
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,160
there's a few ways to think about this

521
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,000
relationship between minimizing free

522
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,600
energy and life

523
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,799
sorry if you thought it was going to be

524
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,160
a discussion on a different topic

525
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,760
because that's what this paper is about

526
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,400
and it just again it's so simple it's

527
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,440
like

528
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,360
a shape in your hand you're turning it

529
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,679
over the shape is simple in some ways

530
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,280
but then the implications of the shape

531
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,559
and the way it gets

532
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,720
connected to other ideas is really

533
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,919
critical

534
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,280
and

535
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,919
actual distinguishes two

536
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,400
ways to talk about the relationship the

537
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,240
strong and the weak

538
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,559
and as we'll see

539
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,120
they differ not just in their strength

540
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,559
but also

541
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,480
essentially in the direction which the

542
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,000
arrow is pointing

543
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,600
so it's kind of like it's not like

544
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,679
there's a a little mountain in a big

545
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,600
mountain but the arrow of elevation is

546
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,360
pointing the same way there's something

547
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,039
a little bit different happening

548
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,640
the strong

549
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,840
claim

550
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,400
in response to the entailment problem

551
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
is that minimizing free energy is a

552
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,960
sufficient condition for life and that's

553
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,440
also called in some earlier work the

554
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,159
overly generous claim which is kind of a

555
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,840
framing that already says that it's

556
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,960
probably

557
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,000
uh

558
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,400
too generous it's it's incorrect in that

559
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,520
way

560
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,760
and the strong claim is the sufficiency

561
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,799
claim

562
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,120
minimizing free energy that's all you

563
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,360
need it's sufficient to minimize free

564
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,240
energy to be a living system

565
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,640
the implication of the strong claim

566
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,280
would be that all we need to do is have

567
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,480
that free energy thermometer and then

568
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,720
we can determine who's minimizing free

569
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,320
energy we have our meter stick on this

570
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,400
left side and then

571
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,799
that would be sufficient to talk about

572
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,400
what systems were alive or not

573
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,280
in contrast the weak claim

574
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,760
is a necessity claim

575
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,480
if a system is currently alive it means

576
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,080
that it has minimized its free energy

577
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,400
and such a type of claim does not assume

578
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,480
the fep is designed to set the bar for

579
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,720
the sufficient conditions of life or

580
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,320
meant to predict what things may or may

581
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,840
not be alive

582
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,080
rather it limits the scope of the

583
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,919
application of the principle to beings

584
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,400
that we think are alive now

585
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,159
and enables us to know the necessary

586
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,400
conditions under which those beings can

587
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,799
be living i.e can actively resist the

588
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,679
loss

589
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,000
of structural integrity what took them

590
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,240
there

591
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,200
so

592
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,360
there's a few interesting pieces just

593
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,960
they differ in strength these two

594
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,840
responses or claims that are

595
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,360
generated by the entailment problem

596
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,720
i wonder what is the scope of the fep

597
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,880
and is it for systems that we have a

598
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,000
priori

599
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,400
decided are already alive

600
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,679
are

601
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,000
non-living systems under the scope of

602
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,360
the fep

603
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,919
so maybe we can try to like do some

604
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,320
duplicate the slide and do a little

605
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,919
diagramming and venn diagrams on

606
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:20,720
what

607
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,039
does the minimizing free energy

608
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,559
circle look like with respect to the

609
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,960
life circle and then what is life if we

610
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,039
don't have the thermometer over here on

611
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,679
the left side

612
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,400
so can i ask a question daniel

613
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,600
would it

614
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,240
would it be going too far off the rails

615
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,520
if i

616
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,200
if i wondered

617
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,039
to take this idea

618
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,960
and say okay so i want to build up i'm

619
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,679
i'm

620
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,240
i'm an academic or i'm a trainer and i

621
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,360
want to

622
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,520
i want to build out a curriculum

623
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,200
knowing this

624
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,960
what does that imply in terms of

625
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,480
well i know what's the difference

626
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,960
between something that's

627
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,120
surprising removal because i remember

628
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,120
i'm the one that already knows this and

629
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,559
i'm trying to pass this along to

630
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,919
somebody who doesn't know it so it's

631
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,000
i'm i'm trying to guess what surprisal

632
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,120
removal

633
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
or minimization means to them i'm

634
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,960
supposed to be guessing what life means

635
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,520
to them i'm supposed to be knowing what

636
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,200
is necessary what absolutely they must

637
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,159
know and what will be sufficient so in

638
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,600
that context

639
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,520
how would we um

640
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,799
[Music]

641
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,360
how would we order this

642
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,840
let's kind of lay out a few options

643
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,880
okay so we have um

644
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,840
behind the first door

645
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,880
we'll use letters to talk about them so

646
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,840
we'll have

647
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,039
i'll take the cash monty are you sure i

648
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,640
can reveal that one of the doors has

649
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,360
nothing behind it

650
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,960
okay so we're gonna have scenario a

651
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,080
which is

652
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,760
their um

653
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,600
r systems that are minimizing free

654
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,400
energy

655
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,080
so they're systems outside of that

656
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,000
circle so there may be systems that are

657
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,240
not minimizing free energy

658
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,400
but within the set

659
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,320
of living things

660
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,919
all of them are minimizing free energy

661
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,080
so let's think about what kind of world

662
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,360
that is

663
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,159
okay

664
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,520
so then we can have scenario b

665
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,880
where

666
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,200
there's living systems

667
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,880
there's non-living systems as well so we

668
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,760
could ask what puts us in one category

669
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,840
living or non-living but

670
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,039
there's living systems that are

671
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,799
minimizing free energy and there's ones

672
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,080
that are not i think we can say that

673
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,279
because

674
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,760
if we go with the weak claim

675
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,640
then

676
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,240
it's fair to say

677
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,960
that b is

678
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,000
ruled out

679
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,200
because this would say that there's

680
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,039
living systems that are not minimizing

681
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,159
free energy

682
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,400
so we can say like basically

683
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,840
weak claim

684
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,279
uh

685
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,000
uh disreputes

686
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,640
this area

687
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,559
the area of that crescent moon

688
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,360
that's being um sort of

689
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,520
invicted against

690
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,000
uh is distributes a word

691
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,320
disputes we'll go with that

692
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,000
the weak claim disputes this area of the

693
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,159
crescent it's saying well all living

694
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,960
systems have to be minimizing free

695
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,480
energy it's a necessity but it's not

696
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,760
sufficiency

697
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,799
so

698
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,279
then a third scenario

699
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,880
would be

700
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,840
like they're the exact same thing

701
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,158
so well

702
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,279
that would be sort of a

703
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,039
well you could have minimizing free

704
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,880
energy is a sufficient condition for

705
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,559
life

706
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,480
so that means that the life circle

707
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,000
is

708
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,520
we'll have to we can't show total

709
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,960
overlap but

710
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,520
the life circle

711
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,279
everything that's minimizing free energy

712
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,960
is alive

713
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
so here in a

714
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,360
there are free energy minimizing systems

715
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,799
that aren't alive

716
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,360
like a ball falling off of a cliff might

717
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,120
be minimizing its free energy just like

718
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,799
it's minimizing its potential energy or

719
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,480
a burning candle might be minimizing

720
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,480
free energy

721
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,279
but

722
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,039
it doesn't have to be alive so that's

723
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,039
these are free energy minimizing systems

724
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,039
in the crescent of a

725
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,200
that are not alive

726
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,120
in c

727
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,320
we have this

728
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,480
perfect relationship between the two

729
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,760
things

730
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,480
and that is a very strong claim which is

731
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,400
that if it's minimizing free energy

732
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,919
that's sufficient

733
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,360
for being alive

734
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,440
and if it's not minimizing free energy

735
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,960
it's not alive

736
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,400
so

737
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,360
this is sort of the the weakest claim is

738
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,240
on the left side

739
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,000
doesn't mean it's useless doesn't mean

740
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,840
it's inadequate but this is the weakest

741
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,880
claim this is the necessity claim

742
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,360
then we have the strong claim

743
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,520
here

744
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,400
uh

745
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,919
that

746
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,679
minimizing free energy is sufficient

747
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,919
well

748
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,760
this is

749
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,880
this is the strongest claim in c

750
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,320
that minimizing free energy is

751
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,919
sufficient for life

752
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,679
so anything that

753
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,000
you know if

754
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,399
doing x is sufficient for

755
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:29,840
greetings blue

756
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,799
hello

757
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,120
cool light

758
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,399
we're um in the slides on 24 just

759
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,200
talking about necessity and sufficiency

760
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,360
c is the strongest case

761
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,919
it's saying it's sufficient

762
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,679
and so you're either going to be

763
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,679
minimizing free energy and therefore

764
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,600
sufficient to be called alive

765
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,840
or you're doing neither

766
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,240
and then b is a little bit of a middle

767
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,480
case that's saying there's some living

768
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,240
systems that are not minimizing they're

769
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,279
free energy but some are

770
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,440
so these are three now are there other

771
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,200
possible layouts and then dean let's

772
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,720
return to your question about like

773
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,880
educating and how do we think about this

774
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,720
how do we distinguish these scenarios in

775
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,440
an education context

776
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,640
or welcome blue if you would like to

777
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,039
say hello or just what

778
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,480
makes you excited for this paper

779
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,200
um i loved this paper i thought it was

780
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,600
great um and i have been listening along

781
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,200
in the live stream so i'm kind of up to

782
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,720
speed with where you guys are and what

783
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,120
you were talking about but um

784
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,880
i yeah enjoyed axel's writing and um

785
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,240
i like like the fact that

786
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,440
i can

787
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,360
implement the free energy without having

788
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,080
to ascribe to pan psychism and also

789
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,080
without having to ascribe to the mind

790
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
life continuity hypothesis or all of

791
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,399
these things that we've been discussing

792
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,919
um like the necessity sufficiency

793
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,760
it's there like

794
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,520
i think that axel sets out a really

795
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,159
logical argument or a set of arguments

796
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,279
um

797
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,159
and

798
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,399
doesn't make any claims

799
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,640
that aren't um

800
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,000
justifiable with maths

801
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,200
yes

802
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,520
using a simple mathematical example

803
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,840
um we'll we'll keep this slide around

804
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,760
because we can wonder maybe is there

805
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,880
some well

806
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,200
another relationship that we could

807
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,039
speculate would be like

808
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,240
a kind of

809
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,559
something like this

810
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,679
like

811
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:38,559
life

812
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,799
there's systems that are minimizing free

813
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,360
energy or not

814
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,960
and then

815
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,559
there's systems that are alive or not

816
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,159
and sometimes they overlap but they

817
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,399
don't have to overlap but there's some

818
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,000
special living systems that are doing it

819
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,279
and there's some that aren't and there's

820
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,960
some that are neither so this is the

821
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,840
most

822
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,000
uh we'll just call this one

823
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,440
situation d

824
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,919
d is the most

825
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,039
is the most

826
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,880
flexible

827
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,320
scenario

828
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,760
because you could have

829
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,679
a or b i mean well i won't use those

830
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,840
letters you could have life free energy

831
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,120
minimizing

832
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,279
both or neither so d is the most

833
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,720
flexible case

834
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,360
c is the most restrictive case

835
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,480
and then we have two possible nesting

836
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,039
relationships where one is nested inside

837
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,320
of the other

838
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,279
and

839
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,480
it's kind of

840
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,559
interesting to wonder what kind of world

841
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,840
do each of these exist in

842
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,840
um well where is the mind bubble

843
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,799
yes let's

844
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,960
should be around the whole slide is it

845
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,279
is that the mind the the modeler is that

846
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,840
why there's that relational or

847
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,440
personal framing of the paper because

848
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,520
the mind is the

849
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,640
mapping

850
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,440
of

851
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,159
these different venn diagrams dean

852
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,440
and i think it's really interesting too

853
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,200
daniel that in real time

854
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,840
we now have a slide 23 and now a new

855
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,519
slide 24

856
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,559
and although the we now know the order

857
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,919
that they

858
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,760
they presented themselves to us as

859
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,480
could we have started with 24 and worked

860
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,640
our way back to 23.

861
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,799
that's that's when it gets really kind

862
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,720
of weird and twisted but

863
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,559
it's also what i think the paper is

864
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,640
speaking to if we're actually thinking

865
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,039
about this and as a as another example

866
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,559
of a post potentially post diction way

867
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,399
of viewing things historically now

868
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,440
yes so

869
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,279
um

870
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,519
23 which now has a little

871
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,519
logo on it for those who don't have the

872
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,279
slide deck at hand

873
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,919
23 was derived heavily from the paper

874
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,399
right it was quotes from the paper and

875
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,399
then just a visual representation now

876
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,240
that was not in the paper but it could

877
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,640
have been interesting

878
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,919
and then that's right through

879
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,039
the specifics of who joined when and

880
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,039
what we were thinking about when that's

881
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,320
what led to 24 but

882
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,440
maybe we'll add another slide before 23

883
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,360
and then they'll both be a different

884
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,640
number

885
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,519
but

886
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,480
it does

887
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,919
bring up an interesting question

888
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,320
i think we could

889
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,279
look at well first dave thanks for

890
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,960
writing in the chat do you want to read

891
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,640
what you wrote or would you like me to

892
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,240
read what you have in the youtube live

893
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,480
chat

894
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,360
yeah um could i expand on it just

895
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,200
slightly please what i would have posted

896
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,799
if i didn't have the big limit

897
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,919
title necessary versus sufficient

898
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,159
two of the original concepts of general

899
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,120
systems theory have recently as of 1975

900
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,200
been resuscitated there's an admirable

901
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,279
discussion by russell akov

902
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,519
the first of the two concepts is that

903
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,840
whereas causal argument considers

904
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,399
necessary and sufficient or double

905
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,640
implication conditions

906
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,679
systematic theory or cyber systems

907
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,399
theory or cybernetic argument deals

908
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,440
primarily with a logic of necessary

909
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,440
conditions

910
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,440
see fred singer's discussion of the

911
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,880
producer

912
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,039
and product relations

913
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,360
and in summerhof this is called goal

914
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,559
relations

915
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,080
and i'd add

916
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,960
this deals with intentional action where

917
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,720
there are goals

918
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,600
uh

919
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,480
there's an old painful discussion going

920
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,679
back to

921
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,039
way before darwin that the world exists

922
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,039
only as push

923
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,399
galileo wanted to absolutely banish

924
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,279
goals of any kind any value had to be

925
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,720
absolutely

926
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,720
driven from science

927
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,640
if you say for the purpose of is get out

928
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,960
you're not a scientist

929
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,640
uh i continue

930
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,240
this notion underlies the more

931
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,080
sophisticated treatment of goals and

932
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,039
intentions conceivably partly specified

933
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,480
intentions

934
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,519
fuzzy goals goals with

935
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,000
um ill-defined uh

936
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,560
criteria which you might or might not be

937
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,320
aware of i would

938
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,879
the other concept of about the same

939
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,879
importance is the presupposition of a

940
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,839
systematic universe there is a tacit

941
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,079
assumption that things objects and other

942
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,960
elementary entities are interdependent

943
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,040
rather than being isolated units which

944
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,359
is the assumption behind the majority of

945
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,119
sciences

946
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,560
further as a result of their

947
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,280
interdependence or with the same meaning

948
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,679
of the supposition that things objects

949
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,960
and so on are not really unitary

950
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,839
these entities form systems and it is

951
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,639
systems which may be observed and

952
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,440
manipulated

953
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,560
so the notion that there's one and only

954
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,000
one way to approach an argument one and

955
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,880
only one order among

956
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,200
real things that are scientifically

957
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,800
respectable utterly wrong

958
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,280
utterly wrong if you can't work your

959
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,440
argument in at least two different

960
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,599
directions you haven't thought about

961
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,720
what your argument is

962
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,720
you don't know the boundaries you don't

963
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,240
know what it is

964
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,960
you don't know what a jellyfish is

965
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,480
you think you know what a jellyfish is

966
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,520
but you don't know the difference

967
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,359
between the inside and the outside you

968
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,640
may end up in the inside

969
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,400
so it's almost like if there's only one

970
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,359
way

971
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:41,040
to run through the argument that's when

972
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,280
necessity and sufficiency are easily

973
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,440
confused so if somebody just

974
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,760
drives in one lane from the beginning to

975
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,079
the end and i made my case

976
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,000
and that's all i have to say

977
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,280
well then

978
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,560
you've

979
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,320
implicitly through your actions your

980
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,079
enacted behavior you've uh

981
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,960
acted consistently as if what you had to

982
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,599
say was sufficient for making your case

983
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,520
the prosecution rests

984
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,280
and also it was necessary you think i've

985
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,800
included everything necessary and

986
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,640
sufficient so that's actually where you

987
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,320
get and here's maybe where we should

988
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,480
duplicate the slide again

989
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,560
you get that's an overlap of necessity

990
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,960
and sufficiency but then

991
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,560
if you did two

992
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,119
parallel arguments just you did one from

993
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,240
start to finish and the other one from

994
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,599
start to finish

995
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,359
now you could say

996
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:30,240
well

997
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,920
both of them

998
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,720
are

999
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,880
in their own timeline they were both

1000
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,880
necessary even if they have totally

1001
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,720
disjoint information that was being used

1002
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,880
and then what is the relationship of the

1003
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,839
goals

1004
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,440
there and that

1005
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,000
is kind of like dean's multiple eyes

1006
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,240
open giving us the perspective to look

1007
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,520
at goals

1008
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,440
when we have multiple realizations

1009
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,960
because it does help us distinguish

1010
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,200
necessity and sufficiency because we

1011
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,400
literally see

1012
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,640
well it could have been done a different

1013
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,599
way

1014
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,320
so it being done in way one

1015
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,720
can't be the whole story because we just

1016
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,680
saw it what done in way two

1017
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,359
dean

1018
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,280
i'm sorry dad

1019
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,280
you dropped off on me for a second there

1020
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,079
but

1021
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,839
so i wanted to ask david a question

1022
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,839
about

1023
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,960
yeah dean kind of drops in and out

1024
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,800
he was giving some funny descriptors of

1025
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,440
his internet hardware earlier it was

1026
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,720
pretty funny

1027
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,839
start again

1028
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:39,119
sorry um so i agree with with what david

1029
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,720
was saying and there's a there's a book

1030
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,560
called the origins of order project and

1031
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,520
system

1032
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,520
and what the author basically says is

1033
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,160
that projects are easy to

1034
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,320
get trapped in goal directed behavior

1035
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,839
whereas where if you

1036
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,000
can also hold up the system

1037
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,280
you can see

1038
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,520
the number the sort of the multitudes of

1039
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,839
different directions all at once and so

1040
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,280
i was wondering

1041
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,200
is is that

1042
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,280
does that sort of fit in with what david

1043
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,960
now was trying to speak to

1044
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,200
[Music]

1045
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,560
try to find out the author's name here

1046
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,440
um

1047
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,119
well stewart kaufman uh who is i think

1048
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,480
he has become a little more active

1049
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,960
recently i know they're pushing his book

1050
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,359
origins of order really hard that's

1051
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:25,599
something i read in like the 80s who's

1052
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,240
going

1053
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,200
this is a new one this is paul khan

1054
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,079
okay

1055
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,079
yeah okay k-a-h-n yeah k-h-n

1056
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,680
and he's and he's basically trying to

1057
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,680
use the argument that you can look at

1058
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,839
the constitution or you can look at the

1059
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,520
actual laws and and you hold up both

1060
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,000
one is goal directed the project piece

1061
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,440
whereas the other one is is is trying to

1062
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,160
work from within and around

1063
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,960
so that's it's that sort of between and

1064
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,359
inside argument and that's not the same

1065
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,079
as

1066
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,400
as projecting yourself to a particular

1067
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,800
outcome

1068
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,839
yeah i can't i can't answer that right

1069
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,440
now but i do want to tell a little quick

1070
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,760
story uh when i was working as a senior

1071
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,240
programmer analyst i was organizing this

1072
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,599
project it was going to take a couple of

1073
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:14,720
months

1074
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,960
and my super is kind of looking over my

1075
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,160
shoulder and i have the criteria and i

1076
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,720
have a big flow chart and he says oh so

1077
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,160
dave this is how you're going to do it

1078
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,839
and i said i haven't decided he said

1079
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,359
well wait a minute what's missing i mean

1080
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,200
you've you've got the whole thing laid

1081
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,119
out it looks like it ought to work and

1082
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,920
says yeah i haven't decided i've only

1083
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,079
done it one way there's no decisions

1084
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,440
involved in that

1085
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,119
i've just stated the requirements i

1086
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,560
didn't decide how to do it so then he

1087
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,040
went out and had a smoke

1088
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,520
i ended up using a much better technique

1089
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,000
that saved us a huge amount of rewrite

1090
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
that nobody would have noticed because

1091
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,160
they would have said oh yeah the answer

1092
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,480
go for it

1093
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,560
it's almost it's the zero to one which

1094
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,480
we've talked about and it's also related

1095
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,280
to

1096
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,240
act

1097
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,319
infer serve

1098
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,960
infer you'll have something to infer

1099
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,839
about

1100
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,319
when you've acted whether getting that

1101
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,720
first draft out or just doing a private

1102
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,800
voice memo or

1103
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,200
whatever stigma g you need you'll have

1104
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,440
something interesting to infer if you

1105
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,119
act i promise

1106
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,880
and then maybe you'll be closer to

1107
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,640
service than you expect

1108
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,319
but infer

1109
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,560
is still within the realm of like well

1110
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,720
what would be sufficient to get the job

1111
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,839
done

1112
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,119
but if you go well what would be

1113
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,760
necessary to do this one way

1114
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,520
this is what would be necessary we could

1115
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,040
um walk

1116
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,200
from california to new york

1117
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,599
that would be necessary for getting to

1118
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,040
new york okay

1119
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,800
it's gonna take too long i just don't

1120
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,319
have that kind of time

1121
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,040
what would be another way to do it

1122
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,680
so there is a almost

1123
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,079
a necessity and a sufficiency

1124
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,119
in

1125
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,520
action and inference

1126
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,240
where action has a lot more to do

1127
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,800
what's needed and

1128
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,520
inference or thought maybe moves us more

1129
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,280
towards thinking about

1130
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,920
what's sufficient

1131
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,599
not sure about that but also thanks for

1132
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,760
sharing this um

1133
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,000
this resource

1134
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,560
well and back to what david was saying i

1135
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,560
in the work that i was doing i often had

1136
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,160
people who

1137
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,119
who are very well versed in setting up

1138
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,960
all kinds of sophisticated projects

1139
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,280
asking me where's the project in this

1140
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,800
and me having to jump up and down and

1141
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,680
wave hands and say this isn't a project

1142
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,880
that's why

1143
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,680
we're doing it we don't know how it's

1144
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,079
going to turn out until we do and then

1145
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,400
we can look back on it and say well

1146
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,400
did we minimize free energy we weren't

1147
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,880
using minimizing free energy but

1148
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,400
because i wasn't you know first in that

1149
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,800
lexicon yet but that's essentially what

1150
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,680
we

1151
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,119
were doing

1152
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,440
we wouldn't know until we'd arrived that

1153
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,800
we'd arrived

1154
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,480
and that's that's really uncomfortable

1155
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,720
for people who were constantly saying

1156
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,280
show me the milestones

1157
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,000
okay well i can show you the stages

1158
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,720
and i can show you how identity identity

1159
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,319
is now in turning into identifying as

1160
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,760
people are are constantly processing who

1161
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,440
they are as they're

1162
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,119
on board this

1163
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,000
this

1164
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,160
this idea but i can't tell you

1165
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,480
what it's like because it's not

1166
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,319
necessarily goal directed other than the

1167
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,480
fact that we want to try to keep it open

1168
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,079
as long as we can

1169
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,319
and figure out what logic people are

1170
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,160
using in order to be able to untangle

1171
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,200
and

1172
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,680
and pull things out of hats that that

1173
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,079
others don't know how to do

1174
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,680
so yeah

1175
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,960
one other thing that makes me think

1176
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,079
about is grants applications

1177
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,960
so a grant application might frame

1178
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,440
things in terms implicitly

1179
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,160
or explicitly in terms of sufficiency if

1180
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,800
you fund me we're going to

1181
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,760
fix this disease like this is the grant

1182
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,599
that will be sufficient for fixing this

1183
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:12,880
disease

1184
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,280
whereas saying that it's a necessary

1185
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,280
step like we do need to understand how

1186
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,240
protein one two three works

1187
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,480
it'll be necessary but it's not the

1188
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,880
whole picture it's not sufficient

1189
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,359
so so much

1190
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,000
when we really turn it over

1191
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,599
is related to

1192
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,440
necessity

1193
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,119
because there's so many things that are

1194
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,560
necessary

1195
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,400
and so little

1196
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,280
save for totally exhaustive examinations

1197
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,599
of really contrived systems

1198
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,800
so rarely do we find sufficiency because

1199
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,960
if you can define sufficiency

1200
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,119
you can make that bacteria in the test

1201
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,200
tube de novo

1202
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,880
and then life

1203
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,560
it's kind of like puts a little twist on

1204
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,520
it like what would be necessary and

1205
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,200
sufficient for having a bacteria in a

1206
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,720
test tube

1207
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,040
putting a pre-existing bacteria in and

1208
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,960
having it replicate

1209
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,160
so life as this paper explores

1210
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,079
it sort of threads the needle of

1211
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,079
necessity and sufficiency

1212
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,240
because the past

1213
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,800
is necessary and sufficient for living

1214
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,240
systems to be in the state that they're

1215
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,440
in now

1216
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,079
and so that's like the generalization as

1217
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,920
well as the minute particulars

1218
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,680
if anyone wants to ask a question

1219
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,520
otherwise i think it's good to take a

1220
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,599
second look at

1221
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,800
the numerical example yes blue first

1222
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,880
so just like

1223
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,920
what got us to this point the past is

1224
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,960
necessary but not sufficient but it just

1225
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,440
just echoes the title like how did we

1226
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,800
even get here right

1227
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,000
yes

1228
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,560
so let's look at that

1229
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,040
bacteria and then of course we can jump

1230
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,079
around

1231
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,040
anywhere else

1232
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,760
okay so the numerical example is of a

1233
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,800
sensing

1234
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,760
and feeling a sentient bacteria not

1235
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,680
necessarily experiencing

1236
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,560
and action isn't even in the loop here

1237
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,280
but it's a sensing bacteria

1238
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,720
and so

1239
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,640
the organism

1240
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,880
is inferring its prior beliefs about the

1241
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,520
cause of the observations it makes

1242
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,240
so it has a prior

1243
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,040
let's just go over the um sort of

1244
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,920
letters again so there's a class of

1245
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,920
events for the organism so this is like

1246
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,720
we need a special color or some metadata

1247
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,680
tag like how can we tag map

1248
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,640
and how can we tag territory let's just

1249
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,920
use like

1250
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,040
one set of colors or one font like map

1251
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,480
comic sans

1252
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,560
territory some

1253
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,079
calligraphy script or something like

1254
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:57,200
that

1255
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,560
for the organism

1256
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,040
of the organism now it's our map of the

1257
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,040
organisms map

1258
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,160
a and b

1259
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,720
are events that are part of the class r

1260
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,000
and so r is like the receptor state

1261
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,280
and then

1262
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,720
a and b

1263
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,520
are inferred downstream of a chemical

1264
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,560
signal

1265
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,560
which is s so s is like for signal and s

1266
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,640
is whether the actual molecule on the

1267
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,359
outside is the a or the b

1268
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,440
so this is kind of a discrete binary

1269
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,119
choice

1270
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,880
it's briefly discussed in the paper like

1271
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,920
what happens if there's multiple

1272
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,920
molecules or one could imagine that

1273
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,520
what's being inferred is a continuous

1274
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,520
variable like blood sugar

1275
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,520
but alpha and beta

1276
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,319
are s that's the outside stuff

1277
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,000
and then a and b

1278
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,240
are the organisms

1279
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,400
receptor inference

1280
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,640
blue

1281
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,880
go ahead and then i i'll just both end

1282
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,040
yeah so just to sort of

1283
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,520
look at it in figure one or in the

1284
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,520
formalism uh block that's in the paper

1285
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,400
the organism has a prior and it's the

1286
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,040
specification of priors

1287
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,800
that differentiate

1288
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,200
bayesian statistics versus frequentist

1289
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,480
statistics

1290
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,800
among a few other pieces but that's

1291
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,280
really the key piece and so the prior

1292
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,720
p of r

1293
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,760
is 80 20 in favor of a

1294
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,559
so

1295
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,079
a priori

1296
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,280
before how did you get there but a

1297
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,960
priori it's 80

1298
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,680
likely that it's a and 20 b before any

1299
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,280
info comes in

1300
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,400
then there's a likelihood mapping so

1301
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,119
that's the the distribution of the

1302
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,480
signal conditioned on the receptor state

1303
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,240
so we're talking about what's the

1304
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,800
probability of alpha

1305
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,160
outside

1306
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,400
conditioned on a and b and so it's 70

1307
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,559
a and 30 for b

1308
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,400
and vice versa

1309
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,200
so what's interesting about this is

1310
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,559
that's a pretty noisy signal

1311
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,480
it's really only saying it's like if it

1312
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,160
were 50 50 it'd be a useless signal

1313
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,760
because it wouldn't

1314
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,200
knowing it one way well it would also

1315
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,599
depend a little bit on the frequency of

1316
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,160
alpha and beta but

1317
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,119
this is

1318
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,079
a very noisy signal like 30 of the time

1319
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,720
the receptor is giving the wrong

1320
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,839
answer

1321
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,240
so this is a way to show that with

1322
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,839
multiple

1323
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,559
uncertainties connected the right way

1324
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,440
you can actually tighten your estimate

1325
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,079
because in this example with the 80

1326
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:39,599
prior on a

1327
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,440
and then a 70

1328
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,960
likelihood mapping

1329
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,200
which is also a that's more like classic

1330
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,480
active

1331
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,880
jargon

1332
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,040
after observing alpha

1333
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,400
it turns out

1334
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,359
that the estimate of a

1335
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:58,559
the estimate of alpha

1336
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:01,440
the estimate of state being a

1337
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,880
conditioned on alpha being observed

1338
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,640
tightens that prior

1339
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,440
from 0.8 to 0.9

1340
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,240
so

1341
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,000
there's still a tightening of the prior

1342
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,160
by a significant amount

1343
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,440
even though

1344
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,680
the mapping between the molecule and the

1345
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,280
receptor state

1346
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,520
is somewhat noisy

1347
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,559
so that's like a bayesian bacteria it's

1348
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,280
just applying bayes rule

1349
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,319
to this

1350
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,400
simple binary

1351
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,280
outcome that it's doing inference on

1352
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,559
blue any thoughts there

1353
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,599
yeah so uh you know i this goes back to

1354
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,440
something that dean brought up in the

1355
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,920
dot zero like is oh and it's actually

1356
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,520
something that axel wrote in the paper

1357
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,160
like is the prior subjective or

1358
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,359
objective

1359
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,839
um and like the mis dysfunctional

1360
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,720
requires and the survivability of

1361
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,119
organisms with dysfunctional fires

1362
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,240
so i just feel like i mean i know axel

1363
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,640
says it's subjective but i feel like

1364
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,119
it's nested so i feel like there's the

1365
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,160
prior must be a subjective prior over

1366
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,520
and objective frequency right like so so

1367
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,040
if i frequently observe you know

1368
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,119
sunshine outside when it's warm or

1369
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,599
something like that like if mostly when

1370
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,200
it's more when i feel warm i absorb

1371
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,599
sunshine so when i have these two things

1372
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,920
linked like based on that frequency i

1373
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,319
then make a subjective assumption and

1374
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:29,839
and that's how i feel that the the

1375
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:32,079
structure of the prior um

1376
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,400
kind of has to be

1377
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,720
otherwise like it doesn't make sense to

1378
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,200
put the math into the prior

1379
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,400
um like like in my mind like if you

1380
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,440
can't

1381
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,119
if an objective prior is based on

1382
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,800
frequencies but a subjective prior is

1383
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,720
not a subjective priors

1384
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,559
i guess but it's a guess over the

1385
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:51,839
frequencies i don't know i feel like

1386
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,920
there's like an extra layer that needs

1387
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,240
to be tucked into the subjective prior

1388
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,280
if you're gonna put math there

1389
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,240
one

1390
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,920
way that that's dealt with empirically

1391
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,920
and then dean is what's called

1392
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,559
parametric empirical base

1393
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,960
and in parametric empirical bays you

1394
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,119
kind of start with just

1395
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:13,920
the prior being what you observed in the

1396
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,839
past so if you had eight sunny days and

1397
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,280
two rainy days

1398
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,040
that's where that point eight and point

1399
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,200
two prior comes from

1400
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,480
so

1401
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,760
it's um

1402
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,240
not a way around specifying a prior it

1403
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,599
just starts your prior in a place that's

1404
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,760
empirically grounded

1405
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,920
dean

1406
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,240
yeah um

1407
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,400
so i think in the point zero two i was i

1408
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,119
was

1409
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,119
trying to figure out how

1410
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,520
the likelihood is really

1411
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,240
the

1412
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,440
the kind of background that we have

1413
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,800
and that's what blue is kind of talking

1414
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,319
to you and i was wondering about in

1415
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:52,880
terms of context because if i see a

1416
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,319
black dot on a on a white background i

1417
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,800
think of period whereas if i see

1418
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,559
a white dot and a

1419
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,720
in a

1420
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,160
in in black background with a whole

1421
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,079
bunch of white dots i think how many

1422
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,160
light years away is that concentration

1423
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,680
of hydrogen right

1424
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,480
so again we could d we could

1425
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,400
decontextualize this

1426
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,200
but

1427
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,119
but if we do

1428
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:18,960
d decontextualize and this is where it

1429
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,480
gets really hard for me i get lost in

1430
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,079
all of the terms but

1431
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,119
if we do

1432
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,280
decontextualize it

1433
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,720
does that

1434
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,640
does that help us in any way understand

1435
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,160
both the subjective

1436
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:30,839
and

1437
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:34,000
objective factors in play that's all i'm

1438
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,160
i'm wondering about and again

1439
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,160
i get i get lost in the number of

1440
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,839
different ways to be able to describe

1441
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:42,160
this that's part of my problem i have an

1442
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,400
upper limit on how much of this stuff i

1443
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,000
can do once if you want me to focus on

1444
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,119
days

1445
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:48,880
i can do that that's hard enough for me

1446
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,559
to concentrate on that

1447
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,400
but if you actually think about this

1448
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,040
okay so what does this actually imply in

1449
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,359
terms of entailment

1450
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:58,960
then it gets really really tricky

1451
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,359
because i can't just focus on one thing

1452
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:03,280
at once i gotta sort of think about what

1453
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,920
all the implications of that are and

1454
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,440
man can never go off in different

1455
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,359
directions all at the same time so i

1456
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:11,599
don't want to be too tangential here but

1457
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,640
yeah that i i'm still not sure whether

1458
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,359
the subjectivity in isolation can work

1459
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:20,880
i'm not saying it can't i don't know

1460
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,559
thanks dean blue then dave

1461
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,599
so in like the empirical parametric base

1462
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,680
that would be like an objective prior

1463
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,839
like do you have subjectivity in

1464
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:34,160
empirical parametric base because like

1465
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,440
that's what axel was describing in the

1466
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,200
paper you do you can have an objective

1467
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,760
prior based on frequencies like it's 80

1468
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,240
of the time you know sunny and 20 of the

1469
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,000
time rainy and so you you get these

1470
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,920
frequencies and that's what goes into

1471
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,160
constructing an objective prior but but

1472
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,839
when it comes to like an organism and a

1473
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:51,440
choice or even like a scientist

1474
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,000
conducting an experiment you know like

1475
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,680
why would you even do the experiment in

1476
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,599
the first place you have a guess right

1477
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,520
like you have something that you think

1478
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,880
will be the outcome and so like a

1479
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,200
totally subjective prior is like well i

1480
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,079
think

1481
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:05,440
sixty percent of the time it's going to

1482
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,160
be

1483
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,599
blah blah blah and like that's a

1484
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,440
completely subjective prior it's just

1485
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,000
your best guess which which if you're

1486
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,160
gonna try to really do objective

1487
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,839
bayesian analysis

1488
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,400
like you need to have a flat prior not

1489
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,640
your best guess right you need to have

1490
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,720
your prior needs to come from previous

1491
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,880
observations and not you guessing but

1492
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,520
but you could very well like not you

1493
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,599
know do a very empirical or objective

1494
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,680
bayesian analysis and just say my guess

1495
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,440
is this and then you count make the

1496
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,440
observations observe the frequencies you

1497
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,319
know you go through the entire time step

1498
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,000
and then at your next time step there is

1499
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
that tightening between the likelihood

1500
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,400
the previous likelihood and the prior so

1501
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,880
that that is um

1502
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,440
i mean as far as i understand it now i'm

1503
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,440
definitely not an expert but so i think

1504
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,720
like the subjectivity and objectivity

1505
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,920
is

1506
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,079
i don't know i think that there's some

1507
00:54:58,079 --> 00:54:59,760
some link there like i get it for

1508
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,760
scientific bayesian data analysis like

1509
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,520
you want to have a flat prior you want

1510
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,680
to do objective analysis you want to use

1511
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,119
you know the previous frequencies or

1512
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:08,319
whatever but

1513
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:11,359
i think that um you know in terms of a

1514
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,520
mental calculation

1515
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,920
it's also over frequencies or it's your

1516
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,760
best guess like what do you think will

1517
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,280
be the outcome and it's not always

1518
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,520
doesn't always line up right

1519
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,400
thanks blue dave

1520
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,119
yeah um

1521
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:28,440
the term

1522
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,040
decontextualized i i kind of that

1523
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,920
shocked me when professor jaron started

1524
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,839
using that it's just he contextualized

1525
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,640
what that that's just some some

1526
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,559
jerk opens his mouth and blood he

1527
00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:44,799
contextualized his feelings at me and

1528
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,559
you know if i want to know what's going

1529
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,880
on i hyper contextualize i've been

1530
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,960
particularly attentive to my own

1531
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,280
prejudices and my own viewpoint you'll

1532
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,599
think about what goes you know einstein

1533
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,680
hated the word relativity he wanted to

1534
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,520
come up with something like hyper

1535
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,440
contextualized or the real world or the

1536
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,359
the um

1537
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:08,400
the tenser description uh

1538
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,720
where you don't have to ask where are

1539
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,280
you because you have the structure of

1540
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,640
the world

1541
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,680
um

1542
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,480
what do people mean by by d contextual

1543
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,920
odds uh is it is it a term of praise as

1544
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,240
well as a term of contempt or have i

1545
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,960
just always misunderstood

1546
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,960
blue

1547
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,119
so i love this term hyper contextualized

1548
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:33,839
and

1549
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:35,520
i i don't know that i would use it in

1550
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,839
the way that you use it dave i i would

1551
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:39,119
use it like

1552
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,160
um

1553
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,319
i would play out all of the potential

1554
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,480
like what ifs like

1555
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,400
like let's talk about counter factuals

1556
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,480
can we can we put it into you know how

1557
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,119
many different contexts will it fit um

1558
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,880
and that's when when i think about hyper

1559
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,119
contextualization it's like playing out

1560
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:59,599
all the potential scenarios for me

1561
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,359
thanks dean

1562
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:03,920
yeah and building building on what blue

1563
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,040
just said

1564
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,079
um

1565
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:09,680
so i i saw a youtube video where a guy

1566
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,440
figured out a way to

1567
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,400
make a target move so that no matter

1568
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,160
where you threw the dart as long as you

1569
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,880
were directing it towards the dart board

1570
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,200
the target would create

1571
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,200
the algorithm would create the target

1572
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,880
moving so that you hit a bullseye every

1573
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,680
time

1574
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,920
and i was a phys ed teacher

1575
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,000
i was like oh this is amazing and i took

1576
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,760
it to one of my colleagues

1577
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,599
who shall remain nameless and i said we

1578
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,440
should show this video

1579
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,799
to the kids and he was like why

1580
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:40,319
and i said well think about it every

1581
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:43,119
time a person moves their hands

1582
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:44,960
to catch the ball

1583
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,160
they're making the same kind of

1584
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,760
adjustment and it was like a light went

1585
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,960
off

1586
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,720
a lot of the things that i was that i

1587
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:54,160
was coaching were then decontextualized

1588
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,680
and the proof was in the fact that when

1589
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,960
you saw

1590
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,280
something out of context that was

1591
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,079
running the same parallel function

1592
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,119
you didn't necessarily recognize it so

1593
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:07,359
this was a really i i love hyper

1594
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,160
contextualized

1595
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,400
so i wonder if that's like abstraction

1596
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,599
or

1597
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:14,400
d

1598
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,280
irrelevant contextualizing you take away

1599
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,359
the irrelevant part of that

1600
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:21,760
setting which is oh it's hands or some

1601
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,240
other specific system

1602
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,000
and then that

1603
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,079
paradoxically

1604
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,079
gets you to hyper contextualize because

1605
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:31,040
it does

1606
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,559
highlight the parts of the context

1607
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:38,000
that matter dave

1608
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,440
and there's that famous phrase from 1923

1609
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,880
consciousness

1610
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,000
of abstracting

1611
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,920
training people to think scientifically

1612
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,319
one of the first things you do is get

1613
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:52,960
them really aware that they're how much

1614
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,839
they're missing you're abstracting away

1615
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:57,920
from at least 90 of whatever you're

1616
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,559
looking at

1617
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,839
uh and since i've got the mic um

1618
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:06,319
there was the question of how a fielder

1619
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:08,559
catches a baseball

1620
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:10,720
a fly ball here it comes it's coming out

1621
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,640
of the sky at you

1622
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,040
and you know the good fielder knows how

1623
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,960
to do that you ask him how you well i

1624
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,880
just i just go to where the ball is

1625
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,079
going to be

1626
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:21,839
but he can't tell you how and there were

1627
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:24,000
a bunch of people mathematicians and

1628
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,799
programmers and physiologists

1629
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:28,880
and philosophers trying to how in the

1630
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,400
world are they doing this it looks like

1631
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,160
they can't because we can't come up with

1632
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,400
an algorithm that doesn't and they

1633
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,599
finally

1634
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:36,960
watch them

1635
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,920
and i guess they got one one one guy

1636
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,000
that's high on

1637
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,640
whatever it is openness the big five

1638
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,559
uh and and they says well what are you

1639
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,880
doing how do you know that you're gonna

1640
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,359
catch the ball oh i i know i'm gonna

1641
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:53,359
catch the ball when i look at it and it

1642
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:55,680
doesn't move

1643
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,400
it doesn't move yeah it just hangs there

1644
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,079
and i put up my my mitt and it since

1645
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:04,720
it's i know where it's going it's going

1646
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:05,760
to my mitt

1647
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,920
and it's not moving and it's in my mid

1648
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,319
and it didn't move then either

1649
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:11,760
that's how they get there they figure

1650
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,799
out what point in the field makes it

1651
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:17,680
look like the ball's not going to move

1652
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,359
as it comes toward there and that's

1653
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:20,400
where you go

1654
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,839
and then just

1655
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:25,839
hangs in the field till it's in your mid

1656
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:28,960
classic baseball physics

1657
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,799
the thing i thought was have you ever

1658
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:33,839
been high on openness

1659
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:36,319
but then it's true there is a simple

1660
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:38,160
algorithm like if you're looking and

1661
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,680
it's to the left then you should go to

1662
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,880
the left if you're looking it's to the

1663
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,119
right and then you're

1664
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,319
cool active baseball and anticipation

1665
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:48,960
and the path of least action

1666
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,040
blue

1667
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,799
you want to talk about high on openness

1668
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:54,640
i don't know that it reminds me of our

1669
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,480
conversations with adam saffron right

1670
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,359
and so

1671
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:00,319
like what the psychedelic like

1672
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:02,000
i would like to see like the psychedelic

1673
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,920
like comparison with big five like the

1674
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,400
integration of those two kind of things

1675
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,000
in terms of active inference because i

1676
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,520
do think that um the openness like

1677
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,520
increases a lot under under the

1678
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,319
psychedelic influence and so it's um

1679
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,000
not have you been high on openness but

1680
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,160
has being high ever made you more open

1681
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,200
maybe is a different question

1682
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,040
and well a few things there's sort of

1683
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:29,280
the um rebus sevis albus relaxation of

1684
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,119
beliefs under psychedelic strengthening

1685
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:33,040
or just the altering of beliefs with

1686
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:36,079
fristen carhar harris saffron

1687
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:40,160
and what is being what priors are being

1688
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,119
opened which priors are being tightened

1689
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,040
and that was sort of at the heart of the

1690
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,079
rebus versus cebus and then the sort of

1691
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,280
um hegelian synthesis in albus and then

1692
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:55,359
also in terms of how we got here

1693
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:58,319
the first two weeks of january was live

1694
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,640
stream number 13

1695
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,079
with

1696
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:03,039
adam

1697
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:04,559
and colleague

1698
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:07,680
on the cybernetic big five

1699
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,480
and so that actually sort of started our

1700
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:11,760
year

1701
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,760
with thinking about how

1702
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,200
frameworks that

1703
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,520
a priori have nothing to do with actinf

1704
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,160
or fep like big five was a principal

1705
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,319
component analysis based

1706
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:25,760
variance decom uh various partitioning

1707
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,880
on psychometric data

1708
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:29,839
yet

1709
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:31,280
we saw how

1710
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,200
active could help us

1711
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,400
reimagine that

1712
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,480
and generalize it

1713
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,280
while also bringing action into the loop

1714
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,520
so then it's kind of cool to see how the

1715
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:45,359
personality traits come back into play

1716
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:47,039
uh dave

1717
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,880
and then we're going to return to base

1718
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:49,920
and then we're going to move into the

1719
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,680
variational free energy

1720
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,720
well stop me if i already mentioned this

1721
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,079
but um

1722
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:57,920
there's been some

1723
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:58,960
uh

1724
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,880
criminological studies of the way

1725
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,839
psychedelics are used by

1726
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:07,680
as a recruiting tool of violent cults

1727
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,359
you go to a rally

1728
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:11,839
in favor i will not say whom

1729
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:13,119
and if somebody seems like they're

1730
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:15,280
really grooving and really into it you

1731
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,359
give them a little ecstasy and that

1732
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:20,160
locks them into the mentality

1733
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,559
and if he's kind of getting fired up but

1734
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:24,319
but he's not quite with it you take him

1735
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:26,640
home give him some lsd and take him to

1736
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:27,760
the session

1737
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,599
and that moves him out of what he was in

1738
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,440
and moves him into where he needs to be

1739
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,559
in order to do the right things in life

1740
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,400
maybe another a little bit of ecstasy

1741
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,400
now and then over subsequent months to

1742
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,920
just get him locked back in where he

1743
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,960
needs to be just like

1744
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,280
just like safran was saying you either

1745
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,160
get him out of the of where he is or you

1746
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,960
get him right back right deep into where

1747
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,319
he is

1748
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:55,359
well there's a long history of

1749
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:58,000
people engaging in experiences taking

1750
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,319
substances to move their

1751
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:03,440
psychodynamics one way or the other um

1752
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,720
i think

1753
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,520
the active streams verge on it but we

1754
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,559
also

1755
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:10,559
remind people to be responsible and

1756
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:11,599
legal

1757
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:14,160
with their behavior and with the one and

1758
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,720
only brain and mind that they have

1759
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:20,079
let's return to the bayesian maths and

1760
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:22,799
then see how that bayesian bacteria

1761
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:25,359
moves into the variational free energy

1762
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:26,799
bacteria

1763
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:29,200
but i pulled out that one

1764
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,520
quote from a um online statistics

1765
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:35,039
resource so we can you know uh

1766
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:36,960
the 0.0

1767
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,520
is the frequentest bacteria

1768
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,280
and so the frequentist

1769
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,520
is basically looking at the outcome of

1770
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,760
an experiment

1771
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,760
you flip the coin ten times it comes up

1772
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,160
seven heads and three

1773
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,640
tails now that's not the most likely

1774
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,359
possible outcome

1775
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:57,440
for a fair coin but it's totally not an

1776
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,359
unexpected outcome

1777
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:00,240
so

1778
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,559
in that case the frequencies can produce

1779
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:04,319
a 95

1780
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:06,160
confidence interval

1781
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,640
given the variance granted by the sample

1782
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:09,599
size

1783
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:13,119
and say okay if if i get um within these

1784
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:14,799
two numbers

1785
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:18,079
um then i'm going to fail to reject the

1786
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,240
hypothesis that it's fair if i'm outside

1787
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,839
of those two numbers with my empirical

1788
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:24,640
results i will reject at a given p-value

1789
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,000
a given alpha

1790
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,559
and so for the frequentist there's no

1791
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,240
sense in asking about the probability

1792
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,240
that the coin is fair it is either fair

1793
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,559
or not fair so that's like accept the

1794
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,160
hypothesis

1795
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,599
implicitly because of the failure to

1796
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,799
reject or reject the null hypothesis in

1797
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:43,440
favor of a specified alternative

1798
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,880
the frequentists make statements about

1799
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,039
the probability of a sample after making

1800
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:48,640
an assumption about the population

1801
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,799
parameter which is just the kind of

1802
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:53,280
average out approach average out value

1803
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:56,319
of the probability of tossing a heads

1804
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:57,520
the bayesian

1805
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,720
in contrast

1806
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,839
starts with information about coins

1807
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:04,960
so specifies some distribution so it

1808
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,720
could be like a bell curve

1809
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,520
a gaussian centered at 0.5

1810
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,079
it could be a super tight prior could be

1811
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:14,559
a very loose prior and then the extreme

1812
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:16,400
case of the gaussian with infinite

1813
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,200
variance is the uniform distribution

1814
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,599
and so that is like a flat across all

1815
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:24,559
the possible values

1816
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,319
that probability assessment of the heads

1817
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:27,599
proportion is called the prior

1818
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:29,680
probability each person might have their

1819
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,119
individual assessment based on their

1820
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:33,039
personal experience called a subjective

1821
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:34,880
prior

1822
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,559
alternatively a prior probability

1823
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:38,240
distribution might be selected on good

1824
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,760
properties of the resulting estimates

1825
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,760
called an objective prior

1826
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,359
i don't know if this is the only way to

1827
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:45,599
use subjective and objective in the

1828
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:48,319
bayesian context but this is just

1829
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:49,520
an important difference between

1830
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,559
frequentism and bayesian so

1831
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:55,200
here is our bayesian bacteria

1832
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:58,640
again it has some a matrix

1833
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,760
that's mapping the signal conditioned on

1834
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,280
the receptor state and then it has a

1835
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,400
prior over those receptor states

1836
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,400
that bayesian bacteria

1837
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,400
then again it's a bayesian perceiving

1838
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,400
bacteria we're not bringing action into

1839
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,000
the loop yet but we're just assuming

1840
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,880
like if you had the right estimate then

1841
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,559
it would be easier to know what to do

1842
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:19,760
correctly

1843
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:23,440
um this is called exact base

1844
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,319
because the exact numbers are plugged in

1845
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:28,079
and then there's some exact number that

1846
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:29,920
comes out and it's pretty much just

1847
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,480
granted by bayes rule

1848
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,920
what's the issue

1849
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,400
well it's unclear whether living systems

1850
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,400
have sufficient computational power to

1851
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,960
accomplish that especially when there's

1852
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,400
just massive

1853
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,799
multivariate landscapes

1854
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:45,599
so

1855
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:48,720
what is the answer in the fep

1856
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:49,599
well

1857
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:51,039
instead of doing

1858
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:53,039
exact base

1859
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:54,960
there's what's called variational

1860
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,400
bayesian inference

1861
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,039
so here we're going to propose this

1862
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:00,720
q

1863
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:01,839
function

1864
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:04,640
and the q function is going to be from a

1865
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:05,839
family

1866
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:09,200
that is specified a priori

1867
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:12,240
and it is more easily fit

1868
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,920
than just sort of the exact base

1869
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,880
and then the way that we compare

1870
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,040
is not by comparing at the end the

1871
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,279
posterior likelihood

1872
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:25,759
but rather we can compare

1873
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:26,880
different

1874
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,319
options

1875
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:30,399
by comparing their

1876
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:32,080
free energy

1877
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,399
and this is how free energy is being

1878
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:36,080
defined here

1879
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,839
it's the negative

1880
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:38,640
sum

1881
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,000
over r those are the receptor states

1882
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,679
a and b

1883
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:46,319
of some q distribution

1884
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:48,799
and then the natural log of the joint

1885
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:50,319
distribution

1886
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:54,319
of the states r and the signal alpha

1887
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:55,839
multiplied

1888
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:57,520
uh then

1889
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,520
divided by qr

1890
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,479
and so then in dot zero we explored a

1891
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:04,238
little bit about how that's like the

1892
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:06,799
recognition model that's like we're

1893
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:09,198
going contingent on alpha and now we're

1894
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:11,839
doing a hyper parameter estimate like

1895
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:13,920
alpha we're going to a

1896
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,920
and then what we're not going to be

1897
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,679
exploring here is like a generative

1898
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:19,439
model and then we talked about how those

1899
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:21,679
map onto perception and action in the

1900
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:22,880
world

1901
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,839
so then the numerical example shows that

1902
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:28,719
okay so the bayesian bacteria it did the

1903
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:30,880
right thing it didn't go to that rally

1904
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,960
that dave was telling it to go to

1905
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,399
but we can also have a free energy

1906
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:38,799
minimizing

1907
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,640
creature bacterium

1908
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,880
and we're going to see a case in which

1909
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,799
the free energy minimization does the

1910
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:46,479
right thing and we're going to see a

1911
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:48,158
case where the free energy minimization

1912
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:49,600
does the wrong thing

1913
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,399
the difference between these two cases

1914
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:54,640
is going to be the prior

1915
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,080
that's set

1916
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,719
and so that is the crux of the argument

1917
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:00,800
that minimizing free energy is not

1918
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,719
sufficient to be alive aka make the

1919
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:04,000
right decisions

1920
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,320
because both of these examples

1921
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,040
are going to minimize free energy and

1922
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,880
one of them is going to minimize free

1923
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,440
energy in the right direction

1924
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,360
and make the right choice because it had

1925
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:18,239
appropriate priors a maladaptive priors

1926
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:20,239
can minimize free energy but still

1927
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:22,000
result in the wrong outcome

1928
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,280
so in this case

1929
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,360
we have the free energy calculation

1930
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,159
for

1931
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:27,360
um this

1932
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,120
80 20

1933
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,360
prior with a favor of a

1934
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,400
and

1935
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,440
contingent on observing alpha

1936
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,920
the free energy of this is 0.47 which

1937
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,679
doesn't have an interpretation as a

1938
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:42,000
probability importantly

1939
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,520
so that we're not within that zero to

1940
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,360
one bounded space

1941
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,400
and then

1942
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,400
um in contrast

1943
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,480
the representation of b

1944
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:54,480
so that q r setting that to b

1945
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,960
that has a free energy of 2.2

1946
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,920
so free energy minimization

1947
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:03,040
saves the day in that context

1948
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,239
however it's not simply because the free

1949
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,000
energy was minimized that the right

1950
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,719
decision was reached here is a creature

1951
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:13,840
with a prior on b of 0.8

1952
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:14,880
and then

1953
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,239
we see that

1954
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:17,760
just barely

1955
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,920
upon observing alpha

1956
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,360
the free energy

1957
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,840
of representing b after sensing a is

1958
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,920
0.96 and the f when representing a after

1959
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:31,520
sensing alpha is 1.094

1960
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,480
so

1961
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,199
the enzing posterior likelihood

1962
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:38,320
is 63 percent in favor of b

1963
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:41,440
and 37 in favor of a

1964
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:42,239
so

1965
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:43,679
we sort of

1966
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:46,880
did move the needle towards

1967
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:47,679
a

1968
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:49,679
because we observed alpha

1969
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:52,480
but our prior was so far off

1970
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,560
that just one cycle of free energy

1971
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,880
minimization still results in the wrong

1972
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,000
outcome

1973
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,320
that's the crux of the numerical example

1974
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,320
provided in this paper

1975
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,560
and the only point that it's being made

1976
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,640
not this is how you'd model a bacteria

1977
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,880
with the fep

1978
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,360
the point it's making is free energy

1979
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:15,839
minimization is not sufficient for life

1980
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,239
dean

1981
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:21,360
so daniel i got a question to ask so

1982
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,199
i don't know because we're just talking

1983
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:25,679
about sensing we're not talking about

1984
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:27,040
you mentioned

1985
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,840
doing but i is it is it is it doing or

1986
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,760
is it directing so

1987
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,080
because of the sample

1988
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,760
sense

1989
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,440
and because of what the

1990
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,560
math

1991
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,320
points to should we think of this kind

1992
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,040
of analogous to a compass we're pointed

1993
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,320
in the right direction we still haven't

1994
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:47,440
actually acted or developed a feeling

1995
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,520
from the sense yet we're just we're

1996
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,760
still pre

1997
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:55,360
doing we're we're we're orienting is

1998
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,159
that

1999
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:58,560
or am i

2000
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,880
wrong

2001
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,280
so if anyone else has a thought after

2002
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,520
this so let's let's i think there's two

2003
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,040
few aspects to this compass and

2004
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,719
orienting approach

2005
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:10,080
so

2006
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:13,040
this little toy motif

2007
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,440
about the recognition model

2008
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,360
about having a prior

2009
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,199
overstates in the world and then getting

2010
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:21,199
some input

2011
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:24,320
that could be plugged into an action

2012
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,199
model

2013
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:27,840
in a slightly more elaborate case so for

2014
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,600
example as written in the caption for

2015
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,280
figure one

2016
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,120
more biologically realistic descriptions

2017
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,960
of behavior require discussion of active

2018
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,640
inference

2019
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,960
they require it it's necessary and

2020
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,440
sufficient you just have to do it

2021
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:42,960
behavior is the result of a different

2022
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,040
inference process that of an action

2023
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,040
policy so pi

2024
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,360
is not here in this bacteria

2025
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,760
this involves more priors namely about

2026
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,239
the transition between hidden states and

2027
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:56,880
often about preferred sensory outcomes

2028
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,040
so inactive inference with a partially

2029
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,679
observable markov decision process we've

2030
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:03,840
seen how there's like a matrix of the

2031
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,239
transition frequency b

2032
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:09,199
between the states at one time and the

2033
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:10,800
states at the next time

2034
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,679
and then policies are inferred

2035
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:16,320
based upon which policies minimize free

2036
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,840
energy

2037
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,760
which ones are going to have the best

2038
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,600
chance through time

2039
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,480
of bringing states

2040
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,600
into alignment with preference

2041
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:30,960
the other thing that it made me think

2042
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,560
about with the compass

2043
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:35,840
is like the exact base

2044
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:36,880
just

2045
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,320
returns um a probability

2046
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,480
and that is sort of like one compass

2047
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,000
needle

2048
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:44,880
uh

2049
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,960
giving you just saying okay you're going

2050
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,800
north by northwest or whatever it

2051
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,679
happens to be this is your one estimate

2052
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:54,480
you could be wildly off but given where

2053
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:55,520
you were

2054
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,440
and then just one blip of information

2055
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,120
that's where your compass needle is now

2056
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,800
pointing to

2057
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,840
free energy it's almost like there's

2058
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,840
two compass needles in this binary

2059
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,040
choice

2060
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,840
and then we're going to

2061
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:13,199
select which one has a lower free energy

2062
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:15,199
because we're looking the fact that this

2063
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:16,960
is 0.478

2064
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:19,920
f and this was 2.27

2065
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,560
they don't have a natural interpretation

2066
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,719
just like entropies you can talk about

2067
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:26,560
the difference in entropy

2068
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,960
but something having like

2069
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:29,840
four

2070
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,159
doesn't have an interpretation in the

2071
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:33,440
world

2072
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,239
and so it's kind of um maybe like

2073
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:38,159
there's two different compass needles

2074
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:39,360
and we're looking at the difference

2075
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,880
between them or we're going to select

2076
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,679
the one that has a lower free energy

2077
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:45,280
dean

2078
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,440
yeah i don't want to say that orienting

2079
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,440
isn't a form of doing as well

2080
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,600
it's just that what the what this shows

2081
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,719
what this shows me is that like you

2082
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:57,440
i you i cut out again but

2083
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:01,199
when we're when we're trying to

2084
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:03,440
when we're trying to determine

2085
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:04,880
a and b

2086
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,560
with a background

2087
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,480
um we haven't taken an action step we

2088
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,719
haven't developed a feeling yet

2089
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:13,199
do we do we categorize that's

2090
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:15,199
differently than if we were to look at

2091
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:17,199
this through an active inference lens

2092
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:18,080
where

2093
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,600
we would then

2094
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,920
push a policy forward right

2095
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,440
so i'm not sure it is the orienting

2096
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,600
fitting you fit into the policy piece or

2097
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,280
is it pre-policy that's what i'm trying

2098
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:30,639
to get clear in my mind

2099
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,320
good

2100
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,320
question

2101
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,880
it makes me think about the uda observe

2102
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,080
orient

2103
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,960
decide act loop and about our

2104
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,800
recent paper that connected active to

2105
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,280
the uda stages

2106
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,600
orienting

2107
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:53,120
i think in this reduced example

2108
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:57,040
the um the north pole north star

2109
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,920
whatever it is is the prior

2110
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,560
like that is what is oriented

2111
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,960
relative to

2112
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:07,120
so that's a purely recognition model

2113
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,280
sense of orienting whereas in the

2114
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,480
physical

2115
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,560
realized world

2116
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,159
orienting has

2117
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:17,760
much to do with action and wayfinding

2118
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:22,239
but this is sort of in the recognition

2119
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:23,679
toy

2120
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:26,719
there is still an orientation

2121
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:28,880
of the prior

2122
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,360
but i'm not 100 sure what do you think

2123
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,040
dean

2124
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,719
what i what i find interesting is is

2125
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:36,320
that when i look at this

2126
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:40,400
and i see a like a 0.8 and a 0.2 it's

2127
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,320
very clear that we're somewhere between

2128
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,760
0 and 1.

2129
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,280
but when we're actually getting to that

2130
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,120
wave finding space

2131
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,360
and we're talking about entailment

2132
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:52,800
one whole over two wholes

2133
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,440
is different than two over one

2134
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:58,560
so as soon as we move past one

2135
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,080
into some of the more as you say

2136
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,520
material

2137
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,320
realities that we have to face down

2138
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,560
that's when those actions

2139
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,159
become

2140
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:09,679
material like we can see what the

2141
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:13,360
process ontology is but what

2142
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,880
axel did was he brought the process

2143
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:17,280
ontology down to it even

2144
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,920
even closer to zero point because he was

2145
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,360
using free energy

2146
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,640
principle and he's talking about free

2147
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:25,760
energy principle and bayesian stuff so

2148
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,679
again sometimes

2149
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:30,560
i have a general sense of this stuff and

2150
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,440
i

2151
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,440
just enough to get me into trouble and

2152
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,280
be an insurgent and

2153
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,080
and

2154
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,239
point it people who are really really

2155
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:40,320
smart and kind of go i think i know what

2156
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,920
you're on to but it doesn't get me deep

2157
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,360
enough to

2158
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,199
to be able to write a parallel paper to

2159
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:46,960
axles and sort of

2160
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,800
either build them up or or tear them

2161
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,640
down so

2162
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,040
yeah i don't know i'm just that's why

2163
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,199
i'm asking i don't know where oriente or

2164
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:56,400
orienting

2165
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,920
fits in this because i think it fits in

2166
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:00,000
the zero to one space and i think it

2167
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,480
fits into the one to three space

2168
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:05,040
as we as the dimensionality blows out

2169
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,840
that's back to the subjective

2170
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,400
objective

2171
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,719
crossing back and forth and again

2172
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:13,040
i come off sounded like a complete idiot

2173
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,400
here because there's somebody way

2174
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,800
smarter than me who can blow my argument

2175
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,480
up but at least i'm putting it out there

2176
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,800
i'm showing up

2177
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,800
oh you're you're

2178
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,560
by being on a live stream and talking

2179
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,880
about it you're like 80 of the way to

2180
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,320
the paper

2181
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,679
um

2182
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:31,760
dave

2183
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:34,960
is there something in this context that

2184
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,880
would correspond to urgency

2185
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,440
and i'm particularly thinking in

2186
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:44,080
the terms that freud

2187
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,920
was concentrating on when he talked

2188
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,400
about how to get people to

2189
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,800
be less neurotic he says

2190
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,159
if you're

2191
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:54,000
the the point that a person is in real

2192
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,880
trouble as a neurotic is when the

2193
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,239
dominant

2194
01:19:58,239 --> 01:20:00,640
factor in his life is reducing his

2195
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,719
anxiety

2196
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:04,640
and what we want to do is to get him to

2197
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,600
tolerate his anxiety tolerate for

2198
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,080
instance ambiguity not knowing is my

2199
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,760
wife mad at me or not but don't get

2200
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:12,960
crazy

2201
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,639
sometimes you just can't do anything

2202
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:16,239
about it

2203
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:18,880
calm down tolerate the anxiety is there

2204
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,040
something and i i'm just taking that as

2205
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,679
a case of urgency urgency seems like

2206
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:24,800
something that would fit into this

2207
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,440
literature better

2208
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,679
blue

2209
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:33,040
so i just want to um like so i don't

2210
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,600
know about urgency i'm going to kind of

2211
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,480
derail off of that and more hook onto

2212
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:41,520
this toleration of anxiety

2213
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,080
or toleration of circumstances that are

2214
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:47,600
not preferable for like a later more

2215
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,600
preferable outcome

2216
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,520
and so this is something that is taught

2217
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,080
like i don't know in self-development

2218
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,080
like a lot right like you have to put

2219
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,920
yourself out of your comfort zone but i

2220
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,199
mean also like

2221
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:01,199
in like the meditative traditions like

2222
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:03,199
to learning to like be with that

2223
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:05,040
discomforting feeling and not like you

2224
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,639
don't have to like get all upset and do

2225
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:10,320
anything about it um so i i just wonder

2226
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,560
if that fits like

2227
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:14,080
it's a different different thing

2228
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,080
different than urgency but what about

2229
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,800
like where's the temporal

2230
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,480
um

2231
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,480
there has to be like a loop right like

2232
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,800
uh i'm gonna tolerate this bad thing for

2233
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,320
something that i think will be like a

2234
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,639
more predictive outcome later like

2235
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:30,480
how can i bathe that

2236
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,320
that would be like an interesting

2237
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,800
mathematical um

2238
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,480
thing to try to work out

2239
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:39,760
cool i added a uh slide

2240
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:43,120
here here's the eisenhower matrix

2241
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,159
so

2242
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:44,960
um

2243
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,520
the x-axis is urgent to not urgent and

2244
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,760
then the y-axis is important to not

2245
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,120
important so

2246
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,840
one of the reasons why this is such a

2247
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,600
useful and well-known tool is it

2248
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,000
separates urgency from importance

2249
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
because there's things that are urgent

2250
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,920
like a chat message

2251
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,520
that urge you to do something or they

2252
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,840
have sort of a short time horizon but

2253
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,360
then there's things that are important

2254
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:09,360
or not important

2255
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:10,639
and then

2256
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:12,719
there's an orientation

2257
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:15,440
when you're figuring out what is in

2258
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:18,159
what quadrant kind of like the rumsfeld

2259
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:19,600
matrix as well

2260
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,760
and then that

2261
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,639
has implications for action

2262
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:25,840
so let's see

2263
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,239
urgency and anxiety dave you mentioned i

2264
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:30,080
don't know about the freudian urgency

2265
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:33,040
concept much but it's of course with uh

2266
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,280
psalms with fristen and the project for

2267
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,480
scientific

2268
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,800
psychiatry there's some clear links

2269
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:41,760
there so it wouldn't be unexpected

2270
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:42,880
and then

2271
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,320
the idea that the imperative

2272
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,800
is to reduce our uncertainty through

2273
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,639
updating our model learning and through

2274
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:51,679
action

2275
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:54,719
so the reduction of anxiety is in

2276
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:56,000
imperative

2277
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,520
and then sometimes it crosses a

2278
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:01,280
threshold towards being truly urgent

2279
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,360
so it's kind of always in the background

2280
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:06,560
but then other times it really is urgent

2281
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,800
but it's always important

2282
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,960
and then blue i

2283
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,719
agree

2284
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:14,960
delayed gratification

2285
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,080
it's like

2286
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:19,280
having the time horizon depth

2287
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:23,120
to take the right policy selection today

2288
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,840
so that your expected free energy

2289
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,239
is higher in the future so it's like

2290
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:30,080
would you rather have one dollar every

2291
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,120
day

2292
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,320
or

2293
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:36,080
a thousand dollars in one year

2294
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,920
depending on how badly you need the

2295
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,679
money today and what you think you'll do

2296
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:41,120
with it in the meantime and all these

2297
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,120
other things

2298
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:46,159
one person given their priors

2299
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:48,639
might minimize free energy and come to

2300
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:50,560
two different conclusions

2301
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,159
and i think that's where we return to

2302
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:56,400
this subjective versus objective

2303
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:58,880
fep take

2304
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,639
which is like

2305
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:03,199
a person could

2306
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:05,280
rationally evaluate

2307
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,760
given their subjective priors and choose

2308
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:10,239
to take that marshmallow

2309
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:12,560
maybe that is just the waiting that they

2310
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,880
have on their priors

2311
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,280
or maybe somebody does the opposite and

2312
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,679
that is just where their priors and that

2313
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:21,040
stimuli

2314
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,360
that's the action selection that they

2315
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,639
take

2316
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:26,080
and so

2317
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,000
um

2318
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,080
not sure how all these pieces tie

2319
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,520
together

2320
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:32,239
but

2321
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:33,360
i think it

2322
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,320
it

2323
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:37,040
speaks to the

2324
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,520
the the logic of action

2325
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,360
and inference

2326
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,000
and we want to have a logic of action

2327
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,639
and inference or a framework for it

2328
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:48,639
that is

2329
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:51,280
broad enough to accommodate like making

2330
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:52,960
bad decisions

2331
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,679
if our action and inference framework is

2332
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:57,840
only

2333
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,760
tightly constrained scenarios that are

2334
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,840
addressable

2335
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,679
then it doesn't really help us as much

2336
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:06,080
with real world scenarios

2337
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,400
but it will be very cool to see how a

2338
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,239
lot of these

2339
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:11,360
daily

2340
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:13,199
phenomena

2341
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:14,560
connect

2342
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:15,840
to the things that we're talking about

2343
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,080
here

2344
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,920
so let's see what else we had in the

2345
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:24,639
pieces and and um also if if axel is

2346
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:27,199
listening or wants to join for a dot 2

2347
01:25:27,199 --> 01:25:30,080
next week or for a future.3 i think

2348
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:31,440
there's probably many things we could

2349
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:32,719
ask and

2350
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:34,880
what brought you to

2351
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,880
write this paper and then

2352
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,880
where do you go after this one

2353
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:42,159
but pretty much the paper

2354
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:43,840
delivers the

2355
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,920
mic drop the coup de grace

2356
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:48,560
with the free energy minimizing bacteria

2357
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,120
which has bad priors

2358
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,520
or let's just say maladaptive priors and

2359
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,920
it minimizes free energy and makes the

2360
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:58,239
wrong decisions so that's where that

2361
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:01,360
section concludes

2362
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:05,040
then there's a jump back to the more

2363
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,360
philosophical framing

2364
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,840
so although free energy minimization is

2365
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,000
not sufficient for life

2366
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,679
there might be an entailment relation

2367
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:15,760
that goes the other way around

2368
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,400
if you are alive it might very well be

2369
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,840
because you did something like

2370
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,480
minimizing free energy

2371
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,400
that entailment relation is that which

2372
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,480
corresponds to the weak version of the

2373
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:27,280
life

2374
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,920
free energy entailment relation so

2375
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,159
remember way back when when we were

2376
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:35,600
looking at the relationship between life

2377
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,760
and minimizing free energy

2378
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:40,080
this example has

2379
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:43,280
decimated the strong claim blown out

2380
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:45,679
make a youtube reaction video

2381
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:46,480
um

2382
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:49,360
but the weak claim is actually supported

2383
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,600
because it seems like making adaptive

2384
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:52,719
decisions

2385
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:54,320
is consistent with free energy

2386
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:56,639
minimization just like it would be with

2387
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:59,120
making adaptive bayesian decisions

2388
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:01,760
but we can say that it's not sufficient

2389
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,040
to do so

2390
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,800
and then the name of the section free

2391
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,920
energy on a wing and a prior

2392
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,520
so

2393
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:12,000
yuck yuck yuck anyone can give a comment

2394
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,760
on that but we just sort of

2395
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:17,440
were reminded of two winged creatures

2396
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,040
that we have talked about only a few

2397
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,520
weeks ago in 32

2398
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,600
there's the winged snowflake and then

2399
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:26,320
the lepidoptera to a flame the moth to a

2400
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,719
flame over here

2401
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:30,639
and about how

2402
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:33,199
in this snowflake example so go to 32 to

2403
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:35,120
check it out in more detail

2404
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,320
but it's like

2405
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,719
the snowflakes with wings that act

2406
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:40,320
adaptively

2407
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,560
are going to persist and those are the

2408
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,560
ones that are going to be

2409
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,480
looking as if they've minimized

2410
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,480
free energy in selecting the correct

2411
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,239
action policies

2412
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:52,800
whereas the ones that don't exist just

2413
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,719
aren't if it makes bad decisions it's

2414
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:57,120
going to fail to exist

2415
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,400
um

2416
01:27:58,400 --> 01:27:59,600
so

2417
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,120
it's an interesting

2418
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:02,320
section

2419
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:06,320
and it uses sort of evolutionary logic

2420
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,320
in a little bit of a different way

2421
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,719
because the evolutionary answer for

2422
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:12,159
everything is just sort of like that's

2423
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:15,199
what was favored by evolution

2424
01:28:15,199 --> 01:28:17,040
selection

2425
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,159
uh

2426
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:20,400
why does

2427
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,080
this organ have this shape it's like

2428
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,960
well that's what was selected on

2429
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,880
and so that's just that's just why it is

2430
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,960
that way even though we've talked about

2431
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,320
tim bergen and other things we know

2432
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:33,440
there's multiple y's

2433
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,639
but here

2434
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:41,280
we can now see the adaptivity of priors

2435
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:44,239
instead of relative fitness

2436
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:45,760
merely

2437
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,719
blue as we know more information here

2438
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:49,600
soon

2439
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:53,440
but the the adaptivity of the priors

2440
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:54,800
will be looking

2441
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:58,320
as if it has been minimizing free energy

2442
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,239
at the population level

2443
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:02,400
so whether we frame natural selection as

2444
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,719
increasing individuals with fitness or

2445
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:06,080
increasing the mean fitness of the

2446
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,760
population

2447
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,400
but not necessarily the relative fitness

2448
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,400
we can also do the same

2449
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:15,600
but rather with a malthusian exponent

2450
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,480
or

2451
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,080
some other kind of

2452
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,360
economic

2453
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,679
fitness parameter we can think about it

2454
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:23,920
in terms of the free energy minimization

2455
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:26,159
dean

2456
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,159
yeah i keep falling off here so i'm

2457
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:29,600
gonna i'm gonna

2458
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,199
have to get past all the hidden stuff

2459
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:33,840
that you guys talked about when i wasn't

2460
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:37,440
uh staying on on the broadcast but

2461
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,199
what this points to me is interesting is

2462
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:41,440
because

2463
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,280
back to the previous slide you talked

2464
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:46,239
about my fur

2465
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,480
rip dean

2466
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:53,320
please f in chat for dean

2467
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,600
he'll rejoin in just a few seconds

2468
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:00,000
sorry guys continue

2469
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,239
yeah is it a wing my first question is

2470
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:04,159
is it a wing as wing

2471
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:06,800
and then second what but does it still

2472
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,560
serve a function like could i use it to

2473
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:09,679
fly

2474
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:12,080
and so that's where the adaptive piece

2475
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,600
actually comes in for me so again

2476
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:16,159
there's two questions necessity and

2477
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:18,400
sufficiency right and and you can even

2478
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,320
see it in the representations is there

2479
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,000
enough information in the representation

2480
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,440
that i identify

2481
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:25,840
as wing and then the second part of it

2482
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,040
is

2483
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,400
well then

2484
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,960
i can see it can carry a moth or i can

2485
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:33,440
see it can carry a snowflake that's the

2486
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:35,120
function that it serves and so that to

2487
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:35,920
me

2488
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:38,159
again is the minimum of two and making

2489
01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:39,840
make sure that we don't

2490
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,920
blend those two things up because it's

2491
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:43,920
the fact that we hold both of them as

2492
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:46,560
discrete and each serving a different

2493
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,719
purpose that helps i'm gonna i'm gonna

2494
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:51,440
jump off prematurely because i tired of

2495
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:53,040
having to catch up and slow you guys

2496
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:55,280
down but i'll watch the video and

2497
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:57,120
seeing the point too thank you peace

2498
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:57,920
dean

2499
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:01,080
all right

2500
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:03,920
okay

2501
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:04,960
cool

2502
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,679
so we walk through

2503
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:10,480
much of the paper it's not a very

2504
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,000
long paper

2505
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,960
and it has just one core numerical

2506
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:17,760
example again with a bayesian walk

2507
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:18,800
through

2508
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:21,760
and then two variational bays

2509
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,440
one variational base that basically

2510
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,679
recapitulates the first bayesian example

2511
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:28,560
of an adaptive prior and then a second

2512
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,880
counter example that provides a

2513
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:34,159
maladaptive prior

2514
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:37,120
that is connected to

2515
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:38,480
evolution

2516
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,639
and to the idea that we're only going to

2517
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:43,760
see adaptive priors moving forward

2518
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,360
because if that

2519
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,280
model of recognition or that action

2520
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:49,120
model is maladaptive

2521
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,760
it will be seen less and less as time

2522
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:54,560
goes on blue

2523
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:57,280
so something that axel didn't mention in

2524
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:00,480
the paper or maybe um didn't mention or

2525
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:02,159
if i if he did mention it i didn't catch

2526
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:03,280
it but

2527
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,360
so the

2528
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:08,320
adaptive priors always fit a certain

2529
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,360
niche

2530
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:11,760
right and so like that you're only

2531
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,760
adaptive you know if you're like a

2532
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:18,320
thermophilic bacteria right like you're

2533
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,880
functional in a hot spring maybe not in

2534
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:23,440
like an ice patch right so i think that

2535
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:24,480
there's

2536
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:25,600
you know if you if you take the

2537
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,560
thermophilic bacteria out of the

2538
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,000
hot environment and put it somewhere

2539
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,760
cold then it's it's maladaptive its

2540
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:33,679
priors are maladaptive but

2541
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:36,000
only because it's just not fit to the

2542
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,840
the correct niche environment and so i

2543
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,360
think that there's this

2544
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,440
you know the importance of of the niche

2545
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:43,440
environment and also it makes me wonder

2546
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:46,560
a lot in terms of evolutionary like

2547
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,800
conceptually like

2548
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,159
you know what if

2549
01:32:50,159 --> 01:32:51,600
it's always we always think about like

2550
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:54,159
the best fit to the niche but but what

2551
01:32:54,159 --> 01:32:55,440
if it's like

2552
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,679
the best generalist like is there like

2553
01:32:57,679 --> 01:32:59,199
the evolutionary i mean i guess that's

2554
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:00,719
like the cockroach right like like the

2555
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:02,719
evolutionary generalists that can go

2556
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:04,960
anywhere be anywhere survive in any

2557
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:08,400
niche survive on anything like is that

2558
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:11,040
the best like how do how

2559
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,880
how does that like

2560
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,880
like a prior that fits no niche or fits

2561
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,600
all niches how how does that like play

2562
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:20,000
into this evolutionary paradigm i mean i

2563
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,120
guess the cockroach will prevail

2564
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:25,120
good question maybe this is related to

2565
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:27,920
our discussion about context

2566
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:31,120
uh having the prior of 80 20

2567
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:33,199
and then we observed

2568
01:33:33,199 --> 01:33:33,450
um

2569
01:33:33,450 --> 01:33:34,639
[Music]

2570
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:37,040
alpha but we could have flipped that if

2571
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:39,040
it was all of a sudden dipped into the

2572
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,800
beta ocean

2573
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,400
then that prior

2574
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,320
would be as wrong

2575
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,400
as the maladaptive prior was in this

2576
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:47,360
paper

2577
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:48,320
so

2578
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,800
whether or not it is adaptive as you

2579
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:53,360
point out it is absolutely about the

2580
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,760
statistical regularities of the niche

2581
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:58,159
and that's the fitness of the model

2582
01:33:58,159 --> 01:34:00,880
fitness of the organism to

2583
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,080
the

2584
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:04,719
generative process is the generative

2585
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:05,840
model

2586
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,520
going to be fit to the generative

2587
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:09,840
process and then generative processes

2588
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,199
change things change out there in the

2589
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:12,159
world

2590
01:34:12,159 --> 01:34:14,239
dave

2591
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:18,320
yeah if the uh the work on my medics

2592
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,800
going back to dawkins and the the

2593
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,320
english lady that did

2594
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:25,360
a lot more development of that notion uh

2595
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,120
if that can be adapted to free energy

2596
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:30,320
that will give a lot of very detailed

2597
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:32,560
discussion of generation after

2598
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,560
generation of the co-evolution of

2599
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:38,480
adaptability and that

2600
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,639
which is adapting

2601
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:42,719
the the notion that the brain has been

2602
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:46,239
adapted to imitate and to remember and

2603
01:34:46,239 --> 01:34:48,719
to pass on and to

2604
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:51,600
recast concepts into many different

2605
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,360
modalities

2606
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:57,920
so do what blue was asking

2607
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:00,880
yes

2608
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,600
agreed with that

2609
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,560
we can then just maybe look at the last

2610
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:09,520
few pieces in the future directions

2611
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:10,880
and then i think

2612
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,560
see if we have any ideas for things to

2613
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,639
discuss and point to and then other than

2614
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:16,480
that just invite everybody who's

2615
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,239
interested in listening

2616
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:20,480
to join us for point two because we've

2617
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:21,600
covered

2618
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:25,119
much in point one in zero

2619
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:28,239
so it's our last

2620
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:31,760
journal discussion of 2021

2621
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,040
come join

2622
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:34,719
and

2623
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:36,320
share how you got

2624
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:37,360
here

2625
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:39,040
and then what action selections you're

2626
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:42,159
going to take in 22.

2627
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:44,880
the last section is

2628
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:47,360
free energy minimization as a historical

2629
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:50,159
scientific principle

2630
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:53,280
so that's a very fascinating idea

2631
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,040
because

2632
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:58,719
it's about anticipatory systems

2633
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:02,480
yet it's a historical principle

2634
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,000
that's where we get into the difference

2635
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:07,119
between prediction and post-diction

2636
01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:08,639
postdictive scientific statements are

2637
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:09,920
concerned with what must have been the

2638
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:13,360
case instead of what will be the case

2639
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:15,440
a statement such as the minimization of

2640
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,440
free energy may be necessary if not

2641
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:18,800
sufficient characteristic of

2642
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,199
evolutionary systems which was from the

2643
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:24,000
first and staff in 2007

2644
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,840
is probably such a postdictive statement

2645
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,239
and then axel claims that that statement

2646
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:32,000
should be interpreted according to the

2647
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,040
weak claim rather than according to the

2648
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,880
strong claim

2649
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:40,480
so interesting that even back then

2650
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,480
the necessity insufficiency was being

2651
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:46,320
used and arguably used properly

2652
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:47,920
so then

2653
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:50,480
what happened

2654
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,320
how did

2655
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,800
we get off the rails

2656
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:59,119
or how did the strong claim come to be

2657
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:01,440
and

2658
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:03,119
the paper

2659
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:04,000
i think

2660
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,920
makes a powerful argument for the fep as

2661
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:10,239
a postdictive model

2662
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:12,320
but that doesn't mean that it can't be

2663
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,880
used in an anticipatory way for

2664
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:18,480
anticipatory systems moving forward

2665
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:19,119
and

2666
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:21,199
doing inference on the consequences of

2667
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:23,600
our action which are also in the future

2668
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,760
so how the uh

2669
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,400
past and the present and the future

2670
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:29,520
are linked

2671
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:32,639
that's more of a dot too

2672
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:36,400
how are the historical sciences

2673
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:39,678
anticipatory sciences

2674
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:40,960
and uh

2675
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:43,600
i don't know is there now sciences

2676
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:47,360
no that's what i call science 21

2677
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,880
what else

2678
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:53,440
would people like to discuss in dot one

2679
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,839
blue

2680
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:05,440
so

2681
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:07,440
i would like to maybe get into more

2682
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:10,800
about the living versus non-living and

2683
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:14,000
maybe talk about um

2684
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,280
you know this this idea of maintaining

2685
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:20,560
structural integrity like is that a

2686
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:22,560
quality of life or do things always

2687
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,880
maintain structural integrity and like

2688
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:26,960
does the fep apply when structural

2689
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:29,360
integrity is maintained

2690
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:31,520
and there's not life

2691
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,600
i mean it's like i mean we talk about

2692
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,440
like free energy minimization and

2693
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:38,000
chemistry all the time like you form the

2694
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
product that minimizes the free energy

2695
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,360
and so i know that there's some

2696
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,920
differences or some

2697
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:45,679
a lot of extrapolation that has to be

2698
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:47,520
done to get from thermodynamics to the

2699
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,840
fep or

2700
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:52,239
not extrapolation but like

2701
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:54,159
it's retrofit

2702
01:38:54,159 --> 01:38:56,639
is maybe the right word um so i don't

2703
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:58,320
know i would like to maybe see some of

2704
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,559
that

2705
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:03,920
where does the fep apply in situations

2706
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:05,920
that are not animated is it

2707
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:08,400
computationally is it relevant like when

2708
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:10,080
we're talking about robotics

2709
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:10,420
um

2710
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:11,600
[Music]

2711
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:12,480
yeah

2712
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,239
that type of thing

2713
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:18,000
yeah and is animate the same as sentient

2714
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,800
like animate sentient

2715
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:22,880
inanimate

2716
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:25,600
not moving not animated

2717
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:27,920
in sentient

2718
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:29,040
like

2719
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:32,000
can we just have an active model

2720
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,800
that doesn't have any affordances or

2721
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,199
where it only has one affordance

2722
01:39:37,199 --> 01:39:39,520
so it's still doing a recognition model

2723
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:40,960
but then it's

2724
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:42,400
policy selection is extremely

2725
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:45,040
constrained

2726
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,199
or like

2727
01:39:47,199 --> 01:39:49,440
so i mean i i don't even like to like

2728
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:52,400
use life and non-life because there are

2729
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:54,960
some things that like blur that boundary

2730
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:56,560
also like it gets into like well what is

2731
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,639
a virus is a virus alive like

2732
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:01,600
uh and a virus is very exploitative like

2733
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:04,719
it has dna like there's

2734
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:06,639
some things some qualities of viruses

2735
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:08,239
that make me feel like they're alive but

2736
01:40:08,239 --> 01:40:09,840
they're technically not

2737
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,199
so

2738
01:40:11,199 --> 01:40:13,199
like what about if we just say dna

2739
01:40:13,199 --> 01:40:14,639
containing but then it's like it's this

2740
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:17,199
test tube full of dna alive like i don't

2741
01:40:17,199 --> 01:40:18,639
know

2742
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:19,760
it's hard

2743
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,440
and so instead of even sentient

2744
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:24,639
inanimate like alive and not alive

2745
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:25,840
i don't know

2746
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:28,320
yeah i i think the the the paper's

2747
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:31,920
succinctness and clarity of argument

2748
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,239
hides a big

2749
01:40:34,239 --> 01:40:36,400
question which is okay

2750
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:38,000
so if it's alive

2751
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,719
who told you that

2752
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:41,520
so

2753
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,440
if we can't go from

2754
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,280
minimizing free energy to inferring

2755
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:47,040
what's alive

2756
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:50,960
then how did we get to here

2757
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:53,119
right or what is even alive mean like i

2758
01:40:53,119 --> 01:40:55,280
don't think it's fully defined like if

2759
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:57,760
we can't fully define death

2760
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:58,639
like

2761
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:01,119
i mean how do we fully define life right

2762
01:41:01,119 --> 01:41:03,119
so i don't know it's this there's this

2763
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:05,440
big sticky

2764
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:07,600
i don't know weird area i mean we kind

2765
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:09,679
of instinctually know what is life and

2766
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:10,800
what is

2767
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:13,360
what is alive and what is not alive

2768
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:14,080
um

2769
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:16,800
anyway but the

2770
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:18,639
i mean are the

2771
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:21,679
crystals in bone alive

2772
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:23,760
well they're part of a bigger system

2773
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:25,760
that people usually don't have a problem

2774
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:28,639
saying is alive but then why should what

2775
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:30,719
people think matter

2776
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:31,679
like

2777
01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:33,760
especially if we believe in evolution

2778
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:36,000
and we think that our cognition is

2779
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,119
oriented

2780
01:41:37,119 --> 01:41:39,679
not necessarily towards like ontological

2781
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:40,880
realism

2782
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,880
then why should it matter what one

2783
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:45,760
percent or 99 or even 100 of people

2784
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:48,000
agree upon

2785
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,239
or even if we zoom like way out and get

2786
01:41:50,239 --> 01:41:53,040
super meta like how does life maintain

2787
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:56,400
the structural integrity of life

2788
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,400
that's an interesting one to think about

2789
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,960
like like because i mean it's dependent

2790
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,480
upon the niche environment which

2791
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:04,239
includes many non-alive things like the

2792
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:06,560
crystals that are inside of bone

2793
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:08,639
um or inside the inner ear which help us

2794
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:10,719
maintain balance right so there's all of

2795
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:12,159
those things

2796
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:14,880
yeah i think um

2797
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:16,560
following with this quote

2798
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:18,080
from the point of view

2799
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:19,360
of the fep

2800
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,199
the life cycle is that which corresponds

2801
01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:22,560
to the thing whose integrity is

2802
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:26,159
maintained over evolutionary time

2803
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:29,840
so then the ants nest architecture

2804
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:33,360
is as much recapitulated as is the

2805
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:35,360
casing of the larva

2806
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:38,320
as is the larva itself

2807
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:40,480
so

2808
01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:42,960
how will we define life i guess we can

2809
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:44,800
just add that as a good you know just

2810
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:46,239
sort of just something quick to hit at

2811
01:42:46,239 --> 01:42:49,360
the end of 32 or of 34.2 just you know

2812
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:52,239
what is life and then um hash rodinger's

2813
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:55,879
question been answered

2814
01:42:57,199 --> 01:42:59,520
i mean it's been a few years since 2018

2815
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:02,560
and ram said it all

2816
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:05,760
but has it been answered

2817
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:07,600
what is life

2818
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:10,159
1944

2819
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:12,000
um okay

2820
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,199
so i think we will uh

2821
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:17,440
conclude there

2822
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,360
i hope if you're listening that you

2823
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:22,639
would like to join us in the dot 2

2824
01:43:22,639 --> 01:43:24,880
where we'll talk a little more about

2825
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,639
this paper and

2826
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:28,239
how we got here and then where we're

2827
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:29,600
going to go

2828
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:30,480
in

2829
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,159
22.

2830
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:35,599
anything else dave or blue

2831
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:39,679
okay thanks for the fun convo

2832
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:43,320
talk to you all later
