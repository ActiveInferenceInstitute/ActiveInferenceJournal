"Unknown","00;00;00;01","00;00;41;01","It's life OK? It is. Hello and welcome, everyone. Thank you to joining the active and Vince love is October 1st 2021 and I'm Daniel I'm here with blue and we're going to be talking about this paper how to count biological minds Symbiosis, the free Energy Principle and Reciprocal Multi Scale Integration. Welcome to the Active Inference Lab. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference."
"Unknown","00;00;41;15","00;01;04;04","You can find us at the links here on this page. This is a recorded and an archived livestream so please provide us with feedback so that we can be improving our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we'll be following good video etiquette for lectures we are heading into October and the number 30 paper about biological mines."
"Unknown","00;01;04;25","00;01;33;01","We currently have the author Matt Sims scheduled to come on the October 5th discussion and then we'll have the 30.2 another participatory group discussion. So check out the calendar here as well as these other series if you want to join or suggest somebody who we can invite today in item stream number 30.0. The goal is to learn and discuss this paper, How to Count Biological Minds."
"Unknown","00;01;34;06","00;01;57;03","And it's by Matthew Sims it's from 2020 in the journals and these and just like all the other dot zero videos, this is just an introduction to some of the ideas some background that Blue and I whipped together literally leading up to the time of now. So it's just an introduction. And if you want to go deeper into an idea then come to the discussion."
"Unknown","00;01;57;26","00;02;24;20","We're going to go over the aims and claims abstracts roadmap of the paper and then the figures and so on. So let's just get started with the introduction. Greetings Blue. And what makes you excited about this paper? You know, Daniel, I'm always interested in studying intelligence and how that scales from the sub cellular to the systemic ecosystem level."
"Unknown","00;02;25;23","00;02;55;12","And so this is kind of an interesting take and it echoes a lot of what we talked about in the discussion of Mike Levin's paper, The Computational Boundary of the Self back in July. So I was excited that Matthew agreed to come on the livestream, and I've been excited about this paper just because it takes out of inference the multi skill aspect of active inference in a really enhanced integrative direction."
"Unknown","00;02;56;17","00;03;25;06","How about you? What did you like? I liked that it combined some general ideas and questions in philosophy philosophy of biology, and then tied it to the natural history of a specific species. So it's all good, you know, make claims about distributed systems with the microbiome and the host in general, but then tying it to a system that can be studied and has a cool ecological history is a good approach."
"Unknown","00;03;25;15","00;03;57;28","Kind of grounds the paper. Here's the paper and how to count biological minds. Symbiosis. The free energy principle and reciprocal multi skill integration. I'll read the first aim of the blue. You can say something and read the other ones to support the notion of symbiotic minds and the notion of nested biological cognizance that falls out of it. This paper will develop and deploy the notion of reciprocal multi scale integration from within the free energy principle."
"Unknown","00;03;59;08","00;04;20;01","Reciprocal multi skill integration describes the case where each of two or more cognizance systems uses the other to provide evidence for its own model of the world and itself. Acting in that world as a case study in support of the notion of symbiotic minds, I will look at the symbiosis of Vibrio fish, dry bacteria and the bobtail squid."
"Unknown","00;04;20;17","00;04;51;25","I will argue that the Vibrio squid assemblage constitutes a functionally integrated cognitive whole, the markup blanket of which constrains those of Vibrio and the squid, and in showing how the notion of a symbiotic mind can be supported by reciprocal multi scale integration within the energy principle this paper contributes to the philosophy of cognitive science, demonstrating that our folk psychological conception of what cognize what cognizance are require rethinking."
"Unknown","00;04;52;12","00;05;24;05","Moreover, if the account of symbiotic colonizers presented as tenable by bringing into relief and accounting for at least one possible transition cognition, this paper contributes to a more complete understanding of the evolution of cognition so cool claims and again, the kind of to have to it of the general argument and the specific and symbiosis and ecological association have been approached in the free energy principle framework."
"Unknown","00;05;24;05","00;06;02;25","But I think this reciprocal component, its approach a little differently here than probably in some works, but we'll get into that OK, I'll do the first abstract one. The notion of a physiological individual has been developed and applied in the philosophy of biology. To understand symbiosis and understanding of which is key to theorizing about the major transitions in evolution from multi-organ his malady to multicellularity the paper begins by asking what such symbiotic individuals can help to reveal about a possible transition in the evolution of cognition."
"Unknown","00;06;04;13","00;06;28;25","It makes me think about the transition from a solitary insect cognition to a colony. So there's that change in the level of organization, and then it is that purely cognitive to cognitive changes precede it. Did they follow? What is the relationship between the evolutionary, the physiological and the cognitive changes? Is what the first part is getting it the second part."
"Unknown","00;06;29;06","00;07;03;23","Such a transition marks the movement from cooperating individual biological cognizance to functionally integrated cognizance unit somewhere along the way that such cognizant units simultaneously have cognizance as parts expanding upon the multi scale integration view of the free energy principle. This paper develops an account of reciprocal integration, demonstrating how some couple of biological cognizance systems when certain constraints are met can result in a cognizant unit that is in ways greater than the sum of its organizing parts."
"Unknown","00;07;04;14","00;07;31;17","And yet this paper just shouts out a lot to success. Mary versus Maria can say as much in the next month. And you know, the major transitions that we've seen, which is if you haven't read that book or thought about those transitions, I mean, you can even probably pick up the summary. But it's really amazing to think about the evolution in terms of the transition from single celled to multi cell and, you know, from asexual to sexual reproduction."
"Unknown","00;07;31;17","00;08;03;06","And there's, I think, seven major transitions that happened in the course of evolution. And I think that this kind of is hinting at a confusing evolution or cognitive evolution, which it will we'll get into a little bit later. Hey, perfect symbiosis between bee fishery bacteria and the bobtail squid is used to provide an illustration of this account novel manner of conceptualizing biological cognition as gradient is then suggested."
"Unknown","00;08;03;26","00;08;29;10","Lastly, it is argued that the reason why the notion of ontologically nested cognizance may be unintuitive stems from the fact that our folk psychology notion of what a cognize are is has been deeply influenced by our folk biological manner of understanding biological individuals as units of reproduction. So that's a really crucial point because it involves our understanding of biology."
"Unknown","00;08;29;10","00;08;59;05","It models of biology influence the way that we see the world, which is kind of sounds by definition. But it's really interesting because people have thought so many different things about different parts of biology, about animal biology, all of evolution, all of the things that we see, so that how that intersects with our understanding of cognition and what cognitive levels exist, what levels of individuality exist for topics."
"Unknown","00;09;00;12","00;09;45;01","So just a thought here. So what a biological individual like a, what a cognize is, has been influenced by our understanding of biological individuals. As units of reproduction. So is a cognizant unit a unit of cognition that's is a corresponding in to cognitive evolution as corresponding units as there are actually biological evolution. So get those are the main pieces, the roadmap, not that many sub sections starts with an introduction and goes through a nice description of the free energy principle, which we're going to use in multiple slides here."
"Unknown","00;09;46;19","00;10;21;11","There's a distinction drawn which will also go into about mere versus adaptive active inference. Motor skill integration will be discussed and different kinds of multi scale integration come up later on. But then there's two sections about this specific bacterial squid symbiosis and then that symbiosis is returned to with this enhanced background on the uni directional and the reciprocal multi scale integration so that's kind of the overall roadmap keywords or anything."
"Unknown","00;10;21;17","00;10;58;18","I don't know blue keywords or free energy principle, active inference or symbiosis, nested markup blankets, multi skill integration, cognitive evolution, emergence and physiological individuals, so let's start with symbiosis. So the quote from the paper was Symbiosis are cooperative, hetero specific associations in which each symbiont partner mutually benefits from e.g. gaining nourishment, shelter, et cetera, from the presence of the other partner."
"Unknown","00;10;59;21","00;11;30;05","So hetero specific means different species. And this is a graphic and also interesting. The footnote that just said, kind of talking about the positive mutual istic form of co living not commence lists or parasitic forms of co living or coexisting, but even just looking at pairwise interactions before more complex loops are taken into account, there's a whole game theory space of interactions."
"Unknown","00;11;30;22","00;11;58;18","So what should our models include? Cooperative interactions, adversarial interactions, which which one of these edges or relationships have? What game theory, what cognitive theories? So it's a, it's a cool approach to take on symbiosis that respects all the ways that different systems like a like in versus a eukaryotic cell with a mitochondria, all these different co living styles."
"Unknown","00;12;00;04","00;12;40;09","So just a thought on that, you know, all of these co living styles are transactional, whether it's, you know, through a voluntary transaction or just straight theft, these kind of associations reminds me of how where we're starting to scale into studying cities and states and thinking about debt. Right? So like the debt that we have to each other, like I borrow this or or you borrow that or I benefit you in this way, you benefit me in this way and that scales from the, you know, very basic biological unit all the way through ecosystems."
"Unknown","00;12;40;15","00;13;18;25","So, OK, physiological individuals. So we're going to come back to this idea of what's an individual. But one wrote in this this quote. So one way philosophers have addressed this question of individuality is by conceptually developing and applying the notion of a physiological individual, a biological individual of this kind is a highly integrated functional unit, the heterogeneous parts of which cohere together through regulatory processes like metabolic immunity tolerance, etc., so as to maintain the system's integrity and resist environmental forces of decay."
"Unknown","00;13;20;02","00;13;49;24","And citation to Prideaux 2011 looks at the role of the immune system and the interaction with the foreign with the other during development and uses that relationship to explore that notion of the interface between the organism and the environment and looks at like the physiological story involving the microbe and the social niche and all these other components can come into play."
"Unknown","00;13;50;06","00;14;14;18","And that is in some cases a better explanation or prediction or description of a certain scenario, such as another cool topic. What do you think? Blue. So this this is cool. The end of this quote. I reject the idea that there is no possible distinction between the organism and its environment. I just want to point that out because we'll come back to that in into slides, actually."
"Unknown","00;14;15;02","00;14;25;27","Yes, it's a qualification of the interface and the system, but it's not the rejection that we just give up so it's towards useful partitioning of the system."
"Unknown","00;14;27;28","00;14;52;07","OK, so two models of individual individuality more generally. There was a quote in the paper that said The theoretical apparatus that falls out of the free energy principle may be used to arrive at an account of the kind of enrichment of living processes that are required for those processes to qualify as cognitive processes ascribe more to physiological individuals."
"Unknown","00;14;52;20","00;15;22;28","So thus linking the cognitive perspective with the physiological perspective of individuality, making good on the project of strong life mind continuity. So what models of individuality exist we have physiological and cognitive. We have the view that is going to be implicitly described as like folk, biological, which is the Darwinian replicator, evolutionary, just a few other ones that exist."
"Unknown","00;15;23;06","00;15;48;01","There's like the teleological concept of individuality which is the end directness and the concept definition of the organism as an end in it in and of itself. And that's when things are acting at the organismal level. But there's probably a lot of distance between what was that simplification and what was written. The information theory of individuality which I know blue."
"Unknown","00;15;48;01","00;16;11;17","You also mean to add on then integrated information theory as well as pluralism and a sort of historical perspective that looks at shifting boundaries of the conception of individuality and then tries to find some organization that doesn't even use that as a central divider. I mean, these are just some of the ways, but just also cool like, you know, species."
"Unknown","00;16;11;17","00;16;19;21","But then there's so many species concepts, but individual seems like that's the one that you can pick out, but then it's not always that way."
"Unknown","00;16;21;29","00;16;52;28","Well, and I guess we'll come back to that remark when we talk about Markov blankets here in a little bit. So the information theory of individuality. I absolutely love, love, love, love this paper because for many reasons. But but I just wanted to highlight in this paper, they talk about how individuality can be nested and it requires a bi directional information flow, which I think that this distinction is important, right?"
"Unknown","00;16;52;28","00;17;19;09","So there has to be like control from the top down and from the bottom up. So information has to go both ways. And that is what describes an individual. So, you know, if you have I'm to think of like a non individual like like, OK, you can have someone broadcasting instructions through a megaphone, you know, like, like shouting, you know, like please move to the right, please move to the right."
"Unknown","00;17;19;14","00;17;52;01","So that's like top down control, but there's no feedback from the crowd. Like the right is blocked. There's a clock here or there's a gap here we can walk through or whatever. If there's no feedback, then then that's not an individual, right? So you have this, you know, top down control, but nothing comes back. So in an individual, there's always that that reciprocal flow and then the the forms of individuality that they highlight in this paper are an organism which is like you and me, a colonial form of individual, which is like a biofilm, right?"
"Unknown","00;17;52;11","00;18;23;03","And then a driven form. And this is the part that goes back to that quote about I reject the idea that there can be no self or that an organism is not distinct from its environment. And so in this, in fact, this is environmentally driven, and that's this last form of individuality that they highlight somewhere like the nature of the individual is entirely dependent upon the environment and allowing for this type of individual to exist really allows the formation of life in the very beginning."
"Unknown","00;18;23;14","00;19;10;07","Because if you just have collections of molecules, you know, without a boundary or a barrier that's environmentally driven, and so without that organism being able to arise from its environment, you don't get the origin of life. And so I just wanted to just highlight that's nice, great points the next key word is the free energy principle or MVP, and this is from active livestream 14 from the illusion that Karl first made to the word lice and his kind of observations of nature leaving eventually to in integrative approach that includes some of these areas like considering how multi scale systems work and how collectives work."
"Unknown","00;19;10;07","00;19;41;23","So how things work literally within a level across the estimates at the multi scale like the colony inside of the ecosystem information and thermodynamics and control theory and action selection as a type of inference. We're going to hear it here from the author and look through the four main points that they drew out of the FP so this is again coming from the Sims 2020 paper."
"Unknown","00;19;41;23","00;20;09;11","So read for more detail. The Free Energy principle starts from a particular view of life that is grounded in statistical physics. So that's an introductory claim. Interesting. Way to start. And again, just pulling a few highlights out to get at this first key point. A biological system is one that self organizes to a limited set of attracting states that is far from thermodynamic equilibrium."
"Unknown","00;20;09;24","00;20;50;21","So there it's like our body temperature is kept above the room temperature far from the sort of naive chemical equilibrium, and that's being maintained despite dissipation being a prevalent in the universe. And that resistance to falling to equilibrium is called the non equilibrium steady state density, importantly the nice density towards which in organisms dynamics flow corresponds to its phenotype, i.e. its regular patterns of behavior, morphology and physiology to find itself in its characteristic or phenotypic states provides the organism evidence that its behavior is countering dispersive effects of random fluctuations."
"Unknown","00;20;51;14","00;21;24;11","So even static seeming phenotypes like the length of your femur, it's actively maintained by cells being renewed and the turnover rate and so on. So sometimes it's easier to think about some phenotypes like cognitive phenotypes, as actually embodying parametric values that are being kept away from equilibrium. Other times for more static components of phenotype. It's not that way, but it's just a cool way to think about phenotype as just these measurements that are stable over some time frame about the world."
"Unknown","00;21;24;23","00;22;00;28","And the persistence of those measurements through time represent the implementation of some strategy that resists dissipation hence the maintenance of a non equilibrium steady state through some kind of strategy anything above know the second the right. The. This brings us to the second primary feature of FFP, the Markoff blanket formalism. This is used in the context of FFP to describe a particular kind of statistical organization of a system relative to that which the system is not."
"Unknown","00;22;02;03","00;22;36;26","Namely, it describes the statistical partitioning of internal states and then using just the variable names as they are here, internal states are the external states FI and the sensory states as active states, eh? These latter states being in the Marcotte blanket which are the sensory and the active states. So what about this blue? Just, I mean, we've talked lot on the livestream, a lot about Markov blankets and how they can be used to describe or individually individuals."
"Unknown","00;22;37;06","00;23;07;20","So really to delineate the boundaries of an individual and technically the Markov like it defines conditional independence. So like under what settings or under what settings are these two systems conditionally independent yes. So there's some interface that is being used and there's a conditional independence across either side. But yeah, a topic that's come up many times and I'm sure this is not the end of it."
"Unknown","00;23;09;02","00;23;34;12","This brings us to a third essential feature of FFP, the notion of a generative model a generative model is a probabilistic model that describes how the evolution of sensory states of a miracle blanket could be caused by external states. It captures prior beliefs in the form of probability distributions about unobserved external states and a likelihood mapping external states to the evolution of sensory states."
"Unknown","00;23;34;28","00;24;02;17","Such models are, quote, implicit in the dynamics of internal states. Palacios at all 2020. So the mapping between external states and the evolution of estimates of internal states is this a matrix that is connecting the observations being made through time to the SW matrix. So that's a bi directional relationship with the generative and the recognition model. That's the tail of two densities."
"Unknown","00;24;03;02","00;24;50;02","But that's the signal processing sort of sampling the external world and then having an ongoing estimate of world states which could be just unobserved world states or causes in the world. Then there's how those states change through time, b how policy interacts with how those states change through time, pi d the prior over the states and then the decision making of PI with the CG and the E So this is the partially observable Markov decision process, the MDP framing, and it's not the only way we can look at it, but this gets like many of the key variables down, which is why we and there's uncertainties on all of these as we've found."
"Unknown","00;24;50;13","00;25;24;27","So this just gets a lot of the key pieces down. The generative model could have a different structure, though. This is not the only structure OK, good so here is from the paper. Importantly, you want to be this one. Sure. Importantly, a systems generative model may be cast in terms of its non equilibrium and steady state. To see how this is the case requires understanding the notion of dual information geometry of self-organizing systems."
"Unknown","00;25;25;08","00;26;00;03","And he gives several citations, one of which I guess is this one yet. So this is just giving the first description, not like first in literature, just like a first introductory description on this dual information geometry. This dual aspect concerns the intrinsic information geometry of the probabilistic evolution of internal states. So that's like the actual if there's a million neurons and they can each take ten states, that's the the geometry of the internal states is like that many neurons can take on that many values."
"Unknown","00;26;00;12","00;26;24;06","But the internal true state space of the actual internal states and the separate in extrinsic information geometry of probabilistic beliefs about external states that are parameter ized by internal states. So that and neurons could be fitting a binary model is the light switch up or down or it could be a three state model. Is it up, down or not?"
"Unknown","00;26;24;06","00;26;52;22","Either or both. Whatever it's specifying that is a lower dimensionality than the actual state space. So it's like there's a lot of decisions in the whole computer. But then there's this external realized component that the smaller state space, the extrinsic information geometry we call these intrinsic, i.e., mechanical or state based and extrinsic Markov and or belief based information geometries."
"Unknown","00;26;53;08","00;27;13;22","And Wonga has come on to discuss several papers. So definitely look at the work by all of these authors because it's like interesting topic. We could probably learn more about that. And I know there's people who are listening who know more about it OK?"
"Unknown","00;27;15;26","00;27;45;11","Here is those intrinsic and extrinsic information geometries being used in, I think the Sims paper, but not in here actually. But we can see either that or it's in this previous first in paper. So there's the probabilistic flow. The system states over time. That's the intrinsic geometry and that's that. Yeah, well, I think this is the first in paper OK."
"Unknown","00;27;45;11","00;28;16;17","OK, and here's the extrinsic. So then basically this is just a visual showing the higher dimensionality of the actual components of the system that can project onto like just to lower areas. OK, the fourth part of ATP in the Sims paper, this brings us to the fourth primary feature of FCP Active Inference all with yellow and blue. You can give a thought on where you think active fits in."
"Unknown","00;28;17;09","00;28;55;06","AVP proposes that living systems are able to resist the second law of thermodynamics in virtue of avoiding sensory states which are deleterious and actively bringing about those sensory states which allow them to maintain their structural and functional integrity. It is by engaging in this coupled process of active inference that an organism minimizes not only current free energy encountered, but expected free energy, i.e. the the free energy that would arise were a particular action policy selected and followed so instead of giving a thought, I'm going to give an author's thought on this just to read a quote from the paper."
"Unknown","00;28;55;14","00;29;26;13","The reason for using the free energy principle to investigate and argue for a symbiotic mind is not only because the quantity free energy provides a measure of cognition across spatial temporal scales, but because the free energy principle and its various corollaries suggest a plausible criterion for identifying biological clock measures across various various spatial temporal scales. So that's why they approach the MVP just for that reason, which I thought was nice."
"Unknown","00;29;28;09","00;30;06;23","I'm going to ask a nice question from the chat from Stephen wrote Is there a dual information geometry between intrinsic and extrinsic states of active inference? And another dual information geometry between action stage estates and niche spaces can I give a first answer, please? OK, I would state that the total state space, which includes the variables for the internal, the blanket and the external space that's the shape it is."
"Unknown","00;30;07;04","00;30;28;24","And then there's going to be sub shapes like you could only look at the blanket and the internal states. That's the particular states so that's partitioning the system of interest away from the niche. Or you could look at it in a, in a four way or there's probably a lot of other ways, but it seems like the full model is the full geometry, and then there's going to be some reduced geometries."
"Unknown","00;30;30;03","00;31;04;25","And then Stephen clarified a dual information geometry in relation to the generative model and what is modeling and a dual information geometry between what actions are happening and then each modification. I think that gets at also that sigma mapping function in the de Costa paper. OK, after there's conditional independence of the kind that the Markov blanket partitioning provides, there's still are some internal state partitions in the world that maybe do some prediction about or anticipation about external states."
"Unknown","00;31;05;04","00;31;25;05","So it's as if they're estimating external states. Let's talk to somebody who knows information geometry that's it. I was going to say, but my guess would be it depends on where you put them. I can think it, but definitely I think anybody out there who's listening that knows that information geometry. I'm curious to take a deep dove down that path."
"Unknown","00;31;25;05","00;31;47;07","So so I encourage you to get in touch and come talk to us about information geometry because I would like to learn some more There was a distinction drawn in the paper between adaptive and mere active inference. So I actually don't think that this has come up. We've we've seen several distinctions like instrumental ism and realism in terms of the interpretation."
"Unknown","00;31;47;07","00;32;12;22","But this is, I think, another relevance distinction FP falls short of making the claim that all more blankets draw a line around cognizance. It has been suggested that what determines whether a living Markov blanketed system is cognize or is whether or not it is the kind of thing which engages in adaptive active inference rather than mere active inference."
"Unknown","00;32;13;06","00;32;54;08","Kirchhoff 2018 adaptive active inference requires that a system autonomously engage in active inference, maximizing sensory evidence for its own existence. So there's been a coupled oscillator model as well as the flywheel gov model. Another classic kind of mechanical regulatory system and as well as the discussion, well, does a rock have a Markov blanket, that type of question. And so this is from the Kirchhoff 2018 paper just drawing the distinction between mere active inference, which is like the ability to draw a partition around a system at all, to distinguish it from its niche and its interfaces."
"Unknown","00;32;55;05","00;33;33;14","And then its general model could be like nil or boring or just a coin flip to contrast that with adaptive active inference, which is actually the inactive sensory motor affordance semantic coupling. I'm a strange loop type system. What do you think about that blue? So I wonder, you know, when we talk about active our friends and adaptive active inference, adaptive active inference implies more than just mental action or maybe mental actions is sufficient."
"Unknown","00;33;33;15","00;34;00;20","But what I think I feel like adaptive active in France implies that there's more of an action component. And, you know, we've talked about situations where you can have active inference occurring without necessarily taking an action or maybe a mental action. You can actively infer what's happening in the environment without performing some kind of action. That's adaptive to it."
"Unknown","00;34;01;07","00;34;25;09","I don't know. Maybe that's that snap X-axis is action on action. It can be adaptive to not act those that mere waiting. Good question. Ray. Ray Ray. And also, like you can have adaptation that's a crack in the brain. Like you adapt to a noise in the environment, like it's super loud and sound super loud, but then eventually your brain adapts."
"Unknown","00;34;25;20","00;34;55;28","So it still is that mirror or is that adaptive? I guess so. Emergence trying to read whatever or say whatever you'd like to say about emotions. Sure. So this is just the Wikipedia definition. So obviously the emergence and philosophies of systems theory, science and art emergence occurs when an entity is observed to have properties its parts do not have on their own properties or behaviors which emerge only when the parts interact in a wider whole."
"Unknown","00;34;56;26","00;35;29;21","And I just included these references so that that definition kind of echoes integrated information theory of consciousness, which again implies that consciousness is this emergent property when the parts are interacting and create something that's bigger than the whole and then both of these later. Yeah. So both of these papers, the process paper and then this paper by Varley and Eric whole start to get into the mathematics of emergence and they use similar metrics."
"Unknown","00;35;29;21","00;35;52;25","It's like they use the partial information, decomposition over the five metric that's used in the integrated information theory of consciousness to kind of quantify emergence, like what is this? How much is this emergent property or what degree is this an emergent property of these parts? And then this is a strong and weak emergence if you include the data."
"Unknown","00;35;52;29","00;36;32;20","Oh yeah, so I just I saw it was really cool that first that you chose some papers from people in the active inference community and that there are recent papers like within the last year or two. So just shows that there's development on these topics and that's interesting to think about. And then I just thought to throw in a third like two truths in a lie but like two newer citations and one older one, just the qualitative distinction between strong and weak emergence was influential by Mark Bedell from 1997 and that paper says I conclude that the scientific and philosophical prospects for weak emergence are bright."
"Unknown","00;36;33;05","00;36;59;28","And so it's easy to be like I want like the best version of whichever thing but in the paper it distinguishes between strong emergence as being sort of the metaphysical discussion about how holes take on meanings greater than the sum of their parts and sort of all versus non like snapping into existence in this kind of semi magical way versus weak emergence like the ant colony, the city, the actual complex systems that can be modeled."
"Unknown","00;37;00;12","00;37;28;09","And so that kind of operationalized emergence while allowing a channel of metaphysical discussion like you just mentioned, consciousness and other people who bring up emergent properties consciousness all the time, like integrated information theory. It's an integrated information theory of consciousness so it's kind of just interesting how there's like a metaphysical thread in what this integration means as well as a operational and a more empirical side of this discussion."
"Unknown","00;37;29;18","00;37;57;22","And I also saw a recent 20, 21 paper, I can't remember the author, but dealing with ephemera, right? And emergence like in ephemera, which is kind of interesting. I didn't, I didn't include it, but I thought that that was cool this time. 12 months, OK, that's remarkable. Blankets, go for it. That's it. So again this, this comes from that here of paper 2018 and you know this this figures cool blankets all the way down."
"Unknown","00;37;58;18","00;38;19;23","So you know here they show a single celled organism and they predict what they illustrate one of my conflicted I'm out of the world and then you have water so organisms a blanket of blankets that says we model the world and then here it shows a pontiff that says it's like it's within blankets. We model ourselves modeling the world."
"Unknown","00;38;19;23","00;38;56;22","And that was something interesting that David Krakauer actually said at the Summer Institute this last summer. He said, you know, humans, one of the things that makes us uniquely human is that we build models of our models we build models of our models. So I thought that that was interesting. Who are then on the right side. So there's the puppy example protozoa plants, pontiffs, and then another cyber physical way that the more blanket concept and the partitioning of systems this way is being used is in digital systems."
"Unknown","00;38;57;08","00;39;23;23","So this is like a team member. And then there's a certain type of blanket that they're interfacing through in terms of sense and action. And the database can also be thought of as having different kinds of sensory and action states as well as internal generative model. It's dealing with the different external set of states that's from the framework and at all 2020 paper how about multi scale integration?"
"Unknown","00;39;24;00","00;39;45;23","You can go for it. So I'll just read the yellow here. And so this is from the round set of our paper 2019, which I think that that's where this figure is from. And then there's also the husband Alex, what do you think it says the multi skill integration this view is a pluralists theory about cognitive boundaries. It uses the notion of nested."
"Unknown","00;39;45;23","00;40;15;01","Markov think it's to demonstrate that cognitive systems have a plurality of ontological boundaries in each relevant to the study of cognition. According to this view in each of the spatial temporally nested components of this cognitive system, maybe ontologically picked out by deploying the Markov blanket formalism at different scales. And that's what we were talking about earlier. We talk about individuality at different scales and we talked about the mark up like individuating systems."
"Unknown","00;40;15;02","00;40;43;05","So this is just one way that multi-skilled integration can be approached. But before the markup, like it even was an idea, there was other approaches to partitioning motor skill systems so let's just go right to the author's distinction in the paper of what unique skill integration is and how it relates to the adaptive versus mere active inference discussion."
"Unknown","00;40;43;05","00;41;12;17","And this is a question Stephen also raised in the chat. So more than skill integration so that's that nesting of systems within one another, just not intentionally, not adding any adjective, just any kind of nesting systems multi skill integration of living systems that fail to possess the high degree of autonomy required of adaptive active inference, and hence fail to be cognizant, continue to engage in mere active inference at fast timescale, e.g. a mitochondria in a cell."
"Unknown","00;41;13;18","00;41;56;22","So that is visualized here before returning to the quote, like the circular nodes on the bottom, let's just say are doing mere active inference. They're simple sensors or actuators, and then they sort of just in a very clean way lead to increasingly weekly emergent behavior that starts approximating adaptive active inference. So if, for example, you have a Python script that is adaptive active inference, just so we don't have to even debate whether, you know, snails or birds are doing it, just you write a script that is adaptive active inference the sub functions within it, even though they might have an input output structure and even a generative model, they're going to be a lot more"
"Unknown","00;41;57;13","00;42;28;29","mechanical or simple or linear, not displaying the properties of the actual active agent in the Python script at the higher level. So that's describing this process of unique scale integration and then just the paper describes more about how adaptive active inference at the slower scale of the colonizing system. That's the thought bubble here drives the continued integration of the nested markup blankets and scales below it and not vise versa."
"Unknown","00;42;29;09","00;42;59;03","So the Python's variables drive the patterns of the computation of the lower level functions, but it does those don't meaningfully feed back into a higher level properties. So adaptive active inference at the high end and then not just being merely explained mechanistically by unique directional integration with systems that are decreasingly cognized or like on some continuum of cognition."
"Unknown","00;43;00;27","00;43;32;11","So I like the term that's used here and I think I'll highlight why when we come to the second slide. But he says the behavior of constituent nested Markov like if systems are enslaved to the slower dynamics, thoughts of the outside arising cognizant organism so I like this concept of enslaving the subroutines. OK, cognitive evolution don't say anything sure."
"Unknown","00;43;32;11","00;43;58;12","So this is just I'll just read this little excerpt from a paper paper because I didn't technically use the term cognitive deletion and I thought that it might refer to a couple of different things, but I'll read this quote because I think it's maybe highlights the point that the author was getting at. So this is a question about the kinds of physiological individuals that we can reasonably ascribe the term cognize to."
"Unknown","00;43;58;22","00;44;27;18","It's a question about how to count biological max. The significance of this question lies in the fact that its answer may be used to shed light upon possible major transitions in cognition. Perhaps there are many such transitions that move from reflex behavior to sensory motor coordination, the move from non sentence to sentence, the move from individual intentionality to group intentionality, which again echoes the major transition of of evolution."
"Unknown","00;44;28;19","00;44;47;20","So cognitive evolution I thought about it in a couple of ways and we're coming to the code slide next. So maybe for so first let's flip to the current slide. So, you know, I thought that that's one way that we can think about cognitive evolution from like the transitions and evolution from say multicellularity to or a single cell to multicellular."
"Unknown","00;44;48;13","00;45;14;06","But here this is from Mike Levin's paper, The Computational Boundary of the Self. And you can see this is like the cognitive cone right so this is the cognitive cone of an individual that like those that were, you know, inverted and used in this way. But you can see that the the cognitive cone of a tic is much smaller than that of a dog, is much smaller than that of a human."
"Unknown","00;45;14;14","00;45;53;21","And so perhaps this cognitive evolution is you know, in terms of of the whole of the organism or, you know, cognitive capacity of an organism. But Mike here uses this idea of nested kind of this multi-skilled nested cognition. And here he's somewhere here in the cell, the organism, the colony to represent these compounds, intelligences. And when we talked on the stream back in July, like we talked about the warping of the the cone that like the bigger cone, the like."
"Unknown","00;45;53;21","00;46;17;23","So the colony enslaves the behavior of the organism, enslaves the behavior of the cell. And so this goes all the way down. And that's why I liked what Matthew Sims, his term enslaving in these nested Markov structures, because the idea that like if you were to grab and twist the top of this cone, you would grab and twist all the cones in it, depending on how tight you twisted it."
"Unknown","00;46;18;04","00;46;50;20","So I like this idea of enslaving the behavior. And this was a good visual to kind of tie that all together that but terminology also arises from Synergetic, from Harken, not Fuller, as they say. And this is footnote ten in order parameter is a notion taken from energetics and used in dynamic systems theory. It denotes a measure of a global systems macro scale, unstable, slow dynamics that's like the sleep wake that enslaves the fast and mimics of micro-scale component systems."
"Unknown","00;46;50;20","00;47;16;10","That's like the EEG rhythm and results in a globally emergent pattern. So it's about multi scale systems organizing. But synergetic, how can not fuller approaches it from a dynamic systems follower, approaches it from a geometric perspective? So there's other ways to do this. Partitioning Mark and Blanket is not the only partitioning out there, but this was cool about also Levin's partitioning, which we just got to learn about."
"Unknown","00;47;17;28","00;47;44;18","All right, onto the split. So I don't know if these are the exact right species, but one of the key empirical examples, the paper, the one that's followed up on, do you want to describe the system is? Sure. Well, so I mean, the vibrio fishery or the bacteria that colonized the squid and yes, it's the why and bobtail squid."
"Unknown","00;47;44;25","00;48;07;14","And shout out to Michelle. This again is her lab. That was the lab underneath my lab when I was in my in my working in a violent biology lab. So the juvenile squid recruits the delivery of fish right into what's called a light organ and that the bacteria are bioluminescent and so it becomes essentially like inoculated with these."
"Unknown","00;48;07;25","00;48;36;14","And so then it says, I'll just read this because it's easy. It's probably a better description so it's a nocturnal predator of the shallow reef, the Verizon sensor that hunts at night. So it's always whether or not it's preyed upon. It's always influenced with this association, with these bioluminescent bacteria. So the juvenile is inoculated into the light or bye through seawater and then the host promotes the colonization of Vibrio fish."
"Unknown","00;48;36;14","00;48;58;06","Right. And only bigger fish right there. The production of mucus, which is bacteria of food, the elimination of competing bacteria through human like defenses of its innate immune system and the eventual shedding of the ciliated appendage appendages and swelling of the crypts membranes preventing further entry and into the light organ. So the switch sucks up the degree of this, right?"
"Unknown","00;48;58;06","00;49;24;08","Says We want you only want you. All of the other bacteria we're not going to allow them like we're just not going to facilitate that interaction. And then it says following gradients, gradients of chitin, which they feed upon raw fish, right? Migrate deeper into the purpose of the light organized organ, colonizing it and causing a biochemical reaction resulting in their emission of bioluminescence like this occurs just in time to the barb tails nightly for prey."
"Unknown","00;49;24;10","00;49;51;00","And something else I thought that was important for this cycle is that there are expelled every at the every morning so that they get out like this. So like they colonize the bottles with colonizes and it sucks up all the bacteria. They multiply and divide inside of the of the squid and then it shoots about, OK, so they're back in the sea water and they are available for recapture by other squid nice."
"Unknown","00;49;51;05","00;50;25;03","So we're going to return to the mark of blanket partitioning and then consider that squid system and how using the Marco Blanket partitioning we can distinguish between uni directional and reciprocal multi scale integration. So the nomenclature in this paper are the internal states, maybe because there's R in the word, then S and A are the usual words for the state of sensory sense states coming into our as an active action, states going out of our influence by."
"Unknown","00;50;25;15","00;50;58;19","So these are like the set of isolating nodes from which knowing them, you're knowing as much as you can about ah, the internal states and then here Fi or V, I don't know which one of this is the external states. OK, it's both. Yes, OK. Figure two is where we turn to these two different kinds of motor skill integration and directly compare them using kind of the nomenclature and the contribution, I believe, of this specific paper."
"Unknown","00;50;59;15","00;51;34;25","So to understand the difference, I will deploy the terminology of users, you and resources are users are living systems, the internal states of which inferentially generates some personal predictions that allow them to use other Markov blanket systems that are external to them. So here is like the spider making its web. So it's a user of this extended cognitive resource and so we can imagine that there's a Markov blanket partitioning that's around these entities."
"Unknown","00;51;35;17","00;51;52;17","Like we don't need to deny that there is a partitioning between the web and the spider. We can think about it using this you and R maybe this you and R is a partition. We can ask the author like Is it a partitioning of just Markov blankets from each other? Is there going to be some sort of interface?"
"Unknown","00;51;52;17","00;52;20;14","Is that the niche or that's the uni directional case. The bi directional case is where those two interacting systems, in the same way that the spider can be thought of as the unidirectional user of the resource of the web, that the two interactions are sort of using and benefiting from each other as a extended cognitive resource so that is the one of the main points of the paper."
"Unknown","00;52;20;29","00;52;59;06","Looking at that difference between kind of mere mortals scale systems and then ones where it's not just like a ladder, it's almost like a conversation that is giving some new emergence outcomes very cool. OK, the next slide to show some more discussion on the new you and our relationships that arise and then how the new non equilibrium steady state density arising from that interaction."
"Unknown","00;53;00;05","00;53;37;19","Then in the Synergetic Sense acts as a ordering parameter for you one and you two. So the constituents are part of a new ordering regime because of the bi directional relationship to be clear, each constituent, by Cognizant, continues to engage in adaptive active inference, acting in ways that ensure it remains statistically separate from its environment. So again, in the uni directional case, it's mere active inference on the bottom that becomes increasingly cognitive as you go towards some level of autonomy like a pyramid scheme."
"Unknown","00;53;38;05","00;54;17;18","This is like a different structure where there's increasing levels of autonomy, of different kinds of interacting systems and then there's sort of a bigger wrapper around that OK, cool. It's like the the interaction creates a new cone, a new tent, it builds a tent yet makes sense. So then this slide brings this emergence from the functional, because it's one thing to say that the functional, you know, these two brain regions get coupled together."
"Unknown","00;54;17;24","00;54;44;26","Now there's a functional difference in their firing rates. That's kind of a low mechanistic bar, the higher bar to pass is this concept of ontological emergence. Like it really becomes a thing in and of itself. And the author writes that's related to these two ideas that first, that some properties of the macro system cannot be reduced to the structural properties of the component parts and they're governing micro dynamics."
"Unknown","00;54;45;11","00;55;11;23","So that sort of anterior duction ism or holism where that exists, there's a strong argument that you're kind of losing something if you keep on dissecting. And then two, because of this irreducible properties a macro level system has ontological status is an entity in its own right. So that just is a good question to think about and to ask the author just which systems are uni directional integrators, which systems are bi directional?"
"Unknown","00;55;13;03","00;55;40;27","How do we know? Why does it matter those are just all good questions to ask. So another question that I have is to what degree does do these new properties have to exist? Like if we're going to quantify emergence in the very quantitative sense, is it any number greater than zero or where are we drawing the line at?"
"Unknown","00;55;41;03","00;56;08;22","What number of emergent properties or what quant, what quantity of new properties creates a new system? Yeah, it comes up with integrated information theory and a lot of other quantitative measures of integration and consciousness because it's like, OK, so this systems one and this one's 100,000. Are you going to have now a second level theory? Like 500 is the cutoff or is it true that I could trade one of these for 100,000 of these?"
"Unknown","00;56;09;02","00;56;37;12","Like once you start putting everything on a numerical value and then that becomes your action selection metric, oh, if it's worth the square root of this, then it's worth this. It's a sense of a market for action based upon these metrics, which is pretty interesting. That's a bi directional divergence. But Figure three is using the Markov blanket partitioning to look at the squid system."
"Unknown","00;56;38;05","00;57;06;21","So the squid is like user one, resource two. So for species one it's this weird bacteria system. So resource species pair one is the squid and its first user and second resource v fisheries. You two are one so these show the two kinds of interfaces like they're encircling each other. So it's kind of like embedded one is embedded within the other from a causal perspective."
"Unknown","00;57;06;21","00;57;36;16","They're the niche for each other because even though when you put them on the two dimensional map, they're all just like flat, they're on the plane they're nearest neighbors are either themself or the other one. So that's kind of a cool way to expand the topology of the just the histology of the tissue and then pull out like actually, you know, each beta cell in the pancreas is surrounded by other cells that aren't beta cells or something like that."
"Unknown","00;57;37;00","00;57;49;14","And the other ones, in a weird sense are also surrounded by the other kind of cell, even though there's a lot more of this non beta cell type. So just a cool way to look at tissue interactions from the Markel blanket perspective."
"Unknown","00;57;53;11","00;58;26;21","Yeah. OK, well now I'm going for you want to describe for or what so or what not so so here in this figure it shows the, the squid cycle which we have talked about. We just we just talked about it. So it shows at time zero the squid is resting after venting. So there's some debris essentially left inside of the squid."
"Unknown","00;58;26;21","00;59;02;23","They're not, you know, sterilizing themselves. And so there's this is the repopulate version of fish. Right. And so then after 12 hours, there's a high density of them we have to try and then it shows this degree of inertia. So on the y axis is degree of integration is the degree of bio cognitive individuality. And so right here when there's the most squid inside the body of this ray, that's when there's the peak of integration, presumably because the squid with the three very of fish right inside of it is not going to light up."
"Unknown","00;59;03;04","00;59;31;05","But when it concentrates, it has a whole lot of pressure inside of the light organ, then that's when it's essence and that's when the novel properties. So like the you know well the is right alone with these sufficient to be like there's not enough of them to be luminescent and then the squid alone without the debris of the shell it doesn't light up and then it's not capable of of predation in the way that it normally does."
"Unknown","00;59;31;26","01;00;00;22","And so it's the peak of integration happens right before the sun comes up and then at dawn that the fish are expelled and then the bioluminescence is over. So that's that's kind of when there's no integration between the two are limited or minimal integration between the two species thanks for the explanation. So a few things on this. It's like there's no single cut off this dashed line."
"Unknown","01;00;01;04","01;00;31;05","It's kind of like how many grains of sand in a heap. Like one is usually, you know, two few, but 100 maybe you're getting there. So it's this continuum of cognitive embeddedness and of emergent function. And there is an actual time that that is most functional and not just because the world has an actual structure where there's a certain time where there's the most light and its darkest outside, and then there's a time where it's ineffective."
"Unknown","01;00;31;15","01;01;02;04","So if we can discount it when it's ineffective and low density and we can see that this is like the peak of that natural variability when it's the most bright of the bioluminescence and the most dark outside, there's something that's varying between those two levels. And so this was just a cool way to show that that there's a smooth increase and that it's a little bit like model specific where we choose to draw the line with who's the biological colonizer."
"Unknown","01;01;02;25","01;01;26;16","So this was a cool pattern and to include the environmental variation in the cognition. So it's not like here's when you're good at taking tests or not it was like, here's the environment as it changes and then here's how the organism is. This reminds me of like, you know, building a nightlight out of fireflies. So I don't have a California because the fireflies there, when I was a little kid, they were everywhere on the East Coast and so we would catch fireflies."
"Unknown","01;01;26;16","01;01;45;09","But like how many fireflies does it take to make like if you can't have one? Well, kind of the size of your jar, but how many can you catch if you can't feed a night, like with one firefly, like there's just not enough light. But if you get like, you know, 20 in there, then you have a good night nightlight so true."
"Unknown","01;01;45;19","01;02;14;22","How many make a party? Right. OK, this is fun. Philosophical implications of the vibrio squid symbiosis. So just nice argument by nature approach that I'm sure we could learn more about that. How do you go from an observation in the natural world? Oh, this bird, you know, the one with this chromosome set does this for this long. Ergo this is possible or this is something about nature in general."
"Unknown","01;02;16;01","01;02;41;20","So there are three philosophical implications that are exposed by this striking association between the Vibrio and the squid that are significant to the account of symbiotic minds, which follows. So the first one is that the Vibrio squid is a clear example of a symbiotic physiological individual and that's distinguished from the other non physiological individual systems like collections of physiological individuals."
"Unknown","01;02;41;29","01;03;03;23","You know, if I eat food, the other person doesn't get the nutrients, but then you go, OK, but one person eating does provide the nutrients for another person. So it's going to be a continuum and there's that's like sort of the complexity of it, but it's a great example of integration that like I like it. And then the second one is physiological individuals are matters of degree."
"Unknown","01;03;04;07","01;03;28;04","Over time, the same living system can be more or less of a symbiotic physiological individual. So I think that really takes that almost unsaid criticism of the first points and immediately builds on it to say like, yes, it is a continuum and that's the whole interesting part is you can see how the system's cognitive interfaces change through time."
"Unknown","01;03;28;04","01;03;51;27","And that's the interesting story. Like for humans, certainly our ability to do something alone in a room is going to change through time. When we're born, it's very low and then there's an age range where you can do some task alone in a room and then eventually there isn't. So it's like that is something that varies continuously, just like there's the daily rhythm, there's a lively rhythm to some cognitive elements of all systems."
"Unknown","01;03;52;14","01;04;17;17","So it's not reducing them or explaining them away. It's actually looking at that variability and what it says about the system. And then the last philosophical implication may be thrown into relief when asking the critical question, what is it that produces the bioluminescence, the squid, the bacteria, or the temporary assemblage of these organisms? So is that a thing that deserves a noun of itself?"
"Unknown","01;04;17;27","01;04;41;29","Because we have nouns for assemblages of other things of one type, like a barrel of oil or something like that. But is there a unit and a noun, or are we left to describe this only with a process and then default implicitly back to the Darwinian replicator? Oh, the squid is just trying to reproduce and the bacteria is doing competition so they're the individuals."
"Unknown","01;04;42;11","01;05;13;24","Ergo, it's a tenuous relationship or it's an injury in interaction ecologically, but it's not a thing in and of itself because it's not the replicator so those are great questions raised by the author. So the questions that I maybe have for the author. So the bioluminescence is there is every of this, right? It's just so detectable by us or presumably by the prey that the very is hunting, right?"
"Unknown","01;05;14;01","01;05;46;08","So I think it's again, like it's a continuum. It's not there is bioluminescence or there's not only one essence, there's like more or less bioluminescence or detectable bioluminescence that occurs that, you know, x lumens. Right. So it was a what is the the the line there that is from a good question. So here's one of the last points in the discussion today."
"Unknown","01;05;47;00","01;06;23;13","It's again, integrating cognitive and functional and physiological individuality together. And then what is in the background of why are those when we say individuality and we have to qualify it by saying, well, I mean informational or I mean physiological, what are we qualifying it implicitly or explicitly against? I think the materialist worldview might suggest that the individual is like just the one crepuscular entity, like the one thing that can be separated out, like the ant is the decimate worker."
"Unknown","01;06;23;22","01;06;58;10","Now there's an argument for the ant being the colony and the nest maybe being a tissue, but people say, Oh, I saw ten ants on the windowsill, not like I saw a thousandth of an ants on the windowsill. So there's, I think, a pure materialist argument for just super ability and that having that more non like characteristic. And then the author is arguing that there's this folk biological concept that sometimes prevents thinking about physiological individuals as real bona fide individuals."
"Unknown","01;06;58;28","01;07;40;01","And that's this like evolutionary individualism model which can even have a collaborative or optimistic bent to it. But it still draws lines around what levels of individuality exist in the world because they're the ones that most cleanly resemble Darwinian replicators. So not the systems that grow slowly outwards or transfer through different media in the same way. And then the argument is that FIP and its corollary active inference, the mere and adaptive and the continuum between like we talked about, offer an ideal program for bringing our folk psychological intuitions in line with the way nature has carved its own joints over evolutionary timescales."
"Unknown","01;07;40;27","01;08;13;15","So that's an interesting claim definitely. OK, last slide, this was like a William Blake line that I thought of when I saw the uni directional, the bird, a nest, a spider, a web man, friendship, people friendship. So it's a great description of kind of this modification. And I think it's getting at this idea that there's niche modification in nature."
"Unknown","01;08;14;00","01;08;36;04","And we do it. That's sort of the unambiguous part. You know, we change our environment and we're also our own environment. So then there's some dynamics of like culture and communication and being each other's niche that are very different than the bacteria changing the nature of a solution. It can go up, it can go down, but it's still there."
"Unknown","01;08;36;20","01;09;11;09","But then there's this different bounded ness to what can happen with humans working together so that just brought a close these few questions like where is the multi scale integration happening? And then how do we identify the unique directional components and the reciprocal components and great paper. So just a final thought and something that I thought about a lot in terms of reading this paper because it's this colonization of the squid by this bacteria."
"Unknown","01;09;11;09","01;09;40;17","I think a lot about us and our colonization. I mean, there are more nonhuman cells in the body than the argument cells, which is fascinating. So but we also have the ability to manipulate our needs, our internal needs, the needs of the microbes that reside within us through taking antibiotics. But there are lots of other things. Probiotics and not just antibiotics, but but just even what you eat and where you go and how whether you're breastfed or not or go through vaginal birth or not."
"Unknown","01;09;40;17","01;09;58;07","And all of these things contribute to your own inoculation or how you inoculate your children. And this is something that you can do. Like literally, you can change the composition of your microbiome, like through your lifetime. So is that means what is it? What is that exactly?"
"Unknown","01;10;01;02","01;10;32;15","I think it's one reason why a not neutral or unbiased but flexible integration model like being presented here, we can just say, OK, rather than wondering whether it falls on one side or the other of a binary classification, like, yes, it's co symbiotic or not, we just have a descriptive framework first and then we can think about the implications later or separate them somehow."
"Unknown","01;10;32;15","01;11;00;12","But we hope that if you're listening in the right time, you'll join us for the 30.1 and point two because the author hopefully will join for at least the first one. And it's cool topics and we can do a little bit like we did in 29.2. Let's think of some systems, are they uni directional, are they reciprocal? What reciprocal systems could exist like?"
"Unknown","01;11;00;12","01;11;19;03","What does that mean? So sounds good. Yep. Thanks. People who are listening and Stephen for the questions live thanks blue for collaborating on the slides here and we'll send those to the author to you for providing this great food for thought totally agreed. So thanks and see you later."
