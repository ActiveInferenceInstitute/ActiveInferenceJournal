"Unknown","00;00;08;09","00;00;40;28","Hello, everybody. Welcome to Active Lab Live Stream number 30.2. Today it is October 12th. 20, 21. And we're having our second discussion group discussion on the paper of Maxim's. How to count biological minds symbiosis, the free energy principle and reciprocal multi scale integration. Welcome to the Active Inference Lab. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference."
"Unknown","00;00;41;08","00;01;09;08","You can find us at the links here on this page. This is a recorded and an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so we can improve on our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we'll be following good video etiquette for livestreams. At this short link, you can see some of the past, present and future live streams in the lab and in the first tab you'll see the Tuesday numbered live stream."
"Unknown","00;01;09;08","00;01;45;07","So every Tuesday we have a participatory group discussion. Two weeks per paper and there's the dot zero video, which is just sort of a contextualizing video. And then these other tabs like Guess Stream, Model Stream and math stream are opportunities for just one off events on any topic that people think is relevant for the lab. So get in touch if you want to join one or co-organised one of these streams today in 30.2, we're going to be continuing to learn and discuss this awesome paper by Matthew Sims How to Count Biological Minds."
"Unknown","00;01;45;26","00;02;18;11","And we're just having fun and discussing. Last week we had Matt join which was a great discussion and we look forward to everyone's input. And if you're watching in the live chat or if you're leaving a comment later, look forward to continuing the discussion today. We're pretty much just going to introduce ourselves and say hello and then we will go wherever we feel relevant and explore different questions."
"Unknown","00;02;18;11","00;02;56;09","People can ask about a figure or a section of the text and also Blue and others have prepared some discussion questions to get into. So we can start with the warm up and introductions. So I'm Daniel and I'm a researcher in California, and I think the thing I'm excited about today, just like with many dot two's is taking a lot of these cool ideas that came up in the paper and in the dot zero and the DART one and then synthesizing and consolidating and then asking, OK, well now what next?"
"Unknown","00;02;56;28","00;03;22;29","How do we go from this conversation theory users and resources reciprocal multi scale integration and then apply it to different systems. So I think that'll be a fun topic and I'll pass to Steven thank you. Yes, Steven here, I'm in Toronto on a nice sunny day and I'm really interested as well actually in these building on these ideas."
"Unknown","00;03;22;29","00;03;52;14","I'm really excited that the folk psychology and folk biology was brought up and I think that that gives permission, I think to build that further and maybe extends into how our phenomenology connects to our folk psychology, because our folk psychology allows us all to be an inherent psychologists of ourselves. Maybe. So that's interested and we just enjoy that analyzing our own reality."
"Unknown","00;03;52;14","00;04;39;27","So I'm going to pass it over to Dave yeah. I'm in the mountains of the Philippines and it's the end of the rainy season, and so we'll have no weather until next year. I am pumped up about the multiple disciplines that are coming together in the discussion of the paper that we're doing now, and also about Bobby Azaria, who is not afraid to jump out into the trenches and face the lunatics with their metabolism and even less pleasant arms and getting a note together to him to suggest some topics that we might want to talk about."
"Unknown","00;04;41;10","00;05;02;13","Well, two things. One off a question about Bobby, but first was when you said there's no weather, it's kind of like what Stephen said about folk psychology, no experience you know, just like, well, now I'm awake and now experience is going to stop. It's kind of like weather stopping. Like weather's always happening. It's always changing in different ways."
"Unknown","00;05;03;05","00;05;31;13","And our experience is also always happening and always in different ways. But just like weather sometimes only gets studied or discussed in the context of catastrophe, or pathology or of extremely unusual events. There's this like baseline weather that's just the climate. And so that's very interesting about our day to day felt realities and then how everybody is in the driver's seat with respect to their experience."
"Unknown","00;05;31;22","00;05;57;23","So sort of the mundaneness of weather, the mundaneness of experience, but also it's something that can be really unpacked. Stephen Yeah, exactly. The mundane. This is interesting, especially we think of the trials that set things up because in some ways it's like the psychologist in psychology gets to decide on the modeling that's going to be used to look at people."
"Unknown","00;05;58;05","00;06;24;22","Whereas in folk psychology this is the implicit modeling that we are framing ourselves around. And of course the same with the biology which this paper brings up and maybe the physics and whatever so these kind of implicit priors you can't get away from them. And maybe in a way it's it brings us into this interest in all those priors."
"Unknown","00;06;25;05","00;06;53;13","How much of them are psychological are they more like practice based, phenomenological questions? So it's an interesting balance there, too. And then the second question so Bobby Azarian is going to be doing a guest stream in November. We have a few guest streams coming up. So there's multiple. But Dave, what made you excited about his presentation or work with a universal Bayesian ism?"
"Unknown","00;06;54;27","00;07;26;18","Well, it's not so much that particular approach, it's that he's been doing a lot of work on cult formation, cult dynamics, the growth of violent cults, especially in the US right now. And that directly ties into Philip Darren's work on the Neuroscience of Delusion OK, very interesting. And so I'm just showing on the screen, those are the dates."
"Unknown","00;07;26;18","00;08;28;17","November 19th is with Bobby, but we'll have Greg Enriquez on the 11th hour on October 22nd for number 11 then Martin Boots for 12 on October 25th Adam Saffron on November 8th and then November 19th so cool guestrooms coming up and of course everyone's always welcome to join so let's return. Yeah I didn't notice you'd gotten books great. I yeah sometimes people just sneak in there, you know OK so let's return to 30.2 and I'm sure Blue will join so let's just save some tasty pieces for her that she added in and then otherwise I think we can maybe let's start with these questions on so, so blue in absentee asynchronous blue, our favorite cheat contributing to the discussion."
"Unknown","00;08;29;06","00;08;51;09","So let's see what we think and if we can connect it to some of the ideas or sections or figures of the paper at any given time, can agents act autonomously as long as there is a defined prior event? I think maybe that's connected to the second question. Is there a difference between a cognize or and an autonomous agent?"
"Unknown","00;08;51;26","00;09;57;23","So how are the terms of cognition agents slash agency and autonomy how do these terms act like if we imagine a three dimensional space and we think, OK, you could have you know, ten 00, you have ten cognition, zero agency, zero autonomy, what is the space of the possible of cognition agency? And autonomy? And then how are these different terms linked are one out of necessity leading the other or lagging the other so Stephen and then Dave I mean this question about defined prior, I mean, the other option is, is if they don't need a defined prior and they can build up their inference process without having that prior."
"Unknown","00;09;58;00","00;10;26;16","So I'm not sure which way that might be. The most important is it is the autonomous agent, obviously, assuming the agent can survive, this is not a bolt of lightning or something. So it's something that can have some sort of non equilibrium steady state over time. Is it more about the autonomous agent being able to act and process its active inference independently of others?"
"Unknown","00;10;27;02","00;10;40;16","And that's may be more key. And maybe that's that happens with cancer as well, you know, so I don't know Welcome Blue. We're just on Slide seven working through some of your interesting questions. Dave."
"Unknown","00;10;42;22","00;11;28;26","Yeah, on that, the first question in the dialog between Kristin and Mark Solms, the years prior are basically to me not affect or the other brainstem residents biological imperatives. And I think Solms would tell you that except in anesthesia, you know, deep, deep anesthesia and perhaps coma, there's always operative priors because you really can't dissociate the homeostatic goal seeking from the higher process."
"Unknown","00;11;28;26","00;12;18;16","The sense of the higher processes are completely dependent on and shaped by the the homeostatic activities. And I wouldn't even accept coma without qualification because of the I don't know if this research has been borne out, but there are therapists who have simply proceeded on the assumption that deeply comatose individuals actually are taking something away from their experience and they're finding that in recovery from coma that yeah, if you talk to people on a daily basis, so you talk about interesting things or unresolved problems, this shapes the way they are going to talk about their experience afterwards."
"Unknown","00;12;19;10","00;13;00;18","One thing that happens is that people people's thinking becomes extremely slow minutes rather than seconds, and that if you actually speed up videos of the response of comatose individuals, you'll see response about and just like if you slow down high resolution videos of infants, you'll see that, yes, they're highly attuned to what's going on around them. They're they do have their own priors that through which they're responding to to events and actually shaping them in a healthy diet."
"Unknown","00;13;03;21","00;13;34;10","Interesting. So I think starting with with Stephen's point, anyone can, of course, can just raise their hand or write a question, live chat. So the question about starting with a prior and whether we start with a very defined prior, like a domain specific prior or whether that's learned that is reminiscent of the difference between first order cybernetics and then higher order cybernetics, like the first order cybernetics of chemistry is your priors on chemistry."
"Unknown","00;13;34;20","00;14;18;00","And the second order would be your approach to learning or your dynamics of flexibility around study habits or around updating your generative model of chemistry, as well as the second order generative model of learning. So as we start to sort of meet in the middle with building active inference up to describe and model these increasingly recursive and symbolic cognizance, we'll start to see the movement from models that merely describe the mountain car into models of mental action, into higher order, cybernetic models of mental action."
"Unknown","00;14;18;14","00;14;41;16","So that will be very cool. And then I think you mentioned the lightning bolt. And so I was coming back to this this trilemma or these three terms, there's more terms could be added like does Lightning Bolt have agency? Does it have autonomy? Well, it sure seems to just act the way that it's apt to so. It seems like an autonomous system."
"Unknown","00;14;41;16","00;15;08;24","It's not waiting for a Bluetooth connection with something else. So it's high autonomy. And then does it have agency, though? And so how is there a difference? And then cognition, especially because the example of lightning bolt, it's electricity. So if what we've been talking about with Professor Levin and others is that like bio electricity is sort of the fundamental that's where biotic and abiotic cognition come together."
"Unknown","00;15;08;24","00;15;45;02","Or where they they blur. So then is a lightning bolt cognitive. And so that was and then just a last comment was the speed of perception and cognition action. Well, active inference is about integrated modeling of perception, cognition and action. So then we're in a quasi computational framework. There are computational ists among us people who think that cognition is computation as well as people who take more nuanced steps or reject that notion."
"Unknown","00;15;45;15","00;16;13;28","But this is kind of like our clock speed. This is like the speed of that loop, what's the tick speed of the generative model? And that relates to the thickness of our temporal experience like flickering images at 30 per seconds are perceived as continuous. So we don't know exactly what the clock speed is or whether a clock speed is even the apt metaphor but surely there are stimuli that are so close spatially or temporally, we cannot tell the difference."
"Unknown","00;16;14;19","00;16;53;10","So it was just cool to hear like that different ages and different conditions might have different parameters for their internal generative model and perception. Action loops blue and then anyone else so going back to whether or not a lightning bolt has agency, it certainly seems that like if there is a defined fire like a lightning bolt, there's a defined like prior state that, you know, like the dielectric constant has to break down for lightning bolt to be able to to occur so as long as there's that defined prior, then yes, like the lightning bolt acts autonomously."
"Unknown","00;16;53;26","00;17;18;23","But, but does it have agency is like, well, what's the goal of the lightning bolt? Is it to like minimize the electricity build up in the cloud or like what would the goal of a lightning bolt be? And so that's kind of what you think about like even or what I think about when it comes to like cells, OK?"
"Unknown","00;17;18;23","00;17;41;15","The goal of a single celled organism is to maintain homeostasis at some set point or within some range. So but a lightning bolt, really, what's the goal of a lightning bolt? And so I think about that. I don't know. So does a lightning bolt have a goal? And that's kind of where the sense of agency comes into play for me."
"Unknown","00;17;41;28","00;18;01;21","And like, yeah, if you define the goal like in a in a, you know, autonomous car, like your goal is to safely transport people from HP without running anyone over or getting smashed. Like that's very simple. I know, but, you know, obeying all the traffic rules and so forth so you can establish a goal for an autonomous car."
"Unknown","00;18;01;21","00;18;35;22","But does the car come up with its own goal or is that like a human driven goal? And is the car then the tool for the human? So so there's like some fuzzy boundaries here, that kind of always pointing toward the left mind continuity thesis, which I think we probably haven't gotten to yet, but maybe we'll get there where life has to happen at some degree for for cognition to occur maybe or maybe not very cool."
"Unknown","00;18;35;22","00;18;56;09","So the goal of the lightning bolt. So let's think of a few, you know, physical systems we know and love like a ball rolling down to the bottom of a ball. It's minimizing its kinetic energy differential. That's one description. Not to say that's the explanation, but it's minimizing something by rolling to the bottom of the ball without fail."
"Unknown","00;18;56;29","00;19;33;12","Similarly, when there's an electric charge built up between the cloud and the ground or between two electric components inside of an electronic device, there's like a zap of electricity that can also be understood in terms of minimizing some energy differential. That's what's interesting about active inference is we're also thinking about minimizing differentials of information. And so what stories are explanations or descriptions of the ball rolling down kinetically or the lightning strike electromagnetically?"
"Unknown","00;19;33;26","00;19;58;04","And then are we going to have the exact same template of explanation for action of biological entities? So that's a and where does teleology and directness like is the ball rolling into the part of the ball? Is that end directed or is it just directed only by a proximate teleology like a next step only? So people say evolution has no end."
"Unknown","00;19;58;12","00;20;26;11","It's just a local optimization process, for example. So it's behavior along those lines. And then the second point then Stephen and Dave was like, is the system of interest, the primary colonizer, or is it being used in an extended or an instrumental fashion? I wasn't sure on the answer there, but that speaks to Matt's paper with the users and the resources."
"Unknown","00;20;26;25","00;20;50;18","And so there's cases where you have like an adaptive active inference agents utilizing a mere act of influencer as a tool. Like you could be using a thermometer as a tool as you investigate the cave but then there's this other reciprocal case where actually the the primary organizers are sort of adaptive on both sides. So there's a lot to explore there."
"Unknown","00;20;51;01","00;21;31;20","Stephen Yeah. The idea of things being either frozen as a certain state or having the ability to be a hold stay in that state, I think about well, I mean, on a big scale, the sun, right? The sun has got an energy differential, but it's is self maintaining, right? Because as it keeps going, more and more material can be fuzed in the middle and it keeps so you get into the broader question of complex adaptive systems of which non equilibrium steady state systems are a subset."
"Unknown","00;21;31;20","00;21;59;14","So you've got this, you know, there's an interesting point there. And when you have something which dissipates and can't form a Mark Colvin, so boundary you say it will lose that. But there are times when you can maintain that. For instance, if you have a globular, molten silica plunging into cold water, you can freeze the liquid state. It's still a liquid, but it's glass now."
"Unknown","00;21;59;25","00;22;40;15","So this same so it's maintaining that over longer periods of time but is it is it still non is as it as it formed, is it just waiting to allow its energy gradients dissipate or is it now managed to hold its state more concretely? Very interesting. Has a true pattern or structural integrity been reached or are we just sort of pausing or freeze, freeze thaw on the energy differential, just sort of make the bowl made of Velcro so it's still stuck up there Dave Yeah."
"Unknown","00;22;40;15","00;23;20;05","There is a hilarious Tour de force by Stuart Bartlett on life as a solution to the planet Earth. Dilemma of having too much heat and needing to get rid of it faster. And he breaks down all these amazing processes culminating with the reverse Krebs Super Acid Cycle as increasing the efficiency with which he can be radiated by creating just the right kinds of molecules in enough concentration to catalyze that problem."
"Unknown","00;23;20;17","00;23;21;24","Well, it's hot in here."
"Unknown","00;23;24;09","00;23;38;14","This it's kind of like the science fiction classification. I don't know what class, you know, class one, class two, class three civilizations, whether they're energy capacity, is like less than a star, equal to a star or multiple stars."
"Unknown","00;23;40;17","00;24;11;00","Some thermodynamic perspectives on the emergence and the elaboration of life. When we see living systems like Schrodinger or Scott David as entropic systems that are resisting dissipation, and you realize that for every unit of order that is constituted inside of the blanket, that more disorder must occur outside, you know that it can't be free lunch and it isn't going to be one to one either."
"Unknown","00;24;11;00","00;24;44;26","So you're making an excess of disorder, which is what pulls chemical reactions forward when you order like forever, you know, £1 of muscle organized on your body, more than £1 of muscle equivalents have to be dissipated. And then it is actually this imperative that's thermodynamic for life to continue inventing potentially even increasingly seemingly inefficient mechanisms so that's sometimes what I think about when someone talks about the energy use of cryptocurrency."
"Unknown","00;24;44;26","00;25;10;08","I think, you know, if you went into the cell and you said, well, we already have the enzyme making the forward reaction, why do we need the one making the backwards reaction that's wasting energy? Well, it gives flexibility to the cell and it pushes the reactions forward. And it gives a capacity to regulate very adaptively. So it's not always like we can just look at the the heat producing light bulb and say that that's the inefficient one, so bloop."
"Unknown","00;25;10;08","00;25;45;03","And then Steven so I wonder to thermodynamically is like life ultimately causing like the heat death of the universe, right? Like are we using up all of the, the thermodynamic free energy that's available with the process of life like we are like in the Scott David sense you know entropy secreting right? We're the only in entropy. I mean life is the only entropy minimizing thing that I can think of."
"Unknown","00;25;45;03","00;26;17;06","But I mean, is this ultimately going to lead to the lack of free energy, thermodynamics, free energy that's available to do work which is just an interesting thing to think about. And then also I was listening to some older live streams and maybe, maybe they've actually probably have the knowledge to kind of clarify for me. But I always thought that informational free energy was fundamentally connected to thermodynamic free energy."
"Unknown","00;26;18;10","00;26;54;05","And so is like in what someone had suggested that that was not the intention of the free energy principle was never supposed to involve thermodynamics. Initially. And I just wonder, is that like some abstract bridge that was formed, the connection between infotainment MC and thermodynamic entropy, or is that a real concrete connection? And so for me, it's something I've always thought about as as like, you know, links through physics and statistical physics."
"Unknown","00;26;54;11","00;27;26;15","Those two things go together. But is there a disconnect there that I'm perhaps not aware of? And was the free energy principle not meant to include thermodynamics? So I would love to hear what you guys think about that. Yeah, Dave, go for it. And then Steve yeah. You know, I think both entropy and the free energy principle are higher order metaphors or analogies at least I'm guessing entropy is roughly a third level analogy."
"Unknown","00;27;26;15","00;27;59;26","You have to go up to that level of ramification to cover the various cases but there are people working on that. I think I sent you a paper by Sean Carroll on the thermodynamic interpretation of what was it, the free energy principle. I just sent that a couple of days ago. I don't know if you saw that. I dropped it in one of our chaps dropped it in the corner of a labyrinth."
"Unknown","00;28;00;23","00;28;09;03","Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to have to go back to mine. Boris. I think he's I've left too much in his various lab room."
"Unknown","00;28;11;06","00;28;34;21","Steven, yeah, there's a couple of good points there. And I suppose one thing in terms of life is, is trying to stay in that Goldilocks zone. So there's times when it's trying to. Well, in terms of heat anyway and get rid, you know, reduce the heat. And sometimes it might want to gain heat, but it doesn't really care per say."
"Unknown","00;28;34;21","00;29;29;11","It's like the the knee itself would have a greater fitness. And if there's enough fluctuations over time and in a feedback loops, in theory, you'll sort of gain the carbon dioxide levels as best can serve the overall production of carbon mass in theory. But in terms of the piece of math is really it's a good conversation around and active inference versus the free energy principle because the free energy principle variation, free energy and Jeffrey Hinton's work and the recognize in models and what that just takes you know perceptual data come in in deep mind can work with reducing free energy information but when you bring action into the game that's the thing chasing thing because"
"Unknown","00;29;29;27","00;30;02;11","it's the action that brings in the energy in a way because by the action being more efficient the the energy sort of becomes part of the landscape. So whereas the perception piece, you're kind of tied more to if there was no action active, it was just Bayesian inference. It's kind of old information up and down. But once you start bringing action into the game, that's when it starts to get a bit more interesting."
"Unknown","00;30;09;15","00;31;07;24","It's a lot to think about. Information is usually framed more on the inference side than the action side. We know there are information theoretic approaches to control theory, and there's all kinds of connections that you know, 20, 21 we can look back at and say that have been made. But information is very aligned with knowledge and inference, whereas thermodynamics brings in physical constraints, energy and action, like what is temperature if not a summary descriptor of the actions of molecules, whereas information tends to be a little bit more abstracted and disembodied and thermodynamics, even if it hasn't been connected to for e cognition extended embedded in culture et cetera."
"Unknown","00;31;09;16","00;31;45;10","It at least is closer to it, like the the pressure volume relationships of a gas they relate to its context and to how it is actually enacting physics. So then if we think about in, in informational physics, first off, how far can we get with bringing thermodynamics into information big topic? And then where is control and action in that kind of a model?"
"Unknown","00;31;45;15","00;32;09;08","Steven Yeah, this is interesting to bring in. And also if you go back to Gibbs free energy and the way it was traditionally used, I mean, you basically have reactants and you have products, which is basically where we were in terms of an equilibrium state and where we ended up. And then there's a force that's going to drive that."
"Unknown","00;32;09;09","00;32;49;04","There's an Southwick force in energy change which will drive things and will succeed depends on the activation energy of whatever is in between, which can be calculated and then there's this kind of entropic force, which is basically cough, cough. It's just inferred basically by what the reaction actually did. But because you're only going from equilibrium states, equilibrium state, whatever happens in the middle was just like, I don't know this that's basically if you if the truth be told, it's just entropy, right?"
"Unknown","00;32;49;13","00;33;32;08","So but that's not it's not just this black box in this case, it's actually all the stuff that's going on, on the journeys is where active influence is sort of in the process. So entropy or thermodynamic entropy is kind of interesting because there's there is somehow this enthalpy term in terms of energy that this is an entropic force, they call it in chemistry, which is like how the entropic shift so pushes the reaction and gives it a force which then combines with the and self force, which is basically just whether it's going to give off loads of heat or absorb heat."
"Unknown","00;33;32;26","00;34;06;01","And so I should say energy absorbing and you know, or energy. So this is where the, the, the, I think it's not entirely clear quite how that might mix up in a maybe sometimes it's safer to not make the analogy because it's non equilibrium and non equilibrium chemistry is only really started to happen in any sort of a coherent way since the 1990s in terms of research it's all been the equilibrium, state equilibrium state and hand-waving in the middle."
"Unknown","00;34;08;00","00;34;40;13","Thanks Steven Blue so I like whatever happens in the middle. I only have an abbreviated peak and like this kind of makes me wish that I had more and then like a full semester of thermodynamics to really like be able to screw these pieces together. But, but maybe they don't all actually screw together with a perfect fit. So I mean I think about OK, is, is it an exothermic or an endothermic reaction?"
"Unknown","00;34;40;13","00;35;16;11","Does energy go in or does energy come out? And essentially all life is like all of life is endothermic. Like some energy has to go in and where is that energy in life? Like because we exist in this non equilibrium point, like life isn't spontaneous. And so where is this like storage happening? And like in some like maybe it's a very abstract link, but but I think about the energy, the going that goes into creating life as information because that's essentially this DNA blueprint that we all have that carries on from generation to generation."
"Unknown","00;35;16;20","00;35;46;25","That is the catalyst for the reactions that occur that create life. So I just always I don't know how I think about it. Here's, here's one image that you'll see on your shared screen. So this relates to gives free energy. I mean, you mentioned it. We've been talking a little bit about chemistry and so this is already pre adapted to instead of B, that gives free energy."
"Unknown","00;35;47;07","00;36;12;09","It's like the pain axis so we can quibble with the specific metaphor. But the the piece that I think is interesting is the difference between the thermodynamically favored and the kinetically favored reactions. So the green line is kinetically favored. Like if there's a ball rolling, it's easier to climb the B hill. So it's easier to get on that."
"Unknown","00;36;12;18","00;36;35;19","There's less friction, less of a activation energy cost, and therefore it's kinetically more accessible to take the green route to get you to product D and then that a minus D is the delta free energy, whereas the THERMODYNAMICALLY favored product, which is like a to E, this is like a complete combustion versus a partial combustion. More energy is released."
"Unknown","00;36;35;19","00;37;08;29","There's a bigger delta g, but that product may not be as kinetically accessible. And so this is like classic OK course questions some reactions. You want to do them really hot because you just want to get over a kinetic barrier and wherever you end up is going to be OK. Other times you want to carry out the reaction very slowly so that you can be sure that the only high energy balls that come across are only going to take this green road and so it doesn't like combust."
"Unknown","00;37;09;06","00;37;42;19","So you keep the reaction cold. And then in this example, it's already been connected to sort of behavioral economics, like making a bad decision versus making a good decision. You know, you're choosing what to eat for dinner. Is it going to be something with a low barrier, high kinetic accessibility but maybe not healthy, but where do we transmute from the kinetic versus thermodynamics of chemicals to kinetics and thermodynamics of information and decision making and action?"
"Unknown","00;37;43;07","00;38;17;15","And then the closing the triangle would be like is there a bio energetic or a metabolic account for decision making? Like it literally uses more glucose in your brain to make taxing decisions. And that would sort of close the loop in in an interesting way. So Stephen, then Dave yeah, this is so this is also quite useful diagram because I mean you'd have that kind of activation transition stage as being the kind of the hill, right?"
"Unknown","00;38;17;15","00;39;05;00","So the higher the hill, the more energy is needed to make that transition state become available. But it is a case of it going from left to right within reason. I mean, there is that idea that things can move both ways. But what's interesting is the more dillydallying to use this as an English phrase, which I do a lot of that, the more dillydallying and it's not necessarily the better thing there right because the more dillydallying the molecules are doing, the less they're going to get over the hump, because it's really a case of this energy dynamic and entropy being maybe going to help because that because in certain cases, but normally it's a hindrance"
"Unknown","00;39;05;00","00;39;38;10","to something to slow it down. But the difference is when you're dealing with variations. So when you've got variation free energy, now you can get information that dillydallying gives you variation in entropy and that can give you like entropy itself doesn't necessar well, we don't entropy is a funny term, but noise alone doesn't give you any information. Variations in noise can give you information and there relations in noise need a reference of infinite."
"Unknown","00;39;38;11","00;40;06;15","Wow. I don't know if they need that, but this say it helps have a non equilibrium steady state to reference against that whole non equilibrium piece and complex attractor states and all of that sort of stuff doesn't really feature. It's not an attractive state at the top per se. It's a it's trans a transition state that some molecules go to or some configurations happen to by chance arrive that."
"Unknown","00;40;06;15","00;40;36;03","So obviously it's maybe not like that alone. There's this kind of inference process yes. So this reaction would be reversible. But imagine if the ball gets to here now it's a 5050. It could roll either way. It's at the transition point. That's what enzymes stabilize, transition state complexes. They reduce activation energy barriers. But now if you were down here in P2, it would be a positive Delta G."
"Unknown","00;40;36;19","00;40;57;12","So the energetically uphill because this is what they call a thermodynamically irreversible reaction. So K e Q like the coefficient of how complete the reaction is going to proceed is going to be way to the right on this one. But if it just looked like a hump, then in the long run you'd get an even number on both sides."
"Unknown","00;40;57;21","00;41;26;27","It's kind of like Arrogance City. And so it is there's a lot that can be seen here. So D And then yeah, the advertising name for that expensive can opener that needs to be pushed that would bind to the the harm. And actually like you, I think you said flat in the heart effectively and how does that happen?"
"Unknown","00;41;26;27","00;42;05;21","Is there a presumably you're getting a reduction of cognitive dissonance that no longer looks dissonant to imagine, oh, spending all that money. I feel so guilty about buying a $40 book the other day. How can I justify buying a $12 can opener instead of a $2.01 and the point of sale. Oh just tap it's lower kinetic friction versus you know pull out your your shells count them blue and then Steven so one the critical thing when you're talking about whether or not a reaction is reversible or not."
"Unknown","00;42;05;21","00;42;35;28","So when you have the free energy of the product and the reactant, if the free energy is the same, it's completely irreversible reaction. But the fact that it's an irreversible reaction is driven by the lower free energy of the product of the reaction. And so I think about things like you know, even just the self-assembly. So we can talk about self-assembly of life of cells, but also self-assembly of molecules right?"
"Unknown","00;42;35;28","00;43;02;20","So so molecules will spontaneously like, you know, salts floating spontaneously dissolves in water. And that's driven by charge, right? And hydrogen bonds and, you know, the polar polarity of water. And so when you have this kind of spontaneous reactions that occur that are driven by like molecular charge, is that that's again like an information catalyst because the charge is information."
"Unknown","00;43;02;20","00;43;29;14","Is it positive or negative? Is it a North Pole? Is a South Pole and so that that without that kind of information, would these reactions push forward and one way that computers over the last hundred years have revolutionized this discussion is like if you just say, well, of course, information has nothing to do with it. We're talking about just chemicals tossing around in space and we're talking about thermodynamics."
"Unknown","00;43;29;14","00;43;56;10","There's no need to bring information into it. And then someone says, Well, I'm talking about the chemical components on my hard drive, or I'm talking about the chemistry of this processor. So it's like there is an information thermodynamic link. We are putting energy into this processor or hard drive. There is chemistry happening. Who will link it? It's no longer tenable position to say that there just is no linkage or it wouldn't even be useful."
"Unknown","00;43;56;22","00;44;28;15","At the very least, it would be extremely useful if not beyond useful to understand this nexus so it's kind of like that info. Thermodynamic marriage is already well in progress and we're using devices that are empirical proofs, even if the conceptual details are not quite filled in yet. Blue. And Stephen. Yeah, just to respond to that, it's like Maxwell's Daemon is essentially can be replaced by a computer, right?"
"Unknown","00;44;28;15","00;45;00;10","Like so a computer can sit on top of the box and decide whether the, you know, big molecules go this way or the hot molecules go this way and the molecules go that way. But then you'd have to put the computer in a fridge and just put the pigeon right. So there's all this like the thought experiment of, you know, the information separation or the information filtering taking place with computers and so that's also like another direct link between the info dynamic and thermodynamic capacities."
"Unknown","00;45;01;01","00;45;27;28","Thanks, Steven. Yeah, this is really interesting. And yeah, this link so it's really interesting is when it that when there's those endothermic. So for instance, actually we used to use this when we used to do reactions so in the lab. So like if you want to get a load of ice basically dumped a load of salt into it and then your ice goes down to like -18 degrees, right?"
"Unknown","00;45;28;01","00;45;55;10","So now you can start doing reactions at -18 degrees in your beaker because you can immerse in this. So your well what's just happened there, you've just dropped the temperature. That doesn't make sense. So this is where this entropic you know, the ice the whole way the ice melts and thaws and it's, you know, if you drop the temperature very, very drop the temperature, drop the beat, drop the video chat."
"Unknown","00;45;55;27","00;46;28;01","All right, Stephen, we'll continue though. Hilary, join this slide, which I just put the image up. This is like in the Wikipedia article on kinetic versus thermodynamic control. Like one doesn't have to be a chemist to see that. We're taking a few very interesting, esoteric, symmetrical molecules and there's some transition state complex. And then in the blue, if it's very cold, it's going to form this product."
"Unknown","00;46;28;01","00;47;03;26","If it's very warm, it forms a different product. So the ratio and the temperature in the solvent, there's so many details to explore, but it's just an example about like thinking fast and slow type one and type two. Kahneman, you know, decision making frameworks. What's the type one decision where is it really being thought through? You know, hey, chill out, cool down, slow your horses make the right decision versus buying under pressure time pressure for decisions."
"Unknown","00;47;04;08","00;47;37;01","That's one of the major threats to cognitive security. And good decision making is not having enough time or spending too much time on a decision which is implicitly taking away time from another decision. Because in the lab, we can just heat things up, cool them down. But, you know, we only get one sequence of action. So in a broader sense, we can't just perform well on a single decisions because we also need to do that sort of Bayesian estimation of how much time should we be spending on this decision?"
"Unknown","00;47;37;01","00;48;06;00","Blue So just thinking about time, I mean, time is always the force, the axis, right? The time is always the other other thing. But I mean, we have these things that we say, like time is money, like so. So what is the cost of time? And like I think about things like time effort, energy and money as I like things that I put in to drive a reaction forward, like things that I put in to create a result."
"Unknown","00;48;06;00","00;48;46;15","Right? Time, effort, energy and money. And so is there some kind of like quantifiable interchange between time and money or time and energy or time and effort or I mean, this time always the entropy increasing thing, but like, OK, entropy increases with time right? But like, I put time into something, right? So is this am I putting entropy into something to create a result that seems very backwards and it's just cool to think about time as like, you know, something that you put in to drive a reaction forward."
"Unknown","00;48;46;15","00;49;15;17","I don't know and quality time, like attention maybe it's like, you know, if we had a unit in ERG or a calorie of attention or, you know, the calories, the temperature, heat of some metal sphere and the cloud, you know, there's different amounts of specific heat. And so maybe individuals attention will be different. It's different to get the attention of peer review or one versus peer review or two."
"Unknown","00;49;16;09","00;49;43;08","But is there a commonality for attention and does that help make decisions get pushed along the road? Blue Maybe you could introduce this nice set of slides on life mine continuity. Sure. So there's a maybe, maybe the first question first and then we can maybe talk about the life my continuity thesis. So this is a quote from the paper."
"Unknown","00;49;43;08","00;50;13;26","It says, Adaptive active inference requires that a system autonomously engage in active inference, maximizing sensory evidence for its own existence. So this kind of is a different. Yeah, and they cited this reference and this is from the sentence paper. But I just thought about what is evidence for your own existence, like when I pull this quote out? And does that require self-awareness?"
"Unknown","00;50;13;26","00;50;41;24","Like like do I exist? I think therefore I am. It's very like Descartes. And I'm like, that's evidence for your existence. But like, does a little cell even is it self-aware enough to know that it exists? I mean, it is like the desire to not be extinguished, awareness of your own existence. So I think about, you know, sensory evidence for your model or for the validity of your models."
"Unknown","00;50;41;27","00;51;09;04","So that's kind of always how I think about it. Model evidence is not evidence for my existence. It's evidence for the validity of my model. So that's kind of how I've always thought about it. But it just was interesting. This this phrasing that was used by by Sims, because I just was curious, is there a difference between evidence for your existence and model evidence and just what do you guys think about that?"
"Unknown","00;51;09;04","00;51;12;09","Or am I the only one that was like, that's kind of weird."
"Unknown","00;51;15;04","00;51;47;09","There's a lot of pieces here. So one piece is that in active inference, the preferences are over sensory outcomes, not over hidden state estimates. So instead of maximizing, you know, values of hidden state estimates like making it maximally safe out there, that situation of bodily safety would be reframed as maximizing evidence for observing our observations in their preferred states."
"Unknown","00;51;47;09","00;52;24;13","So one little flourish that is active inference germane is this focus on the sensory evidence rather than inferred hidden states. And then that is an interesting question about is that is it the model of itself? What is this? How are we getting sensory evidence for our self? And is that the imperative for action? And it just reminded me because you said, you know, I think therefore I am this is Latin post hoc, ergo Proctor Hook after this."
"Unknown","00;52;24;13","00;53;18;01","Therefore, because of this, it's like the post hoc fallacy. So I think therefore I am. And then of course, you know, cue the 51st and papers I am. Therefore I think every possible inversion like is it that thought begets life or does life beget thought? And then if we're only going to find both of them inextricably tied up in actual systems, what is the partitioning or the compartmentalizing that is variously meaningful or true or so that inversion is really cool and also speaks to the podcast that was released yesterday or the podcast episode where it's clips from I think Livestream 56.5.2."
"Unknown","00;53;18;11","00;53;40;24","So there is a lot of discussion about change your mind, change your life, and then the inversion of that is change your life, change your mind, right? I think therefore I am, I am. Therefore, I think that's all of this action perception loop of activity yeah. Here's the first in paper I am. Therefore, I think he did go there."
"Unknown","00;53;41;25","00;54;14;19","He's been there this is an interesting interesting paper. It even begins the first sentence is how does Schrodinger's question, which is what is life touch on philosophical propositions such as two cards, famous proposition, cognito, ergo sum. I think therefore I am. And then not exactly a formal connection, but this weekend is cognito 20, 21. So kind of another illusion there."
"Unknown","00;54;15;11","00;54;50;22","But yeah, what does it mean for sensory evidence of our own existence is that our, our proprioception and our, our thermo perception and taste or is this referring to a higher level of mental activity like as we saw in the Sanford Smith paper on mental action the observables of one level. So like the outcomes of the higher order mental model can be plugged into the priors of a lower model or the hidden state estimates of a lower model."
"Unknown","00;54;51;04","00;55;38;08","So like is observing our attention maximize evidence or a model which we pay attention to different things. Where does, where does that play in with life mean continuity what is that question oh, go ahead, unmute. I got it. So the the distinction that seems made in the paper between adaptive active inference and mere active inference. So my question is whether this distinction follows the kind of evolutionary path or if or if it's in line with the mind's continuity business."
"Unknown","00;55;38;21","00;56;16;15","So we can kind of unpack all of those in the next couple of slides. OK, so the life my thesis so I pulled from this paper by Kirchhoff and Ambrose for we see where they asked the question, are mental phenomena restricted to living systems? And there's several viewpoints here that the first one is obviously you can answer no."
"Unknown","00;56;16;24","00;56;46;16","And there's a couple of different ways. And so the cognitive gist viewpoint is that some cognitive systems can be living systems, but minds are really associated with computational processes that have semantic content for properties, and minds can be realized independently from life given the right kind of artificial support system. And so this this allows mine to exist artificially, essentially."
"Unknown","00;56;47;08","00;57;17;19","And then there's the overly generous, non-cognitive gist of free energy principle thought that all systems can maintain the variables within the limited range of values. All systems that do this can be understood as having some kind of mentality or proto mentality, given that the CPU casts any system that maintains structural integrity in a fluctuating environment as engaged in predicting its own future states."
"Unknown","00;57;17;19","00;57;48;09","And this is kind of the pan psychic take on that that life can exist in or that not that life, but the mind can exist in things like molecules that are undergoing reactions. So there's I mean, in everything there's a mind. Thanks for this really helpful break down. So huge topic. You know, a lot of implications. So, OK, just to throw out a cell phone that we're done using or would that be you know, a rights issue?"
"Unknown","00;57;48;21","00;58;32;07","So are mental phenomena one to one restricted, necessary, sufficient? How is cognition related to life as we thermodynamically know it and some some strong shots from the know site which is saying which first off is always a somewhat easier position to defend because you can just say, look, it's a Venn diagram overlap and we don't know so who's to say that it's restricted because maybe there's some overlap, maybe there's a but not be, maybe there's be but not a so first it's a general claim that one can deny a restriction by just saying we're not sure or it might not always be that way."
"Unknown","00;58;32;21","00;59;15;06","And then this is just really it's clear and funny how you've written it overly generous like relative to the expectations of who maybe someone's very stingy with their interpretation. Maybe so hopefully the authors how they wrote it. So your current policy, that's how that was their, their, their terms. Nice. So maybe there's an RFP whale out there for whom this is still not generous enough, but if it was quite didn't mean to to edit it, but like there's the integrated information theory people their flavor of pants like ism would be like because all systems are on this continuum of integrating information pancake ism."
"Unknown","00;59;16;11","00;59;45;24","Another approach is sort of this cybernetic pancake ism, which is like because all systems are on the continuum of maintaining their variables within a limited range of values, kind of like good regulator theorem. So in other words, not because there's an information continuum but because there's a cybernetic control continuum data dot pants, I guess. So there's an information centered inference."
"Unknown","00;59;45;24","01;00;26;05","Pan inference equals pan psych ism. And here's like a pan control or pan resistance to dissipation equals pants like ism claim. So that's pretty cool that that action and inference thread come back in different guises. Welcome back, Steven. Your surroundings are less blue, but I hope that it will work. Thanks. Yep. We're on 11. We just heard some of the no voices on the question are mental phenomena restricted to living systems?"
"Unknown","01;00;26;18","01;01;05;03","And then Blue, who is on the other side of the table? Well, and then there's a couple of different views that the authors put forward in the paper as well on the yes side. So there is the non cognitive gist. So that's the the second view from the no, but plus the evolutionary come review. So this is mind, but not life requires sophisticated generated generative neural machinery that is not present in simple forms of life such as single celled organisms."
"Unknown","01;01;05;12","01;01;33;02","And that was my question about adaptive active in friends versus mirror active inference is that like putting minds above a certain is that of a certain evolutionary point, such as like higher level vertebrates or whatever only perform adaptive active inference if there evolutionarily at a certain point or in a certain sense kind of implied in a certain amount of collectivity like so."
"Unknown","01;01;33;02","01;02;01;19","So in his paper he said that, you know, whole organisms can be can do adaptive active inference but not like cells within an organism. And so that was kind of it's along the lines. Well, it doesn't necessarily link directly to sophisticated neural machinery. It seems like sophisticated collective autonomy or like like what what was the the sophistication and where was this line?"
"Unknown","01;02;01;19","01;02;40;09","And I kind of pushed Matt on that when he was here. But I just wonder, is that is that links somehow to to this way and then I don't know if Stephen, did you want to say something or and then I can talk about the life might have gotten cut to yes. Yeah I think actually you can just kind of continues what you're saying continues a little bit with the graph that we had earlier there in the sense that I was thinking when when something goes over that that graph and goes down the other side with active inference, the like with normal reactions."
"Unknown","01;02;40;09","01;03;05;26","Right. You do it any time with the same reactants, it's the same basic curve every time, right? Because it's, it's a standard thing. But with life gets a chance to know what the final outcomes have been and start to maybe change the energy of the hump. It can actually change particularly maybe is what if there's non equilibrium steady states in there, but there's a natural ability to infer backwards."
"Unknown","01;03;05;26","01;03;34;02","And I suppose the that inability to infer backwards will in real time which in real time could be chemical time that that could kind of happen through enzymes or maybe through the mediation of enzymes. And whether that's cognition or whether that's could be done through some real time, you know, chemical inference process. And then of course you've got that happening over longer times."
"Unknown","01;03;35;01","01;04;04;03","And this then becomes when you start to move from a variation of free energy into an expected free energy, you know, but that ability to go backwards or forwards and start to sculpt the landscape of intermediaries yeah. I wonder, I think that kind of ties into what you're saying I'm going to do a little life mind Venn diagram."
"Unknown","01;04;05;19","01;04;40;22","What kind of a universe or world or simulation or whatever do life and minds look like partial overlap like in this world it's just this a little different color you know, in this world there's things that are having mind, but not life and vice versa. So that is a strict refutation of the restriction claim. Is it restricted to living systems?"
"Unknown","01;04;41;08","01;05;15;00","This would be no but then let's just say it is restricted to living systems. Well, it could be like that. There's still living systems with no minds. Or could they be the same. So how would we know what would be the observation or the experiments, the measurement to make, especially keeping in mind or keeping in life? That mind is a little bit of a potentially unobservable phenomena."
"Unknown","01;05;15;00","01;05;47;01","So how do we integrate sort of meat and potatoes with minds in a way that's going to lead to testable predictions and ultimately informative experiments? Blue Well, and so that is the life of science continuity. This thesis is that there's 100% overlap. So the concept of a mind is grounded in the concept of life in terms of other polices and activity."
"Unknown","01;05;47;12","01;06;20;24","But the problem that I have with that, so the whole reason I brought this up is like back to certain questions what is life? Right? And so it's not binary necessary necessarily. Like there's some continuum between life and not life. There's a lot of gray area. There's, you know, I'll look at parasites there's viruses, there's a lot of things that fall into that like fuzzy area."
"Unknown","01;06;20;24","01;06;57;27","And then also like going into the origins of life theory, somehow some self-replication and other places happens in non-life that like drove the transition to life at some point in our evolutionary history. And so where is the mind there and that's one other reason that pants, I guess, implicitly or explicitly promote their viewpoints is it there's no need for like Abiogenesis for a mental genesis for the emergence of mind from non mind you just say, nope."
"Unknown","01;06;58;09","01;07;36;17","My belief is it's all continuums of mind so we're just like adding grains of sand to a pile. There's a debate about when it's a heap versus when it's not a heap, but there's no qualitative challenge with explaining the emergence of complex minds as described in third flashback. Whereas other people who are not pants, I guess implicitly it's like saying you do need to have an account for how minds, if you think they exist, arise from non minds or you can take the anti psychic position and just say there's never emergence of mind."
"Unknown","01;07;37;01","01;08;03;04","So not in the little, not in the big. And so there's a few ways to be consistent, you know, pants like ism and then elaboration of mind mental denialism, which is its own answer or some sort of qualified intermediate where you think that it emerges at a developmental stage or some evolutionary development or an ecological context or some informational requirement."
"Unknown","01;08;03;04","01;08;32;00","You have to be this many bits to have awareness so there's a lot of views in the space, but this is just total fundamentals. What systems are living, which ones have mind, which ones deserve to be treated using respect? Stephen This also brings back the multi scale question, maybe not necessarily, I don't know, physical scale, but temporal scale."
"Unknown","01;08;32;28","01;09;21;06","You know, if something is actively variation the enabling itself to maintain its steady state but is purely doing it only at the level of maintaining a chemical gradient. And that's, that's the whole game. I don't know. That's a bit it depends where it's not exactly clear where mere acts of influence active influence sits. Right. So there is the slight ontological question there, but if some things maintain itself, but it's just doing one thing and it can do that maybe through chemical gradients or whatever, but then you've got this temporal depth of doing that because it's inferring that by doing that it will allow it to do something else."
"Unknown","01;09;21;21","01;09;57;17","At what point do these kind of chain of events start to become more lifelike? And does that then need to be is that in itself life? And does then almost need to be a life like entity that is managing that and then that becomes mind and then this is this is that question. I suppose fungi raise a bit as well because they they media messaging message policy, then a lot of interesting stuff."
"Unknown","01;09;57;17","01;10;01;14","Now are they kind of a mind or not? I don't know."
"Unknown","01;10;03;22","01;10;37;28","So we could definitely go to talking a little more about mere an adaptive active inference, but it makes me think about you mentioned a chemical gradient. Well, what are neurons and glia doing if not shuttling around chemical gradients? And so it's like OK is mined in the sodium ion, yes or no garden of forking paths, is it in the system of the lipid membrane and the transport protein and the gradients?"
"Unknown","01;10;38;08","01;11;01;03","So I know that still seems like a fairly no mind needed physical system. OK, well now we're going to put some other bits of protein around it and now we're going to verge towards bio semiotic mass with signaling at the membrane. But it's still a purely physical system. And so it's like you start building up and is there anything left to explain?"
"Unknown","01;11;01;09","01;11;40;17","Is that reductionist hmm? To just sort of make everything literally reduced to the explanation of the chemicals and it reminds me of a, of a sapolsky article in 2004 where he says If free will is lurking in the, in the interstices of the brain, then the crawl spaces are getting smaller and smaller because as we get tools that help us look closer and closer, we're finding there's less and less wiggle room degrees of freedom Tilly loudly or whatever you called it, less and less of that, potentially with deeper and deeper investigation and dissection."
"Unknown","01;11;40;25","01;12;15;11","But are we just tearing something apart, not understanding how it's actually composed, live so that just reminds me of Beck going back to the livestream that we had with Mike Levin. It's like if we are just at any given point, our model essentially dictates our action, right? So underactive inference, we have the generative model recognition model and constantly these are updated based on what's happening in our world."
"Unknown","01;12;15;25","01;12;43;03","Can we in fact, or do we have a choice when presented with any given circumstances in life, in our environment? Do we have a choice whether or not to steal a candy bar from a store or like it like random things that you think about? And this also goes to change your life and change your mind. So it's only through like practicing piano do we learn to play piano."
"Unknown","01;12;43;13","01;13;13;24","But do I have any choice but to sit down and practice the piano, given my existing model? And so is there like at what point where does free will come in like a right? Like does it play in and Mike's answer was awesome. I think he said like, no, there's no free will. But then he said, OK, there's some minuscule amount of free will that's non-zero, but like the smallest possible nonzero number that you can have."
"Unknown","01;13;14;00","01;13;45;29","And so incrementally, then you're able to affect changes on your model, which then affect the decisions that you make given your model. So just two quick things then, Stephen. So with a chaotic system with a big lyapunov exponent, so small changes have nonlinear effects. All you need is a tiny, tiny bit. So let's not confuse the fact that we have small but large, potentially even infinitesimal or fractional freewill, whatever that means in the moment."
"Unknown","01;13;46;08","01;14;26;19","With our inability to have serious consequences through deep time because it is a chaotic, massively interacting system. And the second point is it's you mentioned like stealing something that 2004 paper with Zaki Goodnough and Sapolsky is about the frontal cortex in the criminal justice system. And this paper is really fascinating because it's like there's two modes to just, I believe, centering on the American legal system but replicated in many other cases, either somebody can be like a rational, sane actor or they plead a defense which basically amounts to being entirely incapacitated."
"Unknown","01;14;27;00","01;14;47;29","So like either you were fully you should have known that the bank robbery would have gone this way. You should have really waited it out all the ways, or it was a situation of which there are multiple where you cannot be held to be responsible for the action. But we still need to you know, it's not a get out of jail free card, but it's it is what it is."
"Unknown","01;14;48;12","01;15;22;16","And so they're arguing for a more nuanced perspective that respects all the different time scales of changes that influence our decision making. So it's a really and you know, this is 20, almost 20 years ago. So a lot has changed in neuroscience and in law and society, but this is a little bit of an older people. So Stephen then Dave now I think this is a quite an interesting point you're making here."
"Unknown","01;15;22;24","01;15;51;05","I on that slide, if you go back to that slide that has the mind on it, I'm just trying something here. If a little idea I've just got if OK, so so if I was to put life, you see this life there, put life over mind. OK, so, so I do actually I just do that so it's like this OK, so, so this is this is an idea."
"Unknown","01;15;51;26","01;16;56;10","So, so you've got life as in the organisms body and then you've got life in terms of the, the, the, the cognitive neuronal life and that they're differentiated into two types of organism in the organism and the two organisms talk to each other and the boundary between the two talking to each other is mind is an emergent process something that is coming up as an idea, very interaction est and relational and interface that maybe we shouldn't be looking for the reduced essence of atomic modular life, but we should relentlessly pursue it in the interfaces they've the if mind is entirely a matter of means and nemes need material processes to live in and material processes"
"Unknown","01;16;56;10","01;17;22;00","meet the beams to keep themselves from falling apart. Then things become a lot simpler that I actually want to make a comment on the insanity plea. I think it might have been Dershowitz who went back and looked at the statistics of successful and unsuccessful insanity pleas, and he found that when people when somebody is so completely berserk that you can't even begin to empathize with them."
"Unknown","01;17;22;09","01;17;45;07","Juries say he's just crazy killing. But the places, the people, the juries buy, the insanity plea is the jurors. Sandler himself although he never quite comes out and says this, you know, under the circumstances, I could see killing the guy. That's all right. Whatever it takes to get them off you call that in? Certainly. OK, we'll get them off of themselves."
"Unknown","01;17;46;21","01;18;17;05","So it's exactly the opposite of what you think. You know, the supposed Elizabethan argument did. Well, the guy didn't know the difference between right and wrong, so you can't hold them responsible. American juries don't think that one big questions about what the legal system is for and what it does flew. And then there's a question in the chat so just like the legal system and I wasn't meaning to start spun this entire conversation with the stealing candy bar."
"Unknown","01;18;17;18","01;18;45;18","But but you know, so much of our creation of the model of the world occurs when we're young and in early development. And and I think that, you know, at least in the states that the amount of an unacknowledged childhood trauma that happens for poverty and for drug abuse reason, I mean, there's an infinite number of reasons that people undergo some kind of abuse as a child."
"Unknown","01;18;46;03","01;19;16;28","All of that like really contributes to how well you're going to function in society in later in life. And I don't think like, well, there are people that plead insanity and there are some cases of of severe abuse and whatever where the people get off. But but so much so many of the people that are in our prison systems and go through juvenile systems have these horrible early experiences that really are happening when their model of the world is being solidified."
"Unknown","01;19;17;08","01;19;44;24","And so for me, it really it explains a lot of the choices that are made, but by people in those circumstances, and it's helpful to think about it in terms of a trajectory. We're not just maybe taking a snapshot moment and just doing a snap judgment, but we want a trajectory of healing and of health. Stephen And then Dave."
"Unknown","01;19;44;24","01;20;13;23","David then we'll ask the question. Yeah, this idea, because we talk about people being out of their mind, you know, and in some ways, like you say, these if someone has an experience or something or some biological condition, the idea is that it's like the I suppose the biological architecture means that the person is ability to mindfully choose isn't there."
"Unknown","01;20;13;28","01;20;33;03","In some ways it's almost like the either the, the somatic priors are so skewed or the, the mental architecture is so distorted that a coherent mind isn't available. Thanks, Steve."
"Unknown","01;20;35;05","01;21;02;14","I met a lawyer who worked with the criminal justice system in Chicago on child abuse cases, and she thought a huge number of these cases of serious abuse, like a three month old being put out on a fire escape in the middle of winter to toughen him up. And, you know, instead of just saying, oh, this is so horrible, you got to put the mother in prison."
"Unknown","01;21;03;00","01;21;28;29","The interviewer so what do you do with babies? And she had no idea. She had never seen even minimally competent child rearing from anybody. And they found you explain to these folks, you give them, you know, the supplemental education to understand why middle class people treat babies a certain way. They think that's great. Oh, that makes sense. I just didn't know you could do that."
"Unknown","01;21;29;05","01;21;47;15","I thought you had to beat them. They wouldn't stop crying if you don't beat them. OK, and say, you know, you put them on a long time probation. That is not punitive at all. It's just so you can keep track of them and keep the education going. And keep away from the crazies. And that was working extraordinarily well."
"Unknown","01;21;49;09","01;22;18;08","Thanks. So here's a question from the chat. I'll read the question and then I'll read one response in the chat already. And then anyone can jump in and we have some slides that speak to this. So Joseph wrote, Could the extent of how conscious something is be measured on the basis of how far ahead in time an organism, cell creature can plan or minimize expected free energy or then I know that some people will probably have things to say on that."
"Unknown","01;22;18;08","01;22;43;16","But Tucker in the chat wrote, Under this idea, then might the entropy chaotic ness of the environment influence the degree of consciousness of a system? A more dynamic system or environment would require a more adaptive agent in order to maintain that in tropic coherence through time, the more entropy, the need for a better model. Super interesting questions and responses."
"Unknown","01;22;44;04","01;23;25;21","So I guess just glancing off of that legal and choice discussion into more broader questions, it's so fascinating how especially if we're going to be locating function in the interface between the agent and the environment, maybe depending on whether you're in an unmarked room or a very interactive or space, consciousness is going to be different. Are you more or less aware and then the other piece that comes to mind and Stephen to that anyone else is from Livestream 25 Computational Boundary of self and there's the past and then there's the future below."
"Unknown","01;23;26;02","01;23;59;03","And so the past Cohn is kind of like the, the depth and the breadth of what has influenced the system and then the, the future. Cohn is about the scope of planning. So it's a really interesting question about temporal horizon but is it enough to just plan deeply? Like if you just plan sparsely but deeply over 100 years versus a very rich plan very thick plan for 10 minutes, which one of those is there going to be a single currency that describes or compares those two?"
"Unknown","01;23;59;23","01;24;14;12","How do we think about planning in heterogeneous systems that have different affordances or have different complexities of their internal generative model? So there's a lot of great questions in this area, Stephen, than anyone else."
"Unknown","01;24;16;15","01;24;45;13","Yeah, these are really good questions. I suppose if I was looking at measures, I mean, there's also this interesting question of not necessarily what you're able to do but how far you're able to get with what you're not able to do. Like the like when someone's really working hard cognitively, it's like like I mean, you know, if I want to predict what the inside of a job is going to be like, I can just boil the liquid and it becomes sterile."
"Unknown","01;24;45;13","01;25;23;12","And I know it will be like that for a long time. The question becomes, when you've got these intractable or kind of multifaceted things, a bit like what's going to happen to a collection of family members when they all meet together for Thanksgiving? Right. This that that that that temporal depth. This is definitely a good point. And I suppose there's there's that question of how to penetrate a time when it's hard to penetrate as much as how much are they able to plan."
"Unknown","01;25;23;13","01;25;58;28","I'm sure the two things are linked and you could do both loop. And then I've thought I'll give you thought first because I'm going to go on a tangent. OK, I wanted to connect it to the paper that we're allegedly discussing and this user resource and mirror an adaptive active inference model so on the uni directional, the left side, you have like a more adaptive agent, it's here a spider and then you have this less adaptive, but doing mirror active inference like a web."
"Unknown","01;25;59;10","01;26;34;10","OK, so it's like a person with a thermometer or a spider with their web versus this reciprocal case where on both sides of the table there's a user. And then we've heard before about how the time horizon of planning relates to the the depth or the quality of the conscious experience. For example, the 2018 alias interview with myself and Martin and Karl Feresten in the final question he even talks about the temporal scope and the existence of counterfactuals as being relevant for generating consciousness."
"Unknown","01;26;34;29","01;27;03;29","So then it made me wonder what if by going reciprocal multi integration you actually shorten the time scale of planning? Like if I'm going to set out a buffet for myself, it might take hours of planning. And so there's a lot of mere active inference happening on the stovetop, but it's a very complex process. One user and takes hours of planning, but then to cook with the friends might be just a minute planning."
"Unknown","01;27;04;05","01;27;36;28","We're going to agree to cook together and so actually the temporal explicit depth of planning in an improv and improvizational or interaction ist context the depth drops potentially because you might not need to explicitly prepare for so many counter factual. And it's not like you're just moving pieces on the chessboard. You just need to take that first step, listen to what they're going to say, then think about what your response is."
"Unknown","01;27;36;28","01;28;02;25","So then that almost challenges the simple time horizon or a counterfactual basis of cognition or phenomenology because and it's such a helpful distinction made by math that I know we're going to use in other papers and research, that these are really different kinds of systems. This left system is still magick and it's still a collective system with emergent properties."
"Unknown","01;28;03;04","01;28;31;22","But then this kind of double stick merging interaction ism brings us into a new territory that's very important to delineate. Stephen Yeah, this and this takes us into that realm of sense, making different types of sense making because it's action. Yeah. Being able to act and interact in appropriate ways and in many ways the more appropriate ways can be stimulated by things in the environment."
"Unknown","01;28;31;22","01;28;58;11","I mean, the fact that we have a very expressive face in a way puts our face out there is something we can inscribe and use in that process, right? We just look at each other's faces. Now, for all the psychology in the world, no one quite knows, you know, it's all, it's all, it's all interpretation, but the thing that I think this really highlights is the game in town is action policy."
"Unknown","01;28;58;24","01;29;34;12","It doesn't the game isn't for us to walk around as humans. With big cognitive capacities on the top of our skull or in our skull. The game is that we can interact and sense make the ability to, like you say, to plan on our own is is a nicety. But actually it's been a bit of a we could say a wrong turn for the last 200 years because it's all been about thinking has been the game and feeling."
"Unknown","01;29;34;12","01;29;53;24","There's been this kind of artifact that we've we try and minimize as some sort of sides product that somehow you know a weakness of the human mind or something and it's so far from the truth because it's pretty much what it was like before we took that wrong turn. It's actually about how to act and feel in the world."
"Unknown","01;29;53;24","01;30;31;12","So this is a good point. Thank Stephen Blue. So I'm going to go off on my tangent now, but I really just want to address the first question in the chat about how consciousness relates to our ability to plan and how far out that we plan and so I'm reminded of and maybe Daniel, you can help me remember if it was deeply felt affect or sophisticated active in France but in one of those papers we talked about actually anxiety as trying to plan too far out in the future."
"Unknown","01;30;31;18","01;30;57;29","Right? So if you're trying to plan too many time steps ahead, then that is like the cause of an early typical situation. So I'm not sure I will. And then I think that they said that maybe depression was staying too many steps behind or thinking about too many steps in the past. So so thinking about it. And it was so my takeaway from that was staying in the present moment."
"Unknown","01;30;58;14","01;31;28;21","And so I don't know that the that just briefly to respond to Stephen's comment, I don't know that having this big cognitive giant capacity, diet, cognitive capacity is for interacting as much as it is for adapting because humans like cockroaches adapt to infinite circumstances. Right. We live on or are present on all continents in the world and I mean even Antarctica."
"Unknown","01;31;28;27","01;31;45;27","There are some research scientists there right now, I'm sure, digging holes in the glaciers to find out how much our oceans are going to rise. I hope that some of these are doing that anyway. I'm not sure if he's funding that research, but but hopefully somebody is doing that. So I don't know. I think it's more adaptive. The cognitive capacity then than anything else."
"Unknown","01;31;47;16","01;32;28;10","And to so good good throw back there with the sophisticated and deep active inference and the anxiety, the parametric investigations of anxiety that we've been on before. And one day when we have better keyword indexing, if anyone is passionate about this, they should collaborate with us. Because how cool would it be to have deeply, richly indexed keywords for these papers and artifacts and discussions and have them translated into multiple human languages and computer languages, so and graphics so that we can be really clear so I mean, there's a lot to say here."
"Unknown","01;32;28;10","01;32;54;18","And the only other throwback that I was going to add in was to way long ago in number 29 active inference. We talked about the scaling relationship of the ants brains with a larger colony, having a proportionally smaller ants brain, whereas larger mammalian societies have larger mammalian brains because mammalian sociality has to do with like memory of repeated interactions and theory of mind and the facial recognition and all these things that we're talking about here."
"Unknown","01;32;55;01","01;33;23;14","Whereas potentially colony organism malady means that the increased scope or capacity of the colony can occur over evolutionary times through a diminution of the scope or of the cognitive processing on board each. And so Joseph's question, it's sort of it's just such a great question. So thanks again for asking it because we can sort of look at it at that."
"Unknown","01;33;24;12","01;33;48;06","It's even asked across scales, but what if like the cell plans less because it's it's part of a high trust system. So now the beta cell in the in the pancreas doesn't have to have a deep temporal model. Its temporal model just has to be like one step but it's playing a role in a system that now has a circadian regulation of sleep or a blood sugar."
"Unknown","01;33;48;23","01;34;22;14","And so where do we ascribe consciousness or awareness or cognitive possibility across different systems? Which again brings us back to from 25 these nested cones of cognition and their different shapes and their attributes. Blue. I just wanted to shout out to Tucker as I was like, I don't know drawing this big thing with the last question. So Tucker actually made the link between consciousness and activity and I kind of just stole it."
"Unknown","01;34;23;02","01;34;58;25","I stole all the thunder. But, but really? And are those two things linked? Right. So planning very far and in the future versus having the ability to respond to whatever comes your way in one time step, does it really different? Like one seems very rigid and the other seems very fluid and Tucker actually kind of use consciousness and activity interchangeably, which is an interesting connection and thought, I don't know, maybe resilience and that adaptive anti is kind of what I would use."
"Unknown","01;34;58;25","01;35;03;20","But, but it's interesting to think about Thanks, Stephen."
"Unknown","01;35;06;00","01;35;42;15","Yeah. And also I like that point you're making and suppose it ties with that add activity about the pancreas. You know, you've got the pancreas gives you the affordance of modulating stuff in the body, as do these other organs. But like you say, these cells and if I have a crude or multiple ways of mindfully or live in the idea, if that's a word, adapt in that you can do something but you got no pancreas, you got no cells, it gives you an affordances to actually change it."
"Unknown","01;35;42;22","01;36;19;12","You can have all the computational or cognitive modeling, whatever it is, you can't do anything. It's literally a conceptual framework without any way to do that sort of control. So, you know, the more important thing is to have something which can follow through at these across the scales and change how they maybe cybernetics be integrated than it is to have the like I say, it's not all about cognition, it's about action policies."
"Unknown","01;36;19;17","01;36;49;00","And I think that's really interesting so earlier we had just those three, right, just cognition agency and autonomy. And then that was being inspired by just some of the quotes from the paper where those terms were used. But we're thinking about that three. Then we've talked about like adapting and being flexible and learning over developmental as well as evolutionary time scales."
"Unknown","01;36;49;14","01;37;34;26","We can think about the past and the future, like the time cone illustration. To what extent does memory matter? I mean, can you have a memory loss awareness, or is awareness requiring memory or can you have awareness without planning? Some meditation practices might lead one to think so or is planning vital? What about the capacity for interaction? If we don't have interactions highlighted, you know, Paging Dean are we falling victim into a modular reductionist nightmare or how do we hold interaction ism at every step?"
"Unknown","01;37;35;10","01;38;08;27","What about kind of complex systems, properties like resilience or antifragility or hysteresis these transitions, those are descriptors of various systems. And are those just coming along for free with these? Do they grant the ability for these are they correlated dimensions? Are they uncorrelated? And then the million dollar question, maybe we need to scale that for inflation. You know, the ten Bitcoin question, where does consciousness come into play?"
"Unknown","01;38;09;11","01;38;36;24","And is that something we can ever get a handle on? Or is consciousness always going to be at the fringes of our explanations? And some of these more accessible or opaque features will be amenable to quantitative descriptions, whereas this might be always in a different category. So blue well, I think that they're quantifying consciousness already, but memory is really what I wanted to talk about here."
"Unknown","01;38;36;27","01;39;00;23","The key word that's on this list. And so I mean, I don't know. I think about memory, right? Like there's the ram and there's the RAM and it is memory or to what degree is memory required for a generative model? And so I just wonder, like, I mean, all of the experiences contribute to the formation of the model."
"Unknown","01;39;00;29","01;39;24;25","And what is contained in the model is effectively like our action course. I mean, what's in the generative model? Does anyone know of I think about it like like what is that? I think about it like an action course or like the response. I don't know. I'd love to hear what other people think, if it's been the generative model, what's inside of that, and also whether or not memory is required."
"Unknown","01;39;26;13","01;40;05;29","Stephen I think this also you can bring in would like affordances come in they say, you know, like I say, interaction capacity with affordance is I suppose you could say memory is as an interaction capacity with the affordances. The whole priors you know they so there's an interesting there's an interesting sort of dynamic here between these processes and the affordances."
"Unknown","01;40;06;19","01;40;37;05","And normally affordance says ah well for practical purposes and normally thought of or used in terms of something a bit more concrete in the human scale, but when it kind of is multi scale as well isn't it? You know, if we're going to talk about mental action and thought as mental planning, then absolutely there are mental affordances in the model as formalized by Sanford Smith and others."
"Unknown","01;40;37;26","01;41;08;22","And then to Blue's memory question about where it's related to the generative model. So I thought of a few different options, not exhaustive. So the generative model could have an implicit onboard memory like that D prior, that could just be a summary variable that summarizes memory. So you can just say the past moments temperature here's my prior on the past moments temperature or the past sequence of temperatures could be explicitly represented as like kind of like a list or a vector."
"Unknown","01;41;08;29","01;41;35;28","So there could be onboard memory like within the internal states, the internal generative model of the active inference agents could either have just sort of a snapshot summary implicit memory, which is good enough in many cases. So we might just model it as if anyway or there could be this explicit, just like a policy is a sequence of actions you could have a multi time step prior over previous dates arc memory."
"Unknown","01;41;36;12","01;42;08;16","But then the other option is like this extended or stick magick memory with a recognition model like do I remember what I looked like at that one family dinner when I was three? No. Would I recognize the picture? Yes. Would I know where to look for the picture? Yes. Physically. What about asking somebody? So we're thinking, OK, affordances, social affordances, spatial temporal location of extended cognitive process recognition model but do I remember that?"
"Unknown","01;42;09;15","01;42;40;15","Or am I merely remembering or preferring certain affordances that bring me to the edge of that abyss? And then the recognition model takes over once the picture has been physically presented. That's the stigma. And then just using mass distinction that there's you in the photo library, that's the uni directional multi scale inference integration and then there's the conversation where we actually spur each other's memory."
"Unknown","01;42;41;15","01;43;05;23","And that's where we get that sort of next level of reciprocal integration to kind of bring it back to that idea. Flip really nice with the extended stigma recognition model. And I think that like there's some like RAM, some kind of RAM is required for any generative model. Like, like I think about the generative model a lot like the software that we're running."
"Unknown","01;43;05;23","01;43;35;00","And in order to have software you have to have some RAM but but is the long term memory required also like so or is the long term memory just what goes into creating the generative model? And then all of that can be forgotten. And when I'm thinking about that, I'm thinking about people that have lost their memory for whatever reason, like so so cases of amnesia, like the person can't remember anything."
"Unknown","01;43;35;00","01;43;51;08","Like, I think about Memento and like, you know, every day I can't remember anything, I can't remember anything. But like I still know how to brush my teeth or I still know like when I wake up in the morning, I need to brush my teeth or I need to shower or I remember what food is like. So I don't need to like try this or that seems ethical again."
"Unknown","01;43;51;08","01;44;31;08","So there's some things that are maybe stored in the generative model and maybe some things are irrelevant thanks to Steven Yeah. This, this is ties into the action policies of remembering it like if all memories is an active imagination is an act of recapitulation, then what needs to be present, as you're saying, is, is a way to evoke affordances."
"Unknown","01;44;31;18","01;45;19;07","You could say that the affordances of remapping sensory states, you know, maybe where you look with your eyes and maybe when someone's amnesic, it's not that they haven't got the priors or the knowledge, they haven't got the action capacity to recapitulate from whatever priors were there. I mean, this is a bit speculative, but anyway, it reminds me of the neuroscience on taxi drivers and spatial reasoning and general relationships between spatial memory and practice there and cognitive capacity and preventing cognitive decline and memory palaces like memory palace is kind of this weird quirk."
"Unknown","01;45;19;17","01;45;51;23","I mean, how weird you can imagine a place with file cabinets and walk around it and have stories about that place. And remember, you know, pi to 5000 digits or remember the Iliad. How weird. Eight Mental action, spatial cognition, narratives of action. It's like you can build that physical palace and have the photos there. Or you can update your generative model to include a spatial context where those cues exist."
"Unknown","01;45;52;17","01;46;13;19","And so it's just a very interaction ist way of thinking about architecture, including mental architectures like you just need to have the exit sign. And then when somebody wants to leave, they're going to recognize it and walk towards it and then the next step will be there. And so the architect puts the next step there safely and accordingly to function."
"Unknown","01;46;13;28","01;47;10;00","But when we're the interior mental designer or architect, we can make spaces that also prompt us. And so it's not like we're storing the memory itself in that location. We're remembering a very compressed version of the cues that interact with us to then generate upon demand. Stephen Yeah, that's a good example for the memory palace because it is the question that when something's laid down in such a palace, if you go to visit the palace and you get this whatever sensory cues that come up, it's it's solid enough that you will come up with a particular answer, you know, I mean, you remember X, Y and Z from that so it appears like you've remembered"
"Unknown","01;47;10;09","01;47;51;09","the thing, so to speak. But actually it's just that that combination of Bayesian inference is will lead you to act, to recapitulate it in the way. Now, obviously, the average person can't do it as well as these trained experts, but they can actually do it in a very sophisticated way. But because the in terms of pure floating ideas, it's that whole they say six plus or -1 is all you can keep in your brain at any one time in terms of a just a concept that's floating and that's but then obviously that that isn't what's the case when you can start to use memory palaces."
"Unknown","01;47;51;09","01;48;19;03","So it's a very different thing going on. It reminds me of one class as we go to our closing notes, a class where just each week the homework and class was to memorize a poem and then recite it that's kind of how education has often proceeded. And it's something that is just fundamental for oral cultures and has been a skill that is less emphasized in literate cultures."
"Unknown","01;48;19;17","01;48;48;05","And there's that dense cross-linking of like rhyme and narrative and tonality and rhythm so that you really don't need to keep 50 things or 80 lines in your working memory in your RAM with a computation list metaphor, what is being remembered or recalled or prompted and that investigation, well, if it's not being just stored as a text file, what is it?"
"Unknown","01;48;48;27","01;49;15;12","And then it's just so cool how it dovetails very nicely with Deonte cues and authentic cues in active inference and conversational theory and a lot of other areas. Blue. And then we'll have last comments here. So just what you guys were both talking about reminded me of Kyle Newport's book, Deep Work. If you haven't read it, I highly recommend it."
"Unknown","01;49;15;12","01;49;35;10","It's awesome. But in that book, he talks about creating a memory palace and learning how to memorize the deck of cards. As an old skill that people just don't have anymore. So you construct the memory palace, you learn to have a set of cards memorized, sort of like you, so you can literally memorize 52 things in your memory palace any time."
"Unknown","01;49;35;10","01;49;56;04","So you can memorize the order of a deck of cards, just like he says, to build this as a skill because it's enhancing of memory and I wonder if this isn't going to be something, you know, as we're becoming more and more illiterate, which is it's an interesting I think we've reached like the crescendo of literacy, at least in the in the US."
"Unknown","01;49;57;02","01;50;19;29","And have we reached this crescendo because of technologies like this? Like I don't need to read that paper I'm just going to listen to this group of people talk about it. Right, and get the key points out of the paper and their summary and their discussion. And then I'll have some interesting things to say about that paper. And so is it isn't it our kind of technology that's paving the way for illiteracy again?"
"Unknown","01;50;19;29","01;50;43;14","And will memory become increasingly important? It's great to think about, and I'll just give my final thought here. Thanks for the interesting discussion today. And to Matt also for the for the provocative paper. And I'm looking forward to reading and discussing more of his work. Thanks, Blue Stephen or Dave, any last comments? Yeah, I do. Quickly, thank you."
"Unknown","01;50;43;14","01;51;08;14","Again, a really good conversation. And yeah, I think there's definitely something here around maybe the idea of adjacent possible as well. So is there something about the memory palace that one thing is then an adjacency to the next thing when you have to hold something on its own it's going to have to be supported by its own infrastructure, I suppose, and that's quite an overhead."
"Unknown","01;51;09;26","01;51;28;21","So yeah, because there's also this thing of how long you can hold something in your memory without having a way to ground it just sort of fizzles maybe for some people quicker than others. But so yeah. Oh, very good. I'd have to go back and think I was a number of points came up here that we could expand on in the future."
"Unknown","01;51;29;16","01;52;19;09","Thank you, Stephen. Dave, any last comments nope. Just got a follow up on these references. Thanks all. Thank you. Well, to Matt Sims for writing this great paper and joining our dot one and watching the dot zero for David Blue and Stephen for joining and for for helping in different ways on the dot zero that brings us to the end of 30.2 and next week's at this same time we're going to be in 31 non equilibrium thermodynamics and the Free Energy Principle in Biology by Patricia Palacios and Mateo Colombo so at least one author will join at least one week stay in touch."
"Unknown","01;52;19;24","01;52;25;02","Let us know if you want to join 431 or beyond and see you all later."
