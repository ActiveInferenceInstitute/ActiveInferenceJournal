"Unknown","00;00;08;01","00;00;36;11","Hello and welcome, everybody. Welcome to the Active Inference Lab today. It's October 1st. Fifth. Sorry. Greetings, Shannon. And 20, 21. We're going to be discussing this awesome paper, How to Count Biological Minds, Symbiosis, The Free Energy Principle and reciprocal multi skill integration. Welcome to the Active Inference Lab, everyone. We're a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference."
"Unknown","00;00;36;16","00;00;57;03","You can find us at the links on this slide. This is recorded in an archived livestream, so please provide feedback so that we can improve on our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and will be following good video etiquette for live streams like muting. If there's noise in the background and raising our hand so we can all speak."
"Unknown","00;00;58;19","00;01;23;16","At this short link, you'll find the calendar of past and future live streams. The first tab is the regular Tuesday live stream with two weeks per paper with the dot one and the dot two. But then we have a few other series of streams related to different topics. So go to that link to check out what's upcoming and see if you want to participate in one of these streams today."
"Unknown","00;01;23;16","00;01;52;00","And number 30.1. The goal is to learn and discuss this awesome paper on counting biological minds. And we're really honored and appreciative that Matt Sims is here to discuss it with us. So we're just going to introduce ourselves and walk through any of the figures, any of the Formalisms We also have a few other ideas and questions that the participants have raised, so this should be a great discussion."
"Unknown","00;01;52;00","00;02;27;26","Thanks everyone for joining. We'll just go around and say hi and introduce ourself. Either just an introduction or feel free to say something that you were excited about with reading the paper and then we'll all non authors will go and then we'll let Matt just provide a little context here. So I'm Daniel, I'm a postdoc researcher in California, and I think I'm looking forward to drawing out some of these threads about collective behavior and the timeless questions about collective behavior with some of the new approaches that are discussed in this paper."
"Unknown","00;02;28;12","00;03;13;23","So I'll pass it to Shannon Hello. Nice to see everyone again. I'm Shannon. I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California and said, I played my background, but there is a dog growing around, so hopefully it's not too distracting I will pass it to Steven Hello. I'm Steven Sinnett. I'm based in Toronto. I'm doing a practice based through the UK and around Psychologic perspectives on practices, particularly around social topographies and spatial meaning making in participatory theater in the arts and I'm really interested in this paper."
"Unknown","00;03;13;23","00;03;38;08","I like the folk psychology questions that it brings up, and I like this idea of folk biology, which I found really interested in the way that we have assumptions around that. So it ties in maybe some of the folk quantum that came up in some of our previous sessions about what people think that is. So I am really excited to see this folk idea being extended because I think that could be really useful."
"Unknown","00;03;38;14","00;04;16;20","So thanks, Stephen. And to Dave. Yeah, yeah. Dave Douglas. I'm retired from programing the machine translation software. Now I get to get really busy working on a history of Cybernetic Learning Theory Project for professor at Carnegie Mellon and all this good stuff here thanks Dave. So Matt, thanks again for joining. We'd be really happy to hear some context and we'll just take it from there and anyone can raise their hand or type in the live chat if they have a question."
"Unknown","00;04;17;27","00;05;07;23","Fantastic. Thanks so much for having me. So the context in this paper, I suppose it's like I wrote this paper and during my PhD over at the University of Edinburgh, I was supervised by Dave Ward, who's an Arab-American activist. Andy Clark who I'm sure you know, and Julian Covington, who's up over at the University of Amsterdam. And the focus of this paper was pretty much my obsession on the notion of collective intelligence and what collective intelligence might be and how cognition has has developed, say, the evolution of cognition with, with a background of taking into it, taking into account the fact that cognition is in its most basic form, something that's going to be collective"
"Unknown","00;05;07;23","00;05;55;29","in the first place. So it does pull out. There is this kind of immediate tension with how we look at cognizance and how we look at cognition and the kind of folk field with typical typical cognitive scientific kind of research. I suppose a traditional, should I say. And the point of this paper was to OK, well look at the kind of evolution of cognition, if you, if you will, through a particular lens using some of the kind of the tools, conceptual tools that were provided by our system, they and, and Johnson and Smith and see exactly how this can be formalized and looked at through the perspectives of the fringe of principle with the process"
"Unknown","00;05;55;29","00;06;29;06","theory act of inference so that that's that's pretty much it very concise summary major transitions which is the soft memory and Maynard Smith line big qualitative changes over evolutionary history. And then just like you kind of brought to at the end, how do we land that plane with maybe quantitative differences or structural differences in a micro process theory, maybe active inference under the free energy principle."
"Unknown","00;06;30;23","00;06;57;08","So Shannon or Dave or Stephen, feel free to raise your hand. Otherwise maybe the first question that came to mind for me was like, how do we research or understand these folk beliefs? Scientists are folk too. And is this like sort of the mythical average citizen? What are these beliefs and how do they come to be that way?"
"Unknown","00;06;57;23","00;07;22;01","Why are they the way they are these folk beliefs about biology? Because that sets up a lot of the discussion and what's relevant of the contributions of the paper absolutely. It's a very good question. Very good question. And the folk beliefs we have obviously kind of folk psychological beliefs that take the form of actual folk psychological notions that take the form of, say, beliefs and desire."
"Unknown","00;07;22;08","00;07;45;06","And these things I think are and give us a good, a good, very good manager in which to actually approach the notion of folks, I think biology also, but beliefs and desires being particular type of constructs which play a and explanatory role, a psychological explanatory role, and these are successful. And then, for example, explaining or predicting behavior to us on a certain level."
"Unknown","00;07;46;01","00;08;25;09","And I think on a kind of first blush level, so to speak. And I think folk psychology and folk biology are kind of bad folk in the sense that folk biology is going to be based upon what we initially see are the like. And in our everyday experience of the world, for example, is what we initially see. So we're going to base the notion of an individual, for example, on that on on the ideas of things that are going to be easily individuated and like biological systems that are going to be specifically reproduces."
"Unknown","00;08;25;13","00;08;56;02","And this is where you come into the notion of kind of the kind of Darwinian individual, as it was called by Peter Godfrey-smith, where individuals are going to be demarcated by their ability to be categorized under under three different types of wood that combined are joint three different, three different kind of categories which are going to be they have to involve variation, heritability and some type of differential fitness, which is just natural selection right?"
"Unknown","00;08;56;13","00;09;24;12","And and this type of individual has been kind of say we've invested into this notion of individual and what the biological sciences are. I've been to a certain point, I've been to a certain point because it helps us answer, helps us approach certain questions and make certain I suppose make certain inferences about systems over the long run. But it falls short and I think this is again one of the grounding points of the paper."
"Unknown","00;09;24;12","00;10;03;08","It falls short in explaining certain types of associations. And these associations, namely are going to be symbiotic associations. And this is a quite important, I say, transition as, as, as we spoke about before for the simple fact that without symbiotic associations we don't really have a manner, I think, of explaining multicellularity, right? The transition from single cellular sheets to multicellularity now that is we've had various theories and I think one of the theories that kind of one of the theories that started this was Lynn Margolis over at the University in Madison, Wisconsin."
"Unknown","00;10;03;24","00;10;52;02","And her research was fundamental. And when she suggested that, for example, you have two are two prokaryotes, one enveloped the other through some type of isotopes and they create some type of relationship. But over time, this is thought as ludicrous. And it did really push against this notion of Darwin and Darwin in individual. However, over time we've come to accept something like this, and I think this is like the idea that you have some type of bacteria that was enveloped by an archaea and in order to explain, in order to actually think about what we have in terms of this particular type of unit, we really do need the notion of moving beyond moving past"
"Unknown","00;10;52;02","00;11;27;26","our winning individuals and two ways of doing that. Obviously, I think that the paper tries to point out this and these are not the only two ways, but one way is one way of doing that is through kind of the metabolic individual, which is something that Peter Garvey Smith himself kind of tips his hat off to, which is just to say that metabolic individuals are individuals which are they can be delineated by their metabolic machinery and having kind of autonomous metabolic machinery and others, other individuals can play a part of that machinery."
"Unknown","00;11;28;25","00;11;59;15","And thus you have two systems that may kind of be metabolically coupled to one another making one system. And that's one way to go about it. The other way to go about it, as was introduced by Thomas Pardue and this is kind of the immunological version of an individual or a physiological individual. And again, these are the only two types of individuals or two ways to delineate individuals outside of the kind of more traditional sort of biological notion of individual."
"Unknown","00;11;59;15","00;12;24;13","But maybe that's something that we can talk about. Perhaps there are other ways that it might be interesting great points. And so interesting how the map replaced the territory, the map of the sort of Darwinian triad defining an individual in the Darwinian sense. And then people project that back out and say reality is explained by this partitioning scheme."
"Unknown","00;12;24;13","00;12;49;16","Yes. So very cool, Steven, with Raise Your Hand and anyone else in here or in live chat. Go for it, Steve. Thank you. You'll be interested. I think this is really good points about these different ways once you start to have these interactions and these rhetorics and reciprocity, reciprocity across, you know, then pluralism starts to come into the picture."
"Unknown","00;12;49;27","00;13;28;17","Yes. And I'm wondering how you see this moving between fields of practice because I wonder if like people in the biological sciences and maybe those who work with agents would really be getting this right and then people who have a theory about thinking they know what biology is, maybe physicists who maybe think they know everything is then have you know, they have a they have a biology understanding of biology, just like maybe other people have a folk physics understanding of quantum physics."
"Unknown","00;13;28;29","00;13;56;13","So I'll be interested in that. And this might even bring up some work of Chris Fields that we had on here as well. In terms of other ways of approaching this multicellularity. But I was interested in your thoughts first about, you know, that tension even within the sciences that's a really very good, very good point. I do think this is that before I hit that point directly, I do think this is a call for an interdisciplinary work."
"Unknown","00;13;57;02","00;14;35;06","It's an absolute call for interdisciplinary work. This is something that's I think trying to actually do useful psychological notions of both biological notions of physical physics notions we will tell we will have some success doing these things. However, once we run up and there are going to be certain constraints with doing that and we'll run into problems, run into problems that these problems, I think, can only be not only be avoided or actually addressed when using various disciplines together."
"Unknown","00;14;35;06","00;15;02;04","And I think this is one of the things that kind of the free energy principle actually offer us as a as a kind of it's an opportunity to work interdisciplinary on on various various phenomena, various processes, and you're absolutely right in saying that like, OK, well how how can for example, in biology you might have a typical assumption about what cognition is."
"Unknown","00;15;03;00","00;15;43;28","So we'll have a lot of biologists, for example, there's a there's there's a type of I was speaking about before that before this, there was a notion of basil cognition that has been kind of pushed within the last 15 years and a lot of various kind of research programs, scientific research programs, whether it's going to be plant biology or microbiology has has kind of fed into this, which is it's a lovely program in the sense that it's questioning how we actually look at cognition and these biologists that are kind of taking these cognitive terms and using these cognitive terms."
"Unknown","00;15;43;28","00;16;13;03","One of the things that, you know, I think that pushes against this as going to be kind of a traditional psychology that kind of refuses to with lots of luck, better words, I suppose was uses to actually engage in some type of interdisciplinary discussion. So it's a happier psychology that's happy using, for example, more folk, folk, folk, traditional folk, psychological notions."
"Unknown","00;16;13;21","00;16;54;06","And with these kind of limitations, I think we're going to actually be stuck. We're really going to be stuck so I guess that to summarize the point is, is that it is a call for a discipline charity. It is a call for kind of questioning or putting aside the fact that we can give satisfactory explanations. But whether or not our satisfactory explanations are are actually the explanations or if there is just one explanation that's that's the question."
"Unknown","00;16;54;13","00;17;21;09","That's the question. And I think that the whole notion of the whole the whole idea about biological individuality is that you can be an icon once you take into account various various angles from various disciplines it's fine to be a pluralist it's fine to be a pluralist. Thanks. I was thinking of just a pluralism of what the word folk even means."
"Unknown","00;17;21;19","00;17;46;15","Some people might think, oh, folk chemistry, that's being wrong. That's the middle school level of understanding chemistry. And then the experts, they know about chemistry. That's folk versus expert, but also it seems like folk is being used in a way appeal to first principles like appealing to directly intuitive, observable processes. And what is active inference, if not a first principles approach."
"Unknown","00;17;47;02","00;18;36;04","So there's a way to bring in some of the technical expertize, the computational backbone, but also fully retain the conversational and the casual approaches that appeal and spread to people in their understandings of different sciences. Yes. So Dave, with a raised hand and then anyone else with a then yes, go for it, Dave. Yeah. There has been so much good work done by people outside their specialties, I guess Erwin Schrodinger, maybe the most well known of Emap, but Bjorn Malka, the Swedish neurophysiology ologist, wrote a lovely little paper from about 1999."
"Unknown","00;18;36;04","00;19;13;27","I don't think it was ever published about how the development of the mobile eyes in one extremity of the early vertebrates has forced neurological developments that have resulted in consciousness simply because having mobile AIS creates such an enormous burden on sensation that you can't just use a simple nervous system, otherwise it's just overwhelming. Have you looked at any of marker markers work?"
"Unknown","00;19;14;16","00;20;14;29","No. OK, I'm going to have to send you that jammed up, huh? Please do. Yeah, yeah. And also Mark Solms, who's a direct collaborator with Professor Frist and just wrote a popular account of active inference from the viewpoint of his own work with MEChA and Yuk Punx up and on Tonio Damasio on the affective foundations of consciousness, and especially his own thesis that in Freudian terms, it is the ID that's conscious and the ego, the cortical, the neocortical processes, only days to become conscious when it really has to because it's so expensive metabolically and in terms of distraction and he's one of the few people who's actually aggressive enough in trying to go out and"
"Unknown","00;20;14;29","00;20;53;14","market his decision from the received wisdom. And he's also he's also did a an amazing update of the original project for a scientific psychology in terms of Estonian active inference. So first word to last word of that 1895 Freud say is in 2017 terminology, but still in exactly Freud's order of presentation. Wow. Yes, please do send me that paper."
"Unknown","00;20;53;14","00;21;28;02","I would love to read it. Awesome. So Steven with a raised hand and Shannon or Blue welcome and anyone else in life of course yeah. Just also this this idea of the folk psychology and I agree with that. Your point about interdisciplinarity and I think is really interesting is how the experts perceptions of the world then gets translated into a folk publication which then becomes the kind of landscape which pretty much everyone then starts to incorporate."
"Unknown","00;21;28;02","00;21;54;07","And 11 that I found very interesting with Active is I was looking back at pre older ideas of vision before they discovered the retina and the image on the retina, and they actually thought of the eye as projecting out and sort of feeling the world if you go back like five years. And then we were told by the experts how it is with the retina and that image projected like a camera."
"Unknown","00;21;54;07","00;22;16;14","So then folk psychology moved to that. I think perceptions moved to that because the expert said that. But actually it turns out that the original folks psychology or the original perceptions is actually more accurate now that we're looking at the kids and all of that. So this is an interesting what is folk and what's expert and where does it come from?"
"Unknown","00;22;18;14","00;22;43;10","Absolutely. It's a it's a both. And because it's not like the retina emits the photons that it then senses back. It's not doing echolocation. But there is a tale of two densities. There's a generative model and a recognition model, and there's a process that's a conversation which we're going to get to with users and resources distinction. So it's like there is that bi directional conversation."
"Unknown","00;22;43;10","00;23;07;27","And then if this direction is folk and then that direction is expert in certain social contexts, which direction is going to be prioritized as an explanation? And the other direction is going to be seen as a counter occurrence, literally going against the stream mainstream. So just pluralism allow us to recognize both directions in that case. Yes. Stephen Yeah, and that's a good point."
"Unknown","00;23;07;27","00;23;40;24","Daniel. Now I do it by directional and one question I wonder sometimes I often work. I'm just I'm so connected to people who I'm seeing in the world of coaching and psychology as well in a ways and the arts where these things like Bayesian brains sort of did come through there about ten years ago in a very but it's, it's normally come from research which has been interpreted into a book by someone from that field which then gets picked, which is still quite technical, gets interpreted by someone into something else."
"Unknown","00;23;40;24","00;24;10;13","And by the time it's rolled down into some other areas, these notions can be quite, quite watered down, you know. So yeah, this, this question about how to you know, have that conversation when some of the stuff is quite cutting edge from even people in the fields themselves. And how to get it used in the real world is a big one."
"Unknown","00;24;11;28","00;24;38;09","Absolutely. Very true. So Dave, with the raised hand and then anyone else I think it's in the pandas form where there's a rather exasperated essay about how you'll have an innovator. And if he's really lucky, he'll have a few people that work with him that fill in the gaps. But typically, typically they don't he doesn't even have one level of competence."
"Unknown","00;24;38;09","00;25;11;12","It just immediately goes into full press and becomes just a complete mush with all the almost all the original valid insights just buried under folk for goodness possible. So I guess just we pass on this slide because this concept of individuality is a central one here. And we mentioned a few of these different ways of looking at individuality and kind of contrasted pluralism."
"Unknown","00;25;11;21","00;25;46;07","The idea that multiple perspectives can coexist and that that's OK versus I guess absolutism or monism that one of these or some other unlisted criterion of individuality is like the the broader category or the right one. What is on the table with definitions of individuality? Like why would it matter in a technical capacity or for just all people, what what is being discussed or what matters depending on how we approach this question of individuality to Matt first and then to split."
"Unknown","00;25;47;10","00;26;16;14","Right. I think there are a few things that we can say why it matters. One thing is that we are before we engage in some type of investigation about a particular type of phenomena process it's quite good to know how to integrate what those process what's what are involved in those processes or what that process belongs to the relations between the elements and a network pretty much."
"Unknown","00;26;17;13","00;26;43;00","Right. And in order to understand those elements or to locate those elements, we have to have some type of criterion in order to in order to actually even think about that kind of larger structure of a network and the relationships between them. And I think this is biological individuals. Are they they actually play as role. And I'm reminded by something that Gregor Robertson said."
"Unknown","00;26;43;23","00;27;11;22","Right, that in order to actually understand what the mind is, we have to actually understand and delineate things with minds. But those delineations are going to be completely dependent upon the processes that we're studying, right? Those delineations are going to actually involve the processes that we're like. So it's going to be a process dependent or phenomena dependent individuation."
"Unknown","00;27;12;19","00;27;50;07","And that doesn't say that doesn't mean that these kind of individuals are going to actually are they might contrast a conflict with one another in any type of logical or not, but it's just putting in place a type of pragmatism in terms of where we delineate things. And I think biologically, individuals provide us with a manner of talking about, for example, specific phenomena now if we're talking about replication or we're talking about, for example, competition with respect to something like replication, then we might want to actually focus on Darwinian individuals."
"Unknown","00;27;50;12","00;28;14;22","However, if we're talking about the evolution of cognition or we're talking about the evolution of multicellularity or these major transitions in evolution, we might want to think about individuals in a different way. So that's, that's, that's what I think. Thank you, Matt Lou. And then Shannon so hi, Matt. It's nice to meet you. I love this paper and found it super inspiring."
"Unknown","00;28;14;22","00;29;00;07","And, you know, I think that the concept of an individual is closely related to maybe the concept of autonomy and also the concept of emergence and so as an especially, I mean it's also of course related to the concept of a cognizance, but, but the colonizer side the so I've heard a lot of definitions thrown around and an individual I liked in the paper how you described emergence with the circular causation because it echoes a lot of I mean, it's the information theory of and that's individuality paper by Krakauer and that group, and it just echoes a lot of I mean, what's required for an individual."
"Unknown","00;29;00;14","00;29;24;22","So I just am thinking about autonomy and, and it's one of the things that I mean, it depends how you define it. And in the artificial intelligence world, there's no such thing as an autonomous system. I mean, really, we program in whether we want it to learn whatever it wants to do. But I mean, they just don't little baby robots."
"Unknown","00;29;24;22","00;29;47;15","I'm just set free with no goal there's always a self directed or a human directed goal kind of programed into this system. Or maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there's examples where it's we just create robots for for fun or artificial intelligence just to create it. But is it like an artificial intelligence system doesn't really have that same autonomy? Or at least I don't think about it."
"Unknown","00;29;47;15","00;30;09;04","And so I just am kind of curious as to how, you know, in the paper you kind of hinted out or I don't know if you said explicitly I was kind of flipping through looking for a quote, but, you know, you hinted at like maybe a cell does and also doesn't have that same kind of autonomy and like so I, I want to challenge that."
"Unknown","00;30;10;13","00;30;34;00","So in terms of active inference and the SNP, like I think about it always as a skill for architecture and a continuum. And so why is a cell not autonomous but an organism is or maybe an organ is, is an organ autonomous or where do you draw the line and why are you making a line in the sand around a system like that?"
"Unknown","00;30;35;09","00;30;55;24","Fantastic question. And I agree with you. I agree with you. That's one of the things in the paper that I think that I pushed. I did draw a line. I didn't try to draw a line that was too deep in the sand. And I think in one of the footnotes, I do say something like, OK, I'm not suggesting that a mitochondria is going to be something that's not autonomous."
"Unknown","00;30;56;24","00;31;42;00","Ah. However, autonomy is something that also varies in degree that I think a certain level there's a certain level of autonomy that it's going to be provide us, provide a different degree of, of, I say degrees of freedom with which and some system can interact with its environment in ways and that in that environment provides perturbations enough perturbations enough kind of us and enough surprise such that that that whatever that system is has various strategies."
"Unknown","00;31;43;10","00;32;13;03","It has to have various strategies behavioral strategies or we can talk about this in terms of of entrance and in order to actually adapt to that particular environment. And I'm not in this in this us into this notion of adaptive active inference versus are kind of like the non adaptive active benefits. And I think the way that Michael and Julian have thought about if I'm not mistaken that I have thought about adaptive backburn is that it is based on a certain level, a certain degree of autonomy."
"Unknown","00;32;13;28","00;32;46;14","And with respect to cells, you know, I agree. I do agree with you. Cells do have a certain level of autonomy. However, cells are again dependent upon other cells in a way that other systems are. The more autonomous systems aren't dependent. Now you'll say, of course we're dependent upon our environments. We have to have oxygen. There's certain constraints in our environments that we have to we really have to kind of our requirements have to be a certain way."
"Unknown","00;32;46;14","00;33;19;19","So we are dependent upon our environment. What is the distinction, I think, between being dependent upon other systems and cells for example, bodily cells are dependent upon other cells and not only say that plasma, but other cells in order to actually maintain themselves well, I think there's a difference in degree and that's, that's, that's I and I shouldn't again, I should impress upon that this idea that I'm not saying that cells are not autonomous but most certainly I think there's a there's a difference in degree."
"Unknown","00;33;19;25","00;33;50;14","And that difference in degree does does matter. Our cells, my cells might even be cognitive to a certain degree. And this is something that some some of them like Mike Levin, Michael Levin suggests and I and I agree with them are. But I suppose the notion about ad activity are there's a there's a degree of activity that comes along with the emergence of a certain kind of degree amount in degrees of freedom so cells dependent on other cells."
"Unknown","00;33;50;14","00;34;11;25","But aren't humans dependent on other humans. I mean, we're born as an infant and completely reliant upon our parents to provide everything for us for many, many, many years. And, and even as adults, I mean, still we don't exist in a bubble. I mean, perhaps we can go off to a cave and exist in isolation but but I think humans are dependent on other humans as well."
"Unknown","00;34;12;04","00;34;31;24","So maybe it's a degree of dependance or not or I mean, I really feel like there's a continuum here, even in terms of adaptive active inference and active inference. I mean, and I fall in with Mike Levin in in a lot of the ways that I think so. Yeah. Yeah, I, I think, I think that's right. I do think that's right."
"Unknown","00;34;31;24","00;35;07;27","I think there's a distinction to be made also, though, between kind of the development of dependance and homeostatic dependance. Right. And, and I think homeostatic developmental dependance can have an effect on homeostatic homeostasis, most certainly. But those are two things that might not actually always, always overlap and for example, sure, we as humans, absolutely, we have a long developmental period in which we're absolutely dependent upon our parents or being reared by some other human or some other animal."
"Unknown","00;35;08;12","00;35;37;05","Absolutely. And the happens that when we actually when we when we get older, we probably are dependent also I absolutely agree with that. But it's there isn't any kind of development with a cell that can be mapped on to dependance or not dependance. It's always dependent Thanks, Matt. Shannon, it actually flows really well. And my question blew with that."
"Unknown","00;35;38;00","00;36;13;06","I know your paper, you specifically said we might want to talk about humans or groups of humans, but we're not going to in this paper, but I'm going to ask about humans. And so when you're talking about this this squid and its bioluminescence and then they form a temporary unit in which they are together an individual, and then it sheds the the bioluminescent cells during the daytime and then they breed again afterwards."
"Unknown","00;36;13;16","00;37;02;14","I'm wondering if there is a time like a critical time period at which units would have to be have this symbiotic relationship with each other or if there's a necessary strength of the coupling or a repetition of how many times the organisms need to meet up. And if that would change for for this this animal compared to systems of humans, because there's a certain way in which the humans that you interact with in everyday life or if you're co living with someone, even your metabolic states become co regulated by your snipping patterns with each other or stress and hormones between different humans are affecting each other when you're together at a fairly regular rate."
"Unknown","00;37;02;14","00;37;26;08","And so I wonder if we might define individuality or collective slightly differently depending on the system we're looking at and the type of coupling that's occurring. I think it's a great question, Chad. It's absolutely I would I would say, yes, I think there's has to be some obviously that you know, about the kind of empirical literature in terms of kind of entrainment."
"Unknown","00;37;28;02","00;37;53;01","And I think this is a that's a really good point to make in terms of having those types of interactions with humans, whether or not for the for the bobtail and video there's a chance that I, after the video, actually colonize the light organ. They're typically not taken in again. They're once they're expelled, they're out. They might be taken in by another squid, a juvenile squid."
"Unknown","00;37;53;01","00;38;19;11","But but the vibrio that continue to colonize are the ones that are left over and it might be the case that the ones that are continued to colonize for that shorter period of time are might become the relationship with the squid might change to a certain degree. But I don't know any any empirical evidence I ignorant about this point that suggests that's the case."
"Unknown","00;38;19;11","00;39;16;01","But I think that's a really good, really good question to ask. A very good question to ask so blue. And then I'll make it a question. I think Dave was first. Oh yeah, go for it, Dave. And then but yeah, there Dr Alan Shore has done some I think controversial but really evocative work on the formation of the not just the personality but actually the neural functioning of the newborn in the dyadic relation, the intimate dialog with the mother bass play and the rhythm of moving in and moving back and regulating each of them, regulating each other's expression of interest and each other's degree of involvement and at a really different scale."
"Unknown","00;39;17;28","00;40;06;12","Gerald Edelman's Hopeful Biology talks about the cell and the tissue as being just so dependent. He points out, Look, we have almost no chromosomes, we have almost no genes compared to how complex we are. Where does the regulation come from? It comes from adjacent cells, adjacent tissues, right thanks, Steve. Lou. So, Shannon, kind of what she was saying about becoming co regulated and say if you live in an environment with someone like is a super nice transition to something that I have really been wanting to discuss in the context of this paper, which is like, OK, you become co regulated with someone that you're roommates with and co regulated perhaps by the environment, but also"
"Unknown","00;40;06;12","00;40;33;23","perhaps by the microbes that live in our environment. Yeah. So there's like the entire microbe microbiome concept that is is fundamental and key to humans. And I don't know, I mean, I'm not like a huge studier of symbiosis, but I'm not sure if the microbiome like I know we depend on a healthy microbiome, I mean for healthy like brain function and, you know, just regulation of our own internal metabolism and so forth."
"Unknown","00;40;34;03","00;41;01;08","And so is that a symbiosis or not? Also like the concept of the whole of science, which is like introduced by Fields and Levon, if you read that paper, this free biology paper, I mean, it is like to what and that they talk about physiological individuality there as well. So is it symbiosis, is it not? Is symbiosis also a spectrum or is it like a, you know, as a discrete category of things?"
"Unknown","00;41;01;08","00;41;25;14","And I also think about like severe genic viruses, which like, you know, the very early viruses, it's like, you know, effectively like instantiating speciation, right? Like the viruses insert into the genome and, you know, developing species and so forth. And it's beneficial to the virus and the host right. So so anyway, I just wonder, like what are your thoughts on that or if you have any insight there?"
"Unknown","00;41;25;28","00;41;53;19","Actually, that's again, a wonderful question both with respect to kind of symbiosis. I think there's some there's been some work on that and some very I think convincing work done by Queller and Strassmann are who suggest a particular type of X-Y locating symbiosis on a kind of an axis. Pretty much. So you have a cooperative and I believe on one part of that is I have to I have to look it up again."
"Unknown","00;41;53;19","00;42;26;15","Actually, I should look that up. But it's you have varying degrees of symbiosis and again, symbiosis in the in the particular paper that we're discussing now, I've concentrated on systems, but you have various forms of symbiosis that I think you've actually pointed out previously that can be kind of modeled quite well with kind of game theoretic. And this is going to be is going to range from parasitism to communalism to kind of kind of neutral isms."
"Unknown","00;42;27;08","00;42;53;04","And I think like these are all again degrees and these degrees can change. There have been quite a many theories, I suppose, and I think scholars draw some have also suggested this, that depending upon the condition of a system with respect to another system. So there's some bits of parasite can turn into a mutual parasitic, parasitic relationship can turn into initialism and vice versa."
"Unknown","00;42;54;06","00;43;21;09","So these things move, these types of things move. And if you think about this is an automatic thing that we can even apply to this kind of cellular biology. When you think about something like the origin of cancer, right? When you have cancerous cells, are they actually grown within a host? Right. They're part of the body. But end up being some type of competitor."
"Unknown","00;43;22;17","00;43;57;26","And I think this is it's quite interesting to think about this like through the lens of symbiosis. Obviously, it's not that's that's not a symbiosis, but we can use symbiosis to kind of think about that. But with respect to that kind of thinking about host cells and parasites or host cells and mutualism are there's like there's there's many, many different way areas of the spectrum that one can actually analyze our relationship with our own cells and our relationships with with micro mike about our microbiota."
"Unknown","00;43;58;05","00;44;36;19","And Scott Gilbert, obviously, you know, and Scott's work is quite incredible. He's the one, I believe, who introduced the notion of the how the biome how genome excuse me and how wired. And I think this notion of a Halabi it is specifically a and it includes symbiosis, but it includes actually a kind of community, a particular kind of community of various systems that themselves qualify as one system can qualify as one system or having, you know, if you will put it a different way, they they create a stable state right?"
"Unknown","00;44;36;27","00;45;04;08","The steady state themselves and one that's kind of resistant to perturbation. And that's that's the manner in which I think it's like it's it's a very easy manner in which I can think of how to buy it as an individual, whether or not one wants to call two to the symbiotic, symbiotic systems that are mutualist of relationship. Halabi That's a that's another question."
"Unknown","00;45;04;08","00;45;35;27","But I think typically it's been applied to more than two systems. Thank you, Matt. So for Shannon's questions about, you know, the co-regulation and humans and trust, it made me think about how one off games lead to kind of community or population like game theory, whereas repeated games over evolutionary time, like in the case of the squid and the Vibrio or in the case of the US social insects, that leads to organismal like dynamics."
"Unknown","00;45;35;27","00;46;17;13","And then what you just described and what Levin also got out in the paper is the breakdown of, for example, organisms, polity into population of cell versus population of cell dynamics. So it's absolutely a cool framework. And then also a really important part on figure four is you have the peak of integration and then greeting survival, the peak of integration, and then that's the y axis so it's like instead of saying we're going to say which organisms are tall or short out there in the world, it's like you do the population level survey and they range from, you know, two to four feet and you say, OK, it's in the upper 50th percentile, it's tall."
"Unknown","00;46;17;13","00;46;45;07","Like we're re normalizing our comparison. Stick to the maximum integration of the squared bacteria. So we're not comparing it to some other system. We're re normalizing and we're able to have a system specific understanding here. It's relatively more integrated here. It's relatively less. It's a second question whether the peak of integration of the squid and the Vibrio is like the integration of some computer program with another computer program."
"Unknown","00;46;45;16","00;47;16;19","Maybe it's apples and oranges. Maybe we'll have the right framework that allows us to transmute apples and oranges. But here you can just relative size to the system itself, and that's like very specific and powerful. So Stephen, with a raised hand and then anyone else yeah, I'll give you a chance to get a breath because they're throwing a lot at you, but the you mentioned allostatic and homeostatic forces."
"Unknown","00;47;16;23","00;48;03;18","If I'm making this a the so the so you've got that difference there between saying trying to maintain know training, trying to move forward and change. And I'm interested in how that reflects so for instance, I suppose you could have within a set of cells, you could have some cells or some organs, you know, trying to maintain homeostasis and others say even maybe a parasite is trying to add a statically into that world and in these for itself and I think that that that question about, you know, that that balance between the two is a useful device or a useful way to think about the same cell."
"Unknown","00;48;03;18","00;48;27;28","And of course, in cells they change to become different types of cells. So that's something that whole organisms have less ability to be completely, completely different types of organisms. You know, they can't you are what you are. I suppose that's one defining thing about. But you can still change your focus from homeostasis to other status. I think that is quite common."
"Unknown","00;48;28;08","00;49;00;27","And I wonder what your thoughts are around that and how that that itself could be a useful way to frame things. That's a really interesting the manner in which I'm looking at kind of a homeostasis and kind of covering the homeostatic regulatory systems to our set up regulatory systems is based upon kind of a more traditional idea that homeostasis might be considered more reaction or reactive, where almost diseases anticipatory."
"Unknown","00;49;01;18","00;49;36;18","Right? And that allows disease takes a particular form. It's quite interesting with respect to in the context of lack of interest because we talk about extractive free energy minimization and this is something that one can tie together with the notion of spaces where and when you start to think about kind of homeostatic and coupled systems, one system with respect to kind of symbiotic systems might be playing kind of a larger role and being able to make further and further being able to make inferences further and further into the future."
"Unknown","00;49;36;18","00;50;02;05","And I think this is something that you've you've you've looked at previously actually on on a slide Mike Levin's slide that you and Daniel actually had up previously. And I think this is a quite interesting manner of thinking about kind of a transition. And perhaps we've always been allostatic systems, living systems have always had sort of certain capacity to anticipate."
"Unknown","00;50;03;00","00;50;41;00","However, when we start putting systems together, we have a larger capacity or more capacity to anticipate further and further in the future. I think one of the dimensions of this particular cone is this dimension of the kind of allostatic control this is this is my interpretations of Michael's work. And I think this is that's very important. And again, you'll see that there's a kind of a balancing that as one as I give it, a type of approximate Bayesian inference, it's going to be, you know, what we suggest is going on, you have to actually balance this with priors, which are going to be respective to the past."
"Unknown","00;50;41;00","00;51;11;00","So you have another type, another axis on the cone. And as these things expand, sometimes the past is going to be a bit deeper on the cone than than than the future. But our states, this is on the top there. And I think that like with with multicellularity, with with kind of the interactions, more interactions, perhaps we'll see a capacity, a larger capacity to go upwards and the kind of future oriented direction."
"Unknown","00;51;12;14","00;51;37;04","And this is this is something again, and I appreciate Blue's bringing this out. This is this is something that's again, a matter of degree. It's not it's not a it's not a line that's cut. It's a matter of degree. Right. And so just simply, we know that there are certain types of microorganisms that that do anticipate that do."
"Unknown","00;51;38;00","00;52;20;09","Right. And this is kind of an outward anticipatory behavior, whether I think it's going to be fusarium pan itself, which is kind of a Plasmodium slime mold are various experiments in 2011 have suggested that, you know, fusarium can actually anticipate various periodic bouts of dryness of this this type of thing. This is an outward periodic behavior and our anticipatory behavior that's not to say that anticipation is not happening or occurring prior to that and the internal dynamics of systems that just are kind of an outward manner of kind of measuring it."
"Unknown","00;52;21;26","00;52;56;27","Again, I do think that this like it's it's it's a quite important notion out of status and it's perhaps all systems. Again, I, I would be safe at least my position now is that all systems are pretty much allostatic systems that kind of enslave homeostatic regulatory systems to maneuver and invest their metabolic machinery and metabolic capacities to a particular type of state that perhaps they haven't reached yet."
"Unknown","00;52;56;27","00;53;22;08","Considering, you know, a manner of of trying to avoid perturbation thank you, Matt. Very similar to mere adaptive inference being more homeostatic, more like the ball just in the bottom of a bowl and then increasing tingly anticipatory Rosen's ecology adopts active inference. Stephen, go for it."
"Unknown","00;53;24;09","00;54;17;17","Yeah, this this ties in actually a lot of work around coaching. Funnily enough, the world of coaching and team coaching is like and team coaching. So and I think this also brings in, you know, these other types of clusters groups symbiotic relationships beyond maybe what we might just think of as a system, you know, and so the idea of a team in a as a system in a systemic context is really interesting because they and this might be how out of status in a social context starts to enable that larger horizons so each even Anastasia's is sort of status and then working together you may start to break your own need for status you know"
"Unknown","00;54;17;17","00;54;53;22","and it just becomes some other organization and I think it be really interesting and looking at how the way that team coaching either for performance because it's performance orientated team coaching or this developmental orientated team coaching but that idea of and then the enabling context becomes what we would call the ecological niche I suppose becomes as much the focus of attention as the system in that makes if that makes sense and I think this, this might tie into what you're saying."
"Unknown","00;54;54;26","00;55;18;18","Thanks, Stephen. So Dave, I know that you are a little bit to share, but I'll just bring up one point related to this definitions of individuality. And then anything you want to ask, feel free to raise your hand. We hear a lot of terms like autonomous and self-organizing which sort of highlight the ability to cleanly partition a system like people will say the embryo."
"Unknown","00;55;18;18","00;55;45;25","It's a classic self-organizing system, right? Except for the context of the womb. And so they're sort of on one hand the desire to individually in partition and look at a genetic system agent based modeling, autonomous and self-organizing and then that is critiqued by the ecological perspective or the relational perspective. So there's sort of a dialectic between like it's all individuals all the way down and it's all relationships all the way down."
"Unknown","00;55;46;04","00;56;09;11","We see that debate in particle physics. We understand it less than we might some of the biological systems or in a different way. But it's like two pillars that we're navigating between, and it is a continuum in between. So that's why it's such a nice discussion. So, Dave, if you're around, feel free to any time you're ready, you can go for the conversation theory, otherwise blue go for it."
"Unknown","00;56;11;13","00;56;42;05","OK, sure. Now slide. Yeah, slides 18 or 19. We inserted that into the slide show that we prepared for Dr Susan's presentation and these slides bring in some matters that he doesn't address in his paper. So to justify that, but not to paraphrase the insertions the free energy principle and active inference jointly constitute a relatively mature macro level framework for describing living, psychological and other complex self stabilizing systems."
"Unknown","00;56;43;04","00;57;25;15","As of the moment, no comparably mature micro level framework has been both proposed for and coordinated with this macro level of analysis. I suggest that the basis for such a needed micro level framework was proposed by my teacher, the late cybernetics Professor Gordon Pasch of Brunel University. In the form of conversation theory maps essay How to Count Biological Minds considers the puzzle of whether an individual can come into existence and pass out of an existence repeatedly Matts account of this puzzle and please excuse me if I stray from oversimplification into parody."
"Unknown","00;57;26;07","00;58;01;02","Yes, solution in terms of degrees of integration is a perfectly acceptable insightful account at a macro or more level, the metaphor is a quantity and elsewhere probability nicely expressed falsifiable common sense attributes of real world processes. But if one states this paradox the paradox of emergent the transient individuals in terms of conversation theory, then one speaks of a conversation recurring over time between the same converse."
"Unknown","00;58;02;06","00;58;30;14","This terminology makes the proposal more intuitive, less shocking, and more readily a similar both for readers better yet familiar ideas, attention, rhythm of discourse, punctuation of a conversation through understandings or through agreements to disagree. They all play their roles now. What place would be occupied by the special disciplines that have enjoyed detailed treatment by conversation? Theory as a micro theory?"
"Unknown","00;58;31;08","00;59;15;03","During his career, Professor Pasch carried out an array of experiments studying human learning of complex subject matters, configuration and using configurations of software and hardware to administer and collect data from those experiments, developed a vocabulary, allow an elegant description and restatement of the results of those experiments. Moreover, he developed a theory of micro level learning teaching as a single literally irreducible complex of activities, regardless of whether they were realized by living organisms, by machinery, or by complexes of those two fabrics I see many deep and broad analogies between conversation, theory and act of inference."
"Unknown","00;59;15;17","00;59;37;01","Each addresses important aspects of real world phenomena in a systematic way, such that each treats of matters that are not so well handled by the other. I believe that act of inference in conversation theory can enrich and streamline each other by carving natural science scholarship closer to its joints."
"Unknown","00;59;39;14","01;00;09;19","Very nice. Thank you, Dave. So maybe, Matt, any thoughts on that? Then we'll go to blue. I have to say. I have to say that I'm absolutely that the cybernetic theory that I've concentrated upon and most influenced by, it's very limited and conversation theory. It's absolutely interested in seeing more of this, more of this, I suppose analysis and understanding more of this analysis."
"Unknown","01;00;09;19","01;00;35;29","So I'm quite ignorant about conversation theory. And second, most certainly piqued my interest yeah. Let me let me think about this for a few minutes. I'm still kind of internalizing what you just said. Yep. And one note on the conversation, a lot of times cybernetics falls into that individualism mode like it's the one self-guided missile. It's not the conversation between the flock of birds."
"Unknown","01;00;35;29","01;01;05;28","So cybernetics isn't just about individuals, it can be about collectives. And it was our colleague Alex who told us via one of his teachers, Levin Chuck, just yesterday that cybernetics died when it could explain homeostasis, but it couldn't go beyond. So we're talking about the transition from individuals to collectives and from mere homeostasis to adaptive alone, stasis over developmental and evolutionary timescales."
"Unknown","01;01;06;08","01;01;43;15","And so it's sort of like you can have homeostatic individuals and then they can have emergence towards allostatic collectives. And then what is that process of emergence? It's a conversation or potentially something like that using our folk understanding of interacting pieces, which are us blue so my question is maybe technical, but also maybe civil has some insight to provide as well."
"Unknown","01;01;44;15","01;02;11;06","So I wanted to ask here, in the beginning of your paper, you talk about free energy being an additive quantity. So the free energy that arises at the macro scale is only the free energy that there is for the ensemble and maybe quantified by summing the free energy associated with each constituent micro-scale Markov blanketed system. So is that true and does that account for emergence?"
"Unknown","01;02;12;06","01;02;40;25","Because I feel like there has to be some like greater free energy minimization. And so like I'm not I'm not well-versed in the technical mathematics of the FPP because I think about, you know, like just in terms of the bioluminescence of the big fish. Right, right, right. There's like a criticality that happens like almost like a phase transition that the system undergoes to become bioluminescent, like after there's a certain concentration of bacteria in the light organ."
"Unknown","01;02;41;02","01;03;10;17","And so like does this criticality, this phase transition, does this not like to minimize free energy to a greater degree like or is it really just the sum of its parts Wonderful question. Really wonderful question. I do think that, OK, there's might be a distinction in terms here and a distinction in terms of like what are the free energy of the actual constituents as a group?"
"Unknown","01;03;10;20","01;03;48;28","Have as an as an ensemble have are and a distinction between that, for example, and bioluminescence as a particular type of free energy, minimizing strategy are the it's a I think it's a fantastic question. I'm getting the notion of kind of you know, the summation of free energy from Palacios and Randstad. And this I think that the pretty much the idea is that I'm not sure if there's going to be any."
"Unknown","01;03;49;03","01;04;18;02","I'd like that. Maybe I can ask you, Blue, do you do you see that there is some type of inconsistency between saying that, for example, free energy is going to be an additive quantity? And and the fact that there can be some type of immersion property that is not going to be reducible to, say, the constituent relations and the elements do you think that there's some type of inconsistency there?"
"Unknown","01;04;18;21","01;04;45;07","Well, so I definitely do think that free energy across skills is additive like I agree with that wholeheartedly. Right. But I don't think that it reduces to the mere sum of the parts. And I mean, this also it's the work, the recent work of Rosa's and also Eric for looking at the partial information, decomposition over the biometric that's used in integrated information theory of consciousness."
"Unknown","01;04;45;13","01;05;07;10","And so this kind of speaks to that. There's has to be some mathematical I mean, I just feel like I don't know that there has to be, but I feel like there should be some mathematical quantification of more so to be a greater degree of free energy reduction when the system is more than a sum of its parts."
"Unknown","01;05;07;10","01;05;28;09","And so that I think that that's an argument that you make in the paper as well, that it can't be it's not reducible to just the component parts. So is the free energy then just reducible to the component parts there? Because that to me seems inconsistent. OK, OK, the manner what I think I see I absolutely see your point."
"Unknown","01;05;28;09","01;06;05;18","The manner in which I'm thinking about this though. Is that OK? Well, I think there's a very informative paper by Santos. He's a philosopher. He actually deals with emergence. And I and it's a really nice way, I suppose. I really like this, the paper that you suggested about kind of using the fine metrics and various manners in which to do information decomposition are over various time steps in order to think about some way to some metric for emergence."
"Unknown","01;06;06;03","01;06;27;20","I think there's been various metrics for emergence. I haven't picked my favorite metric. That's something that I'm still getting into. But I think this is it's quite interesting to think about, OK, well, what makes an emergent system is an emergent system going to be more than it's at the kind of relationships and elements of a network. And what makes it so, what makes it so?"
"Unknown","01;06;27;20","01;06;52;27","It's going to be the relationships themselves or or is it going to be something the combination of the relationships or is it going to be the interaction between the system, the emergent system and the environment? And I think when you start thinking about the interactions between the emergence system and the environment, are there's a there's a distinction between what free energy is going to be minimized or and the free energy of the system itself."
"Unknown","01;06;54;10","01;07;20;26","Does that make sense is it there's a distinction being made, and perhaps I'm wrong about this, but emergence is not something. And one of the reasons why you have an emergent system it's going to be for the simple fact, OK, well, you have it's it's not only the interactions of the parts and the parts or the elements. It's going to be the it's going to be the interaction of a particular type of persistence."
"Unknown","01;07;21;22","01;08;02;28","And I think this is the this is the idea. You have a persistence with a particular environment or with an environment. And it's the perturbations within that environment that occur along with that system in which kind of free energy is going to be a free energy that has to be minimized. It's going to arise and I think it's like so you might say, of course, that the the system itself, when it has component parts and relationships between those component parts, is going to be that system can be thought about in terms of an additive or a summation of the free energy of the various parts and relations in that system."
"Unknown","01;08;03;05","01;08;26;12","But that's distinct from that systems engagement or interactions with this environment. Then you'll have extra free energy you have an additional amount of free energy. And maybe that's what that's, that's, that's another way a matter of thinking about, OK, well, and an emergence as measured. I don't know if you can measure emergence in terms of free energy, of course are going to be able to measure it in terms of some type of neutral information."
"Unknown","01;08;27;16","01;08;47;18","Very nice. Thank you. That's what was a question there. I don't know if you can measure emergence in terms of free energy, like you said, and you might have to look at something like visual information. And I was thinking that perhaps the free energy that's minimized by each individual system, then when they become a symbiotic unit or something, might end up being identical."
"Unknown","01;08;48;00","01;09;11;03","And again, I'm thinking of humans again, but if humans are walking and they happen to start walking and step, that's going to look like an identical isolation as as they're coupling with each other so there's might not be more free energy that's minimized by this coupled system walking and step together. But it might look like this the same free energy once they're a coupled system."
"Unknown","01;09;11;28","01;09;37;26","And one thing that we talked about, I think in the zero or around there is there are situations where the cooperation, the coordination increases synchrony. So just increases the mutual information of the humans walking in step. But also you can imagine antifreeze relationships, which is kind of like division of labor or task allocation where the emergence is not due to copy and conform, but the emergence is actually, you know, you go left, I go right."
"Unknown","01;09;38;12","01;10;01;15","And so in both of those cases, there would be a change in the non equilibrium steady state, which is what is introduced throughout the paper. And so that starts to build the road towards quantitative discussions. And you can take a system that you suspect already has emergence in nature and remove a part that's kind of like the gene knock out approach."
"Unknown","01;10;01;21","01;10;36;26","So gains of functions and loss of functions and all the other ways that we study function can now have something like a common grounding potentially using these metrics here. So Dave and then maybe Matt if there's response otherwise Steve thank you. In Blue asks Is free energy additive? Does an exercise that I suggest it should bring that question to a more down to earth and more poignant focus."
"Unknown","01;10;37;16","01;11;05;04","Take all the discussions you've heard of free energy and substitute for the phrase free energy, the word anxiety it already is that way. Dave. What you want me to do what would that show though? Or do you think it's a natural fit or could it could we could we put any word there? What do you think it means?"
"Unknown","01;11;05;24","01;11;48;06","Well, so just using anxiety like it totally leads to the movement mentality and like ultra paranoia and conspiracy theory so like, definitely additive yeah. Possibly multiplicative, though, like could be exponential yes. If yeah, there actually have been clinicians that have really used free energy, although they didn't use the term as probably before the usage was coined it was William Glasser in control theory."
"Unknown","01;11;48;06","01;12;32;20","And his earlier work really has this quantum of anxiety that his patients had to manage. These tended to be out of control criminal adolescents, so they were pretty screwed up. And he found ways to get them to rein themselves in and control themselves. But think about the blitz effect London blitz. You had objectively tremendous stress on everyone all the time, but there was almost no hospitalization or shellshock among civilians, including air raid wardens that were digging a building suddenly get bombed and they'd rush in and try to find people and drag them out."
"Unknown","01;12;32;27","01;12;59;17","Extraordinary really low rates of psychosomatic disorder. There's a certain there's multiple parts in people. People's brains are really complex. There are certain ways that people actually do get shocked into rationality. I've been in situations where the right thing had to be done right now with no hesitation no anxiety, no blame, just do the right thing and do the right thing."
"Unknown","01;13;00;12","01;13;29;24","Whether it's alive, whether it's puts me in danger or not. You know, a child's in danger. You do the right thing. So it's not predetermined. But typically, yes, what does happen is a thing called reorganization. It's a technical term Glasser uses. It essentially means going crazy. And in the really worst case, the reorganizations get faster and faster and faster and more and more drastic as the personality becomes more and more simplified."
"Unknown","01;13;30;03","01;13;52;23","And that's something that Kurt Levin or one worked through in his work on driving children crazy by giving them more and more complicated tasks and under more and more anxiety. And he was able to make the kids personalities and thinking degenerates and simplify more and more, become more and more infantile. And you're right, that is one of the things that happens in a mob."
"Unknown","01;13;52;23","01;14;26;11","The it's terrifying to be an evil unified, angry mob where everybody's mad at the same thing and they're probably not going to attack each other. It's terrifying. And people keep going into that situation things happen. Remember, the presentation two weeks ago on the mutual suppression of the limbic system, the reticular actuating system on the one hand and the prefrontal cortex on the other."
"Unknown","01;14;27;19","01;15;04;03","You get these things that look like beliefs. They sound like beliefs, they act like beliefs, but they're not beliefs because reason has never been invoked in the biological decision. Whether you incorporate this magician's spell into my feeling and my actions, do you have to have reason to have a belief? Dave Oh yeah. In the sense that Philip Jones uses it."
"Unknown","01;15;04;21","01;15;35;21","Yeah, yeah. You have I mean, that's that's kind of the way he defines that. A belief is something where the prefrontal cortex has been involved. It's been in the loop, and there's a way to bypass that I asked him whether he's worked on the social psychology of this or that. The ego psychologist says, No, no, no, I, I have enough trouble worrying about people with damaged brains and how that shows the bypassing of rationality in the formation of delusions."
"Unknown","01;15;36;05","01;16;07;24","But I think it works the other way. You may have seen my my shotgunning of the apathetic apathy roll oh by Dr. Nathan Rosenberg, or rather Gabriel. Nathan Rosenberg is an academic in, I think, Kentucky. He says, look, is what's happening? You've got this person with a a nonexistent personality who's doing what the mob tells him to do through the mobs megaphone called FoxNews."
"Unknown","01;16;09;13","01;16;42;22","Why do we like him so much? Because he's less than any of us. He will always obey us. So we'll give him power and then he'll give us what we feel like are. Yeah, and there's no reasonable ultimate. It's very much a bypass. Yeah. Read a lot, Bones. Study and Mackey's study on the madness of mobs and the mass production of delusions and crazies and McCarthyism and all this unhealthy stuff."
"Unknown","01;16;43;06","01;17;08;02","Thanks, Dave. And that was the guest stream, 10.1 with Philip Gardens. And so just to highlight one point and then Stephen, it's we're really talking about control theory. Maybe the first pass, the first term in the Taylor series is about control. I mean, come on, narrow the error. And that's kind of definition one control as homeostasis, even if there's a shifting set point."
"Unknown","01;17;08;17","01;17;35;22","But then again, it's the ecological and the relational insight and just the emergence of interactions that control takes on this broader anticipatory usage to control your body temperature is to sometimes do a lot of movements that from that first pass look like a non-sequitur, like sprints so that you can get into the air conditioned room. That's the expected free energy through time."
"Unknown","01;17;36;09","01;18;13;19","So now we have a common grounding for talking about control when it looks homeostatic as well as control when it looks allostatic or even innovative. So it's very important to pull out some of these threads and also recognize their cybernetic origins and other areas too. So Stephen and then anyone else yeah, these are all really good points. I'm curious when we talk about free energy minimizing ation, I think it's, it's interesting to talk about that from assistance perspective."
"Unknown","01;18;14;15","01;18;45;02","However, if we want to get back to the kind of organism. So the key thing with free energy minimization that occurs at different scales, you know, physical scales, number of units, scale, time, scale, you know, very logical scales. We think about these different scales, but that reduction there has to be a way for that reduction to be meaningfully engaged through actions or interactions like the metric."
"Unknown","01;18;45;03","01;19;22;16","Ultimately what's going to be filtering through probably in some noisy, maybe backdoor way is that if it's going to be sustained over time, there needs to be some meaningful engagement over time. So, for instance, you know, the idea of the path that we walk starting to wear away the grass in our niche you know, it's because we walk on the path more than once that we have an ability to observe that, you know, if we only ever walked that path once, it wouldn't have a way for any variations we notice, but we notice the path being worn by agents over time."
"Unknown","01;19;22;16","01;19;46;20","So when we're talking about these different scales, these variational dynamics in free energy, it's not just the reduction because we don't get a number each time saying this was lower than last. We just get some new state in the world and we have to infer if it's changed from some other state in the world and we it may go up."
"Unknown","01;19;46;20","01;20;17;08","It may go down. So we may infer at times that the three energies has not been minimized and we might taper over allostatic processes. For instance, if we have a big room that's not tidy and we have a group of people and they want to organize into a studio space you know, they may work together initially putting in a lot of extra free energy time and and then eventually they know that they will be able to minimize their sort of systemic engagement as a group."
"Unknown","01;20;17;21","01;21;04;15","While it's not necessarily that they're each minimizing free energy as a system. And so this is almost where maybe challenging to get out of the biological sense and maybe come into some other disciplines where it's not all a system it might be more of a systemic context, which is then more logical. So I'd be interested that that question like where does this crop through this idea of being able to to have a pragmatic metric that links the non equilibrium steady state of the organisms phenotype or individual so they're actually able to then infer something from whatever is happening, the free energy out there or in, in there or around them and how that changes things."
"Unknown","01;21;04;15","01;21;37;12","If we, if we frame it away from systems per say to something more systemic hmm. Different uses of the highly poly same as word systems, systems of systems for some people are systems. So that's why we increasingly will try to be exploring the active inference ontology so that we know which pieces of the puzzle we're talking about and that will unpack so interestingly into different disciplinary contexts."
"Unknown","01;21;37;12","01;22;03;26","Stephen, so nice points. So in the last half hour, I think there's a few different things. Let's maybe get to one of the key pieces and specific contributions of the paper, which I would love to hear your thoughts on, which is just first, what's going on with users and resources. And second, what is the difference between uni directional multi scale integration and reciprocal multi scale integration?"
"Unknown","01;22;05;13","01;22;05;24","Right."
"Unknown","01;22;07;28","01;22;40;26","Those two, those two notions I suppose of uni directional and multidirectional or reciprocal and users and resources, they're very much so connected. The idea of a user, we can think about this and I think the Stephen's are, to use Stephen's example, of an Amazon path, I believe that's what these things are called sometimes. So you see these paths that are traded and are typically, you know, used to refer to when we're thinking about kind of nice construction, like paths finished construction."
"Unknown","01;22;42;24","01;23;17;15","This is something that is in the environment that is being used say is a resource that's being used and it's the effect of previous action on the environment returning to the notion so that that that would be a resource used by a particular cognitive agent or an agent that's engaging in adaptive that benefits. So number one, it has to be recognizable and it has to actually in order for the system actually to engage with that particular resource, it has to be recognizable as such."
"Unknown","01;23;19;06","01;23;53;17","And that recognition can come through, for example, epistemic foraging or actually just applying particular kind of apply the model to a particular type of resource that has been applied previously. And this is also the case with something like statutory, right, where you have something that's quite lovely what you have, for example, ants leaving pheromones within their environment and that pheromones acts as a particular type of mediator, directing further behavior by agents of a similar type."
"Unknown","01;23;54;07","01;24;26;24","Right. And that's again environmentally mediated communication or what they might call an environment environmentally mediated, you know, a conversation between between various elements of a system. And the pheromones themselves, of course, are resources in the environment that's going to be perhaps contrast with the idea that not all resources need themselves are themselves. They have to be limited to being resources."
"Unknown","01;24;26;24","01;24;54;02","They can also be users also. So to to make a strange case, you can think about stigma. Gee, actually, what if it wasn't actually the ceremony that was being used? But the other aspect, the presence of the other act that was being used, the interaction with the act itself. So here the two are using, using, using, perhaps and perhaps you have to tell me if I'm using this wrong, that's terminology, but you have to discussants, right?"
"Unknown","01;24;54;15","01;25;18;02","Ascender or T both are but both actors and there's an receivers and actually they're communicating something. They're having a conversation, but there isn't any mediation in between. The two are that can be offloaded onto in this particular situation, offloaded on into the environment. So the signal itself is going to be the direct kind of interaction between the two rather than affair mode."
"Unknown","01;25;18;14","01;25;45;22","Now that in that case we can map that on to that would be a kind of hypothetical case of reciprocal military integration right. And again, security just happens to be are typically and in each cases in the way that people on the grass are suggested it when he was saying termites, this is something that's actually involving a particular type of signal in the environment that's also added to the environment."
"Unknown","01;25;45;22","01;26;11;12","So it's going to be naturally something that's going to be unit directional not at scale integration between a system or between various systems are whereas for example, when you have direct interaction between two cognizance or two systems, two adaptive systems they can also, of course, use some type of resource that can be signaling. And this is something that of course happens with artificial fish."
"Unknown","01;26;11;12","01;26;43;10","Right? Ah, and about tail squared. But there are also going to be some kind of other direct interaction between two systems. And that's, that's kind of the reciprocal multi-step integration awesome summary. I believe the technical term would be Converse Ants for that kind of a conversation, but it's a great point. How when you have an adaptive active inference agent and then a niche that's being modified stick surgically, that does mirror active inference like the spider's web that's right."
"Unknown","01;26;43;12","01;27;07;26","Uni directional but still multi skill. Whereas when you have adaptive and adaptive in discussion, in conversation, even again, if only in a folk sense, you have adaptive on either end and it can allow for a new non equilibrium steady state to arise so not that there isn't a non equilibrium steady state of spider plus web rather than them separate."
"Unknown","01;27;07;26","01;27;41;03","In fact there will be, but it still is a different type. It's like a double directional or reciprocal state merging. So just such a cool way to connect that blue. And then Stephen so like again this line between mirror active inference and adaptive active inference, like is it like makes me want to attack it a little bit. I think about the niche modification that for example, humans do is extensive and transcends like generations."
"Unknown","01;27;41;03","01;28;10;21","And I mean it like contributes a lot to the collective intelligence of the human species and so forth. And I also think about it in terms of like the Gaia hypothesis, right? So if, if the world is one giant organism and this is something that we talked about with Mike Levin when he came to the livestream. So if the world is one giant organism, is the knees constantly adapting to this species that are that are in it?"
"Unknown","01;28;10;21","01;28;33;25","Like, is this a continuous adaptive active inference? And just in terms of transcending time scales, you think about like these you know, symbiosis, I guess there's symbiosis, but like relationships that develop between, you know, like orchids and their pollinators, for example. So I mean, these are intense co-evolution, things that happen over many, many, many times, daily time scales."
"Unknown","01;28;34;03","01;28;56;26","And I mean, we can think about the plant. Is the plant a cognizable? I mean, that's debatable. I would say to a degree, like I'm not I'm not I'm not binary here. Like, yes, no is not not really a good answer. But but is the need to be constantly adapting to systems to a degree I think that's a great point."
"Unknown","01;28;57;00","01;29;15;25","Really, really great point. I do think the nature's adapting to systems. Absolutely. But I would say that the niche is adapting in a different way. And we can we can use of course, we're going to have to be specific because this whole adaptation takes as a policy in that sense, adaptation in terms of what the niche is doing."
"Unknown","01;29;15;25","01;29;51;11","If the niche is not itself, OK, perhaps you want to I can be accused of being bias interest. And in one sense, if the niche itself isn't a biological system, then we can kind of perhaps push against the idea that it's adapting in the same way that a biological system would adapt to. And this maybe one way of phrasing this, and I'm not sure if this is going to hopefully make a bit clearer, my point is that biological systems, one way of understanding them is that they have set points, right?"
"Unknown","01;29;51;14","01;30;22;25","Moving set points throughout a particular trajectory. And this particular trajectory might be a trajectory across face space throughout their lives. So you have a moving set and that's moving that is something that's organized around a particular type of phase space organization and it's recapitulated within a particular type of phenotype. Define the phenotype of characterize this is a phenotype or genetic model with a particular, say, a field of dirt."
"Unknown","01;30;23;13","01;30;45;00","We might be able to actually walk across a field of dirt or a set of cement stairs. The it might actually over time for what, few hundred years, you have these interesting stairs at the Castle Edinburgh that actually dip. And these dips in the cement are evidence that people have away before. But we tend to walk where other people have walked."
"Unknown","01;30;45;07","01;31;07;03","And this perhaps one would might call that an adaptation to a certain degree, but I think that might be pushing the limit on the word adaptation, given that that set of stairs does not have a set forth and doesn't have it doesn't have the same type of it's not the same type, I suppose, of a self-organizing system. It's not a self-organizing system in that sense."
"Unknown","01;31;08;25","01;31;58;24","And as such, I would think that. OK, well maybe then maybe the need to adapt to a certain degree. But there's an adaptation with biological systems that are self-organizing and have organizational closure. And I think this is why this is quite important. That is different than say abiotic systems. And this brings there, I suppose we I would love to talk about this in a bit is that it's a question that blew brought up in the last and the last kind of live stream was the manner in which we can actually understand systems or identify particular types of individuals that are involving the environment and so it's not actually saying that the environment is separate from"
"Unknown","01;31;58;24","01;32;19;17","the system. Otherwise we wouldn't actually be able to actually talk about the emergence of actually living systems we can get about that. We can get into that later, though. So I have to just push back on you. So think about the earth and the atmosphere of the Earth, OK? Now, this is not necessarily a biological system. This is nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water clouds, et cetera."
"Unknown","01;32;20;11","01;32;48;28","But here we are, humans releasing tons and tons of carbon into the atmosphere, totally changing the the set point, as you described it, like the homeostatic set point or whatever that non equilibrium steady state density that the atmosphere of the earth currently resides in and has resided in for X million years. Right. So but we are changing that and we are seeing the Earth adapt to us and the changes that we're making in it."
"Unknown","01;32;49;01","01;33;10;21","Just in terms of hurricanes, storms, I mean, the weather patterns are completely and they're destroying large amounts of humans. Right. And drought, famine, all of the things that are going to cascade through climate change as we see it for us. So is this not adaptive active inference on the part of the earth or what do you think of that?"
"Unknown","01;33;11;28","01;33;38;06","I really interesting. I think in order to make that particular type of assumption, one would actually have to ascribe to something like a hypothesis like Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis with the same type of thing that Dan Margulis presented later. And a lot and I think that's that's that's an assumption that has to be made, given the fact that, OK, well, just because response happens chemically doesn't necessarily mean that it's not actually an adaptive response."
"Unknown","01;33;38;06","01;34;08;12","B, you know, gene expression is biochemical adaptation, right? So it's not about just being chemical using chemical or something like this composition changing molecular structure as some type of criterion for adaptation but there's an I think there's an assumption that has to be made about what the system is there. And if you're thinking about the Earth as a system, maybe the Earth is adapting to its constituent parts."
"Unknown","01;34;09;17","01;34;41;00","Right. But that would involve that would involve intrinsically the Earth being a particular type of living system, given the fact that it has live living parts One other quick thought on that is as a model comparison framework. So go back to SPM, DCM, all of our categorical model comparison techniques in the toolkit, we can actually evaluate should we have cells as the units and then organisms and then the system of them, the the world?"
"Unknown","01;34;41;00","01;35;13;04","Or should we use a different partitioning? Which one of these models is explaining, predicting, designing, controlling better or which one is more parsimonious? I prefer simplicity over utility or I have a function that balances simplicity and utility. There's all kinds of frameworks that's kind of part of pluralism is starting with and being with that multiplicity of answers and then knowing who we are and what we use to decide on which models to use."
"Unknown","01;35;13;29","01;35;49;14","So Steven Yeah, I'd very much like to keep that ecological niche in the picture. So, you know, if it's organism in niche and groups of organism in niche and then watershed and micro environment or microclimate as a niche, I think that kind of becomes like a defining organism or unit in a way. It's like, what's the watershed? What's the kind of climate as experienced by that ecosystem?"
"Unknown","01;35;50;04","01;36;19;05","And then of course, you've got many ecosystems around the world from the Arctic to the Antarctic, you know, and it will be in between. Now, they might all be collectively affected in the broader carbon dioxide levels of the broader ecosystem, but when how that then jumps to make the whole world an organism becomes for me slightly challenging, right?"
"Unknown","01;36;19;06","01;36;39;09","Because it is always it was always in these up to then, and then suddenly it jumps to be an organism because we look at it from space and we see a nice round ball and it sort of looks alive. So I wonder whether there's a so one of the things I'm really interested in is, is like you're saying how things get ascribed to the niche."
"Unknown","01;36;39;09","01;37;16;16","And we talked about the path walking on the path and in a way like that, dispersive thing, animals can sort of also intuit some of that as well from the affordances and the directions and again, bringing stuff in from systemic design type approaches is one thing that's interesting is if you then say humans like humans, what we do is as a child and maybe some apes do this, but not many is we point at something as a child and then we went to the parent and that's becomes is in the niche, but it becomes what they would call a boundary object in systemic design."
"Unknown","01;37;16;16","01;37;39;12","So you're trying to bring together a team around something which is beyond one discipline. So what you need to do is you say, OK, we can't just use the variation free energy landscape of this domain ecosystem, which we have all attuned to in our sort of way, because now people are running by different rules, right? We're running by the physicists and the biologists."
"Unknown","01;37;39;12","01;38;00;17","Right? They're just going to be so you get a boundary object, which you point to. So it's something in the niche and then you sort of work to that so anyway, I just think there's something quite interesting then about like Daniel was saying there about, you know, what sort of language and do we use. But this scale problem comes back every time."
"Unknown","01;38;00;17","01;38;24;19","But I wondered, like the difference between boundary objects or something which can be defined, which I'm not sure if other animals can really do in the same way. Maybe a dog when it urinates up a tree. I was just thinking about that. Does that become a boundary object in their in their world? I don't know. But yeah, that's something that comes to mind."
"Unknown","01;38;25;19","01;38;51;20","Thanks, Stephen. And with a trans disciplinary in cancer biology, they've recognized the niche, the tumor and the stem cell niche in the micro environment and there's so much more to say on these very interesting topics. Just in the last few minutes, we can go to a few of these final points in the DOC one. It's always awesome to have the author and unpack some of the ideas."
"Unknown","01;38;52;07","01;39;28;28","So this is kind of our little fractal dot to setting us up for our discussion next week and thinking about implications and how does it influence how we act moving forward and what kinds of questions we're looking at. You wrote about some of the implications for thinking about individuality from a cognitive perspective. Say it broadly and it'd be awesome to hear your thoughts on the folk psychological notion of the cognizable and where does the ATP come into play?"
"Unknown","01;39;30;24","01;40;10;21","All right, thanks for the question. So the folk psychological notion of cognizant again, my argument is that it piggybacks upon this idea of folk, psychological folk, biological notion of the individual. And once we kind of free ourselves from thinking about individuals specifically in terms of replication dynamics, that opens up a space for us to think about and cognize those that are discontinuous with replication or replicate us."
"Unknown","01;40;11;13","01;40;45;15","And I think this is like that. That's going to be very important again when taking the this particular route of thinking about the evolution of cognition, when thinking about, for example, OK, if cognition goes all the way down to a certain to a certain degree, then what part does it actually play? And the construction of larger systems and why would why would the construction of larger systems actually be some type of adaptation?"
"Unknown","01;40;45;27","01;41;28;06","What for each of the systems involves are so when we're thinking about, for example, I think one particular thing that it's quite important will be quite important to think about this for as OK the manner in which we think about artificial intelligence, for example, one way, of course, or two ways, of course, of doing this. As you know, we go for various kind of specific tasks, but there's going to be kind of a computer vision or three type tasks where we can actually analyze large corpus of tasks and kind of recapitulate that that's one thing."
"Unknown","01;41;28;06","01;41;52;09","And the other thing of course, is the task general or that kind of domain general notion of A.I. And I think in order to perhaps try to into the Department of Trade, into that field of more kind of task generality, we're going to have to think about even simpler questions as to how can a system actually start maintaining itself according to its own tasks."
"Unknown","01;41;52;09","01;42;20;12","And again, we come back to this notion of how can we actually set a system up, you know, to have its own intrinsic motivation and one way to do this is perhaps to piggyback on living systems. So you introduce a living system to an artificial system and have to have them communicate in such a way that's, you know, analogous to some type of symbiotic system."
"Unknown","01;42;20;24","01;42;48;23","And this is something, again, perhaps that Mike Levin, Michael Levin has been thinking about doing actually in his lab. And and I think this this is quite an interesting kind of method to think about the importance of of symbiosis and developing artificial intelligence systems, you know, a system that can identify go, go, go to a room on embodied intelligence agent that can, you know, traverse a room and identify all the dogs."
"Unknown","01;42;48;23","01;43;16;12","That's great. With with an accuracy a high accuracy level. That's fantastic. But if if if they can't respond to the dog knowing that a dog is going to actually, you know, dismantle it, I'm not sure if I would want to call how intelligent that system would even be in terms of having basic intelligence. And I think that step that developments allows allows a particular type of perspective on the notion of basic intelligence or intelligence that surrounded or."
"Unknown","01;43;17;28","01;44;13;14","Yes, that's that's grounds in the notion of kind of a nest unless density or grounded in the notion of a type of a moving set point that's equivalent to a homeostatic moving home and moving to a static state. And our states are supporting states Thank you, Matt. Shannon, thanks for that. I wonder how important sort of drawing on what Lewis said and Dave and Stephen, I think also earlier how important some sort of affective or emotional state or awareness is in knowing and cognizant of and like how important that is for for a symbiotic relationship to be called the cognize there."
"Unknown","01;44;14;01","01;44;48;08","And whether you know, like the neural networks that is working with the human maybe to compose a piece of music, how important it is for that neural network to have cognized capabilities of its own or maybe some sort of affective awareness or some sort of affective processing that it is able to develop in some way on its own, or maybe only in symbiosis with a person and I don't know if this bobtail squid and the vibrio like do they have sort of affective awareness together?"
"Unknown","01;44;48;08","01;45;33;21","It is this would seem to experience something like pain, I suppose would be one of the most basic affective states you might have. So how important what basically is affective processing in delineating individuals or cognizance? The great question Chad and I I'll take a go at it. I do think that at a certain level of flux, the affective affective states play a huge role but I but because I'm I suppose I'm making an assumption that cognition goes all the way down and not every system is going to be an affect have that capacity to have some type of natural awareness."
"Unknown","01;45;34;06","01;46;13;06","One might actually think about some other type of subcomponent it that plays a similar role as affect. And perhaps that just might be something like, you know, something that grounds the grounds, a particular type of motivation to stay, to stay in homeostatic state or to remain in particular homeostatic state and this can be our Pamela Lion has written about this just recently actually, and it's not affected necessarily, but it's valence, negative and positive valence that might not."
"Unknown","01;46;13;06","01;46;58;03","And it has less to do with awareness or sentience in that sense, but more to do with actually a particular type of organism or a particular type of system responding in ways that, again, are responding in ways that keep it centered. And whether or not whether or not that kind of valence a bacteria might climb a gradient of glucose, for example, a bacterium might not have any type of, you know, experience of that glucose gradient but somehow we might say that that bacterium is actually it's positively balanced."
"Unknown","01;46;58;11","01;47;50;02","It's something that is attracted to them. Right. And maybe, maybe in simpler systems, you have something more like the notion of valence rather than the affect, but a certain period of complexity after a certain perhaps degree of complexity arises are aspect is very important. And I think particularly when it comes into multi-cellular systems, that perhaps that have to actually compute larger like much more information has to compute much more information and has to interact in their environments, their environmental niches and much more using a term by construal and a much more opaque so a fact of information and fact of the matter which we can use affect and how that effect, how that affects cognition"
"Unknown","01;47;50;04","01;48;10;27","but I think it becomes quite important, but I'm not exactly sure what, number one, that's probably not a line it probably develops but just what that function is, is a different story. I don't know. Do you have any ideas about that? I don't have an idea about where that would start. But I feel like it would fall off."
"Unknown","01;48;10;27","01;48;33;19","So we might have the small scale like bobtail squid and Vibrio who might have something like Valence that they're responding to. And then as we get slightly larger organisms, you know, dogs, people then aspect will play a lot more of a role. But then as we have bigger systems like multiple humans, what is the affective state of a crowd of people?"
"Unknown","01;48;33;19","01;49;01;21","Like we can ascribe like they look angry or they sound angry, but they as a crowd are they feeling something as a crowd kind of like group intentionality? Is there a group affective state? It might kind of start falling off again. So you might have this sort of U-shaped curve where violence matters. And then somewhere here in the sweet spot, affective states or emotions really matter that's that's super definitely something."
"Unknown","01;49;02;06","01;49;25;19","Absolutely something I want to think about. Cool. And also reminiscent of the discussion of affect as well as higher order parameters in deep parametric active inference, where we even talked about which states were opaque or not whereas opaque usually meaning like you can't see it, you can't see in. But actually the opaque mental states are the ones that we do experience."
"Unknown","01;49;25;25","01;49;45;08","So that was in the Sanford Smith paper and whether other systems feel things, what is it like to be a squid? What is it like to be a symbiosis? That's the phenomenology and the metaphysics. But what is it like for us to model that system as if there's a higher level control parameter? We can know what that's like."
"Unknown","01;49;45;08","01;50;27;28","It's a lot like this conversation so just everybody can provide a last comment on this awesome discussion. I think the takeaway for me is that in a post Darwin biology, it's easy to use the simplified trifecta of evolution by natural selection phenotypic variability, heritability of the phenotype, fitness correlation and variation and fitness, and then project that onto all the kinds of individual cognitive, the rights and responsibilities, the economic unit, the sentence unit, all of those as just simply under the coattails of the Darwinian replicator."
"Unknown","01;50;28;10","01;50;51;26","And I think pluralism and a bevy of other perspectives suggests that that's just not the case. Blue And then anyone else with the last comment, I just wanted to say thanks for coming. I really enjoyed this discussion and I just started reading your paper, your 20, 21 paper with Zillow the modeling ourselves and I hope you'd consider coming back to talk about it with us."
"Unknown","01;50;52;27","01;51;20;21","Thanks so much. It's been a really incredible conversation, discussion so thank you all for inviting me, Shannon or Steven or Dave. Any last comments? Awesome. Well, all participants, thank you so much. And especially for writing the paper and coming to talk about it and seeing the dot zero before. So peace out, everybody. See you next week. Right. Bye."
