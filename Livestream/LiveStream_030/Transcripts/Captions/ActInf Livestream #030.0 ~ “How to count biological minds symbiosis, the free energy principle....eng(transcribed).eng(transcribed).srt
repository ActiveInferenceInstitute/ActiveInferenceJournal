1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,560
it's life

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,880
okay

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,320
it is

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,839
hello and welcome everyone thank you to

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,480
joining the active inference lab

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,359
it is october 1st 2021 and

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,000
i'm daniel i'm here with blue and we're

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,680
going to be talking about this paper how

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,640
to count biological minds symbiosis the

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,800
free energy principle and reciprocal

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,960
multi-scale integration

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,520
welcome to the active inference lab

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,760
we are a participatory online lab that

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,920
is communicating learning and practicing

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,160
applied active inference you can find us

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,640
at the links here on this page

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,559
this is recorded in an archived live

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,840
stream so please provide us with

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,680
feedback so that we can be improving our

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,800
work

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,320
all backgrounds and perspectives are

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,600
welcome here

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,520
and we'll be following good video

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,320
etiquette for live streams

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,520
we are heading into october and the

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,879
number 30 paper about biological minds

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,119
we currently have the author matt sims

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,680
scheduled to come on the october 5th

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,479
discussion and then we'll have the 30.2

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,400
another participatory group

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,560
discussion so check out the calendar

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,720
here as well as these other series if

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,759
you want to

34
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,360
join or

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,720
suggest somebody who we can invite

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,840
today in acting stream number 30.0 the

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,560
goal is to learn and discuss

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,320
this paper how to count biological minds

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,040
and it's by matthew sims it's from 2020

40
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,200
in the journal synthese

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,600
and just like all the other zero videos

42
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,520
this is just an introduction to some of

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,840
the ideas some background that blue and

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,799
i whip together literally leading up to

45
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,640
the time of now so it's just an

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,399
introduction and if you want to

47
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,640
go deeper into an idea then come to the

48
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,840
discussion

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,200
we're going to go over the aims and

50
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,079
claims abstract roadmap of the paper and

51
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,719
then the figures and so on

52
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,000
so

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,200
let's just get started with the

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,919
introduction readings blue and what

55
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,440
makes you excited about this paper

56
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,720
you know daniel i'm always interested in

57
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,360
studying intelligence and how that

58
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,959
scales from

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,599
the subcellular to the systemic

60
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,120
ecosystem level

61
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,000
um

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,800
and so this is kind of an interesting

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,000
take and it echoes a lot of what we

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,440
talked about in

65
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,599
the discussion of mike levin's paper the

66
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,080
computational boundary of the self back

67
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,200
in july so i was excited that matthew

68
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,440
agreed to come on the live stream and

69
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,920
i've been excited about this paper um

70
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,840
just because it it takes active

71
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,879
inference

72
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,040
the multi-scale aspect of active

73
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,319
inference

74
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,959
in a really enhanced integrative

75
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,480
direction

76
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,120
how about you what did you like

77
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,159
i liked that it combined uh some general

78
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,440
ideas

79
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,080
and questions in philosophy philosophy

80
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,480
of biology and then tied it to the

81
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,920
natural history of a specific species

82
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,080
so it's all good you know make claims

83
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,840
about distributed systems or the

84
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,760
microbiome and the host in general but

85
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,480
then

86
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,879
tying it to a system that can be studied

87
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,720
and has a cool

88
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,440
ecological history is a good approach

89
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,400
kind of grounds the paper

90
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,760
here's the

91
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,959
paper

92
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,280
and how to count biological minds

93
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,000
symbiosis the free energy principle and

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,120
reciprocal multi-scale integration

95
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,000
i'll

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,319
read the first aim and then blue you can

97
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,319
say something or read the other ones

98
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,959
to support the notion of symbiotic minds

99
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,040
and the notion of nested biological

100
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,280
cognizers that falls out of it this

101
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,760
paper will develop and deploy the notion

102
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,400
of reciprocal multiscale integration

103
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,760
from within the free energy principle

104
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,599
multiscale integration describes the

105
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,080
case where each of two or more cognizing

106
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,680
systems uses the other to provide

107
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,760
evidence for its own model of the world

108
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,518
and itself acting in that world

109
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,080
as a case study in support of the notion

110
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,079
of symbiotic minds i will look at the

111
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,880
symbiosis of vibrio fischeri bacteria

112
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,560
and the bobtail squid

113
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,560
i will argue that the vibrio squid

114
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,960
assemblage constitutes a functionally

115
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,440
integrated cognitive hole the markov

116
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,520
blanket of which constrains those of

117
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,800
vibrio and the squid

118
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,479
and in showing how the notion of a

119
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,639
symbiotic mind can be supported by

120
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,479
reciprocal multi-scale integration

121
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,639
within the free energy principle

122
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,880
this paper contributes to the philosophy

123
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,479
of cognitive science

124
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,160
demonstrating that our folk

125
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,720
psychological conception of what cogniza

126
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,560
what cognizers are

127
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,400
require rethinking

128
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,479
moreover if the account of symbiotic

129
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,560
cognizance presented as tenable by

130
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,320
bringing into relief and accounted for

131
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,160
at least one possible transition in

132
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,639
cognition this paper contributes to a

133
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,400
more complete understanding of the

134
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,520
evolution of cognition

135
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,320
so cool claims and the only kind of two

136
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,479
halves to it of the general argument and

137
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,080
the specific

138
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,919
and

139
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,240
symbiosis and ecological association

140
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,840
have been

141
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,919
approached in

142
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,639
the free energy principle framework but

143
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,680
i think this reciprocal component

144
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,120
it's approached a little differently

145
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,080
here than probably in some works but

146
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,800
we'll get into that

147
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,320
okay

148
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,440
i'll do the first abstract one

149
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,000
the notion of a physiological individual

150
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,440
has been developed and applied in the

151
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,520
philosophy of biology to understand

152
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,080
symbiosis an understanding of which is

153
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
key to theorizing about the major

154
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,800
transitions in evolution from

155
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,120
multi-organismality to multicellularity

156
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,120
the paper begins by asking what such

157
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,759
symbiotic individuals can help to reveal

158
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,520
about a possible transition in the

159
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,160
evolution of cognition

160
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,240
it makes me think about the transition

161
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,720
from a solitary insect cognition to a

162
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,759
colony

163
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,840
so there's the change in the level of

164
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,479
organization and then is that purely

165
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,120
cognitive do cognitive changes preceded

166
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,199
do they follow what is the relationship

167
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,960
between the evolutionary the

168
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,440
physiological and the cognitive changes

169
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,120
is what the first part is getting it

170
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,960
the second part such a transition marks

171
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,440
the movement from cooperating individual

172
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,919
biological cognizers to functionally

173
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,080
integrated cognizing unit

174
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,680
somewhere along the way did such

175
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,080
cognizant units simultaneously have

176
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,319
cognizers as parts

177
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,080
expanding upon the multi-scale

178
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,840
integration view of the free energy

179
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,639
principle this paper develops an account

180
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,720
of reciprocal integration

181
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,880
demonstrating how some coupled

182
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,720
biological cognizing systems when

183
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,880
certain constraints are met can result

184
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,120
in a cognizant unit that is in ways

185
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,199
greater than the sum of its cognizing

186
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,919
parts um and yeah this paper just shouts

187
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,599
out a lot to seth mary or smith

188
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,280
mary a kid says last name and nader

189
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,360
smith and you know the major transitions

190
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,759
in evolution uh which is if you haven't

191
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,759
read that book or thought about those

192
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,360
transitions i mean you can even probably

193
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,319
pick up a summary um but it's really um

194
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,080
amazing to think about

195
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,120
the evolution in terms of the transition

196
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,680
from single cell to multi-cell and you

197
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,520
know from asexual to sexual reproduction

198
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,840
and there's you know i think seven major

199
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,360
transitions that happened in the course

200
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,319
of evolution and i think that this kind

201
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,120
of

202
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,479
is hinting at a cognizing evolution or

203
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,879
cognitive evolution which

204
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,479
we'll we'll get into a little bit later

205
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,560
hey parker

206
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,199
symbiosis between bee fishery

207
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,360
bacteria and the bobtail squid is used

208
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,800
to provide an illustration of this

209
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,639
account a novel manner of

210
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,280
conceptualizing biological cognizers as

211
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,840
gradients is then suggested

212
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,919
lastly it is argued that the reason why

213
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,240
the notion of ontologically nested

214
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,120
cognizers may be unintuitive stems from

215
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,199
the fact that our folk psychology notion

216
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,039
of what a cognizer is

217
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,879
has been deeply influenced by our folk

218
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,039
biological manner of understanding

219
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,360
biological individuals as units of

220
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,199
reproduction

221
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,520
so that's a really cool point because it

222
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,759
involves um

223
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,840
our understanding of biology models of

224
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,159
biology influence the way that we see

225
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,159
the world which is kind of

226
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,679
sounds by definition but it's really

227
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,760
interesting because people have thought

228
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,839
so many different things about different

229
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,519
parts of biology about animal biology

230
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,040
all of evolution

231
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,320
all of the things we see

232
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,240
so then how that

233
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,160
intersects with our understanding of

234
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,880
cognition and what cognitive levels

235
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,320
exist what levels of individuality exist

236
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,399
cool topics

237
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,399
so just a thought here

238
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,240
so what uh

239
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,040
a biological individual like a what a

240
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,519
cognizer is has been in uh

241
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,200
influenced by our understanding of

242
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,279
biological individuals as units of

243
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,320
reproduction so is a cognizing unit a

244
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
unit of cognition

245
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,279
it's like

246
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,440
is there a corresponding in

247
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,680
to cognitive evolution as um

248
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,360
corresponding units as there are to

249
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,080
biological evolution sorry

250
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,920
good

251
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,560
so those are the main pieces

252
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,080
the roadmap

253
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,720
not that many sub sections starts with

254
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,120
an introduction and goes through a nice

255
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,720
description of the free energy principle

256
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,080
which we're going to

257
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,040
use

258
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,560
in multiple slides here

259
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,240
there's a distinction drawn which we'll

260
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,279
also go into about mirror versus

261
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,600
adaptive active inference

262
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,440
multi-scale integration will be

263
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,040
discussed

264
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,440
and different kinds of multi-scale

265
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,160
integration come up later on

266
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,399
but then there's two sections about this

267
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,040
specific bacterial squid symbiosis

268
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,920
and then that symbiosis is returned to

269
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,760
with this

270
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,120
enhanced background on the

271
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,040
uni-directional and the reciprocal

272
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,120
multi-scale integration

273
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,240
so that's kind of the overall roadmap

274
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,800
keywords or anything to add on that blue

275
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,600
all right

276
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,200
keywords were

277
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,839
free energy principle active inference

278
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,120
symbiosis nested markov blankets

279
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,959
multi-scale integration cognitive

280
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,279
evolution emergence and physiological

281
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,360
individuals

282
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,120
so let's start with

283
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,959
symbiosis

284
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:41,680
so

285
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,160
the quote from the paper was

286
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,760
symbioses are cooperative heterospecific

287
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,360
associations

288
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
in which

289
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,600
each symbiont partner mutually benefits

290
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,480
from

291
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,200
eg gaining nourishment shelter etc from

292
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,680
the presence of the other partners

293
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,760
so heterospecific means different

294
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,519
species

295
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,320
and uh this is a graphic and also those

296
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,640
interesting the footnote that just said

297
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,399
we're kind of talking about the positive

298
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,440
mutualistic form of

299
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,880
co-living

300
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,440
not commensalist or parasitic forms of

301
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,640
co-living or co-existing but even just

302
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,200
looking at pairwise interactions before

303
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,279
more complex loops are

304
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,000
taken into account there's a whole game

305
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,800
theory space of interactions

306
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,160
so

307
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,920
what should our models

308
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,720
include cooperative interactions

309
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,880
adversarial interactions

310
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,959
uh which which one of these edges or

311
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,640
relationships

312
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,800
have what game theory what cognitive

313
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,920
theories

314
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,240
so it's a it's a cool approach to take

315
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,800
on symbiosis that respects all the ways

316
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,399
that different systems like a lycan

317
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,600
versus a

318
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,519
eukaryotic cell with a mitochondria all

319
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,800
these different

320
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,000
co-living

321
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,079
styles

322
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,480
so just a thought on that um

323
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,720
you know all of these co-living styles

324
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,760
are transactional whether it's you know

325
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,120
through a

326
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,440
voluntary transaction or just straight

327
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,320
theft

328
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,760
um these kind of associations

329
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,240
remind me of how we're we're starting to

330
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,920
scale into studying

331
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,240
cities and states and thinking about

332
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,880
debt right so like the debt that we have

333
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,440
to each other like i borrow this or or

334
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,440
you borrow that or i benefit you know

335
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,880
you in this way and you benefit me in

336
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,160
this way and

337
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,000
that scales from

338
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,519
the you know

339
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,839
very basic biological unit all the way

340
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,519
through

341
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,560
ecosystems so

342
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,360
okay physiological individuals

343
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,240
so we're gonna come back to this idea

344
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,399
of what's an individual but

345
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,279
one

346
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,600
wrote in is this quote so one way

347
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,880
philosophers have addressed this

348
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,200
question of individuality is by

349
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,040
conceptually developing and applying the

350
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,519
notion of a physiological individual

351
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,760
a biological individual of this kind is

352
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,480
a highly integrated functional unit

353
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,560
the heterogeneous parts of which

354
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,320
cohere together through regulatory

355
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,600
processes

356
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,480
like metabolic immunotolerance etc so as

357
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,720
to maintain the system's integrity and

358
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,079
resist environmental forces of decay

359
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,000
and the citation to prado 2011

360
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,760
looks at the

361
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,639
role of the immune system

362
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,040
and the interaction with the foreign

363
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,519
with the other during development

364
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,360
and uses that

365
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,720
relationship

366
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,600
to

367
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,839
explore the the notion of the interface

368
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,240
between the organism and the environment

369
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,399
and looks at like the physiological

370
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,199
story involving the microbe and the

371
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,399
social niche and all these other

372
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,480
components can come into play and that

373
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,560
that is in some

374
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,680
cases

375
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,839
a better explanation or prediction or

376
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,040
description

377
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,079
of a certain scenario such as cool

378
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,519
another cool topic what do you think

379
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,560
blue

380
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,399
so this this is cool the end of this

381
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,480
quote i reject the idea that there is no

382
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,920
possible distinction between the

383
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,160
organism and its environment i just want

384
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,440
to point that out

385
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,680
because we'll come back to that in uh in

386
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,120
two slides actually

387
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
yes it's a qualification of the

388
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
interface and the system but it's not

389
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,560
the rejection

390
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,639
that we just give up

391
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,360
so it's towards useful partitionings of

392
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,839
the system

393
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,040
okay

394
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,720
so

395
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,440
two models of individual individuality

396
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,040
more generally

397
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,480
there was a quote in the paper that said

398
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,720
the theoretical apparatus that falls out

399
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,639
of the free energy principle may be used

400
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,480
to arrive at an account of the kind of

401
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,240
enrichment of living processes that are

402
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,480
required for those processes to qualify

403
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,800
as cognitive processes ascribable to

404
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,040
physiological individuals so that's

405
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,600
linking the cognitive perspective

406
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,519
with the physiological perspective of

407
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,880
individuality

408
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,199
making good on the project of strong

409
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,839
life-mind continuity

410
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,040
so what models of individuality exist we

411
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,880
have physiological and cognitive

412
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,720
we have the um

413
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,320
view that is going to be implicitly

414
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,120
described as like folk biological which

415
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,440
is the darwinian replicator evolutionary

416
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,360
just a few other ones that exist there's

417
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,120
like the teleological concept of

418
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,639
individuality

419
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,839
which is um the end directedness

420
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,160
and the cons definition of the organism

421
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,880
as an end in it in and of itself

422
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,399
and that's when things are acting at the

423
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,079
organismal level

424
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,720
but there's probably a lot of distance

425
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,880
between what was that simplification and

426
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,399
what was written

427
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,279
the information theory of individuality

428
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,800
which i know blue you have something to

429
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,199
add on and then integrated information

430
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,079
theory

431
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,839
as well as pluralism uh and a sort of

432
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,079
historical perspective

433
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,040
that

434
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,560
looks at shifting boundaries of the

435
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,040
conception of individuality and then

436
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,800
tries to find some organization that

437
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,880
doesn't even use that as a central

438
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,320
divider i mean these are just some of

439
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,800
the ways but just also cool like you

440
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,240
know species but then there's so many

441
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,880
species concepts but individual seems

442
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,720
like that's the one that you can pick

443
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,519
out

444
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,839
but then it's not always that

445
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,759
way well and i guess we'll come back to

446
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,800
that

447
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,959
remark when we uh talk about markov

448
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,600
blankets here in a little bit

449
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,519
um so

450
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,440
the information theory of individuality

451
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,600
i absolutely love love love love this

452
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,320
paper um because for many reasons but

453
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,720
but i just wanted to highlight um in

454
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,600
this paper they talk about how

455
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,440
individuality can be nested and it

456
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,480
requires a bi-directional information

457
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,560
flow which which i think that this

458
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,040
distinction um is important right so

459
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,279
there has to be like control from the

460
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,920
top down and from the bottom up so

461
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,399
information has to go both ways and that

462
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,000
is what describes

463
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,519
an individual so

464
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,839
you know if you have um

465
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,799
i'm trying to think of like a

466
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,880
non-individual

467
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,880
like like okay you can have someone

468
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,199
broadcasting instructions through a

469
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,439
megaphone you know right like like

470
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,599
shouting you know like please move to

471
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,359
the right please move to the right like

472
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,280
so that that's like top down control but

473
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,439
there's no feedback from the crowd like

474
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,839
the right is blocked there's a path here

475
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,599
or there's you know a gap here we can't

476
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,960
walk through it or whatever if there's

477
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,760
no you know feedback then that's not an

478
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,520
individual right so you have this you

479
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,360
know top down control but nothing comes

480
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,600
back so in an individual there's always

481
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,000
that that reciprocal uh flow

482
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,320
and then the the forms of individuality

483
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,640
that they highlight in this paper are an

484
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,600
organism which is like you and me uh a

485
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,440
colonial form of

486
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,840
uh individual which is like a biofilm

487
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,400
right and then a driven form and this is

488
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,559
the part that goes back to that quote

489
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,880
about i reject the idea that you know

490
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,960
there can be no step or that

491
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,120
an organism is not distinct from its

492
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,960
environment and so in this enviro this

493
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,080
is environmentally driven um and that's

494
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,000
this last form of individuality that

495
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,919
they highlight so it's aware like the

496
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,000
nature of the individual is entirely

497
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,240
dependent upon the environment and

498
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,400
allowing for this type of individual to

499
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,520
exist

500
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,240
really allows the formation of life in

501
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,160
the very beginning because if you just

502
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,559
have collections of molecules

503
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,320
you know without a boundary or a barrier

504
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,400
that's environmentally driven and so

505
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,480
without that uh

506
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,240
organism being able to arise from its

507
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,320
environment you don't get the origin of

508
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,080
life and so i just wanted to just

509
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,679
highlight that

510
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,200
nice great points

511
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
the next key word is the free energy

512
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,799
principle or fep and this is from

513
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,160
active livestream 14 from the illusion

514
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,120
that carl firsten made to the wood lice

515
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,640
and his kind of

516
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,400
observations of nature

517
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,000
leading eventually

518
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,880
to

519
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,280
an integrative approach

520
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,679
that includes some of these areas like

521
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,240
considering how multi-scale systems work

522
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,799
and how collectives work so how things

523
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,120
work laterally within a level like

524
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,960
across and estimates and then multiscale

525
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,320
like the colony inside of the ecosystem

526
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,120
information and thermodynamics and

527
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,919
control theory and action selection as a

528
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,440
type of inference

529
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,960
we're going to

530
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,679
hear it here from the author and look

531
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,440
through the four main

532
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,160
points that they drew out of the fep

533
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,480
so this is again

534
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,919
coming from

535
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,039
the sims 2020 paper so read for more

536
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,960
detail

537
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,720
the free energy principle

538
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,559
starts from a particular view of life

539
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,679
that is grounded in statistical physics

540
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,440
so that's

541
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,600
an introductory claim an interesting way

542
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,880
to start

543
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,799
and again just pulling a few highlights

544
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,159
out to to get at this first key point

545
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,400
a biological system is one that self

546
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
organizes to a limited set of attracting

547
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,720
states that is far from thermodynamic

548
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,960
equilibrium so there it's like our body

549
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,880
temperature is kept above the room

550
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,080
temperature

551
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,640
far from the sort of naive chemical

552
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,919
equilibrium

553
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,840
and that's being maintained despite

554
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,320
dissipation being a prevalent in the

555
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,919
universe

556
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,520
and that

557
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,000
resistance to falling to equilibrium is

558
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
called the non-equilibrium steady state

559
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,440
density

560
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,760
importantly the nest density

561
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,679
towards which an organism's dynamics

562
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,320
flow corresponds to its phenotype i.e

563
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,919
its regular patterns of behavior

564
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,720
morphology and physiology to find itself

565
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,400
in its characteristic or phenotypic

566
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,280
states provides the organism evidence

567
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,559
that its behavior is countering

568
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,919
dispersive effects of random

569
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,520
fluctuations

570
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,960
so

571
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,360
even static seeming phenotypes like the

572
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,679
length of your femur it's actively

573
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,280
maintained by

574
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,840
cells being renewed and the turnover

575
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,440
rate and so on

576
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,360
so sometimes it's easier to think about

577
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,720
some phenotypes like cognitive

578
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,039
phenotypes as actually embodying

579
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,600
parametric values that are being kept

580
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,440
away from equilibrium

581
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,200
other times for more static components

582
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,440
of phenotype it's not that way but it's

583
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,280
just a cool way to think about phenotype

584
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,679
as just these measurements that are

585
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,000
stable over some time frame about the

586
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,400
world and the persistence of those

587
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,240
measurements through time

588
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,600
represents

589
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,919
the implementation of some strategy that

590
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,600
resisted dissipation

591
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,039
hence the maintenance of a

592
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,960
non-equilibrium steady state through

593
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,080
some kind of strategy

594
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,840
anything that

595
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,520
blue no

596
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,720
the second

597
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,720
the right the this brings us to the

598
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,960
second primary feature of fep

599
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,679
the markov blanket formalism

600
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,520
this is used in the context of fep to

601
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,880
describe a particular kind of

602
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,039
statistical organization of a system

603
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,080
relative to that which the system is not

604
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,000
namely it describes the statistical

605
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
partitioning of internal states and then

606
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,080
using just the variable names as they

607
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,200
are here

608
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,799
internal states are

609
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,200
the external states phi

610
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,720
and the sensory states s active states a

611
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,400
these latter states being

612
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,840
in the markov blanket which are the

613
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,159
sensory and the active states

614
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,000
so what what about this blue

615
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,480
just i mean we've talked um well on the

616
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,640
live stream a lot about markov blankets

617
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,559
and how they can be used to describe um

618
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,760
or or individual individuals so really

619
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,840
or to delineate the boundaries of an

620
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,320
individual and technically the the

621
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,240
markup blanket

622
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,039
defines conditional independence

623
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,880
so like

624
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,120
under what settings or under what

625
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,480
settings are these two systems

626
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,840
conditionally independent

627
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,200
yes

628
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,320
so there's some interface that is being

629
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,919
used and there's a conditional

630
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,760
independence across either side but yeah

631
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
cool a topic that's come up many times

632
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,960
and i'm sure this is not the end of it

633
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,720
this brings us to a third essential

634
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,320
feature of fep

635
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,720
the notion of a generative model

636
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,720
a generative model is a probabilistic

637
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,039
model that describes how the evolution

638
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,600
of sensory states of a markov blanket

639
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,640
could be caused by external states

640
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,480
it captures prior beliefs in the form of

641
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,400
probability distributions about

642
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,480
unobserved external states

643
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,720
and a likelihood mapping external states

644
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,960
to the evolution of sensory states

645
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,120
such models are quote implicit in the

646
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,600
dynamics of internal states

647
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,840
palacios at all 2020.

648
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,640
so

649
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,559
the mapping between

650
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,360
external states and the evolution of

651
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,679
estimates of internal states is this a

652
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,799
matrix

653
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,960
that is connecting the observations

654
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,960
being made through time

655
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,200
to the s matrix so that's a

656
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
bi-directional relationship with the

657
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,880
generative and the recognition model

658
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,039
that's the tail of two densities

659
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,640
but that's the signal processing uh

660
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,159
sort of uh

661
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,080
sampling the external world

662
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,720
and then having an ongoing estimate of

663
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,480
world states which could be just

664
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,240
unobserved world states or causes in the

665
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,640
world then there's how those states

666
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,320
change their time b

667
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,360
how policy interacts with how those

668
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,320
states change through time pi

669
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,799
d the prior over the states

670
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,799
and then the decision making of pi with

671
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,200
the c g and the e so this is the

672
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,440
partially observable markov decision

673
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,559
process

674
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,640
the pomdp

675
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,200
framing and it's not the only way we can

676
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,360
look at it but this gets like many of

677
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,840
the key

678
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,360
variables down which is why we and

679
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,120
there's uncertainties on all of these as

680
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,200
we've found so

681
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,799
this just gets a lot of the key pieces

682
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,679
down

683
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,200
the generative model could have a

684
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,960
different structure though this is not

685
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,000
the only structure

686
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,600
okay

687
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,760
good

688
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,360
so here is from the paper

689
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,039
importantly uh

690
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,799
you want to read this one

691
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:11,600
sure

692
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,840
importantly a systems generative model

693
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,600
may be cast in terms of its

694
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,760
non-equilibrium steady state

695
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,080
to see how this is the case requires

696
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,840
understanding the notion of dual

697
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,320
information geometry of self-organizing

698
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,440
systems and he gives several citations

699
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,400
one of which i guess is this one yep

700
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,679
so this is just giving the first

701
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:34,799
description

702
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,240
uh not like first in literature just

703
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,000
like a first introductory description on

704
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,200
this dual information geometry

705
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,520
this dual aspect concerns the intrinsic

706
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,200
information geometry of the

707
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,520
probabilistic evolution of internal

708
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,480
states

709
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,720
so that's like the actual if there's a

710
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,400
million neurons and they can each take

711
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,600
10 states

712
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,720
that's this

713
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,279
the geometry of the internal states is

714
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,200
like that many neurons can take on that

715
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,919
many values that's the internal

716
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,480
true state space of the actual internal

717
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,760
states

718
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,360
and the separate

719
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,080
in

720
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,240
extrinsic information geometry of

721
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,320
probabilistic beliefs about external

722
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,400
states that are parameterized by

723
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,760
internal states

724
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,480
so that n neurons could be fitting a

725
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,799
binary model is the light switch up or

726
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:21,600
down

727
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,120
or it could be a three-state model is it

728
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,760
up down or not either or both

729
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,559
whatever it's specifying that is a lower

730
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,080
dimensionality

731
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,520
than

732
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,679
the actual state space so it's like

733
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:34,880
there's a lot of

734
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,880
decisions in the whole computer but then

735
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,720
there's this external

736
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,120
realized component that's a smaller

737
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,279
state space

738
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,679
the extrinsic information geometry we

739
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,600
call these intrinsic ie mechanical or

740
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,880
state-based

741
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,880
and extrinsic i.e markovian or

742
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,360
belief-based information geometries

743
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,640
and uh

744
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,120
wanja has come on just to discuss

745
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,520
several papers so definitely

746
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,400
look at the work by all of these authors

747
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,679
because it's like

748
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,039
interesting topic we could probably

749
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,520
learn more about that and i know there's

750
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,880
people who are

751
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,159
listening who know more about it

752
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,600
okay

753
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,039
here

754
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:17,840
is

755
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,000
those intrinsic and extrinsic

756
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
information geometries

757
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,720
being used in

758
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,799
i think the sims paper

759
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,640
but

760
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,799
uh

761
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,200
not 100 sure actually but we can see

762
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,799
either that or it's in this previous

763
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,559
fristen paper

764
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,080
so there's the probabilistic flow the

765
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,840
system states over time that's the

766
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,679
intrinsic geometry

767
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,080
and that's that yeah what i think this

768
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,000
is the first paper okay okay and here's

769
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,440
the extras so then

770
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,880
basically this is just a visual showing

771
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,279
the higher dimensionality of the actual

772
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,960
components of the system that can

773
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,279
project onto like just two

774
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,799
lower areas

775
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,039
okay

776
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,200
the fourth

777
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,559
part

778
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,559
of fep

779
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,279
uh in the sims paper this brings us to

780
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,919
the fourth primary feature of fep

781
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,840
active inference

782
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,640
um

783
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,559
i'll read the yellow and then

784
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,520
you can give a thought on where you

785
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,279
think acting fits in

786
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,279
fep proposes that living systems are

787
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,200
able to resist the second law of

788
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,279
thermodynamics in virtue of avoiding

789
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,440
sensory states which are deleterious and

790
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,440
actively bringing about those sensory

791
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,039
states which allow them to maintain

792
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,399
their structural and functional

793
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,520
integrity

794
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,200
it is by engaging in this coupled

795
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,600
process of active inference that an

796
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
organism minimizes not only current free

797
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,279
energy encountered but expected free

798
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,600
energy i.e the free energy that would

799
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,000
arise were a particular action policy

800
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,880
selected and followed

801
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,760
um so instead of giving a thought i'm

802
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,880
going to give

803
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,480
an author's thought

804
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,760
on this

805
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,600
just to read a quote from the paper the

806
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,440
reason for using the free energy

807
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,600
principle to investigate and argue for a

808
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,240
symbiotic mind is not only because the

809
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,640
quantity free energy provides a measure

810
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,520
of cognition across

811
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,200
spatiotemporal scales but because the

812
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,240
free energy

813
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,720
principle and its various corollaries

814
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,120
suggest a plausible criterion for

815
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,240
identifying biological cognizers across

816
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,440
various various spatiotemporal skills

817
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,799
so that's why they touch the fep um just

818
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,240
for that reason which i thought was nice

819
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,840
i'm going to ask a nice question from

820
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,159
the chat from stephen

821
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,679
wrote

822
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,919
is there a dual information geometry

823
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,039
between intrinsic and extrinsic states

824
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,799
of active inference

825
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,120
and another dual information geometry

826
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,840
between action stage estates and niche

827
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,320
spaces

828
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,760
can i give a first answer

829
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,320
please okay

830
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,960
i would say that

831
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,880
the total state space

832
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,039
which includes the variables for the

833
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,039
internal the blanket and the external

834
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,399
space

835
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,760
that's

836
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,120
the shape it is

837
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,200
and then there's going to be sub shapes

838
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,360
like you could only look at the blanket

839
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,799
and the internal states that's the

840
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,399
particular states

841
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,000
so that's partitioning the system of

842
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,159
interest away from the niche

843
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,159
or you could look at it in a in a four

844
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,760
way or

845
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,440
there's probably a lot of other ways but

846
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,200
it seems like the full model is the full

847
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
geometry and then there's going to be

848
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,080
some reduced geometries

849
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,399
and then stephen clarified i.e a dual

850
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,720
information geometry in relation to the

851
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,120
generative model and what it is modeling

852
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,960
and a dual information geometry between

853
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,480
what actions are happening

854
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,640
and the niche modification

855
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,679
i think that gets at also that sigma

856
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,640
mapping function in the decosta paper

857
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,399
with like okay after there's conditional

858
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:51,919
independence

859
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,520
of the kind that the markov blanket

860
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,240
partitioning provides there's still so

861
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,679
are some internal

862
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,240
state partitions in the world that

863
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,880
maybe do some prediction about or

864
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,200
anticipation about external states so

865
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,960
it's as if they're estimating external

866
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,039
states

867
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,559
let's talk to somebody who knows

868
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,640
information geometry

869
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,159
that's it i was going to say but my

870
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,360
guess would be depends on where you put

871
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,440
the mark on blanket but definitely i

872
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,120
think uh anybody out there who's

873
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,360
listening that knows about information

874
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,600
geometry i'm curious to take a deep dive

875
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,799
down that

876
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,080
path so

877
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,080
so i encourage you to get in touch and

878
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,919
contact us come talk to us about

879
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,120
information geometry because i would

880
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,840
like to learn some more

881
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,159
there was a distinction drawn in the

882
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,640
paper between adaptive and mere active

883
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,159
inference so i actually don't think that

884
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,000
this has come up

885
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,240
we've seen several distinctions like

886
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,480
instrumentalism and realism in terms of

887
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,840
the interpretation but this is i think

888
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,440
another

889
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,159
relevant distinction

890
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,880
fep falls short of making the claim that

891
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,960
all markov blankets draw a line around

892
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,200
cognizers

893
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,399
it has been suggested that what

894
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,080
determines whether a living markov

895
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,399
blanketed system is cognizer

896
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,399
is whether or not it is the kind of

897
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,760
thing which engages in adaptive active

898
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,960
inference

899
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,120
rather than mere active inference

900
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,279
kirchoff 2018

901
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,120
adaptive active inference requires that

902
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,440
a system autonomously engage in active

903
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,200
inference maximizing sensory evidence

904
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,760
for its own existence so there's been a

905
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,080
coupled oscillator model

906
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,880
as well as the uh flywheel governor

907
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,519
model another classic kind of mechanical

908
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,600
regulatory system

909
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,679
and uh

910
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,440
as well as the discussion well does a

911
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,159
rock have a markov blanket that type of

912
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,279
question

913
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,000
and so this is from the kirchoff 2018

914
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,600
paper just drawing the distinction

915
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,760
between mere active inference which is

916
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,760
like the ability to draw a partition

917
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,559
around a system at all to distinguish it

918
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,200
from its niche and its interfaces

919
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,399
and then

920
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,399
its generative model could be like

921
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,720
nil or boring or just a coin flip

922
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,399
to contrast that with adaptive active

923
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,799
inference which is actually the inactive

924
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,679
sensory motor affordance semantic

925
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,559
coupling i'm a strange loop type

926
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,360
system what do you think about that blue

927
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,399
so i wonder you know when we talk about

928
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,519
um

929
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,159
active inference and adaptive active

930
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,519
inference

931
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,440
adaptive active inference um

932
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,840
implies more than just

933
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,720
mental action or maybe mental action is

934
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,159
sufficient but but i think

935
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,200
i feel like adaptive active inference

936
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,760
implies that there's more of an action

937
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,840
component and you know we've talked

938
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,000
about situations where where

939
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,399
you can have active inference occurring

940
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,480
without necessarily taking

941
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,600
an action or maybe a mental action um

942
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,360
you can actively infer what's happening

943
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,600
in the environment without

944
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,679
performing some kind of action that's

945
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,200
adaptive to it

946
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,159
i don't know maybe that's that's that

947
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,480
exactly it's action and non-action it

948
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,719
can be adaptive to not act so is that

949
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,239
mirror

950
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,480
waiting good question right

951
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,639
right right and also like you can have

952
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,560
adaptation that's occurring in the brain

953
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,800
like you adapt to a noise in the

954
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,399
environment like it's super loud and

955
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,320
sound super loud but then eventually

956
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,879
your brain adapts so are you still is

957
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,399
that mirror or is that adaptive

958
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,159
nice so

959
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,440
emergence

960
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,040
do you want to read whatever or say

961
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,918
whatever you'd like to say about

962
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:37,119
immersions

963
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,159
sure so um this is just the wikipedia

964
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,000
definition so i'll just read it um

965
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,399
emergence in philosophy systems theory

966
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,320
science an art emergence occurs when an

967
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,480
entity is observed to have properties

968
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,879
its parts do not have on their own

969
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,639
properties or behaviors which emerge

970
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,599
only when the parts interact in a wider

971
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,879
hole

972
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,480
and i just

973
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,160
included these

974
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,520
references

975
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,280
so so that that definition kind of

976
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,920
echoes integrated information theory of

977
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,680
consciousness which

978
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,599
again implies that like consciousness is

979
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,599
this emerging property when the parts

980
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,960
are interacting and create something

981
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,680
that's bigger than the whole and then um

982
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,200
both of these um wait oh yeah so both of

983
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,839
these papers um the roses paper and then

984
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,800
this paper by varley and eric hole

985
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,640
start to get into the mathematics of

986
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,200
emergence and they use similar

987
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,040
metrics it's like they use the partial

988
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,839
information decomposition over the the

989
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,359
five metric that's used in the

990
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,880
integrated information theory of

991
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,440
consciousness to kind of quantify

992
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,079
emergence like what is this

993
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,480
how much is this emergent property or

994
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,920
it's what degree is this an emergent

995
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,960
property of these parts um and then what

996
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,359
this is a strong and weak emergence um

997
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,119
paper that you you included daniel oh

998
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,599
yep so i just i saw it it was really

999
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,480
cool that first that you

1000
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,160
chose some papers from people in the

1001
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,920
active inference community and that

1002
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,680
their recent papers like within the last

1003
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,800
year or two

1004
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,240
so just shows that there's development

1005
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,560
on these topics and that's interesting

1006
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,400
to think about and then i just thought

1007
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,240
to throw in a third like two truths and

1008
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,079
a lie but like

1009
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,720
two newer citations and one older one

1010
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,720
just the qualitative distinction between

1011
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,800
strong and weak emergence

1012
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,960
was influential by mark badao from 1997

1013
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,280
and

1014
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,440
that paper says i conclude that the

1015
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,200
scientific and philosophical prospects

1016
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,359
for weak emergence are bright and so

1017
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,640
it's easy to be like oh i want like the

1018
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,119
best version of whichever thing but in

1019
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,560
the paper it distinguishes between

1020
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,640
strong emergence as being sort of the

1021
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,720
metaphysical discussion

1022
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,000
about

1023
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,960
how holes take on meanings

1024
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,560
greater than the sum of their parts and

1025
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,119
sort of all versus none like snapping

1026
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,400
into existence in this kind of

1027
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
semi-magical way

1028
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,640
versus weak emergence like the ant

1029
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,480
colony the city the actual complex

1030
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,800
systems that can be modeled and so that

1031
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,200
kind of operationalized emergence while

1032
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,280
allowing a channel of

1033
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,760
metaphysical discussion like you just

1034
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,520
mentioned consciousness and other people

1035
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,720
bring up emergent properties

1036
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,400
consciousness all the time like

1037
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,160
integrated information theory it's an

1038
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,599
integrated information theory of

1039
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,200
consciousness so

1040
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,560
it's kind of just interesting how

1041
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,560
there's like a metaphysical thread

1042
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,720
in what this integration means

1043
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,599
as well as a uh operational and a more

1044
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,760
empirical side of this

1045
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,599
discussion

1046
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,320
and i also saw a recent 2021 paper i

1047
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,480
can't remember the author but um dealing

1048
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,280
with fmri and emergence like

1049
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,839
in fmri which is kind of interesting i i

1050
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,440
didn't i didn't include it but um i

1051
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,920
thought that that was cool it was 20 21.

1052
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,599
okay um

1053
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,000
that's the mark of blankets go for it

1054
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,920
that's it so again this camp this comes

1055
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,079
from that uh here cough paper 2018.

1056
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,400
um and you know this this figure is

1057
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,280
called blankets all the way down um so

1058
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,680
you know here they show a single-celled

1059
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,560
organism and they predict what they they

1060
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,400
illustrate one more conflict i model the

1061
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,640
world um and then you have a multi-cell

1062
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,200
organism a blanket of blankets that says

1063
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,040
we modeled the world

1064
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,359
um and then here it shows a pontiff that

1065
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,680
shows blankets within blankets we model

1066
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,000
ourselves modeling the world and that

1067
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,839
was something uh interesting that david

1068
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,760
krakauer actually said at the summer

1069
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,359
institute um this last summer he said

1070
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,040
you know humans is one of the things

1071
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,320
that makes us

1072
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,040
uniquely human is that we build models

1073
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,320
of our model

1074
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,800
we build models of our models um so i

1075
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,800
thought that that was interesting

1076
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,440
cool and then on the right side so

1077
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,720
there's the uh

1078
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,560
ppp example protozoa plants pontiffs

1079
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,320
and then another

1080
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,640
cyber physical way that the markov

1081
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,880
blanket concept and the partitioning of

1082
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,760
systems this way is being used is in

1083
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,200
digital systems

1084
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,480
so this is like

1085
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,880
a team member and then there's

1086
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,400
a certain type of blanket that they're

1087
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,400
interfacing through in terms of sense

1088
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,599
and action

1089
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,280
and the database can also be thought of

1090
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,800
as having different kinds of sensory and

1091
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,079
action

1092
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,079
states as well as internal generative

1093
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,839
model it's dealing with a different

1094
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,520
external set of states

1095
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,839
that's from the vayatkin at all 2020

1096
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,160
paper

1097
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,240
how about

1098
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,640
multi-scale integration you can go for

1099
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,160
it

1100
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,960
so i'll just read the yellow here um and

1101
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,920
so this is from the ramstead owl paper

1102
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,839
2019 which i think that that's where

1103
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,280
this figure is from and then there's

1104
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,000
also the hess but owl 2019 paper

1105
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,400
it says the multi-scale integrationalist

1106
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,560
view is a pluralist's theory about

1107
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,119
cognitive boundaries it uses the notion

1108
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,440
of nested markov blankets to demonstrate

1109
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,839
that cognitive systems have a plurality

1110
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,400
of ontological boundaries each relevant

1111
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,880
to the study of cognition

1112
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,920
according to this view each of the

1113
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,040
spatio-temporally nested components of

1114
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,960
this cognitive system may be

1115
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,119
ontologically picked out by deploying

1116
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,960
the markov blanket formalism at

1117
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,560
different scales

1118
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,680
and that's what we were talking about

1119
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,760
earlier we talked about individuality at

1120
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,000
different scales and we talked about the

1121
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,359
markov blanket

1122
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,240
individuating systems so

1123
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,319
so this is just

1124
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,800
one way that multi-scale integration can

1125
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,920
be approached

1126
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,359
but before the markow blanket even

1127
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,520
was an idea there was other approaches

1128
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,920
to partitioning multi-scale systems

1129
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,960
so let's just go right to the author's

1130
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,640
distinction in the paper

1131
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,839
of what uni scale

1132
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:38,720
integration is

1133
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,960
and how it relates to the adaptive

1134
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,560
versus mirror active inference

1135
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,079
discussion and this is a question

1136
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,160
stephen also raised in the chat

1137
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,680
so

1138
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,760
multi-skill integration so that's that

1139
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,640
nesting of systems within one another

1140
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,680
just

1141
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,440
not i'm intentionally not adding any

1142
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,119
adjectives just any kind of nesting

1143
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,560
systems

1144
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,920
multi-scale integration of living

1145
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,839
systems that failed to possess

1146
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,760
the high degree of autonomy required of

1147
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,680
adaptive active inference

1148
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,839
and hence fail to be cognizers continue

1149
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,839
to engage in mere active inference at

1150
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,240
fast time scale eg a mitochondria in a

1151
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,599
cell

1152
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,760
so that is visualized here before

1153
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,079
returning to the quote like the circular

1154
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,680
nodes on the bottom let's just say are

1155
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,000
doing mere active inference they're

1156
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,200
simple sensors or actuators

1157
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,000
and then they sort of just in a very

1158
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,760
clean way

1159
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,240
lead to increasingly

1160
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,880
weakly emergent behavior that starts

1161
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,200
approximating adaptive active inference

1162
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,960
so for example you have a python script

1163
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,800
that is adaptive active inference just

1164
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,119
so we don't have to even debate whether

1165
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,880
you know snails or birds are doing it

1166
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,040
just you write a script that is adaptive

1167
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,119
active inference the sub functions

1168
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,240
within it

1169
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,599
even though they might have an input

1170
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,119
output structure

1171
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,960
and even a generative model

1172
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,520
they're going to be a lot more

1173
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,640
mechanical

1174
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,359
or simple or linear not displaying the

1175
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,680
properties of the actual active agent in

1176
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,920
the python script at the higher level

1177
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,920
so that's describing this process of

1178
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,560
uniscale integration

1179
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,880
and

1180
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,280
then

1181
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,240
just the paper describes more about how

1182
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,000
adaptive active inference at the slower

1183
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,760
scale of the cognizing system that's the

1184
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,760
thought bubble here

1185
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,760
drives the continued integration of the

1186
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,760
nested markov blankets at scales below

1187
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,280
it and not vice versa so the pythons

1188
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,000
variables drive the patterns of the

1189
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,040
computation of the lower level functions

1190
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,839
but it does those don't meaningfully

1191
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,400
feed back into higher level

1192
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,599
properties

1193
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,240
so adaptive active influence at the high

1194
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,040
end

1195
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,359
and then that's just being merely

1196
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,920
explained mechanistically

1197
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,000
by unidirectional integration with

1198
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,640
systems that are decreasingly

1199
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,359
cognizer-like

1200
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,960
on some continuum of cognition

1201
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,920
so i i like the the term that's used

1202
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,240
here and i think i'll highlight why when

1203
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,920
we come to um the nested cone slide

1204
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,800
but he says the behavior of constituent

1205
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,800
nested markov blanket systems are

1206
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,079
enslaved to the slower dynamics of the

1207
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,640
autonomizing cognizing organism so i

1208
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,119
like this concept of enslaving

1209
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,400
um the sub routines

1210
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,920
okay

1211
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,240
cognitive evolution do you wanna say

1212
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,760
anything

1213
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,160
uh sure so this is um

1214
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,079
just i'll just read this little excerpt

1215
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,240
from the people paper because the author

1216
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,920
didn't technically use the term

1217
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,480
cognitive evolution and i thought that

1218
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,359
it might um refer to a couple different

1219
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,760
things but uh i'll read this quote

1220
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,280
because i think it's maybe highlights

1221
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,960
the the point that the author was

1222
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,040
getting at so this is a question about

1223
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,280
the kinds of physiological individuals

1224
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,440
that we can reasonably ascribe the term

1225
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,000
cognizer to it's a question about how to

1226
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,800
count biological minds the significance

1227
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,520
of this question lies in the fact that

1228
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,440
its answer may be used to shed light

1229
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,400
upon possible major transitions in

1230
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,880
cognition perhaps there are many such

1231
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,880
transitions the move from reflex

1232
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,119
behavior to sensory motor coordination

1233
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,200
the move from non-sentience to sentience

1234
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,319
to move from

1235
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,079
individual intentionality to group

1236
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,800
intentionality which this again echoes

1237
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,920
the the major transition of of evolution

1238
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,480
um so cognitive evolution i thought

1239
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,079
about it in a couple ways and we're

1240
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,760
coming to the cone slide next so maybe

1241
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,800
we'll make a flow forward

1242
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,920
so

1243
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,440
you know i thought that that's one way

1244
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,720
that we can think about cognitive

1245
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,800
evolution from like the transitions in

1246
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,240
evolution from say multicellular to or

1247
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,960
single cell to multicellular um but here

1248
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,520
this is from um mike levin's paper the

1249
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,160
computational boundary of the self and

1250
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,760
you can see this is like

1251
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,599
the the cognitive um cone right so so

1252
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,680
this is the cognitive cone of an

1253
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,599
individual that the like cones that were

1254
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,079
you know inverted and used in this way

1255
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,160
but you can see that the the cognitive

1256
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,680
cone of a tip

1257
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,240
is much smaller than that of a dog is

1258
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,720
much smaller than that of a human and so

1259
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,400
perhaps this cognitive evolution is um

1260
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,960
you know in terms of of

1261
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,400
scale of of the organism or or

1262
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,560
you know cognitive capacity of an

1263
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,000
organism

1264
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,280
but mike here uses this uh idea of

1265
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,640
nested kind of this multi-scale nested

1266
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,079
cognition

1267
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,920
and here it's

1268
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,079
shown here the cell the organism the

1269
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,240
colony to represent these

1270
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,119
compound intelligences and when we

1271
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,520
talked on the stream back in july like

1272
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,800
we talked about the warping of the um

1273
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,119
the the cone that like the bigger cone

1274
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,359
but like so the colony enslaves the

1275
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,599
behavior of the organism enslaves the

1276
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,359
behavior of the cell and so this goes

1277
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,119
all the way down and that's why i liked

1278
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,319
um what uh matthew sims his term

1279
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:07,280
enslaving um in these nested more

1280
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,319
complicated structures um because and

1281
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,160
the idea that like if you were to grab

1282
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,319
and twist the top of this cone you would

1283
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,160
grab and twist all the cones in it

1284
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,839
depending on how tight you twisted right

1285
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,400
so so i like this idea of enslaving the

1286
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,319
behavior and this was a good visual to

1287
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:25,440
kind of tie that all together

1288
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,480
that terminology also arises from

1289
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,760
synergetics from hakken not fuller as

1290
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,800
they say

1291
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,400
um and this is footnote 10 an order

1292
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,920
parameter is a notion taken from

1293
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,560
synergetics and used in

1294
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,400
dynamic systems theory

1295
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,000
it denotes a measure of a global

1296
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,480
system's macro scale unstable slow

1297
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,440
dynamics that's like the sleep wake

1298
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,280
that enslaves the fast dynamics of

1299
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,960
microscale component systems that's like

1300
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,599
the eeg rhythm and results in a globally

1301
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,200
emergent pattern so it's about

1302
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,599
multi-scale systems organizing but

1303
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,520
synergetics

1304
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,839
hackin not fuller approaches it from a

1305
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,920
dynamic systems fuller approaches it

1306
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,000
from a geometric perspective so there's

1307
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,160
other ways to do this partitioning mark

1308
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,839
how blanket is not the only partitioning

1309
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:10,720
out there

1310
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,480
but this was cool about

1311
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,599
also

1312
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,599
um levin's partitioning which we just

1313
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,839
got to learn about

1314
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:20,559
all right on to the squid

1315
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,640
so i i don't know if these are the exact

1316
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,119
right species but

1317
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,040
one of the key uh

1318
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,599
empirical examples of the paper the one

1319
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,359
that's uh followed up on do you want to

1320
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,040
describe the system

1321
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,200
um

1322
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,520
sure well so i mean the vibrio fischeri

1323
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,000
um are the bacteria that colonize the

1324
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,240
squid and yes it's the hawaiian bobtail

1325
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,160
squid and shout out to michelle

1326
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,640
nishiguchi and her lab that like was the

1327
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,640
lab underneath my lab when i was in

1328
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,960
biology lab so the juvenile squid um

1329
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,440
recruits the vibrio fisheries into the

1330
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,599
what's called a light organ and that the

1331
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,040
bacteria are bioluminescent um and so it

1332
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,960
becomes essentially like inoculated with

1333
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,920
these um and so then it says i'll just

1334
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,440
read this because it's easy it's

1335
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,240
probably a better description so it's a

1336
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,640
nocturnal predator of the shallow reef

1337
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,319
um the berries and sands during the day

1338
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,960
and hunts at night so it's always

1339
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,559
whether or not it is preyed upon it's

1340
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,240
always influenced with

1341
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,280
this association with these

1342
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,760
bioluminescent bacteria so the juvenile

1343
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,559
is inoculated into the light organ by

1344
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,240
through seawater

1345
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,680
and then the host promotes the

1346
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,040
colonization of uh vibrio fisheries and

1347
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,960
only vibrio fisheries through the

1348
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,839
production of mucus um which is bacteria

1349
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,079
and food the elimination of competing

1350
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,319
bacteria through hemocyte defenses of

1351
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,160
its innate immune system and the

1352
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,000
eventual shedding of the ciliated

1353
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,880
dependent appendages and swelling of the

1354
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,040
crypt membranes preventing further entry

1355
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,200
into the light organ so the switch sucks

1356
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,040
up the vibrio fisheries says we want you

1357
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,480
we only want you

1358
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,000
all of the other bacteria we're not

1359
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,280
going to allow them like we're just not

1360
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,760
going to facilitate that interaction um

1361
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,680
and then it says following gradients

1362
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,000
gradients of chitin which they feed upon

1363
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,400
vibrio fischeri migrate deeper into the

1364
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,319
crypts of the light organized organ

1365
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,640
colonizing it and causing a biochemical

1366
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,040
reaction resulting in their emission of

1367
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,960
bioluminescent light

1368
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,720
this occurs just in time for the

1369
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,400
bobtails nightly comfort prey and

1370
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,520
something else i thought that was

1371
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,520
important for this um

1372
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,359
cycle is that they're expelled every at

1373
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:30,800
the every morning

1374
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,200
right like so they just get out like so

1375
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,520
so like they colonize the the vocal

1376
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,200
split colonizes and sucks up all the

1377
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,920
bacteria they multiply and divide inside

1378
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,559
of the of the squid and then it shoots

1379
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:43,920
them out so they're back in the sea

1380
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,280
water and they're available for

1381
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,079
recapture by other um

1382
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,480
squid

1383
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,480
nice so

1384
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,000
we're going to return to

1385
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,160
the markov blanket partitioning

1386
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,119
and then

1387
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,720
consider that

1388
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,359
squid system and how

1389
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,040
using the mark out blanket partitioning

1390
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,400
we can distinguish between

1391
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,800
uni-directional and reciprocal

1392
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,640
multi-scale integration

1393
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,640
so the nomenclature in this paper are

1394
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,720
the internal states maybe because

1395
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,400
there's r in the word

1396
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,119
then s and a are the usual words for the

1397
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:18,079
state

1398
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,280
of sensory sense states coming in to r

1399
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,599
and then active action states going out

1400
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,240
of r influenced by so these are like the

1401
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,240
set of isolating nodes

1402
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,280
from which

1403
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,359
knowing them you're knowing as much as

1404
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:34,800
you can about r the internal states and

1405
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,319
then here

1406
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:39,280
phi or v i don't know which one it is is

1407
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,280
the external states

1408
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,280
okay

1409
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,960
yes

1410
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,160
okay

1411
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,359
figure two is where we uh turn to these

1412
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:50,960
two different kinds of multi-scale

1413
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,160
integration

1414
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,400
and directly compare them using

1415
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,680
kind of the nomenclature and the

1416
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,319
contribution i believe of this specific

1417
00:50:58,319 --> 00:50:59,520
paper

1418
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,440
so to understand

1419
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,119
the difference

1420
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,200
uh i will deploy the terminology of

1421
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,200
users you and resources are

1422
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,520
users are living systems the internal

1423
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,359
states of which inferentially generate

1424
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,040
subpersonal predictions that allow them

1425
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,280
to use other markov blanketed systems

1426
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,359
that are external to them

1427
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:22,000
so here is like the spider making its

1428
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,119
web

1429
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,440
so it's a user of this extended

1430
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,760
cognitive resource

1431
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,040
and so we can imagine that there's a

1432
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,280
mark of blanket partitioning

1433
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,520
that's around these entities

1434
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,760
like we don't need to deny that there is

1435
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,280
a partitioning between the web and the

1436
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,559
spider

1437
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,440
we can think about it using this u and r

1438
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,760
maybe this unr is a partition we can ask

1439
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,839
the author like is it a partitioning of

1440
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,200
just markov

1441
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,960
blankets from each other is there going

1442
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,119
to be some sort of interface is that the

1443
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:54,720
niche or

1444
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,440
that's the unidirectional case

1445
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,359
the bi-directional case

1446
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:03,119
is where those two interacting systems

1447
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,640
in the same way that the spider can be

1448
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,440
thought of as the unidirectional user of

1449
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,359
the resource of the web that the two

1450
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:10,640
interactants

1451
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,119
are sort of using and benefiting from

1452
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:15,040
each other as an extended cognitive

1453
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,720
resource

1454
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,400
so that is the

1455
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,040
one of the main points of the paper

1456
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,520
looking at that difference between

1457
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,200
kind of mere

1458
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,440
multi-scale systems and then ones where

1459
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,040
it's not just like a ladder it's almost

1460
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,880
like a conversation

1461
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,480
that is giving

1462
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,640
some new emergence

1463
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,040
outcomes

1464
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,880
very cool okay

1465
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,440
the next slide just shows some more

1466
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,240
discussion on the

1467
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,000
new

1468
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,280
u and r relationships that arise

1469
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,000
and then how the new non-equilibrium

1470
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,480
steady state density arising from that

1471
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,160
interaction

1472
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,119
then

1473
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,920
in the synergetic sense acts as a

1474
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,359
ordering parameter for u1 and u2 so the

1475
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:09,760
constituents are part of a new

1476
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,839
ordering regime

1477
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:14,160
because of the bi-directional

1478
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,720
relationship

1479
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,839
to be clear each constituent biocognizer

1480
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,599
continues to engage in adaptive active

1481
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,599
inference acting in ways that ensure it

1482
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,119
remains statistically separate from its

1483
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,400
environment

1484
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,319
so again in the unidirectional case it's

1485
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:31,040
mirror active inference on the bottom

1486
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,200
that becomes increasingly cognitive as

1487
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,680
you go towards some level of

1488
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,160
autonomy like a pyramid scheme

1489
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,400
this is like a different structure

1490
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,760
where there's increasing levels of

1491
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,520
autonomy of different kinds of

1492
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,079
interacting systems

1493
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:47,920
and then there's sort of a bigger

1494
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,200
wrapper around that

1495
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:54,720
okay

1496
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,520
cool

1497
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,800
it's like the the interaction creates a

1498
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,319
new cone a new tent it builds a tent

1499
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:04,160
yep makes sense

1500
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,920
though then

1501
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,800
uh

1502
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,040
this slide

1503
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,200
brings this emergence from the

1504
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,760
functional because it's one thing to say

1505
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,839
that the functional um you know these

1506
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:17,839
two brain regions get coupled together

1507
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,760
now there's a functional difference in

1508
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,160
their firing rates that's kind of a low

1509
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,680
mechanistic bar

1510
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,720
the higher bar to pass is this concept

1511
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,720
of ontological emergence like it really

1512
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,920
becomes

1513
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,880
a thing in and of itself

1514
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:33,680
and

1515
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,440
the authorized that's related to these

1516
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,880
two ideas

1517
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,960
that uh first that some properties of

1518
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,359
the macro system cannot be reduced to

1519
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:42,559
the structural properties of the

1520
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:43,920
component parts and they're governing

1521
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,040
microdynamics so that's sort of

1522
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,680
anti-reductionism

1523
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,000
or holism where that exists there's a

1524
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,280
strong argument that you're kind of

1525
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,400
losing something if you keep on

1526
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,839
dissecting

1527
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,680
and then two because of this irreducible

1528
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,799
properties

1529
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:58,559
a macro level system has ontological

1530
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,599
status eg is an entity in its own right

1531
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,920
so that just is a good question to think

1532
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,400
about and to ask the author just which

1533
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,040
systems are unidirectional integrators

1534
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,640
which systems are

1535
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,040
bi-directional

1536
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,559
how do we know

1537
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:16,240
why does it matter

1538
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,599
those are just all

1539
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,680
good questions to ask

1540
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,359
so another question that i have is

1541
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,520
to what degree

1542
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,319
does do these new properties have to

1543
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:30,880
exist like if we're going to quantify

1544
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,079
emergence

1545
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,400
in the very quantitative sense

1546
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,720
is it any number greater than zero

1547
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,160
or

1548
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,280
where are we drawing the line at

1549
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,400
what

1550
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,240
number of emergent properties or what

1551
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,040
quant what quantity of new properties

1552
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,119
creates a new system

1553
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:51,119
yeah it comes up with uh integrated

1554
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,720
information theory and a lot of other

1555
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,559
quantitative measures of

1556
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,480
integration and consciousness because

1557
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,960
it's like okay so if this system's one

1558
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,960
and this one's a hundred thousand

1559
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,480
are you gonna have now a second level

1560
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,119
theory like 500 is the cutoff or is it

1561
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,960
true that i could you know trade one of

1562
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,599
these for 100 000 of these like once you

1563
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,920
start putting everything on a numerical

1564
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,599
value

1565
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:15,280
and then that becomes your action

1566
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,359
selection metric oh

1567
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:19,680
if it's worth the square root of this

1568
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,359
then it's worth this

1569
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,520
so it sets up a market for action based

1570
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,200
upon these metrics

1571
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,880
which is pretty interesting that's a

1572
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,400
bi-directional emergence

1573
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,559
definitely figure three

1574
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:36,000
is using the markov blanket partitioning

1575
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,160
to look at the squid system

1576
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,680
so uh

1577
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,680
the squid is like user one resource two

1578
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,599
so for species one it's the squid

1579
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,839
bacteria system so resource species pair

1580
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:50,640
one is the squid and it's first user and

1581
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:55,520
second resource v fisheries u2 r1

1582
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,000
so these show the two kinds of

1583
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,079
interfaces like they're encircling each

1584
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:01,200
other

1585
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,799
so it's kind of like embedded one is

1586
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,480
embedded within the other

1587
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,000
from a causal

1588
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,760
perspective they're the niche for each

1589
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,960
other

1590
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,720
because even though when you put them on

1591
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,240
the two-dimensional map they're all just

1592
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,960
like flat there on the plane

1593
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,720
their nearest neighbors

1594
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,559
are either themselves or the other one

1595
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:23,119
so that's kind of a cool way to

1596
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:25,359
expand the topology

1597
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:28,640
of the just the histology of

1598
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,000
the tissue

1599
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,760
and then pull out like actually you know

1600
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,280
each beta cell in the pancreas is

1601
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,960
surrounded by other cells that aren't

1602
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,280
beta cells something like that and the

1603
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,799
other ones in a weird sense are also

1604
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:41,040
surrounded by the other kind of cell

1605
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,480
even though there's a lot more of this

1606
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,760
non-beta cell type so just a cool way to

1607
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,680
look at tissue interactions from the

1608
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,359
mark all blanket perspective

1609
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:00,160
you want to describe for or what

1610
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,200
sure

1611
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,598
or what

1612
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:09,520
so so here in this um figure it shows

1613
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:13,040
the the squid cycle um which we have

1614
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,200
talked about uh we just we just kind of

1615
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,040
talked about it so um

1616
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,520
it shows at time zero

1617
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,960
the squid is resting after venting um so

1618
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,559
there's some

1619
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:26,640
vibrio fishery left inside of the squid

1620
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,079
they're not like you know sterilizing

1621
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:29,920
themselves and so there's this is the

1622
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,520
repopulation

1623
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,960
of um vibrio fischeri and so then after

1624
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,319
12 hours there's a high density of um

1625
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:40,000
vibrio fischeri

1626
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,839
and then it shows this degree of

1627
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:43,920
interest so on the y-axis degree of

1628
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,240
integration is the degree of

1629
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,599
biocognitive individuality and so right

1630
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:52,240
here when there's the most squid inside

1631
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,119
vibrio fisheries um that's when there's

1632
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:58,160
the peak of integration presumably

1633
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,559
because the squid with you know three

1634
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:02,160
vibrio fisheries inside of it is not

1635
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,599
going to light up but when it

1636
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:05,680
concentrates it has a whole lot of the

1637
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,680
vibrio fischerite inside of the light

1638
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,319
organ then that's when it's luminescent

1639
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:12,640
um and that's when you know the novel

1640
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,839
properties so like not the you know

1641
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:19,040
well the you know vibration right alone

1642
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,839
wouldn't be sufficient to be um like

1643
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:23,280
there's not enough of them to be you

1644
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,720
know luminescent

1645
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,000
and then the split alone without the

1646
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,760
vibrofisherie doesn't light up and then

1647
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,839
it's not capable of of predation in the

1648
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:31,760
way that it normally does

1649
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,119
and so it's the peak of integration

1650
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:35,119
happens right before the sun comes up

1651
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:37,680
and then at dawn the vibrio fisheries

1652
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,119
are expelled

1653
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:42,400
and then the bioluminescence is over so

1654
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,520
that's that's kind of when there's no

1655
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,000
um integration between the two or

1656
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,240
limited or minimal integration between

1657
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,200
the two species

1658
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,440
thanks for the explanation so a few

1659
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,559
things on this

1660
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:59,839
it's like there's no single cut off this

1661
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:02,400
dashed line it's kind of like

1662
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,559
how many grains of sand in the heap

1663
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,079
like one

1664
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:08,400
is usually you know too few

1665
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,200
but 100 maybe you're getting there

1666
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,000
so

1667
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,119
it's this continuum of

1668
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:17,280
cognitive embeddedness

1669
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,400
and of emergent function and there is an

1670
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,760
actual time

1671
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,240
that that is most functional and that's

1672
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,599
just because the world has an actual

1673
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:26,799
structure where there's a certain time

1674
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:27,920
where there's the most light and it's

1675
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,520
the darkest outside

1676
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,559
and then there's a time where it's

1677
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:32,880
ineffective so if we can discount it

1678
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,680
when it's ineffective and low density

1679
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,119
and we can say that this is like the

1680
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:38,559
peak of that

1681
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:40,559
natural variability when it's the most

1682
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:41,520
bright

1683
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,359
of the bioluminescence and the most dark

1684
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:45,839
outside there's something

1685
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:48,640
that's varying between those two levels

1686
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,119
and so this was just a cool way to show

1687
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:53,760
that that there's a smooth

1688
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,920
increase and that it's a little bit like

1689
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,559
model specific where

1690
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:00,240
we choose to draw the line with the with

1691
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,799
who's the biological cognizer

1692
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:04,799
so this was a cool pattern and to

1693
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:07,119
include the environmental variation in

1694
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:09,040
the cognition so it's not like here's

1695
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,960
when you're good at taking tests or not

1696
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,559
it was like here's the environment as it

1697
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:14,640
changes and then here's how the organism

1698
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,240
is

1699
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,000
this reminds me of like you know

1700
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
building a nightlight out of fireflies

1701
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,200
so i don't know in california do you

1702
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,640
guys have fireflies there when i was a

1703
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,720
little kid they were everywhere on the

1704
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,000
east coast and so we would catch

1705
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,680
fireflies but like how many fireflies

1706
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,280
does it take to make a nightlight like

1707
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,200
you can't have one fight well it depends

1708
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,440
on the size of your jar

1709
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,680
and how many can you catch like you

1710
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,200
can't create a nightlight with one

1711
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,559
firefly like there's just not enough

1712
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:40,400
light but if you get like you know 20 in

1713
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,920
there then you have a good like

1714
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,319
nightlight

1715
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,440
so true how many make a party

1716
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,720
right

1717
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,760
okay this is fun um

1718
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,240
implications of the vibrio squid

1719
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,680
symbiosis

1720
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,680
so just a nice uh

1721
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,599
argument by nature

1722
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:01,200
approach that i'm sure we could learn

1723
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,480
more about

1724
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,119
that how do you go from an observation

1725
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:07,440
in the natural world oh this bird you

1726
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,039
know the one with this chromosome set

1727
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:11,520
does this for this long ergo

1728
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,440
this is possible or this is something

1729
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,920
about nature in general

1730
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,200
so there are three philosophical

1731
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,039
implications that are exposed by this

1732
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:21,039
striking association between the vibrio

1733
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:22,079
and the squid

1734
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:23,920
that are significant to the account of

1735
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,920
symbiotic minds which follows

1736
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,200
so the first one

1737
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,880
is that the vibrio squid is a clear

1738
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,960
example of a symbiotic physiological

1739
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,400
individual

1740
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,960
and that's distinguished uh from the

1741
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,920
other

1742
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,039
non-physiological individual systems

1743
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:40,960
like collections of physiological

1744
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,839
individuals you know if i eat food the

1745
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:45,359
other person doesn't get the nutrients

1746
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:47,520
but then you go okay but

1747
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,440
one person eating does provide the

1748
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,520
nutrients for another person so it's

1749
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,960
going to be a continuum and there's all

1750
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,680
that's like sort of the complexity of it

1751
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,640
but it's a great example of integration

1752
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,640
the like i like it and then the second

1753
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,880
one is um physiological individuals or

1754
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,039
matters of degree over time the same

1755
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:06,960
living system can be more or less of a

1756
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,720
symbiotic physiological individual so i

1757
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,319
think that really takes

1758
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:13,119
that um almost unsaid criticism of the

1759
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:14,319
first point

1760
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:17,280
and immediately builds on it to say like

1761
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,680
yes it is a continuum

1762
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,640
and

1763
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,960
that's the whole interesting part

1764
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:23,760
is

1765
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,480
you can see how the system's

1766
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,079
cognitive interfaces change through time

1767
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:30,640
and that's the interesting story like

1768
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,520
for humans certainly our ability to um

1769
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,760
do something alone in a room is gonna

1770
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,599
change through time when we're born it's

1771
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,839
very low and then there's an age range

1772
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:42,000
where you can do some task alone in a

1773
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:42,880
room

1774
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,319
and then eventually there isn't so it's

1775
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:46,000
like that is something that varies

1776
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,520
continuously just like there's the daily

1777
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,520
rhythm there's a lively rhythm

1778
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,359
to some cognitive elements of all

1779
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:52,400
systems

1780
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,079
so it's not reducing them or explaining

1781
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:56,319
them away it's actually looking at that

1782
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:58,720
variability and what it says about the

1783
01:03:58,720 --> 01:03:59,760
system

1784
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:00,880
and then

1785
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,119
the last philosophical implication may

1786
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,799
be thrown into relief when asking the

1787
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,079
critical question

1788
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:07,280
what is it that produces the

1789
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,079
bioluminescence the squid the bacteria

1790
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,520
or the temporary assemblage of these

1791
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,880
organisms

1792
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:13,760
so

1793
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,799
is that a thing that deserves a noun

1794
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:19,440
of itself because we have nouns for

1795
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,319
assemblages of other things

1796
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:23,839
of one type

1797
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:25,760
like the barrel of oil or something like

1798
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,799
that but is there a unit and a noun or

1799
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:30,799
are we left to describe this only with a

1800
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:31,839
process

1801
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:34,640
and then default implicitly back to the

1802
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,559
darwinian replicator

1803
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:38,480
oh the squid's just trying to reproduce

1804
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,799
and the bacteria is doing competition so

1805
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:42,880
they're the individuals ergo is a

1806
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,760
tenuous relationship or it's an interra

1807
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,839
interaction ecologically but it's not a

1808
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:49,599
thing in and of itself because it's not

1809
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:51,280
the replicator

1810
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:52,079
so

1811
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:54,000
those are great questions raised by the

1812
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,440
author

1813
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,240
so the questions that i maybe have for

1814
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,760
the author um

1815
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:00,480
so

1816
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,559
the bioluminescence

1817
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:05,359
is there in the vibrio fisheries

1818
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:06,599
it's just

1819
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:08,960
self-detectable by us

1820
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,920
or presumably by the prey that the

1821
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,640
vibrio fisheries hunting right so so i

1822
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:15,599
think

1823
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:17,839
um

1824
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,200
it's again like it's a continuum it's

1825
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,359
not uh um

1826
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:25,359
there is bioluminescence or there's not

1827
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:27,520
bioluminescence there's like more or

1828
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,400
less bioluminescence or detectable

1829
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,359
bioluminescence that occurs at you know

1830
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:35,440
x lumens

1831
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,280
so so what is the

1832
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,640
um

1833
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,920
the line there that is wrong

1834
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,680
good question so here's one of the last

1835
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,359
points in the

1836
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:46,960
discussion today

1837
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,559
it's again integrating cognitive and

1838
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:52,160
functional and physiological

1839
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,480
individuality together

1840
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,440
and then um what is in the background of

1841
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,119
you why are those

1842
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:01,680
when we say individuality and we have to

1843
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,039
qualify it by saying well i mean

1844
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:05,599
informational or i mean physiological

1845
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:07,440
what are we qualifying it

1846
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,400
implicitly or explicitly against

1847
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,880
um i think the materialist worldview

1848
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,960
might suggest that the individual is

1849
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,119
like just the the one

1850
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:19,200
corpuscular entity

1851
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,200
like the one thing that can be separated

1852
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,599
out like the ant is the nest mate worker

1853
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:24,960
now there's an argument for the ampy and

1854
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,799
the colony and the nest made being a

1855
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:29,680
tissue but people say oh i saw 10 ants

1856
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:32,400
on the windowsill not like i saw a

1857
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,640
thousandth of an ants on the windowsill

1858
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,640
so there's i think a pure materialist

1859
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,799
argument for just separability

1860
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:41,039
and that having the more noun-like

1861
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,319
characteristic

1862
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:44,000
and then

1863
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,400
the author is arguing that

1864
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,119
um there's this folk biological

1865
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:51,760
concept that sometimes prevents

1866
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,160
thinking about physiological individuals

1867
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,039
as

1868
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:55,920
real

1869
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,599
uh bona fide

1870
01:06:57,599 --> 01:06:58,960
individuals

1871
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,799
and that's this like evolutionary

1872
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:02,160
individualism

1873
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,440
model

1874
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,760
uh which can even have a collaborative

1875
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,160
or optimistic bent to it but it still

1876
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,400
draws lines around what levels of

1877
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,559
individuality exist in the world because

1878
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:13,760
they're the ones that most cleanly

1879
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,480
resemble darwinian replicators so not

1880
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,280
the systems that grow slowly outwards or

1881
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,960
transfer through different media in the

1882
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,240
same way

1883
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:25,520
and then the argument is that fep

1884
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,160
and its corollary active inference the

1885
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,640
mirror and adaptive and the continuum

1886
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,400
between like we talked about

1887
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,160
offer an ideal program for bringing our

1888
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,240
folk psychological intuitions in line

1889
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,079
with the way nature has carved its own

1890
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:40,799
joints over evolutionary time skills

1891
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:42,559
so that's an interesting

1892
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,880
claim

1893
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,240
definitely

1894
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,760
okay

1895
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:50,720
last

1896
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,599
slide

1897
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:53,760
this was like a william blake

1898
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,200
line that i thought of when i saw the

1899
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,720
uni-directional

1900
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:59,839
the bird a nest the spider a web

1901
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:02,079
man friendship people

1902
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:04,319
friendship so it's a great

1903
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:07,200
description of kind of this modification

1904
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,480
and i think

1905
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,480
it's getting at this idea that there's

1906
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,799
niche modification

1907
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:13,920
in nature

1908
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,359
and we do it

1909
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:17,520
that's sort of the unambiguous part you

1910
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,120
know we change our environment but then

1911
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:22,080
we're also our own environment

1912
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,799
so then there's some dynamics of like

1913
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,719
culture and communication and being each

1914
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:28,319
other's niche

1915
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:30,319
that are very different than the the

1916
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,960
bacteria changing the ph of a solution

1917
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,880
it can go up it can go down

1918
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,640
but it's still ph

1919
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,560
but then there's this different

1920
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,560
boundedness to

1921
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,319
what can happen with humans working

1922
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:43,679
together

1923
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:46,158
so that just brought a close these few

1924
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:47,679
questions like

1925
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:49,359
where is the

1926
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:51,759
multi-scale integration happening

1927
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:52,880
and then

1928
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,319
how how do we identify the

1929
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:56,399
unidirectional components

1930
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:59,198
and the reciprocal components and uh

1931
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:01,679
great paper

1932
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,920
so just a final thought and something

1933
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,600
that i've thought about a lot um in

1934
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,439
terms of of reading this paper because

1935
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:10,080
it's this colonization of the squid by

1936
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,120
this bacteria i think a lot about

1937
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,040
us and our colonization i mean there are

1938
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:15,839
more

1939
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:17,759
non-human cells in the body than there

1940
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:20,960
are human cells which is fascinating so

1941
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,198
but we also have the ability to

1942
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:26,158
manipulate our niche our internal niche

1943
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:27,679
the niche of the microbes that reside

1944
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:30,158
within us through taking antibiotics but

1945
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:31,279
there are lots of other things

1946
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:33,359
probiotics and not just antibiotics but

1947
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:35,679
but just even what you eat and where you

1948
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:37,359
go and how

1949
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:39,359
whether you're breastfed or not or go

1950
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:40,960
through vaginal birth or not and all

1951
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,198
these things contribute to your own

1952
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:45,520
inoculation or how you inoculate your

1953
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,920
children and this is something that you

1954
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,759
can do like literally you can change the

1955
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:51,279
composition of your microbiota like

1956
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:53,120
through your lifetime

1957
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:53,839
so

1958
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:57,120
is that niche modification is it

1959
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:00,080
what is that exactly

1960
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,040
i think it's one reason why

1961
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,360
a um

1962
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,199
not neutral or

1963
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:08,159
um

1964
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:11,280
unbiased but flexible

1965
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,800
integration

1966
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,440
model like being presented here

1967
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,280
we can just say okay rather than

1968
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,840
wondering whether it falls on one side

1969
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,320
or the other of a binary classification

1970
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,760
like yes it's co

1971
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,159
um symbiotic or not

1972
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:28,239
we just have a descriptive framework

1973
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:29,679
first

1974
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:30,640
and then you can think about the

1975
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,159
implications later or separate them

1976
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:33,920
somehow but

1977
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,360
we hope that if you're listening in the

1978
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,320
right time you'll join us for the 30.1

1979
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,520
and 0.2

1980
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,440
because

1981
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,880
the author hopefully will join for at

1982
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:46,400
least the first one and it's cool topics

1983
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,880
and we can do a little bit like we did

1984
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,880
in 29.2

1985
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,440
let's think of some systems

1986
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,199
are they unidirectional are they

1987
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:58,000
reciprocal

1988
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,320
what reciprocal systems could exist like

1989
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,640
what does that mean so

1990
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,760
sounds good yep thanks uh people who are

1991
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,679
listening and steven for the questions

1992
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:09,920
live thanks blue for collaborating on

1993
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,120
the slides here

1994
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,120
and thanks to the author too for

1995
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,120
providing us such such great food for

1996
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:15,920
thought

1997
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,360
totally agreed

1998
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:21,799
so thanks and see you later
