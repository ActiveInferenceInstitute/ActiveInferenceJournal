00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,160
hello and welcome everybody welcome to

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,400
the active inference lab today it's

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,920
october 1st

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,440
5th sorry greeting shannon and 2021

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,560
we're going to be discussing this

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,760
awesome paper

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,560
how to count biological minds symbiosis

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,880
the free energy principle and reciprocal

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,519
multi-scale integration

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,119
welcome to the active inference lab

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,679
everyone we're a participatory online

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,399
lab that is communicating learning and

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,640
practicing applied active inference you

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,239
can find us at the links on this slide

15
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,160
this is recorded in an archived live

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,239
stream so please provide feedback so

17
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,640
that we can improve on our work

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,559
all backgrounds and perspectives are

19
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,120
welcome here and we'll be following good

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,280
video etiquette for live streams like

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,239
muting if there's noise in the

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,160
background and raising our hands so we

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,719
can all speak

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,800
at this short link you'll find the

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,559
calendar of

26
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,959
past and future live streams the first

27
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,680
tab is the regular tuesday live stream

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,600
with two weeks per paper with the dot

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,600
one and the dot two but then we have a

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,040
few other

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,360
series of streams related to different

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,520
topics so go to that link to check out

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,960
what's upcoming

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,720
and see if you want to participate in

35
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,200
one of these streams

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,400
today in

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,080
number 30.1 the goal is to learn and

38
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,439
discuss

39
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,520
this awesome paper on counting

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,520
biological minds and we're really

41
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,759
honored and appreciative that matt sims

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,840
is here to discuss it with us

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,479
so we're just going to introduce

44
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,040
ourselves and walk through any of the

45
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,040
figures any of the formalisms we also

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,040
have a few other ideas and questions

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,159
that lab participants have raised

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,000
so this should be a great discussion

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,159
thanks everyone for joining we'll just

50
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,079
go around and

51
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,479
say hi and introduce ourselves either

52
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,960
just an introduction or feel free to say

53
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,719
something that you are excited about

54
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,920
with reading the paper and then we'll uh

55
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,318
all non-authors will go and then we'll

56
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,318
let matt just provide a little context

57
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,280
here so i'm daniel i'm a

58
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,000
postdoc researcher in california

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,760
and i think

60
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,760
i'm looking forward to drawing out some

61
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,599
of these threads about collective

62
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,360
behavior and the timeless questions

63
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,360
about collective behavior with some of

64
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,360
the new approaches that are discussed in

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,400
this paper

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,319
so i'll pass it to shannon

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,480
hi there nice to see everyone again um

68
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,319
i'm shannon i'm a phd candidate at the

69
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,040
university of california in merced

70
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,560
um and i've blurred my background but

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,239
there is a dog rolling around so

72
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,760
hopefully it's not too distracting

73
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,319
um i will pass it to stephen

74
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,959
hello i'm stephen sillett i'm based in

75
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,519
toronto um i'm doing a practice-based

76
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,720
phd through the uk and

77
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,159
around sort of psychological

78
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,239
perspectives on practices particularly

79
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,360
around social topographies and

80
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,159
spatial meaning making in participatory

81
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,760
theater and the arts

82
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,760
and i'm really interested in this paper

83
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,200
i like the

84
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,360
folk psychology questions that it brings

85
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,159
up and i like this idea of a folk

86
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,640
biology which i found really interesting

87
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,000
and the way that

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,239
we have assumptions around that

89
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,840
it sort of ties in maybe some of the

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,799
folk quantum that came up in some of our

91
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,480
previous sessions about what people

92
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,640
think that is so i i'm really excited to

93
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,799
see this folk idea being extended

94
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,840
because i think that could be really

95
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,799
useful so thanks

96
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,080
thanks stephen and to dave yeah

97
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,720
yeah dave douglas i'm retired from

98
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,760
programming machine translation

99
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,200
software um now i get to get really busy

100
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,480
working on a history of cybernetic

101
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,360
learning theory project for a professor

102
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,239
at carnegie mellon and all this good

103
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,959
stuff here

104
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,599
thanks steve so

105
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,159
matt thanks again for joining we'd be

106
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,400
really happy to hear some context and

107
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,760
we'll just take it from there and anyone

108
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,680
can raise their hand or type in the live

109
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,839
chat if they have a question

110
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,000
fantastic thanks so much for having me

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
uh so uh the context in this paper i

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,479
suppose it's like i wrote this paper uh

113
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,440
and

114
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,440
during my phd over at the university of

115
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,280
edinburgh i was

116
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,440
supervised by dave ward who's an auto

117
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,639
product and activist uh andy clark

118
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,360
uh who i'm sure all of you know and uh

119
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,120
julian kaverstein who's up over at the

120
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,880
university of amsterdam

121
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,680
and the the focus of this paper

122
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,880
uh was

123
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,720
pretty much my obsession on the notion

124
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,240
of collective intelligence and what

125
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,520
collective intelligence might be

126
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,440
and how cognition

127
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,320
uh has has developed say the evolution

128
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,919
of cognition with with a background of

129
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,479
um or taking into taking into account

130
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,520
the fact that cognition is uh in its

131
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,039
most basic form something that's going

132
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,199
to be collective in the first place

133
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,479
uh so it does pull at there is this kind

134
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,720
of immediate um

135
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,840
tension with how we look at cognizers

136
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,840
and how we look at cognition

137
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,120
uh

138
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,240
in the kind of

139
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,479
folk field with typical

140
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,120
uh say typical cognitive scientific kind

141
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,800
of research i suppose a traditional

142
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,000
should i say

143
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,560
uh and the point of this paper was to

144
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,400
okay but look at

145
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,280
uh the kind of evolution of cognition if

146
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,120
you if you will through a particular

147
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,360
lens using some of the kind of the tools

148
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,199
conceptual tools that were provided by

149
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,680
our seth morty and and uh john men and

150
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,880
smith

151
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,080
and see exactly how this can be

152
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,800
uh formalized and looked at through the

153
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,720
perspectives of the free nature

154
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,479
principle with the process theory active

155
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,880
inference

156
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,560
so that that's that's pretty much it

157
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,520
very

158
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,160
concise summary major transitions which

159
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,600
is the zothemary and maynard smith line

160
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,479
big

161
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,560
qualitative changes over evolutionary

162
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,039
history and then just like you kind of

163
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,560
brought

164
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,240
to at the end how do we land that plane

165
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,720
with maybe quantitative differences or

166
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,639
structural differences in a micro

167
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,319
process theory

168
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,240
maybe active inference under the free

169
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,000
energy principle

170
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,800
um

171
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,360
so shannon or dave or steven feel free

172
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,720
to

173
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,360
raise your hand um

174
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,120
otherwise maybe

175
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,479
a first question that came to mind for

176
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,680
me was like how do we research

177
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,880
or understand these folk beliefs

178
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,520
scientists are folk too

179
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,000
and is this like sort of the mythical

180
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,759
average citizen

181
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,919
what are these beliefs and how do they

182
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,919
come to be that way

183
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,000
why are they the way they are these folk

184
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,080
beliefs about biology because that sets

185
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,560
up a lot of the discussion and what's

186
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,160
relevant of the contributions of the

187
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,520
paper

188
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,800
absolutely that's a very very good

189
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,639
question very good question

190
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,680
uh

191
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,440
book beliefs we have kind of obviously

192
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,360
kind of folks psychological beliefs that

193
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,360
take the form of

194
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,759
actual uh for psychological notions that

195
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,160
take the form of say beliefs and desires

196
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,479
and these things i think uh

197
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,080
give us a good a good

198
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,840
very good manner to in which to actually

199
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,280
approach the notion folks thought

200
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,319
biology also with beliefs and desires

201
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,039
being particular type of constructs

202
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,080
which play an explanatory role

203
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,240
a psychological explanatory role these

204
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,400
are successful in for example explaining

205
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,639
or predicting behavior to us on a

206
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,000
certain level

207
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,639
and i think uh on a kind of first blush

208
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,960
level so to speak and i think folks

209
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,160
psychology and folk biology are kind of

210
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,360
um

211
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,759
bed folk in the sense that

212
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,919
biology is going to be based upon what

213
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,520
we initially

214
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,639
see

215
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,440
uh

216
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,400
via

217
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,560
like in our everyday experience of the

218
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,720
world for example is what we initially

219
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,440
see

220
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,520
so we're going to base the notion of an

221
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,720
individual

222
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,759
for example on the on on the ideas of

223
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,280
things that are going to be easily

224
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,720
individuated

225
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,639
uh and like

226
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,520
biological systems that are going to be

227
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,759
specifically reproducers and this is

228
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,599
where you come into the the notion of

229
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,639
kind of

230
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,560
the kind of darwinian individual as it

231
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,120
was called by peter godfrey smith

232
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,399
uh where

233
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,159
individuals are going to be demarcated

234
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,000
by their ability to be categorized under

235
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,159
under three different types of that

236
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,240
combined or joint three different three

237
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,680
different kind of categories which are

238
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,959
going to be

239
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,839
they have to involve variation

240
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:50,720
uh

241
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,200
heritability and some type of

242
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,720
differential fitness which is just

243
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,480
natural selection right

244
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,320
and uh

245
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,880
and this type of individual has been

246
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,480
kind of uh

247
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,399
saying we've invested into this notion

248
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,320
of individual and by the biological

249
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,440
sciences

250
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,560
uh

251
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,320
up into a certain point up into a

252
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,480
certain point because it helps us answer

253
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,240
helps us approach certain questions and

254
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
make certain i suppose make certain

255
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,640
inferences about about systems over the

256
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,440
long run but it falls short

257
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,360
and i think this is again one of the

258
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,800
grounding points of the paper it falls

259
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,279
short and explaining certain types of

260
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,880
associations

261
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,839
uh

262
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,760
and these associations namely are going

263
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,080
to be symbiotic associations and this is

264
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,680
a quite important uh i say transition as

265
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,080
as as we spoke about before

266
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,560
uh for the simple fact that without

267
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,320
symbiotic associations we don't really

268
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,399
have a manner i think i think of

269
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,680
explaining

270
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,720
uh

271
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,800
multicellularity

272
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,560
right the the transition from single

273
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,959
cellularity to multicellularity now that

274
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,680
this we've had various theories and i

275
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,959
think one of the theories that kind of

276
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,720
one of theorists that started this was

277
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,320
lynn margulis over at the university of

278
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,839
madison wisconsin

279
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,880
and her research was fundamental

280
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,560
and and when she suggested that for

281
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,640
example you have two

282
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,440
uh

283
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,760
two prokaryotes one envelope the other

284
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,160
through some type of phagocytosis

285
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,600
and they create some type of

286
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,040
relationship over time there's just

287
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,640
thought as ludicrous

288
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,399
and it did really push against this

289
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,600
notion of darwin darwinian individual

290
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,680
uh however over time we've come to

291
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,040
accept something like this uh and uh i

292
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,560
think this is like

293
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,240
the idea that you have some type of

294
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,880
bacteria that was enveloped by a

295
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,399
an archaea

296
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,760
and

297
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,640
in order to explain in order to actually

298
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,560
think about what we have in terms of

299
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,640
this particular type of unit

300
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,760
uh we really do need the notion of

301
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,480
uh moving beyond moving past our winning

302
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,399
individuals and two ways of doing that

303
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,399
obviously i think that the paper tries

304
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,240
to point out this

305
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,320
uh and it's these are not the only two

306
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,480
ways but one way is one way of doing

307
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,920
that is through kind of the metabolic

308
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,839
individual which is something that peter

309
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,320
gabriel smith himself kind of um

310
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,480
uh tips his hat off to

311
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,720
uh which is just to say that metabolic

312
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,040
individuals are individuals which

313
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,839
uh

314
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,519
they can be delineated by their

315
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,399
metabolic machinery and having uh kind

316
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,240
of autonomous metabolic machinery and

317
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,040
other other individuals can play a part

318
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,800
of that machinery

319
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,120
and thus you have uh two systems that

320
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,800
may kind of be

321
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,279
metabolic coupled to one another making

322
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,560
one system

323
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,839
and that's one way to go about it the

324
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,519
other way to go about it is i was

325
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,839
introduced by thomas

326
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,760
and this is a kind of the

327
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,320
immunological version of

328
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,240
an individual or a physiological

329
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,440
individual

330
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,639
now again these are the only two types

331
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,959
of individuals or two ways to delineate

332
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,480
individuals outside of the kind of more

333
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,600
traditional

334
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,480
folk biological notion of individual but

335
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,760
maybe that's something that we can talk

336
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,600
about perhaps there are other ways that

337
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,320
it might be interesting

338
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,920
great points and so interesting how the

339
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,320
map replaced the territory the map of

340
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,800
the sort of darwinian triad

341
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
defining an individual in the darwinian

342
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,440
sense and then people project that back

343
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,560
out

344
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,120
and say reality is explained by this

345
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,360
partitioning scheme yes

346
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,000
so very cool steven uh with the raised

347
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,079
hand then anyone else in here or in the

348
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,240
live chat go for it stephen thank you

349
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,920
yeah i'll be interested uh i think this

350
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,839
is really good points about these

351
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,360
different ways once you start to have um

352
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,600
these interactions and these

353
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,440
repres

354
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,959
reciproc reciprocities across p you know

355
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,040
then pluralism starts to come into the

356
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,560
picture yes and i i'm wondering how you

357
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,000
see um

358
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,079
this moving between fields of practice

359
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,240
because i wonder if like people in the

360
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,959
biological sciences and maybe those who

361
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,760
work with agents would really

362
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,040
be getting this right and then people

363
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,600
who have a theory about thinking they

364
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,519
know what biology is

365
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,279
maybe physicists

366
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,320
who maybe think they know what

367
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,760
everything is

368
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,720
um then have you know they have a

369
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,160
they have a biology understanding of

370
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,680
biology

371
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,760
just like maybe other people have a

372
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,959
physics understanding of quantum physics

373
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,760
so

374
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,200
i'd be interested in that and this might

375
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,040
even bring up some work of chris fields

376
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,040
that we had on here as well in terms of

377
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,839
other

378
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,360
ways of approaching this

379
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,880
multicellularity but i'd be interested

380
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
in your thoughts first about you know

381
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,839
that

382
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,880
tension even within the sciences

383
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,720
that's a really very good very good

384
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,160
point i do think this is a uh

385
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,880
before i hit that point directly

386
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,199
i do think this is a call for and just

387
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,120
interdisciplinary work

388
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,399
it's an absolute call for

389
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,959
interdisciplinary work this is something

390
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,360
uh that's that's it's

391
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,600
i think

392
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,920
trying to actually

393
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,880
use

394
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,720
psychological notions of biological

395
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,839
notions or physical physics notions uh

396
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,240
we will turn we will have some success

397
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,720
doing these things however

398
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,480
once we run up and there are going to be

399
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,839
certain constraints

400
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,760
uh with doing that and we'll run up to

401
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,440
problems run into problems and these

402
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,519
problems i think can only be

403
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,720
uh

404
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,360
can only be avoided or actually uh

405
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,399
addressed

406
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,440
when

407
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,360
using various disciplines together and i

408
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,720
think this is one of the things that

409
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,480
kind of the free energy principle

410
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,839
actually offers

411
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,639
uh as a kind of it's an opportunity

412
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,800
to work interdisciplinarily

413
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,920
on on various uh various phenomena

414
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,760
various processes

415
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,040
uh and

416
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,800
you're absolutely right in saying that

417
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,160
like okay well

418
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,959
uh how how can for example

419
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,959
in biology you might have

420
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,279
a typical assumption about what

421
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,880
cognition is

422
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,800
so we'll have a lot of biologists for

423
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,240
example there's a

424
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,839
there's a

425
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,000
there's a type of i that we were

426
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,760
speaking about before the before this

427
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,959
there was a

428
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,120
a notion of basel cognition that has

429
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,120
been kind of pushed

430
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,160
uh within the last 15 years and a lot of

431
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,000
various kind of research programs

432
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,760
scientific research programs whether

433
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,959
it's going to be plant biology or

434
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,839
microbiology has

435
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:28,959
has kind of

436
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,959
fed into this which is it's a lovely

437
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,560
program in the sense that it's

438
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,680
questioning

439
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,560
uh how we actually look at cognition

440
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,560
and these biologists that are kind of

441
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,880
taking these cognitive terms and using

442
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,639
these cognitive terms one of the things

443
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,480
that you know uh

444
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
i think that pushes against this is

445
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,920
going to be kind of a traditional

446
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,120
psychology

447
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,399
that uh

448
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,639
refuses to

449
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,040
uh with lack of lack of better words i

450
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,279
suppose which uses to actually engage in

451
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,279
some type of interdisciplinary

452
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,720
discussion

453
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,320
so it's it's a happiest psychology

454
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,079
that's happy using

455
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,160
for example um more focus focus

456
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,560
traditional and folk uh psychological

457
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,680
notions

458
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,800
and

459
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,279
uh with these kind of limitations i

460
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,240
think

461
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,880
we're going to actually be stuck we're

462
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,360
really going to be stuck

463
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,120
um and so

464
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,639
i i guess to summarize the point

465
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,480
is is that

466
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,120
it is a call for interdisciplinarity it

467
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,440
is a call for kind of questioning uh or

468
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,880
putting aside

469
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,959
the fact that we can give

470
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,199
uh satisfactory explanations but whether

471
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,079
or not our satisfactory explanations are

472
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,320
are actually the explanations or if

473
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,880
there is just one explanation uh

474
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,880
it that's that's the question that's the

475
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,240
question and i think that the whole

476
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,360
notion

477
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,759
of uh

478
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,920
the whole the whole idea about uh

479
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,680
biological individuality is that you can

480
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,520
be a

481
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,760
once you take into account various

482
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,679
various angles from various disciplines

483
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,520
it's fine to be a pluralist

484
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,880
it's fine to be a pluralist

485
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,720
thanks i i was thinking of just a

486
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,880
pluralism of what the word folk even

487
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
means some people might think oh folk

488
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,799
chemistry that's being wrong that's the

489
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,799
middle school level of understanding

490
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,960
chemistry and then the experts they know

491
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,720
about chemistry that's folk versus

492
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,480
expert but also

493
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,880
it seems like focus being used in a way

494
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,039
appeal to first principles like

495
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,480
appealing to

496
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,160
directly intuitive observable processes

497
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,799
and um what is active inference if not a

498
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,120
first principles approach

499
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,919
so

500
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,919
there's a way to bring in some of the

501
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,480
technical expertise the computational

502
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,679
backbone

503
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:54,880
but also

504
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,799
fully retain

505
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,280
the conversational and the casual

506
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,320
approaches that appeal and spread to

507
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,200
people

508
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,600
in their understandings of different

509
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,039
sciences

510
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,799
yes so

511
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,640
dave with a raised hand and then anyone

512
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,240
else with a then yes go for it dave yeah

513
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,360
there has been so much good work done by

514
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,000
people outside their specialties i guess

515
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,559
erwin schredinger may be the most

516
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,200
well known of uh in that

517
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,400
um

518
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,960
but um ben malka the swedish uh

519
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,720
neurophysiologist

520
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,799
uh wrote a lovely little paper from

521
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,120
about 1999 i don't think it was ever

522
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,480
published

523
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,919
about

524
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,720
how the development of the mobile eyes

525
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,440
in

526
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,320
one extremity of the early vertebrates

527
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,080
has forced

528
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,880
neurological developments

529
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,679
that have resulted in consciousness

530
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,480
simply because having mobile eyes

531
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,039
creates such an enormous burden

532
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,360
on

533
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,760
sensation

534
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,320
that you can't just use a simple nervous

535
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,799
system otherwise it's just overwhelming

536
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,080
have you looked at any of mercury

537
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,480
america's uh work

538
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,880
no okay i'm gonna have to send you that

539
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,880
and uh

540
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,080
please do

541
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,840
yeah yeah and um also mark solemns uh

542
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,760
who's a direct collaborator with uh

543
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,919
professor fristen just wrote a popular

544
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:28,880
account

545
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,520
of um

546
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,840
active inference from the viewpoint of

547
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,440
his own work with america and yak poncep

548
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,160
and antonio dimazio on

549
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,480
the effective

550
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,120
uh foundations of consciousness and

551
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,520
especially his own

552
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,600
thesis that

553
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,440
in freudian terms

554
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,960
it is the id that's conscious and the

555
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,080
ego

556
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,160
the cortical and the neocortical

557
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,440
processes

558
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,720
only

559
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,280
gain to become conscious when it really

560
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,679
has to because it's so expensive

561
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,120
metabolically and in terms of

562
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,039
distraction

563
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,320
um

564
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
and he's one of the few people who's

565
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
actually aggressive enough in trying to

566
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,640
go out and market his

567
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,159
dissidence

568
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,400
from the received

569
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,640
wisdom

570
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,520
and he's also he's also did a uh an

571
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,880
amazing update of the original

572
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,080
um

573
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,880
project for scientific psychology

574
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,360
in terms of fristonian

575
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,600
active inference so

576
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,400
first word the last word of that 1895

577
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,799
freud essay is in 2017

578
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,480
terminology

579
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
but still in exactly freud's order of

580
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,880
presentation

581
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,000
wow

582
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,760
yes please do send me that paper i would

583
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,919
love to read it

584
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,280
awesome so

585
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,520
stephen with a raised hand then shannon

586
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,600
or blue welcome and anyone else in the

587
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,399
live chat of course

588
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,120
yeah just uh also

589
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,600
this this idea of the folk psychology

590
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,840
and i agree with your point about

591
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,559
interdisciplinarity and it's i think

592
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,159
it's really interesting is how the

593
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,280
experts perceptions of the world then

594
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,960
gets translated into a folk publication

595
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,080
which then becomes the kind of landscape

596
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,080
which pretty much everyone then

597
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,360
starts to

598
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,440
incorporate and one one that i found

599
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,640
really interesting with active

600
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,840
inferences i was looking back at pre uh

601
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,960
older

602
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
ideas of vision

603
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,200
before they discovered the retina and

604
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,960
the image on the retina

605
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,280
and they actually thought of the eye as

606
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,440
projecting out and sort of feeling the

607
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,400
world if you go back like 500 years

608
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,360
and then

609
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,600
we were told by the experts how it is

610
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,520
with the retina and the image projected

611
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,600
like a camera so then folk psychology

612
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,960
moved to that

613
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,960
or folk perceptions move to that because

614
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,039
the experts said that but actually it

615
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,799
turns out that the original folk

616
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,880
psychology or the original perception is

617
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,400
actually more accurate now that we're

618
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,200
looking at circades and

619
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,880
uh all of that so this is an interesting

620
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,520
what is folk and what's expert and where

621
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,320
does it come from

622
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,159
absolutely

623
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,159
it's a it's a both and because it's not

624
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,720
like the retina emits the photons that

625
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,120
it then senses back it's not doing echo

626
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,240
location

627
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,840
but there is

628
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,840
a tale of two densities there's a

629
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,240
generative model and a recognition model

630
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,440
and there's a process that's a

631
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,280
conversation which we're going to get to

632
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,080
with

633
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,480
users and resources distinction so it's

634
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,559
like there is that bi-directional

635
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,960
conversation and then if this direction

636
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,720
is folk and then that direction is

637
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,080
expert

638
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,320
in certain social contexts which

639
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,720
direction is going to be prioritized as

640
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,799
an explanation and the other direction

641
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,120
is going to be seen as a counter current

642
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,799
literally going against the stream

643
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,919
mainstream

644
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,280
so

645
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,080
how does pluralism allow us to recognize

646
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,799
both directions in that case yes stephen

647
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,120
yeah that's a good point daniel um that

648
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,200
that i do a bi-directional and one

649
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,440
question i i wonder sometimes

650
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,280
i often work i'm i'm sort of connected

651
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,960
to people who are i'm seen in the world

652
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,039
of coaching and psychology as well in a

653
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,960
ways

654
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,520
and the arts where these things like

655
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,840
bayesian brains sort of did come through

656
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,400
there about 10 years ago but in a very

657
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,440
but it's it's normally come from

658
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,440
research which has been interpreted into

659
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,840
a book by someone from that field which

660
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,440
then gets pic which is still quite

661
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,679
technical which interpreted by someone

662
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,679
into something else and

663
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,000
by the time it's rolled down

664
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,480
into some other areas

665
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,240
um

666
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,799
these notions can be quite

667
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,919
quite watered down you know um so yeah

668
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:54,720
this

669
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,440
this question about how to

670
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,840
you know have that conversation

671
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,240
when some of the stuff is quite

672
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,799
cutting edge from even people in the the

673
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,559
fields themselves

674
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,880
um and how to get it used in the real

675
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,919
world is is a big one

676
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,640
absolutely very true so dave with a

677
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,200
raised hand and then anyone else

678
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,799
i think it's in the panda's thumb where

679
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,320
um

680
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,120
there's a rather exasperated essay about

681
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,919
how you'll have an innovator and if he's

682
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,679
really lucky he'll have a few people

683
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,039
that work with him that fill in the gap

684
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,039
but typically and

685
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,559
typically they don't he doesn't even

686
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,640
have one level of competence it just

687
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,559
immediately goes into the full press and

688
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,200
becomes just a complete mush with all

689
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,159
the

690
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,960
almost all the original valid insights

691
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,480
just

692
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,400
buried under

693
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,440
full foolishness

694
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,679
possible so i guess just we paused on

695
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:58,559
this

696
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,320
slide because this concept of

697
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,200
individuality is a central one here and

698
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,679
we mentioned a few of these different

699
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:06,880
uh

700
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,600
ways of looking at individuality and

701
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,080
kind of contrasted pluralism the idea

702
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,799
that multiple perspectives can co-exist

703
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,360
and that that's okay versus i guess

704
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,840
absolutism or modernism that one of

705
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,480
these or some other unlisted criterion

706
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,120
of individuality is like the the broader

707
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,640
category or the right one um what is on

708
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,559
the table with definitions of

709
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,880
individuality like why

710
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,760
would it matter in a technical capacity

711
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,039
or for just all people what what is

712
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,039
being discussed or what matters

713
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,200
depending on how we approach this

714
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,440
question of individuality to matt first

715
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,360
and then to

716
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,720
right i think there are a few things

717
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,120
that we can say why it matters one thing

718
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,480
is that we ha

719
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,360
before we engage in some type of

720
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,520
investigation about a particular type of

721
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,400
phenomenal process

722
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,559
it's quite good to know

723
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,880
how to individuate

724
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,559
what those process what's what are

725
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,559
involved in those processes or what that

726
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,720
process belongs to

727
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,600
uh

728
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,279
the relations between elements in a

729
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,440
network pretty much

730
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,679
right in order to understand

731
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,600
those elements or to locate those

732
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,039
elements we have to have some type of

733
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,919
criterion in order to in order to

734
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,320
actually even think about uh the kind of

735
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,919
larger structure of a network and the

736
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,440
relationships between them and i think

737
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,000
this is biological individuals

738
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,360
uh they they actually play this role

739
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,919
and i'm reminded by

740
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,760
something that uh gregory bateson said

741
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,039
right

742
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,919
that in order to actually understand

743
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,919
what the mind is

744
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,440
we have to actually understand how to

745
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,679
delineate things with minds

746
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,240
but those delineations are going to be

747
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,480
completely dependent upon

748
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,840
uh the the processes that we're studying

749
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,880
right

750
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,559
those delineations are going to actually

751
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,880
involve the processes that we're like so

752
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,039
it's going to be a process dependent or

753
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,559
a phenomenal dependent individuation

754
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,000
and that doesn't say that doesn't mean

755
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
that uh

756
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,760
these kind of individuals are going to

757
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,120
actually uh

758
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,600
they might contrast or conflict with one

759
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,080
another in any type of logical matter

760
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,399
but it's just putting in place as a type

761
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,679
of pragmatism in terms of uh where we

762
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,600
delineate things and i think biological

763
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,200
individuals provide us with a manner of

764
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,919
talking about for example specific

765
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,919
phenomena now if we're talking about

766
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,080
replication we're talking about for

767
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,760
example competition

768
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,159
uh with respect to something like

769
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,520
replication

770
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,200
then we might want to actually focus on

771
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,960
darwinian individuals however if we're

772
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,360
talking about the evolution of cognition

773
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,200
or we're talking about the evolution of

774
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,360
multicellularity or these major

775
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,600
transitions in evolution we might want

776
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,799
to think about individuals in a

777
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,039
different way

778
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,360
so that's that's that's what i think

779
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,520
thank you matt blue and then shannon

780
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,919
so hi matt it's nice to meet you i love

781
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,720
this paper found it super um inspiring

782
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,840
and um you know i think that the concept

783
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,919
of an individual um

784
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,159
is closely related to

785
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,279
maybe the concept of autonomy and also

786
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,840
the concept of emergence

787
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,039
and so

788
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,960
as and especially

789
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,640
i mean it's also of course related to

790
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,960
the concept of a cognizer

791
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,159
but but

792
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,840
cognizer aside

793
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,640
the

794
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,159
so i've heard a lot of definitions

795
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,640
thrown around and an individual

796
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,480
um i liked in the paper how you

797
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,640
described emergence with the circular

798
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,360
causation because that like echoes a lot

799
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,279
of um i mean it's the the information

800
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,279
theory of internet individuality paper

801
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,760
by um krakauer and that group and it

802
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,600
just echoes a lot of i mean what's

803
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,399
required

804
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,440
for

805
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,480
an individual so i i just i'm thinking

806
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,080
about um

807
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,640
autonomy and and it's one of the things

808
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,440
that

809
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,320
um i mean it depends how you define it

810
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
and in like the artificial intelligence

811
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,480
world there's no such thing as an

812
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,520
autonomous system i mean i mean

813
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,240
really we program in whether we want it

814
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
to learn whatever it wants to do but i

815
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,640
mean they just don't little baby robots

816
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,559
aren't just set free with no goal

817
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,360
there's always a self-directed or a

818
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,760
human directed goal kind of programmed

819
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,480
into this system or maybe i'm wrong

820
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,080
maybe there's examples where it's we

821
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,399
just create robots for for fun or or

822
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,159
artificial intelligence just to create

823
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,520
it but

824
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,200
like an artificial intelligence system

825
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,279
doesn't really have that same autonomy

826
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,600
or at least i don't think about it and

827
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,440
so i just i'm kind of curious as to

828
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,919
you know in the paper you kind of hint

829
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,039
it out or i don't know if you said

830
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,320
explicitly i was kind of flipping

831
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,399
through looking for a quote but you know

832
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,159
you hinted at like maybe a

833
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,480
cell doesn't also doesn't have that same

834
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,240
kind of autonomy

835
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,960
and

836
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,679
like so i i um

837
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,480
i i want to challenge that

838
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,360
so

839
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,520
in in terms of active inference and the

840
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,520
fvp like i think about it always as a

841
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,799
skill-free architecture and a continuum

842
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:19,840
and so

843
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,080
why is a cell not autonomous but an

844
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,559
organism is or maybe an organ is is an

845
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,399
organ autonomous or where do you draw

846
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,720
the line and why are you making a line

847
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,960
in the sand around

848
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,360
a system like that

849
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,840
fantastic question and uh i agree with

850
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,000
you i agree with you that's one of the

851
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
things in the paper that i think that i

852
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
pushed i did draw a line i didn't try to

853
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
draw a line that was too

854
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,520
deep in the sand

855
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,279
uh and i think in one of the footnotes i

856
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,360
do say something like okay well i'm not

857
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,679
suggesting that a mitochondria

858
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:54,960
is going to be something that's

859
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,880
non-autonomous

860
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,000
uh

861
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,279
however

862
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,399
autonomy is something that also varies

863
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,399
in degree

864
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,080
that i think a certain level there's a

865
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,000
certain level of autonomy

866
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,320
uh that it's going to be

867
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,279
uh

868
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,399
providers that provide a a different

869
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,840
degree of of i say degrees of freedom

870
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,200
with which

871
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,039
some system can interact with its

872
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,799
environment in ways

873
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,279
uh and that integra that environment

874
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,159
provides perturbations

875
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,679
uh enough perturbations enough kind of

876
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,039
uh

877
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,200
enough surprise

878
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,480
such that that

879
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,399
that whatever that system is

880
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,799
has various strategies

881
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,720
uh it has to have various strategies

882
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,320
behavioral strategies or we can talk

883
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,320
about this in terms of active inference

884
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,559
uh and in order to actually

885
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,799
adapt to that particular environment now

886
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,799
i'm not this this gets us into this

887
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,320
notion of adaptive active inference

888
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,679
versus

889
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,279
uh kind of like

890
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,080
the non-adaptive active inference

891
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,240
and i think the way that michael and

892
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,480
julian have thought about if i'm not

893
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,080
mistaken i have thought about uh

894
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,000
adaptive active environments is that it

895
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,159
is based on a certain level a certain

896
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,120
degree of autonomy and with respect to

897
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,080
cells

898
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,600
you know

899
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,760
i agree i do agree with you

900
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,480
cells do have a certain level of

901
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,320
autonomy however

902
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,159
cells are again

903
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,880
dependent upon other cells

904
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,640
uh in a way that

905
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,960
other systems other more autonomous

906
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,519
systems aren't dependent now you'll say

907
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,880
of course we're dependent upon our

908
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,600
environments we have to have oxygen

909
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,960
there are certain constraints in our

910
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,440
environments that we have to um

911
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,120
we really have to kind of like our

912
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,559
environments have to be a certain way so

913
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,480
we are dependent upon our environments

914
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,480
but it's it's the distinction i think

915
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,360
between

916
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,720
being dependent upon other systems

917
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,600
uh and cells for example bodily cells

918
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,240
are dependent upon other cells uh not

919
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,760
only uh say that plasma but other cells

920
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,799
in order to actually maintain themselves

921
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:07,919
but i think there's a difference in

922
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,320
degree so that's that's that's and i

923
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,840
shouldn't again i should impress upon

924
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,279
that this idea that i'm not saying that

925
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,559
cells are not uh autonomous

926
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,240
but most certainly i think there's a

927
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,159
there's a difference in degree and that

928
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,200
difference in degree does uh does matter

929
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,000
uh cells might eat cells might even be

930
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,360
cognitive to a certain degree and this

931
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,720
is something that some someone like mike

932
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,279
11 michael levin suggests and i and i

933
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,399
agree with him

934
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,840
uh

935
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,840
but i suppose the notion about

936
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,120
adaptivity uh

937
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,640
there's a degree of addictivity that

938
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,799
comes along with us uh the emergence of

939
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,279
a certain kind of uh degree amount of

940
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,000
degrees of freedom

941
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,480
so cells are dependent on other cells

942
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,799
but aren't humans dependent on other

943
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,120
humans i mean we're born as an infant

944
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,360
and completely reliant upon our parents

945
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,200
to provide everything for us for many

946
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,919
many many years and and even as adults i

947
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,840
mean still we don't exist in a bubble i

948
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,240
mean perhaps we can go off to a cave and

949
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,800
exist in isolation but but i think

950
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,199
humans are dependent on other humans as

951
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,079
well

952
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,040
so maybe it's a degree of dependence or

953
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,719
not or

954
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,480
i mean i i really feel like there's a

955
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,199
continuum here even in terms of adaptive

956
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,879
active inference and mere active

957
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,480
inference i mean and i fall in with mike

958
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,520
levin in

959
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,560
in a lot of the ways that i think so

960
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,800
yeah yeah i i think i think that's right

961
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,079
i do think that's right i think there's

962
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,000
a distinction to be made also though

963
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,159
between kind of uh

964
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,000
developmental dependence

965
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,719
uh and homeostatic dependence

966
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,839
right and

967
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,760
and i think homeosta developmental

968
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,239
dependence can have an effect on

969
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,960
homeostasis homeostasis

970
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,320
most certainly

971
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,480
but those are two things that

972
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,280
might not actually uh always always

973
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,800
overlap and uh for example sure

974
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,119
we as humans absolutely we have a long

975
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,040
developmental period in which we're

976
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,440
absolutely dependent upon our parents or

977
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,280
being reared by some other human or some

978
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,400
other animal

979
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
absolutely and that happens that when we

980
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,280
actually

981
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,000
uh when we when we get older we probably

982
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,560
are dependent also i absolutely agree

983
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,520
with that

984
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,839
but there isn't any kind of development

985
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,599
with a cell

986
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,760
that can be mapped on to

987
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,440
uh dependence or non-dependence it's

988
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,400
always dependent

989
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,240
thanks matt shannon

990
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,000
that actually uh flows really well into

991
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,400
my question blue that um i know your

992
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
paper you specifically say we might want

993
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,320
to talk about humans or groups of humans

994
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,480
but we're not going to in this paper

995
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,040
um but i'm going to ask about humans

996
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,839
and so when you're talking about um

997
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,280
this

998
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,320
this

999
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,599
squid and it's bioluminescence um

1000
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,920
and they form a temporary unit in which

1001
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,880
they are

1002
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,920
together

1003
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,359
an individual

1004
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,560
um and then it sheds the

1005
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,440
the the bioluminescent cells during the

1006
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,880
daytime and then

1007
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,640
they breed again

1008
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,880
afterwards i'm wondering if there is a

1009
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,520
time like a critical time period at

1010
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,640
which

1011
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,040
units would have to be

1012
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,839
uh have

1013
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,440
this symbiotic relationship with each

1014
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,599
other or if there's a necessary strength

1015
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,680
of the coupling or a repetition of how

1016
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,040
many times

1017
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,200
um the organisms need to meet up and if

1018
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,520
that would change for for this

1019
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,560
this animal compared to systems of

1020
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,640
humans because there's a certain way in

1021
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,800
which um the the humans that you

1022
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
interact with in everyday life or if

1023
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,720
you're co-living with someone even your

1024
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,760
metabolic states become co-regulated by

1025
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,079
your sleeping patterns with each other

1026
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,119
or

1027
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,599
stress and hormones between different

1028
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,119
humans are affecting each other when

1029
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,400
you're together

1030
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,079
at a fairly regular

1031
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,400
rate and so i wonder

1032
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,040
if we might define individuality or

1033
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,200
collective slightly differently

1034
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,800
depending on the system we're looking at

1035
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,800
and the type of coupling that's

1036
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,920
occurring

1037
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,280
i think that's a great question chad

1038
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,920
it's absolutely i would i would say yes

1039
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,960
i think this has to be some um obviously

1040
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,079
that you know about the the empirical uh

1041
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,599
literature in terms of kind of

1042
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,880
entrainment

1043
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,079
uh

1044
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,000
and i think this is like that's a really

1045
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,320
good point to make in terms of

1046
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,920
having those types of interactions with

1047
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,920
humans whether or not

1048
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,960
for the for the bobtail and uh vibrio

1049
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,680
uh there's a chance that um

1050
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,440
like out after the vibra actually

1051
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,359
colonized the light organ they're

1052
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,839
typically not taken in again

1053
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,599
uh that once they're expelled they're

1054
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,359
out and they might be taken in by

1055
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,200
another squid or juvenile squid but

1056
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,280
they're but the vibrio that continued to

1057
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,640
colonize are the ones that are left over

1058
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,839
uh and

1059
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,560
it might be the case that the ones that

1060
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,680
uh continue to colonize for that shorter

1061
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,119
period of time

1062
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,400
uh

1063
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,000
might become

1064
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,599
the relationship with the script might

1065
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,040
change to a certain degree but i don't

1066
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,240
know any

1067
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,560
uh any empirical evidence and i'm

1068
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,560
ignorant about this point that suggests

1069
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,400
that's the case but i think that's a

1070
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,640
really good really good question to ask

1071
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,839
a very good question to ask

1072
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,079
so blue and then i'll make a question

1073
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,079
i think dave was first oh yeah go for it

1074
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,000
dave at them

1075
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,599
yeah they're from

1076
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,079
dr alan shore has done some um

1077
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,880
i think controversial but really

1078
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,119
evocative work on

1079
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,680
the formation of the not just the

1080
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,320
personality but actually the neural

1081
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,440
functioning of the newborn in the dyadic

1082
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,560
relation the intimate dialogue with the

1083
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,520
mother

1084
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,640
face play and the rhythm of moving in

1085
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,359
and moving back and

1086
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,240
regulating each of them regulating each

1087
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,200
other's expression of interest and each

1088
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,640
other's degree of involvement

1089
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,200
and at a really different

1090
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,400
scale

1091
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,920
um

1092
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,079
gerald edelman's

1093
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,599
topo biology talks about the cell and

1094
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,599
the tissue as being just so dependent he

1095
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,599
points out look we have almost no

1096
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,839
chromosomes we have almost no genes

1097
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,160
compared to how complex we are where

1098
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,839
does the regulation come from it comes

1099
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:40,640
from adjacent cells adjacent tissues

1100
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:44,240
right thanks steve blue

1101
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,880
so um shannon kind of what she was

1102
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,000
saying about um becoming co-regulated

1103
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,760
say if you live in an environment with

1104
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,520
someone like it's a super nice

1105
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,280
transition to something that i have

1106
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,839
really been wanting to discuss uh in the

1107
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,000
context of this paper which is like okay

1108
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
you become co-regulated with someone

1109
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,760
that you're roommates with and and

1110
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,839
co-regulated perhaps by the environment

1111
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,839
but also perhaps by the microbes that

1112
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,000
live in our environment right so there's

1113
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,520
like the entire micro microbiome concept

1114
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,640
that is is fundamental and key to humans

1115
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,599
and i don't know i mean i'm not like a a

1116
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,400
huge studier of symbiosis but

1117
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,480
i'm not sure if the microbiome like i

1118
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,720
know we depend on a healthy microbiome i

1119
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,040
mean for healthy like brain function and

1120
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,119
you know just regulation of our own

1121
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,319
internal like uh metabolism and so forth

1122
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:35,760
and so

1123
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,520
is that a symbiosis

1124
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,160
or not um also like the concept of the

1125
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,319
holobionts which is like introduced by

1126
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,000
fields 11 if you've read that paper

1127
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,079
they're the scale free biology paper i

1128
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:46,800
mean

1129
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,640
it is like to what

1130
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,319
and that they they talk about um

1131
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,960
physiological individuality there as

1132
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,680
well so is that symbiosis is it not is

1133
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,839
symbiosis it's also a spectrum or is it

1134
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,960
like a you know a discrete category of

1135
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,119
things and i also think about like

1136
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,359
symbiogenic viruses

1137
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:06,720
which like you know the very early

1138
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,880
viruses that it's like you know

1139
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,720
effectively like instantiating

1140
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,599
speciation right like the viruses insert

1141
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,359
into the genome and you know developing

1142
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,200
species and so forth and and it's

1143
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,920
beneficial to the virus and the host

1144
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,760
right so so anyway i just wonder like

1145
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,240
what are your thoughts on that or or or

1146
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,920
um if you have any insight there

1147
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,680
absolutely that's again a wonderful

1148
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,160
question boo um with respect to kind of

1149
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,000
symbiosis i think there's some there's

1150
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,960
been

1151
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,520
some work on that and some very i think

1152
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,599
uh convincing work done by queller and

1153
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,280
strassman

1154
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,319
uh

1155
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:44,640
who suggests a particular type of xy

1156
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,599
locating symbiosis on uh kind of an axis

1157
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,200
pretty much so you have uh cooperation

1158
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,560
i believe on one part of the axis i have

1159
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,079
to have to look it up again actually i

1160
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,640
should look that up um

1161
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,119
but it's uh you have varying degrees of

1162
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,800
symbiosis

1163
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,000
uh and again symbiosis in the in the

1164
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,599
particular paper that we're discussing

1165
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,760
now i've concentrated on mutualisms but

1166
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,319
you have various forms of symbiosis uh

1167
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,319
that i think you've actually pointed out

1168
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,480
previously uh that can be kind of

1169
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,599
modeled

1170
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,160
quite well with kind of game theoretic

1171
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,560
uh and this is going to be is going to

1172
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,480
rain from parasitism

1173
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,680
to uh communalism to kind of um kind of

1174
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,359
mutualisms

1175
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,560
and i think like these are all again

1176
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,839
degrees and these degrees can change

1177
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,160
uh there have been quite a many theories

1178
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,920
i suppose and i think squadron strassman

1179
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,000
have also suggested this that uh

1180
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,960
depending upon the condition of a system

1181
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,680
uh with respect to another system say

1182
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,560
their symbiotes a parasite can turn into

1183
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,640
a mutual a parasitic parasitic

1184
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,319
relationship can turn into a mutualism

1185
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,160
and vice versa

1186
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,240
so these things move these types of

1187
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,800
things move uh and if you think about

1188
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,040
this is an automatic thing that we can

1189
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,359
even apply this kind of cellular biology

1190
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:04,960
when you think about something like the

1191
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,960
the origin of cancer

1192
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,839
right

1193
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:09,040
when you have

1194
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,720
cancerous cells

1195
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,240
uh

1196
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,160
they're they've actually grown within a

1197
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,680
host

1198
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,839
right they're part of a body

1199
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,720
uh but end up being some type of

1200
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,560
competitor

1201
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,400
and i think this is quite interesting to

1202
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,240
think about this it's like through the

1203
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,920
lens of symbiosis obviously it's it's

1204
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,000
not that's that's not a symbiosis but we

1205
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
can use symbiosis to kind of think about

1206
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,880
that

1207
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,680
uh

1208
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,520
but with respect to kind of

1209
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,920
uh thinking about

1210
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,240
host cells and parasites our whole cells

1211
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,000
and mutualisms

1212
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,920
uh there's like

1213
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,520
there's there's many many different

1214
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,119
kinds of ways

1215
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,640
areas of the spectrum that one can

1216
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,599
actually analyze uh our relationship

1217
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,880
with our own cells and our relationships

1218
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,079
with uh with micro microbiota microbiota

1219
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,480
like scott gilbert obviously you know

1220
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,440
and scott's work is is quite incredible

1221
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,960
he's the one i believe who introduced

1222
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,839
the notion of the hollow biome

1223
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,240
the hubble genome excuse me in halloween

1224
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,240
and uh

1225
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,640
i think this this notion about uh hollow

1226
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,800
buoyant is specifically

1227
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,000
uh

1228
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,240
it includes symbiosis but includes

1229
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,119
actually a kind of community

1230
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,119
a particular kind of community of

1231
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,800
various systems

1232
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,599
uh that themselves qualify as one system

1233
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,079
can qualify as one system or having you

1234
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,760
know if you would put it in a different

1235
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,319
way they they create a stable state

1236
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:38,800
right a steady state themselves

1237
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,720
and uh one that's kind of resistant to

1238
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,400
perturbation

1239
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,599
uh and

1240
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:44,880
that's that's the matter in which i

1241
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,240
think it's like it's it's a very easy

1242
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,400
matter in which i can think of uh

1243
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,119
the

1244
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,680
blind as as an individual

1245
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,240
uh whether or not one wants to call

1246
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,359
two

1247
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,520
two symbiotic say symbiotic uh systems

1248
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,400
um

1249
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,480
that are in a mutualistic relationship a

1250
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,319
hollow bond that's another question but

1251
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,560
i think typically it's been applied to

1252
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,599
um more than two systems

1253
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,040
thank you matt

1254
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,160
so for

1255
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,839
shannon's questions about you know the

1256
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:17,040
co-regulation and humans and trust it

1257
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,400
made me think about how

1258
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,400
one-off games

1259
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,240
lead to kind of community or

1260
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,560
population-like game theory whereas

1261
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,440
repeated games over evolutionary time

1262
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,119
like in the case of the squid and the

1263
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,839
vibrio or in the case of the eu social

1264
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,040
insects that leads to

1265
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,319
organismal-like dynamics and then what

1266
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,400
you just described and what um levin

1267
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,079
also got at in the paper is the

1268
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,359
breakdown

1269
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,200
of for example organismality into

1270
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,119
population of cell versus population of

1271
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,680
cell dynamics so it's absolutely um a

1272
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,160
cool framework and then also a really

1273
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,560
important part on figure four

1274
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,359
is you have the peak of integration and

1275
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,760
then greeting serval

1276
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,520
the peak of integration

1277
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,400
um and then that's the y-axis so it's

1278
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,000
like instead of saying we're gonna say

1279
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
which organisms are tall or short out

1280
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,839
there in the world it's like you do the

1281
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,839
population level survey and they range

1282
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,480
from you know two to four feet and you

1283
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,240
say okay it's in the upper 50th

1284
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,760
percentile it's tall like we're

1285
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,280
renormalizing

1286
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,839
our comparison stick to

1287
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,720
the maximum integration of the squid

1288
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,400
bacteria so we're not comparing it to

1289
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,520
some other system we're re-normalizing

1290
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,520
and we're able to have a system-specific

1291
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,079
understanding here it's relatively more

1292
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,560
integrated here it's relatively less

1293
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,960
it's a second question whether the peak

1294
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,240
of integration of the squid and the

1295
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,200
vibrio is like the integration of some

1296
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,800
computer program with another computer

1297
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,119
program maybe it's apples and oranges

1298
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,720
maybe we'll have the right framework

1299
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,800
that allows us to transmute apples and

1300
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,400
oranges but here you can just relativize

1301
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,000
to the system itself and that's like

1302
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,520
very specific and powerful

1303
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,400
so stephen with a raised hand and then

1304
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,960
anyone else

1305
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,440
yeah

1306
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,880
i'll give you a chance to get a breath

1307
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,800
because we've thrown a lot at you but um

1308
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,040
the you mentioned allostatic and

1309
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,680
homeostatic forces if i imagine there's

1310
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,400
the the so the so you've got that

1311
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,680
difference there between something

1312
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,319
trying to maintain or trying to try to

1313
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,480
move forward and change

1314
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,359
um

1315
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,920
and i'm interested in in how that

1316
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,000
reflects um

1317
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,160
so for instance i suppose you could have

1318
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,079
within a set of cells you could have

1319
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,040
some cells or some

1320
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,800
organs you know trying to maintain

1321
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,720
homeostasis and others

1322
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,720
say even maybe a parasite is trying to

1323
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,240
anaesthetically

1324
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,440
enter that world and create a niche for

1325
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,559
itself

1326
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,839
um and i think that that that

1327
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,359
question about

1328
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:56,240
you know

1329
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,000
that that balance between the two is a

1330
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,640
useful divide or a useful way to think

1331
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,119
about the same

1332
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:04,880
cell and of course in cells they change

1333
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,559
to become different types of cells so

1334
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,400
that's something that

1335
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,960
whole organisms have less ability to be

1336
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,359
completely

1337
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,520
completely different types of organisms

1338
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,319
you know they can't um you are what you

1339
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,640
are i suppose that's one defining thing

1340
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,960
about but you can still change your

1341
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,079
focus from homeostasis to allostasis i

1342
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,880
think that is quite common and i wonder

1343
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,240
what your thoughts are around that um

1344
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,640
and how that that itself could be a

1345
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,920
useful

1346
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,720
way to frame things

1347
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,880
that's really interesting

1348
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,359
uh the the man in which i'm looking at

1349
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:47,040
kind of a homeostasis uh and uh kind of

1350
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,119
coupling of homeostatic regulatory

1351
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,599
systems to allocate regulatory systems

1352
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,520
is based upon kind of

1353
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,839
a more traditional idea that homeostasis

1354
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:57,680
might be considered more reaction or

1355
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,800
reactive

1356
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,599
where allostasis is anticipatory

1357
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:04,400
right and then allostasis takes a

1358
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,000
particular form it's quite interesting

1359
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,480
with respect to in the context of active

1360
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,079
inference because we talk about expected

1361
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,920
free energy minimization

1362
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,760
and this is something that uh one can

1363
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,359
tie together with the notion valley

1364
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,559
stasis

1365
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:17,680
um

1366
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,119
where

1367
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:20,960
uh and when you start to think about

1368
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,520
kind of homeostatically coupled systems

1369
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,800
one system

1370
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,800
uh with respect to kind of symbiotic

1371
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,960
systems might be playing a kind of a

1372
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,880
larger rule uh and being able to make

1373
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,720
further and further of being able to

1374
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,240
make inferences further and further into

1375
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,440
the future and i think this is something

1376
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,119
that you've you've suggested you've

1377
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,599
looked at previously actually on a slide

1378
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,119
uh mike levin's cone slide that blue

1379
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,359
and daniel actually had up previously

1380
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,359
and i think this is a quite interesting

1381
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,599
manner of thinking about

1382
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,839
uh kind of a transition

1383
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:56,000
perhaps we've always been allostatic

1384
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,839
systems living systems have always been

1385
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:01,359
had certain of certain uh capacity to

1386
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,040
anticipate

1387
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,280
however when we start putting systems

1388
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,800
together

1389
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,280
we have a larger capacity or more

1390
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,800
capacity to anticipate further and

1391
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,160
further in the future and i think one of

1392
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,640
the dimensions on this particular cone

1393
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,640
is this dimension of alice like a kind

1394
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,559
of outstanding control

1395
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,559
uh this is this is my interpretation of

1396
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,880
michael's work uh and

1397
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,640
i think this is that's very important

1398
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,160
and again you'll see that there's that

1399
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,280
kind of

1400
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,000
balancing that if one is

1401
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,839
given a type of approximate bayesian

1402
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:34,079
inference that's going to be uh you know

1403
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,640
what we suggest is going on uh you have

1404
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,800
to actually balance this with priors

1405
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,559
which are going to be respective to the

1406
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,960
past so you have another type uh another

1407
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,480
axis on the cone

1408
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,400
and as these things expand sometimes the

1409
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,640
past is going to uh be a bit deeper on

1410
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,880
the cone than than the than the future

1411
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,119
but out of stasis is on on the top there

1412
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,599
and i think that like with

1413
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,079
with multicellularity

1414
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:59,440
with uh

1415
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,880
with kind of

1416
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,920
uh the interactions more interactions

1417
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,079
perhaps you will see a capacity a larger

1418
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:08,480
capacity to go upwards

1419
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,400
and in the kind of future oriented

1420
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,400
direction

1421
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,480
and this is this is something again

1422
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,440
uh and i i appreciate blues bringing

1423
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,839
this out this is this is uh something

1424
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:22,160
that's again a matter of degree it's not

1425
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,400
a it's not a it's not a line that's cut

1426
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,760
it's a matter of degree

1427
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,559
right

1428
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:27,680
and so

1429
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,559
uh

1430
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,200
just simply we know that there's certain

1431
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,400
types of

1432
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,119
uh microorganisms that that do

1433
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:36,559
anticipate

1434
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,440
that do like right uh and

1435
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,599
uh this is kind of outward anticipatory

1436
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,960
behavior whether it's i think it's going

1437
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,160
to be uh

1438
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,319
phaser and polycephalum which is uh the

1439
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:47,280
kind of

1440
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,200
plasmodium slime mold

1441
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,240
uh various experiments in 2011

1442
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,559
uh had suggested that you know

1443
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,559
uh fuzzerum can actually

1444
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,079
anticipate

1445
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,400
various periodic uh bouts of dryness

1446
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,599
this this type of thing this is an

1447
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,520
outward periodic behavior an outward

1448
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,280
anticipatory behavior

1449
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,720
uh

1450
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,359
that's not to say that anticipation is

1451
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:14,160
not happening occurring prior to that in

1452
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,240
the internal dynamics of systems that's

1453
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,480
just an uh kind of an outward

1454
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,119
manner of kind of measuring it

1455
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,920
um

1456
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,160
again i i do think that this like it's

1457
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,440
it's a quite important notion allostasis

1458
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,800
uh and

1459
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,400
it's perhaps all systems again i i would

1460
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,119
be

1461
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,160
safe

1462
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,920
at least my position now is that all

1463
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,680
systems are pretty much allostatic

1464
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,240
systems uh that kind of enslave

1465
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,720
homeostatic regulatory systems

1466
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,960
uh to maneuver

1467
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,720
and

1468
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,319
invest their

1469
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,319
metabolic machinery and metabolic

1470
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:51,760
capacities

1471
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,720
uh to a particular type of

1472
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,319
uh state that perhaps they haven't

1473
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:58,160
reached yet considering

1474
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,839
uh you know a manner of of trying to

1475
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:05,520
kind of avoid perturbation

1476
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,640
thank you

1477
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,599
matt very similar to mere adaptive

1478
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,680
inference being more homeostatic more

1479
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,520
like the ball just in the bottom of the

1480
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,200
bowl and then increasingly anticipatory

1481
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,079
rosen's ecology adaptive

1482
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,240
active inference stephen go for it

1483
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,119
yeah this this ties in actually i'm a

1484
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,839
lot of work around um coaching funny

1485
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,559
enough the world of coaching and um

1486
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,839
team coaching is like and team coaching

1487
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,319
so and i think this also brings in you

1488
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:41,280
know these other types of clusters

1489
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,800
groups

1490
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,480
symbiotic

1491
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,880
um relationships beyond maybe what we

1492
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,920
might just think of as a system you know

1493
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,240
so the idea of a team

1494
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,000
um in a as a

1495
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,480
in a systemic context

1496
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,440
um is really interesting because

1497
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,720
they

1498
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,119
and this might be how allostasis in a

1499
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,079
social context starts to enable that

1500
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,400
larger horizon so each

1501
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,960
even allostasis is sort of stasis and

1502
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,400
then

1503
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,520
working together you may start to break

1504
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,160
your own need for stasis you know and it

1505
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,200
just

1506
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,920
becomes some other organization and i

1507
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,839
think it'd be really interesting and

1508
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:25,359
looking at how

1509
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:27,920
the way that team coaching either for

1510
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,839
performance because there's performance

1511
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,520
orientated team coaching or there's

1512
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,319
developmental orientated team coaching

1513
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:37,040
but that idea of and then the enabling

1514
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,480
context

1515
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,480
becomes what we would call the

1516
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,640
ecological niche i suppose

1517
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,760
becomes

1518
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,880
um

1519
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,240
as much the focus of attention

1520
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,880
as the system in that makes if that

1521
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,720
makes sense and i think this this might

1522
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,880
tie into what you're saying

1523
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,520
thanks steven so dave i know that you

1524
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,760
had a little bit to share but i'll just

1525
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,119
bring up one

1526
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,200
point related to this definitions of

1527
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,119
individuality and then several anything

1528
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:06,480
you want to ask feel free to raise your

1529
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,680
hand

1530
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,559
we hear a lot of terms like autonomous

1531
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,960
and self-organizing which sort of

1532
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,960
highlight the um

1533
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,200
ability to cleanly partition a system

1534
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,720
like people will say the embryo it's a

1535
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,880
classic self-organizing system

1536
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,400
right except for the context of the womb

1537
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,799
and so there's sort of on one hand the

1538
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:29,520
desire to individuate and partition and

1539
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,680
look at agentic systems agent-based

1540
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,920
modeling autonomous and self-organizing

1541
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,559
and then that is critiqued by

1542
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,319
the ecological perspective or the

1543
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:40,720
relational perspective so there's sort

1544
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,720
of a dialectic between like it's all

1545
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,240
individuals all the way down and it's

1546
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,319
all relationships all the way down we

1547
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:49,280
see that debate in particle physics

1548
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,040
we understand it less than we might some

1549
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,480
of the biological systems are in a

1550
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,119
different way but it's um like two

1551
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,520
pillars that we're navigating between

1552
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,280
and it is a continuum

1553
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,040
in between so that's why it's such a

1554
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,480
nice discussion

1555
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,640
so dave if you're around

1556
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,720
um feel free to um any time you're ready

1557
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,160
you can go for the conversation theory

1558
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,359
otherwise blue go for it

1559
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,599
okay sure um now slide yeah slides 18-19

1560
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,760
we inserted that into the slide show

1561
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,839
that we prepared for dr sims

1562
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:21,119
presentation

1563
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,960
and these slides bring in some matters

1564
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,599
that he doesn't address in his paper so

1565
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,240
to justify that but not to paraphrase

1566
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,160
the insertions

1567
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,839
the free energy principle and active

1568
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:33,839
inference jointly constitute a

1569
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:37,280
relatively mature macro level framework

1570
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,599
for describing living psychological and

1571
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:43,119
other complex self-stabilizing systems

1572
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:46,240
as of the moment no comparably mature

1573
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,799
micro level framework has been both

1574
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:52,559
proposed for and coordinated with this

1575
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:55,119
macro level of analysis

1576
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,040
i suggest that the basis for such a

1577
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,119
needed micro level framework was

1578
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,880
proposed by my teacher the late

1579
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,160
cybernetics

1580
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,799
professor gordon pasque of brunel

1581
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:07,839
university in the form of conversation

1582
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,520
theory

1583
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,680
matt's essay how to count biological

1584
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,079
minds considers the puzzle of whether an

1585
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,000
individual can come into existence and

1586
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,760
pass out of in existence repeatedly

1587
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,160
that's account of this puzzle and please

1588
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,839
excuse me if i stray from over

1589
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:26,960
simplification into parity his solution

1590
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,400
in terms of degrees of integration

1591
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,559
is a perfectly acceptable insightful

1592
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:33,599
account

1593
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:36,400
at a macro or molar

1594
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,280
level

1595
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,520
the metaphors of quantity and elsewhere

1596
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,640
probability nicely express falsifiable

1597
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,040
common sense attributes of real-world

1598
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,880
processes

1599
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,040
but if one states this paradox the

1600
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,599
paradox of emergent but transient

1601
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,760
individuals in terms of conversation

1602
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,359
theory then one speaks of a conversation

1603
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:59,200
recurring over time

1604
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,079
between the same conversants

1605
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,400
this terminology makes the proposal more

1606
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,960
intuitive less shocking and more readily

1607
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,200
assimilable for readers

1608
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,920
better yet familiar ideas attention

1609
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,319
rhythm of discourse punctuation of a

1610
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:17,119
conversation through understandings or

1611
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,920
through agreements to disagree they all

1612
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,400
play their roles

1613
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,480
now what place would be occupied by the

1614
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,559
special disciplines that have enjoyed

1615
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,720
detailed treatment by conversation

1616
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,200
theory as a micro theory

1617
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,520
during his career professor pask carried

1618
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,520
out an array of experiments studying

1619
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,359
human learning of complex subject

1620
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:39,440
matters configurations using

1621
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,440
configurations of software and hardware

1622
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,520
to administer and collect data from

1623
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,760
those experiments and develop a

1624
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,400
vocabulary allowing elegant description

1625
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,640
and restatement of the results of those

1626
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,160
experiments

1627
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,720
moreover he developed a theory of micro

1628
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,280
level learning teaching

1629
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,680
as a single literally irreducible

1630
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,599
complex of activities

1631
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,520
regardless of whether they were realized

1632
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,240
by living organisms by machinery or by

1633
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,400
complexes of those two

1634
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,000
fabrics

1635
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,400
i see many deep and broad analogies

1636
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,480
between conversation theory and active

1637
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,520
inference

1638
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,920
each addresses important aspects of real

1639
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,160
world phenomena that assist in a

1640
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,680
systematic way

1641
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,240
such that each treats of matters that

1642
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,280
are not so well handled by the other

1643
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,799
i believe that active inference and

1644
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,799
conversation theory can enrich and

1645
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:32,400
streamline each other

1646
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,760
by carving natural science scholarship

1647
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,960
closer to its joints

1648
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,960
very nice

1649
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,760
thank you dave so maybe matt any

1650
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,440
thoughts on that and then we'll go to

1651
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,559
blue

1652
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,160
i have to say i have to say that i'm

1653
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,440
absolutely

1654
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,160
uh the

1655
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,680
the cybernetic theory that i've

1656
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,520
concentrated upon have been most

1657
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,200
influenced by

1658
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,680
uh it's it's very limited

1659
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,680
and conversational theory it's i'm

1660
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,520
absolutely interested in seeing

1661
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,480
uh

1662
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,319
more of this more of this

1663
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:08,640
i suppose analysis and understanding

1664
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,240
more of this analysis so i'm quite

1665
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,839
ignorant about conversation theory and

1666
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:13,599
it's like he most certainly piqued my

1667
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:14,880
interest

1668
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,559
um

1669
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,559
yeah let me let me

1670
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,640
think about this for a few minutes i'm

1671
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,160
still kind of internalizing what you've

1672
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,000
just said

1673
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,559
yep and one note on the conversation a

1674
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,880
lot of times cybernetics falls into that

1675
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,920
individualism mode like it's the one

1676
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,839
self-guided missile it's not the

1677
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:36,000
conversation between the flock of birds

1678
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,480
so cybernetics um isn't just about

1679
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,079
individuals it can be about collectives

1680
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,440
and it was our colleague alex who told

1681
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,839
us um via one of his teachers levinchuk

1682
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:49,520
just yesterday that um cybernetics died

1683
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,440
when it could explain homeostasis but it

1684
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,200
couldn't go beyond

1685
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,960
so we're talking about the transition

1686
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,000
from individuals to collectives

1687
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
and from mere homeostasis to adaptive

1688
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,480
allostasis over developmental and

1689
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,640
evolutionary time scales and so it's

1690
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,799
sort of like you can have homeostatic

1691
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:10,559
individuals

1692
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,280
and then they can have emergence

1693
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,559
towards allostatic collectives

1694
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:19,359
and then what is that

1695
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:21,599
process of emergence

1696
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:23,280
it's a conversation

1697
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,240
or potentially something like that using

1698
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,240
our folk understanding

1699
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:32,400
of interacting pieces which are us

1700
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,640
blue

1701
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,680
so um my question is maybe technical but

1702
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,720
also uh maybe serval has some insight to

1703
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,920
provide as well um so i wanted to ask

1704
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,440
here in the beginning of your paper you

1705
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,480
talk about

1706
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,680
free energy being an additive quantity

1707
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:52,400
so

1708
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,240
the free energy that arises at the macro

1709
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,039
scale is only the free energy that there

1710
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:58,559
is for the ensemble and may be

1711
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:01,119
quantified by summing the free energy

1712
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:03,839
associated with each constituent micro

1713
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:07,039
scale markov blanketed system so

1714
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:09,280
is that true and and like does that

1715
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,160
account for emergence

1716
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,039
because i feel like there has to be some

1717
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,520
like greater free energy minimization

1718
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,359
and so like i i'm not i'm not well

1719
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:21,280
versed in the technical like mathematics

1720
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,119
of the fep um

1721
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:25,359
because i think about you know like

1722
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:27,359
just in terms of the bioluminescence of

1723
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:29,680
vibrio fisheries right right there's

1724
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,920
like a criticality that happens like

1725
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,480
almost like a phase transition that the

1726
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,079
system undergoes to become

1727
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:37,680
bioluminescent like after there's a

1728
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,240
certain concentration of bacteria in the

1729
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,480
light organ and so like does this

1730
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,039
criticality this phase transition does

1731
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:46,559
this not like

1732
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:48,319
to minimize free energy to a greater

1733
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,640
degree like or is it really just the sum

1734
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,799
of its parts

1735
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:54,319
wonderful question really wonderful

1736
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:55,599
question

1737
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:56,720
uh

1738
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,280
i do think that okay there's a might be

1739
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,440
a distinction in terms here in a

1740
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,839
distinction in terms of like what

1741
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:06,319
uh the free energy

1742
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:08,000
uh of

1743
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
the actual constituents

1744
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,480
as a group have

1745
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,720
as an ensemble have

1746
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,720
uh

1747
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:19,839
and a distinction between that for

1748
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:22,319
example and

1749
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:24,160
bioluminescence as a particular type of

1750
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,759
free energy minimizing strategy

1751
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:29,280
uh

1752
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,119
the

1753
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:32,960
it's a i think it's a fantastic question

1754
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,200
i'm getting the the the notion of kind

1755
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,559
of uh

1756
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:38,240
you know the summation of free energy

1757
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,640
from uh palacios

1758
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,160
and aronstead

1759
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,599
uh and

1760
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:45,440
this i think that the pretty much the

1761
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,039
idea is that

1762
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:48,960
i'm not sure if there's going to be any

1763
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,319
well i'd like that maybe i can ask you

1764
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:52,400
blue do you use do you see that there is

1765
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,799
some type of inconsistency between

1766
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:56,079
saying that

1767
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:57,280
uh

1768
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,640
for example

1769
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,839
uh

1770
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:02,000
free energy is going to be an additive

1771
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,440
quantity

1772
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,240
and

1773
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,599
and the fact that there can be some type

1774
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:07,760
of emergent property that is not going

1775
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,760
to be reducible to

1776
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:10,640
uh

1777
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,440
say

1778
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,920
the the constituent relations and and

1779
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,359
the elements

1780
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,799
do you think that there's some type of

1781
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:18,720
uh inconsistency there

1782
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,880
well so i definitely do think that free

1783
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,319
energy across scales is additive like i

1784
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:27,039
i agree with that wholeheartedly but but

1785
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:28,640
i don't think that it reduces to the

1786
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,359
mere sum of the parts

1787
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:33,599
and i mean this also um

1788
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,520
it's the the work the recent work of

1789
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,640
rosas and also eric hole looking at the

1790
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,280
partial information decomposition over

1791
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,280
the um five metric that's used in

1792
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,720
integrated information theory of

1793
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,799
consciousness and so this kind of speaks

1794
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,400
to that there there's

1795
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,000
it has to be some mathematical i mean i

1796
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,760
just feel like i don't know that there

1797
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,280
has to be but i feel like there should

1798
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,760
be some mathematical

1799
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,880
um

1800
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,280
quantification of more so it should be a

1801
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,240
greater degree of free energy reduction

1802
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,720
when the system is more than a sum of

1803
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,799
its parts and so i think that that's an

1804
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:10,480
argument that you make in the paper as

1805
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,200
well that it can't be it's it's not

1806
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,240
reducible to just the component parts so

1807
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,559
is the free energy then just reducible

1808
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:20,880
to the component parts here because that

1809
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,880
to me seems inconsistent

1810
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:23,680
okay

1811
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,480
okay the matter would i think uh

1812
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,319
i i see absolutely see your point no

1813
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,599
matter what i'm thinking about this

1814
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,680
though i said okay well

1815
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,919
uh

1816
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,240
there's a very informative paper by

1817
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,119
santos he's a philosopher he he actually

1818
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:42,000
deals with immersions uh and

1819
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,200
uh and

1820
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,440
it's a really nice way i suppose i

1821
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,200
really like this uh the paper that you

1822
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,200
suggested about kind of using the five

1823
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,400
metric

1824
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,799
uh and various manners in which to like

1825
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:54,480
to do like decom information

1826
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:55,680
decomposition

1827
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:56,799
uh

1828
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:59,200
over various time steps

1829
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,039
uh in order to

1830
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:02,319
think about

1831
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:04,880
some way to some some metric for

1832
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,079
emergence

1833
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:08,079
i think there's been various metrics for

1834
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:10,079
emergence i haven't picked my favorite

1835
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:11,520
metric that's something that i'm still

1836
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,720
getting into

1837
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:13,599
uh

1838
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:14,880
but i think this is it's quite

1839
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,880
interesting to think about okay well

1840
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,960
uh what makes an emergent system is an

1841
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,880
emergency system going to be more than

1842
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:21,680
it's

1843
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:24,000
the kind of relationships and elements

1844
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,440
of a network

1845
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,599
and what makes it so what makes it so

1846
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:28,880
it's going to be the relationships

1847
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,160
themselves or

1848
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,160
or is it going to be something uh the

1849
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,599
combination of the relationships or is

1850
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,039
it going to be the interaction between

1851
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:37,680
the system the emergent system and the

1852
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,599
environment and i think when you start

1853
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,359
thinking about the interactions between

1854
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:43,520
the emergency system and the environment

1855
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:44,960
uh

1856
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,480
there's there's a distinction between

1857
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,079
what free energy is going to be

1858
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:49,520
minimized

1859
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:50,880
uh or

1860
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,160
and the free energy of the system itself

1861
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,960
does that make sense

1862
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,200
is it there's a distinction being made

1863
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,440
uh and perhaps i'm wrong about this

1864
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,559
but

1865
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:04,720
emergence is not something and one of

1866
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,240
the reasons why you have an emergency

1867
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,440
system

1868
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,280
it's going to be for the simple fact

1869
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,720
okay well you have

1870
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,400
uh

1871
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,319
it's not only the interactions of the

1872
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:16,400
parts and the parts or the elements it's

1873
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,599
going to be it's going to be the

1874
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:18,799
interaction

1875
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:21,599
of a particular type of persistent

1876
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:23,280
and i think this is the this is the idea

1877
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,039
you have a persistence

1878
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:27,599
uh with a particular environment or with

1879
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,359
an environment and it's the

1880
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:32,400
perturbations within that environment

1881
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,839
uh that occur along with that system

1882
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:37,440
in which kind of free energy is going to

1883
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,440
be a free energy that might have to be

1884
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,760
minimized is going to arise and i think

1885
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,119
it's like so

1886
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:45,039
um

1887
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:47,680
you might say of course that the the the

1888
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,359
system itself

1889
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:51,280
uh when it has component parts and

1890
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,720
relationships between those component

1891
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:56,240
parts is going to be uh that system can

1892
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,160
be thought about in terms of

1893
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,920
an additive or summation of the free

1894
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,760
energy of the various parts and

1895
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,440
relations in that system but that's

1896
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,480
distinct from that system's engagement

1897
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,240
or interactions with this environment

1898
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:11,760
then you'll have extra free energy

1899
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:12,880
you have an additional amount of free

1900
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,319
energy and maybe that's what that's

1901
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:16,080
that's that's another way a matter of

1902
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,479
thinking about okay well uh and an

1903
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:19,920
emergence

1904
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,520
as measured i don't know if you can

1905
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,880
measure emergence in terms of free

1906
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,000
energy but of course we're going to be

1907
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,279
able to measure it in terms of some type

1908
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:27,520
of mutual information

1909
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,520
very nice thank you that's i think that

1910
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,399
was

1911
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:32,000
a question there i don't know if you can

1912
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,359
measure emergence in terms of free

1913
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,359
energy like you said and you might have

1914
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:36,719
to look at something like mutual

1915
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:38,479
information and i was thinking that

1916
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:39,679
perhaps

1917
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:41,359
the free energy that's minimized by each

1918
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:43,359
individual system

1919
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:45,359
then when they become a symbiotic unit

1920
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:46,880
or something might end up being

1921
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,000
identical

1922
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,040
and again

1923
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,799
i'm thinking of humans again but if

1924
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:52,560
humans are walking and they happen to

1925
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,158
start walking in step

1926
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:56,399
um that's gonna look like an identical

1927
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:57,759
oscillation

1928
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,759
as as they're coupling with each other

1929
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:02,238
so there's might not be more free energy

1930
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,560
that's minimized by this coupled system

1931
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,640
walking in step together

1932
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,040
um but it might look like this the same

1933
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,560
free energy once they're a coupled

1934
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,920
system

1935
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,920
and one thing that we talked about i

1936
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,000
think in the dot zero or around there is

1937
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,399
there's situations where the cooperation

1938
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:20,799
the coordination increases synchrony so

1939
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:22,960
just increases the mutual information of

1940
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,198
the humans walking in step but also you

1941
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:26,560
could imagine

1942
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,560
anti-phase relationships which is kind

1943
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,238
of like division of labor or task

1944
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:32,238
allocation where the emergence is not

1945
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:33,679
due to um

1946
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:36,158
copy and conform but the emergence is

1947
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:38,399
actually you know you go left i go right

1948
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:40,960
and so in both of those cases

1949
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,120
there would be a change

1950
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,520
in the non-equilibrium steady state

1951
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,279
which is what is introduced throughout

1952
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:49,759
the paper and so that starts to build

1953
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:52,080
the road towards quantitative

1954
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,359
discussions

1955
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:55,360
and you could take a system that

1956
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,199
you suspect already has emergence in

1957
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:58,080
nature

1958
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,920
and remove a part that's kind of like

1959
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:02,400
the gene knockout approach so gains of

1960
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,280
functions and loss of functions and all

1961
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,280
the other ways that we study

1962
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,400
function

1963
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,480
can now have something like a common

1964
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,640
grounding potentially using these

1965
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,159
metrics here

1966
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:14,880
so

1967
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,800
dave and then

1968
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,159
maybe matt if there's a response

1969
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:20,320
otherwise stephen thank you

1970
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,480
okay now blue asks

1971
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:25,920
is free energy additive

1972
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,360
there's an exercise that i'd suggest

1973
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:32,960
it should bring that question to a more

1974
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,440
down-to-earth and more

1975
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,520
poignant focus

1976
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,280
take all the discussions you've heard of

1977
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,760
free energy and substitute for the

1978
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,960
phrase free energy the word

1979
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,920
anxiety

1980
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,199
it already is that way dave what do you

1981
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:52,690
want me to do

1982
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:58,719
[Laughter]

1983
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:00,000
what would that show though or do you

1984
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,600
think it's a natural fit or could it

1985
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,000
could be could we put any word there

1986
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
what do you think it means

1987
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,920
well so just using anxiety like it

1988
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,480
totally leads to the mob mentality and

1989
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,719
like ultra paranoia and conspiracy

1990
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,480
theory so like definitely additive

1991
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,159
yeah

1992
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:23,280
possibly multiplicative though like

1993
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:26,460
could be exponential

1994
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:28,159
[Music]

1995
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,239
yes steve

1996
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:33,679
yeah there actually have been uh

1997
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:36,000
clinicians that have

1998
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,480
really used free energy although they

1999
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,640
didn't use the term as probably before

2000
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,640
the usage was was coined

2001
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,040
um

2002
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:48,960
william glasser in control theory and

2003
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,080
his earlier work uh really has this

2004
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,480
quantum of anxiety

2005
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,320
that these patients had to manage these

2006
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,560
tended to be out of control criminal

2007
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,640
adolescence so they were pretty screwed

2008
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:01,360
up

2009
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:04,159
um and he found ways to get them to rein

2010
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:06,320
themselves in and

2011
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:09,520
control themselves but

2012
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:12,159
think about the blitz effect london

2013
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:13,280
blitz

2014
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:17,360
you had objectively tremendous stress on

2015
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:20,000
everyone all the time

2016
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,600
but there was almost no hospitalization

2017
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,760
for shell shock among civilians

2018
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,280
including the air raid wardens that were

2019
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,040
in digging you know they a building

2020
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,880
beside them get bombed and they'd rush

2021
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,560
in and try to find people and drag them

2022
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,960
out extraordinarily low rates of

2023
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,320
psychosomatic disorder

2024
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,719
there's a certain there's multiple paths

2025
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:42,159
you know people people's brains are

2026
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:43,600
really complex

2027
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,360
there are certain ways that people

2028
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,760
actually do get shocked into rationality

2029
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,679
i've been in situations where the right

2030
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:52,480
thing had to be done right now with no

2031
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,360
hesitation no anxiety no blame

2032
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,159
uh

2033
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:58,239
just do the right thing and there was no

2034
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,239
question just do the right thing uh

2035
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:01,840
whether it's whether it puts me in

2036
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,600
danger or not you know a child's

2037
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,320
endangered you do the right thing so

2038
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:09,360
it's not predetermined uh but typically

2039
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,840
yes what does happen is

2040
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,560
uh a thing called reorganization it's a

2041
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,080
technical term that

2042
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,040
glasser uses it essentially means going

2043
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,520
crazy and in the really worst case the

2044
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,600
reorganizations get faster and faster

2045
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,880
and faster and more and more drastic as

2046
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,880
the personality becomes more and more

2047
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,120
simplified and that's something that

2048
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:34,320
kurt levin or lewin worked through in

2049
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,960
his work on driving children crazy by

2050
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,719
giving them more and more complicated

2051
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:41,360
tasks and under more and more anxiety

2052
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:43,040
and he was able to make the kids

2053
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,520
personalities and thinking degenerate

2054
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,520
and simplify more and more and become

2055
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,840
more and more infertile and you're right

2056
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,199
blue that is one of the things that

2057
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:54,719
happens in a mob the it's terrifying to

2058
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:57,840
be in an even

2059
01:13:58,159 --> 01:13:59,440
unified

2060
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,760
angry mob where everybody's mad at the

2061
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,280
same thing and they're probably not

2062
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,400
going to attack each other it's

2063
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,080
terrifying and people that keep going

2064
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,320
into that situation

2065
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,840
things happen

2066
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,760
remember um

2067
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,360
uh um

2068
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:18,080
the presentation two weeks ago on

2069
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,120
the mutual suppression of the limbic

2070
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,360
system the reticular activating system

2071
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,280
on the one hand and the prefrontal

2072
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:27,600
cortex on the other

2073
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,280
you get these things that look like

2074
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,400
beliefs

2075
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,320
they sound like beliefs they act like

2076
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,440
beliefs but they're not beliefs because

2077
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:38,239
reason has never been

2078
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:39,360
invoked

2079
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,159
in

2080
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:42,320
the biological decision whether to

2081
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,080
incorporate this

2082
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:48,719
magician's spell into my

2083
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:49,760
feeling

2084
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,920
and my actions

2085
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,320
do you have to have reason to have a

2086
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,799
belief dave

2087
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:01,920
oh yeah in the sense that uh uh philip

2088
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:02,800
uh

2089
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,880
gerunds uses it

2090
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:05,760
yeah

2091
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,280
yeah you have i mean that's that's kind

2092
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,800
of the way he defines it a belief is

2093
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,880
something where the prefrontal cortex

2094
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,920
has been involved it's been in the loop

2095
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,440
and there's way to bypass that um

2096
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,600
i asked him whether he's worked on the

2097
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,320
social psychology of this or the the ego

2098
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,400
psychologist he says no no

2099
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,560
i have enough trouble worrying about

2100
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,679
people with damaged brains and how that

2101
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:31,600
shows the bypassing

2102
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,880
of rationality in the formation of

2103
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,679
delusions but i think it works the other

2104
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:41,040
way um you may have seen my my

2105
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:45,360
shotgunning of the apathetic apothemic

2106
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,719
brawl

2107
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:48,640
by uh dr

2108
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,880
nathan rosenberg or rather gabriel

2109
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,360
nathan rosenberg he's an academic and i

2110
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,520
think kentucky he says look this is

2111
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,360
what's happening you've got this person

2112
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,679
with a

2113
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,960
a non-existent personality who's doing

2114
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,679
what the mob tells him to do through the

2115
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:09,360
mob's megaphone called fox news

2116
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,400
why do we like him so much because he's

2117
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:16,239
less than any of us he will always obey

2118
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:18,400
us so we'll give him power and then

2119
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,560
he'll give us what we

2120
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,199
feel like

2121
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:24,480
uh yeah and there's no reason of

2122
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,560
ultimate it's very much a bypass yeah

2123
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,880
rita labonz uh

2124
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,600
study and mackey's study on

2125
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,640
the madness of mobs

2126
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:37,120
and the mass production of delusions and

2127
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,480
crazes

2128
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:39,679
and

2129
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:41,840
mccarthyism and all this

2130
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,280
unhealthy stuff

2131
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,280
thanks dave and that was the guest

2132
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,400
stream 10.1 with philip guerins and so

2133
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,159
just to highlight one point and then

2134
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:52,640
stephen it's we're really talking about

2135
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,080
control theory

2136
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,239
maybe the first pass the first term in

2137
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:57,600
the taylor series

2138
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,800
is about control i mean come on narrow

2139
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,679
the error and that's kind of definition

2140
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:04,480
one

2141
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:07,120
control as homeostasis even if there's a

2142
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,600
shifting set point but then

2143
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,199
again it's the ecological and the

2144
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:13,040
relational insight

2145
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,679
and just the emergence of interactions

2146
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:16,480
that

2147
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,960
control takes on this broader

2148
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,960
anticipatory

2149
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,679
usage to control your body temperature

2150
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:25,199
is to sometimes do

2151
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:27,840
a lot of movements that from that first

2152
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,840
pass look like a non-sequitur like

2153
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,440
sprint so that you can get into the

2154
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,199
air-conditioned room

2155
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:35,280
that's the expected free energy through

2156
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,239
time

2157
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:38,640
so now we have a common grounding for

2158
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:41,120
talking about control when it looks

2159
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,679
homeostatic as well as control when it

2160
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:46,719
looks allostatic or even innovative

2161
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:49,280
so it's very important to pull out some

2162
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:50,960
of these threads and also recognize

2163
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,600
their cybernetic origins and other areas

2164
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,480
too

2165
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:59,080
so steven and then anyone else

2166
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,920
yeah um these are all really good points

2167
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,840
i'm curious when we talk about free

2168
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:08,719
energy minimization

2169
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:11,440
i think it's it's interesting to talk

2170
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:14,320
about that from a systems perspective um

2171
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,320
however if we want to get back to the

2172
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,400
kind of organism

2173
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,159
so the key thing with free energy

2174
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,480
minimization

2175
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,480
that occurs at different scales you know

2176
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,360
physical scales number of

2177
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:30,000
units scale time scale

2178
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,840
you know teleological scales we think

2179
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,800
about these different scales but

2180
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,600
that reduction there has to be a way for

2181
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,840
that reduction to be meaningfully

2182
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,280
engaged

2183
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,080
through actions or interactions like

2184
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:47,440
the metric ultimately what's going to be

2185
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:48,880
filtering through

2186
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:51,440
probably in some noisy maybe backdoor

2187
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:52,320
way

2188
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,679
is that um if it's going to be sustained

2189
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:57,679
over time there needs to be some

2190
01:18:57,679 --> 01:18:59,679
meaningful engagement over time so for

2191
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:01,280
instance you know the idea of the path

2192
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,640
that we walk

2193
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,560
starting to wear away the grass in our

2194
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:05,520
niche

2195
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:07,920
well it's because we walk on the path

2196
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,280
more than

2197
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,679
once that we have an ability to observe

2198
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:13,280
that you know if we only ever walk that

2199
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,960
path once it wouldn't

2200
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,040
have a way for any variation to be

2201
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,600
noticed but we notice the path being

2202
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,120
worn

2203
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,520
by agents over time so

2204
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,120
when we're talking about these different

2205
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,320
scales

2206
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:29,120
these variational dynamics in free

2207
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:30,719
energy it's not just a reduction because

2208
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:31,920
we don't

2209
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:32,960
get

2210
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,120
a number each time saying this was lower

2211
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,360
than last we just get

2212
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,400
some

2213
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,560
new state in the world and we have to

2214
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,199
infer if it's changed from some other

2215
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:44,800
state in the world

2216
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,920
and we it may go up it may go down so we

2217
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,280
may infer

2218
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,440
at times the free energies

2219
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,840
has has not been minimized and we might

2220
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,719
take but overall static processes

2221
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:58,480
for instance if we have a big room

2222
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,880
that's not tidy and we have a group of

2223
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,480
people and they want to organize it into

2224
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,560
a studio space

2225
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,080
you know they might work together

2226
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,080
initially putting in a lot of extra free

2227
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,159
energy time and

2228
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:11,679
and then eventually they know that they

2229
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:13,520
will be able to minimize

2230
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,760
their sort of systemic

2231
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,679
engagement as a group

2232
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:19,840
while it's not necessarily that they're

2233
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,639
each minimizing free energy as a system

2234
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:24,880
in the so this is almost where maybe

2235
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,800
challenging to get out of the biological

2236
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,040
sense and maybe come into some other

2237
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,440
disciplines where

2238
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,040
it's not all a system it might be more

2239
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,280
of a systemic context

2240
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,520
which is then more teleological so i'd

2241
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,920
be interested that that question okay

2242
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,000
where does this crop through this idea

2243
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:42,800
of

2244
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:46,400
being able to to have a pragmatic metric

2245
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:48,480
that links the non-equilibrium steady

2246
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,560
state of the organisms

2247
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,719
phenotype or individual so they're

2248
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:54,480
actually able to then

2249
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,800
infer something from whatever is

2250
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,040
happening to the free energy out there

2251
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:02,400
or in in there or around them

2252
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,199
and how that changes things if we if we

2253
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:06,960
frame it away from

2254
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,280
systems per se to something more

2255
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,280
systemic

2256
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:18,719
different uses of the highly poly semis

2257
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:20,880
word system systems of systems for some

2258
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,679
people are systems so that's why we

2259
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:27,360
um increasingly will try to be

2260
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,920
exploring the active inference ontology

2261
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,000
so that we know which pieces of the

2262
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,360
puzzle we're talking about and then that

2263
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,280
will unpack so interestingly into

2264
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,840
different disciplinary contexts stephen

2265
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,040
so nice

2266
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:42,480
points um so in the last half hour

2267
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,719
i think there's a few different things

2268
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:47,120
let's maybe get to one of the key

2269
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,280
pieces and specific contributions of the

2270
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,280
paper which i would love to hear matt

2271
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,920
your thoughts on which is just first

2272
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,880
what's going on with users and resources

2273
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:59,040
and second what is the difference

2274
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,040
between uni-directional multi-scale

2275
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,360
integration and reciprocal multi-scale

2276
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,440
integration

2277
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:08,239
right um

2278
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:10,320
those two

2279
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:13,440
notions i suppose of unidirectional and

2280
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,199
multi-directional

2281
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:16,639
reciprocal

2282
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:18,800
and users and resources they're very

2283
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,360
much so connected

2284
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,840
the idea of a user we can think about

2285
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,560
this and i think stephen's uh

2286
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,320
to use stephen's example of an elephant

2287
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,760
path i believe that's what these things

2288
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,440
are called sometimes so you see these

2289
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,679
paths that are treaded

2290
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:35,920
and are typically you know

2291
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,600
used to refer to when we're thinking

2292
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,679
about kind of nice construction like

2293
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:41,480
past phones construction

2294
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:41,710
[Applause]

2295
01:22:41,710 --> 01:22:42,880
[Music]

2296
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:45,120
this is something that is in the

2297
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,239
environment that's is being used say is

2298
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:50,560
a resource that's being used and it's

2299
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:54,080
the effect of previous action on the

2300
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,360
environment

2301
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,440
uh returning to the notion of so that

2302
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,440
that that would be a resource

2303
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,480
uh

2304
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,040
used by a particular cognitive agent or

2305
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,639
an agent that's engaging in adaptive

2306
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:06,880
active inference uh

2307
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,679
so

2308
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:10,400
number one it has to be recognizable

2309
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:13,120
uh and it has to actually in order for

2310
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,800
the system actually to engage with that

2311
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,239
particular resource it has to be

2312
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:18,080
recognizable as such

2313
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,360
um

2314
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:20,880
and that recognition can come through

2315
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,520
for example epistemic foraging uh or

2316
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,840
actually just uh be applying particular

2317
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,920
kind of a plan a model to a particular

2318
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,080
type of uh resource that has been

2319
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,760
applied previously

2320
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:34,080
um this is also the case with something

2321
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,000
like stitch merging right

2322
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,320
where you have uh something

2323
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,880
uh that's it's quite lovely where you

2324
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,880
have for example ants leaving pheromones

2325
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,520
within the environment uh and that

2326
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,600
pheromone acts as a particular type of

2327
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:48,800
mediator

2328
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,239
uh directing

2329
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:53,280
further behavior by agents of a similar

2330
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,239
type

2331
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:55,199
right

2332
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:57,440
and that's again environmentally

2333
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,520
mediated communication

2334
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:02,159
or or what they might call an

2335
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:04,639
environment environmentally mediated uh

2336
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:05,679
you know

2337
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:06,480
uh

2338
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,880
conversation between between various

2339
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,320
elements of a system

2340
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,760
uh and

2341
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,280
the pheromones themselves of course are

2342
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,800
resources

2343
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,880
in the environment that's going to be

2344
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:20,480
perhaps uh contrast with the idea that

2345
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:23,679
uh not all resources need themselves are

2346
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:25,040
themselves

2347
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,239
they have to be limited to being

2348
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:29,040
resources they can also be users also so

2349
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:32,239
uh to to make a strange case we can

2350
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:35,199
think about uh stitch mercy actually uh

2351
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:37,360
what if it wasn't actually the pheromone

2352
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:38,960
that was being used but the other act

2353
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,239
the presence of the other ant that was

2354
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:41,920
being used the interaction with the ant

2355
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,760
itself

2356
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,040
so here

2357
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,480
the two

2358
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,639
uh using using using perhaps and perhaps

2359
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:49,920
you have to tell me if i'm using this

2360
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,159
wrong that's terminology but you have

2361
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:53,760
two discussions

2362
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,719
right a cinder and receiver both are but

2363
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:58,719
both active senators and receivers and

2364
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,239
actually they're communicating something

2365
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:02,320
they're having a conversation uh but

2366
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,159
there isn't any mediation in between the

2367
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:07,520
two uh that can be offloaded onto

2368
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,120
uh in this particular situation

2369
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:11,280
offloaded into the environment

2370
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,199
so the signal itself is going to be the

2371
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:15,520
direct kind of interaction between the

2372
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:16,639
two

2373
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:18,880
uh rather than a pheromone now that in

2374
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,960
that case we can map that onto something

2375
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:22,320
that would be a kind of hypothetical

2376
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:25,120
case of reciprocal multi-integration

2377
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,040
right uh

2378
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,080
and again

2379
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,560
uh stigma rg just happens to be

2380
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:33,199
uh typically and in each cases in in the

2381
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:36,400
way that uh people degrasse uh suggested

2382
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,560
it when he was studying termites

2383
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,320
uh this is something that's actually

2384
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:43,840
involving a particular type of signal in

2385
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,280
the environment that's offloaded to the

2386
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,320
environment so it's going to be

2387
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,480
naturally something that's going to be a

2388
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,480
unidirectional multi-scale integration

2389
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:54,000
between a system of team very systems

2390
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,960
whereas for example

2391
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:58,800
when you have direct interaction between

2392
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,320
two cognizers

2393
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,000
or two systems

2394
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
uh two adaptive systems

2395
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:04,800
uh

2396
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,840
they can also of course use some type of

2397
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:09,040
resource there can be signaling and this

2398
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,719
is something that of course happens with

2399
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:12,320
vibro fisheries

2400
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,120
uh

2401
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:14,880
and the bobtail squid but there's also

2402
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,320
going to be some kind of other direct

2403
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,239
interaction between two systems and

2404
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:20,320
that's uh that's kind of the reciprocal

2405
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:23,840
multi-scale integration

2406
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,080
awesome summary i believe the technical

2407
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,239
term would be converse ants

2408
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:31,360
for that kind of a conversation

2409
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,520
but it's a great point how um when you

2410
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,080
have an adaptive active inference agent

2411
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,480
and then a niche that's being modified

2412
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,320
stigmatically that does mere active

2413
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,719
inference like the spider's web

2414
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:44,639
that's unidirectional but still

2415
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:46,320
multi-scale

2416
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,400
whereas when you have adaptive and

2417
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:52,000
adaptive in discussion in conversation

2418
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,960
even again if only in a folk sense

2419
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,120
you have adaptive on either end and it

2420
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,000
can

2421
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,920
allow for a new

2422
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,320
non-equilibrium steady state to arise so

2423
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,320
not that there isn't a non-equilibrium

2424
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,960
steady state of spider plus web rather

2425
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:09,199
than them separate in fact there will be

2426
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:11,199
but it still is a different type it's

2427
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:13,280
like a double directional or reciprocal

2428
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:16,159
stigma g so just such a cool way to

2429
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:17,360
connect that

2430
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:20,719
blue and then stephen

2431
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:22,719
so

2432
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:25,520
like again this like line between mirror

2433
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,360
active inference and adaptive active

2434
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,840
inference like is it like makes me want

2435
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:32,480
to attack it a little bit um i i think

2436
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,920
about uh the niche modification that for

2437
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:38,560
example humans do is extensive and

2438
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:39,760
transcends

2439
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,800
like generations and i mean work it like

2440
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,560
contributes a lot to the collective

2441
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,880
intelligence of the human species and so

2442
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,239
forth and

2443
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:51,199
i also think about um

2444
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:53,600
in terms of like the gaia hypothesis

2445
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,199
right like so if

2446
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:57,360
if the world is one giant organism and

2447
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:58,560
this is something that we talked about

2448
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,719
with mike levin when he came to the live

2449
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:03,760
stream so if the world is one giant

2450
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,120
organism

2451
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,760
is the niche constantly

2452
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,159
adapting to the species that are that

2453
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:13,199
are in it like is this a continuous

2454
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:15,360
adaptive active inference and just in in

2455
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,199
terms of transcending time scales you

2456
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:19,040
think about like these you know

2457
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,440
symbiosis i guess they're symbiosis but

2458
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,520
like relationships that develop between

2459
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,639
you know like

2460
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:27,040
orchids and their pollinators for

2461
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:29,440
example so i mean these are intense

2462
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,600
co-evolution things that happen over

2463
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,199
many many many times

2464
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:35,440
time scales and i mean we can think

2465
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,920
about the plant as a plant a cognizer i

2466
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,520
mean that's debatable

2467
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:42,239
i would say to a degree like i'm not i'm

2468
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:44,880
not not binary here like yes no is not

2469
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,480
not really a good answer

2470
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,560
but but is the the niche may be

2471
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,199
constantly adapting to

2472
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:54,559
systems to a degree

2473
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,280
i think that's a great point really

2474
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,960
really great point um i do think the

2475
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:01,280
niche is adapting to systems absolutely

2476
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,560
but i would say that the niche is

2477
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:04,400
adapting in a different way

2478
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,840
and we can we can use

2479
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:06,880
of course we're going to have to be

2480
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,639
specifics because this whole

2481
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:12,880
adaptation takes a policy in a sense uh

2482
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,360
adaptation in in terms of what the niche

2483
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:18,159
is doing if if the niche is not itself

2484
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:20,400
okay perhaps you want to i can be

2485
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:22,320
accused of being biased interested in

2486
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,800
one sense if the niche itself isn't a

2487
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,600
biological system

2488
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:28,880
uh

2489
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:29,679
then

2490
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:31,440
we can kind of

2491
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,760
perhaps push against this idea that it's

2492
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:34,800
adapting in the same way that a

2493
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,800
biological system would adapt to and

2494
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,000
this

2495
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,159
may be one way of phrasing this uh i'm

2496
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:43,040
not sure if this is going to

2497
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,960
hopefully make a bit clearer

2498
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,679
my my point is that

2499
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:49,440
biological systems one way of

2500
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:50,800
understanding them is that they have set

2501
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,239
points right moving set points

2502
01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:53,840
throughout a particular trajectory this

2503
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:56,000
particular trajectory might be

2504
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,840
a trajectory across face space

2505
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,040
throughout their life so you have a

2506
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,960
moving set

2507
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,639
and this moving set

2508
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:06,560
is something uh that's organized uh

2509
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,880
around a particular type of phase-based

2510
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:11,840
organization uh and it's recapitulated

2511
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,320
within a particular type of phenotype

2512
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:16,000
uh defines the phenotype it

2513
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,080
characterizes a phenotype or a genetic

2514
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,120
model

2515
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,600
uh with a particular say a

2516
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,440
a field of dirt

2517
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:24,960
we might be able to

2518
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,520
actually walk across a field of dirt

2519
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,760
or a set of cement stairs

2520
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,239
the uh it might actually over time for

2521
01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:34,000
what a few hundred years you have these

2522
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,520
interesting stairs at the castle of

2523
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:38,800
edinburgh that actually dip it and these

2524
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,600
dips in this in the cement are evidence

2525
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:42,960
that people have walked there before but

2526
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,560
we tend to walk where other people have

2527
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,239
walked and this

2528
01:30:46,239 --> 01:30:47,600
perhaps one might call that an

2529
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:48,960
adaptation

2530
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,480
to a certain degree but i think that

2531
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:51,920
might be pushing the limit on the word

2532
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,800
adaptation given that that set of stairs

2533
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,719
does not have a set point it doesn't

2534
01:30:56,719 --> 01:30:59,920
have uh it doesn't have the same type of

2535
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:03,040
uh it's not the same type i suppose of

2536
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,280
of of self-organized system it's not a

2537
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:07,600
self-organizing system in that sense

2538
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:08,880
uh

2539
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:09,920
and

2540
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:13,040
as such i would think that okay well

2541
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:15,679
uh maybe that maybe the niche does adapt

2542
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:17,520
to a certain degree

2543
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,600
uh but there's an adaptation with

2544
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,800
biological systems that are

2545
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:23,360
self-organizing and have organizational

2546
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,120
closure and i think this is quite this

2547
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,639
is quite important

2548
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:28,639
uh that is different than

2549
01:31:28,639 --> 01:31:32,000
say um abiotic systems and this brings i

2550
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,360
suppose we i would love to talk about

2551
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:34,320
this

2552
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:35,920
in a bit is that it's a question that

2553
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:38,960
blue brought up in the last um

2554
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:40,719
in the last kind of uh

2555
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:41,840
live stream

2556
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:42,880
was

2557
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,719
the the manner in which we can actually

2558
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:46,159
understand

2559
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:47,120
uh

2560
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:49,840
systems or i identify

2561
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:52,480
particular types of individuals uh that

2562
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:55,520
are involving the environment so it's

2563
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,120
it's not actually saying that the

2564
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:59,840
environment is separate from the system

2565
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,199
otherwise we wouldn't actually be able

2566
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:03,440
to actually talk about the emergence of

2567
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:05,280
actually living systems we can get about

2568
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:07,120
we can get into that later though

2569
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:10,480
so i have to just push back on you um

2570
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:12,000
so think about the earth and the

2571
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,239
atmosphere of the earth okay now this is

2572
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:16,320
not necessarily a biological system this

2573
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:19,040
is nitrogen carbon dioxide water clouds

2574
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:22,000
etc right but here we are humans

2575
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,159
releasing tons and tons of carbon into

2576
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:25,440
the atmosphere

2577
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:28,400
totally changing the the the

2578
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,719
set point as you described it like the

2579
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:33,440
homeostatic set point or whatever the

2580
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:35,360
non-equilibrium steady-state density

2581
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:36,880
that the atmosphere of the earth

2582
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,639
currently resides in and has resided in

2583
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:41,440
for x million years right so but we are

2584
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:44,320
changing that and we are seeing the

2585
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,320
earth adapt to

2586
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:48,880
us and the changes that we're making in

2587
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:51,920
it just in terms of hurricanes storms i

2588
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:53,920
mean the weather patterns are completely

2589
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:56,719
and and they're destroying large amounts

2590
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:58,000
of humans right

2591
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,320
and drought famine all of the things

2592
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:01,600
that are going to

2593
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,920
cascade through climate change as we see

2594
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:07,040
it progress so is this not adaptive

2595
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,880
active inference on the part of the

2596
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:12,000
earth or or what do you think of that

2597
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,120
uh

2598
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:14,800
really interesting i think in order to

2599
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,560
make that particular type of assumption

2600
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,159
one would actually have to

2601
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:19,679
you know ascribe to something like a guy

2602
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:20,880
hypothesis

2603
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,880
like lovelock sky hypothesis or the same

2604
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,400
type of thing that then margulis was

2605
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,080
into later in her life

2606
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,120
um

2607
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:28,400
and i think that's that's that's an

2608
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:30,560
assumption that has to be made

2609
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,560
uh given the fact that okay well just

2610
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:35,199
because uh response happens chemically

2611
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:36,880
doesn't necessarily mean that it's not

2612
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,960
actually an adaptive response we

2613
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:41,120
you know uh gene expression is

2614
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:44,159
biochemical adaptation right so it's not

2615
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:46,880
about just being chemical

2616
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:49,280
uh using chemical or or something like

2617
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:51,920
this uh composition changing molecular

2618
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:54,960
structure as some type of uh criterion

2619
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:57,520
for adaptation but there's a i think

2620
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:58,560
there's an assumption that has to be

2621
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,400
made about what the system is there and

2622
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,920
if you're thinking about the earth as a

2623
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:03,199
system

2624
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:05,040
uh

2625
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,199
maybe the earth is adapting to its

2626
01:34:07,199 --> 01:34:09,600
constituent parts

2627
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:10,639
right

2628
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:12,880
uh but that would involve that would

2629
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:13,840
involve

2630
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,920
uh intrinsically the earth being a

2631
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,600
particular type of living system given

2632
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,960
the fact that it has living parts

2633
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:24,239
one other quick thought on that is as a

2634
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:26,880
model comparison framework so go back to

2635
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:30,800
spm dcm all of our categorical model

2636
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:33,199
comparison techniques in the toolkit we

2637
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:35,120
can actually evaluate

2638
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:37,280
should we have cells as the units and

2639
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:40,400
then organisms then the each system in

2640
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:42,239
the world or should we use a different

2641
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:44,400
partitioning which one of these models

2642
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,159
is explaining predicting designing

2643
01:34:46,159 --> 01:34:48,080
controlling better

2644
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,159
or which one is more parsimonious i

2645
01:34:50,159 --> 01:34:53,119
prefer simplicity over utility or i have

2646
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:56,159
a function that balances simplicity and

2647
01:34:56,159 --> 01:34:58,560
utility there's all kinds of frameworks

2648
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:01,360
that's kind of part of pluralism is

2649
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,920
starting with and being with

2650
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:05,520
that

2651
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,679
multiplicity of answers

2652
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:10,400
and then knowing who we are and what we

2653
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:14,159
use to decide on which models to use so

2654
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:16,638
stephen

2655
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:20,000
you know i'm very much like to keep that

2656
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,159
ecological niche

2657
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:24,080
in the picture

2658
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:25,280
so

2659
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:27,600
you know if it's organism in niche and

2660
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,000
groups of organisms in niche

2661
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
and then watershed

2662
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,840
a micro environment or micro climate

2663
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,760
as a niche

2664
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:39,199
i think that kind of becomes like a

2665
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:41,760
defining organism or

2666
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:43,440
unit in a way is like watch the

2667
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:45,679
watershed what's the kind of

2668
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:48,480
climate as experienced by that

2669
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,080
ecosystem

2670
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:51,199
and then of course you've got many

2671
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:53,520
ecosystems around

2672
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:54,800
the world

2673
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:57,040
from the arctic to the antarctic you

2674
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:59,199
know and it will be in between

2675
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:02,560
now they might all be

2676
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,080
collectively

2677
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:06,639
affecting the broader

2678
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:09,679
carbon dioxide levels of the broader

2679
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:11,280
ecosystem

2680
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:13,840
but when but how that then jumps to make

2681
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,960
the whole world an organism

2682
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:18,960
becomes for me slightly challenging

2683
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,719
right because it's it's always it was

2684
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:22,320
always a niche up to then and then

2685
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:23,760
suddenly it jumps to be an organism

2686
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:26,000
because we look at it from space and we

2687
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,840
see a nice round ball

2688
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,000
and it sort of looks alive so i wonder

2689
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,920
whether there's a so one one of the

2690
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:34,159
things i'm really interested in is

2691
01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:35,920
is like you're saying how things get

2692
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,440
ascribed

2693
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:38,560
to

2694
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,400
the niche and we we talked about the

2695
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,639
path walking on the path and

2696
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:44,080
in a way like

2697
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:46,080
that dispersive

2698
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:48,719
thing animals can sort of also intuit

2699
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:49,840
some of that as well from the

2700
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:52,560
affordances and the directions

2701
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,320
and again bringing stuff in from

2702
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,560
systemic design type approaches is one

2703
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,400
thing that's interesting is if you then

2704
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:02,000
say humans like humans what we do is

2705
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,320
as a child and maybe some apes do this

2706
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:06,800
but not many is we point at something as

2707
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,159
a child

2708
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:09,440
and then we

2709
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:11,679
point to the parent and that's becomes

2710
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:13,199
it's in the niche but it becomes what

2711
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:15,600
they would call a boundary object in

2712
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:16,880
systemic design so you're trying to

2713
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:18,480
bring together a team around something

2714
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,400
which is beyond one discipline

2715
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,159
so what you need to do is you say okay

2716
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:24,560
we can't just use the

2717
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,719
variational free energy landscape of

2718
01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:28,960
this

2719
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:31,760
domain ecosystem which we have all

2720
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:34,400
attuned to in our sort of own way

2721
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:35,760
because now people are running by

2722
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,920
different rules right we're running by

2723
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,600
the physicists and the biologists right

2724
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,280
they're just going to be so you get a

2725
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,679
boundary object which you point to so

2726
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:45,600
it's something in the niche

2727
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,639
and then you sort of work to that

2728
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:50,800
um so anyway i just think there's

2729
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,639
something quite interesting then about

2730
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:54,880
like daniel was saying there about

2731
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:56,480
you know what sort of language and do we

2732
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,159
use but

2733
01:37:58,159 --> 01:38:00,480
this scale problem comes back every time

2734
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:03,119
but i i wondered um

2735
01:38:03,119 --> 01:38:06,560
like the difference between

2736
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:09,119
a boundary object or something which can

2737
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:10,719
be defined which i'm not sure if other

2738
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:13,199
animals can really do

2739
01:38:13,199 --> 01:38:14,800
in the same way maybe a dog when it

2740
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,639
urinates up a tree i was just thinking

2741
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:18,480
about that does that become a boundary

2742
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:20,800
object in the in their world i don't

2743
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,480
know but um

2744
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:24,239
yeah anyways something that comes to

2745
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:25,520
mind

2746
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:27,440
thanks steven and with the

2747
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,600
transdisciplinarity

2748
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:32,400
in cancer biology they've recognized the

2749
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,280
niche

2750
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:35,440
the tumor and the stem cell niche and

2751
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:36,480
the micro

2752
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:39,040
environment and there's so much more to

2753
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:41,440
say on these very interesting topics

2754
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:42,800
just in the last

2755
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:45,040
few minutes we can go to a few of these

2756
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:46,560
final um

2757
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:48,639
points in the dot one it's always

2758
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:50,719
awesome to have the author and unpack

2759
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:52,080
some of the ideas

2760
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:53,679
and so this is kind of our little

2761
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:55,440
fractal.2

2762
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,840
setting us up for our discussion next

2763
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:00,560
week and thinking about implications and

2764
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:03,119
how does it influence how we act moving

2765
01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:04,560
forward and what kinds of questions

2766
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,080
we're looking at

2767
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:08,960
you wrote about some of the implications

2768
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:11,520
for thinking um

2769
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:12,480
about

2770
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,000
individuality from a cognitive

2771
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,360
perspective

2772
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:17,280
you say it broadly

2773
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:18,320
and

2774
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:21,600
it'd be awesome to hear your thoughts on

2775
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:22,560
uh

2776
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:24,560
the folks psychological notion of the

2777
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,159
cognizer

2778
01:39:26,159 --> 01:39:30,799
and where does the fep come into play

2779
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:32,159
right

2780
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:33,119
um

2781
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:34,800
thanks for the question

2782
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,880
uh so the folk psychological notion of

2783
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,159
cognizer

2784
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:39,040
again

2785
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:42,400
um my argument is a piggybacks

2786
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:44,719
upon this idea of the

2787
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:45,840
psychological

2788
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:48,320
biological notion of the individual

2789
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:50,480
and once we kind of free ourselves from

2790
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:52,080
thinking about

2791
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:55,840
uh individuals specifically in terms of

2792
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,560
replication dynamics

2793
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,960
uh that opens up a space

2794
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:02,639
for us to think about

2795
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:04,000
uh

2796
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,520
cognizers

2797
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:08,800
that are discontinuous with uh

2798
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:11,440
replication or replicators

2799
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:12,960
and i think this is like that that's

2800
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,880
going to be very important

2801
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,560
uh again

2802
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:19,440
when taking the uh this particular route

2803
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:21,600
of thinking about the evolution of

2804
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:22,800
cognition

2805
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,760
uh when thinking about for example okay

2806
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:26,800
uh

2807
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:29,040
if cognition goes all the way down

2808
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:32,480
to a certain to a certain degree

2809
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:33,360
uh

2810
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:36,639
then what part does it actually play in

2811
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:40,080
the the construction of larger systems

2812
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:41,679
uh and why would why would the

2813
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:43,600
construction of larger systems actually

2814
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:46,000
be some type of adaptation

2815
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,440
what uh for each of the systems involved

2816
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:50,639
so

2817
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:52,480
when we're thinking about for example i

2818
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,159
think one particular thing that is quite

2819
01:40:54,159 --> 01:40:56,080
important will be quite important to

2820
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:57,840
think about this for is

2821
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:01,360
okay the manner in which we

2822
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:03,679
think about artificial intelligence for

2823
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:05,360
example

2824
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:06,159
um

2825
01:41:06,159 --> 01:41:08,000
one way of course two ways of course of

2826
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,040
doing this

2827
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:12,080
uh is you know we go for various kind of

2828
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:14,320
specific tasks

2829
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:15,600
whether it's going to be kind of

2830
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,360
computer vision or

2831
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:20,719
uh gpt3 type tasks where we can actually

2832
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:24,639
analyze large corpus of text

2833
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:26,960
and kind of recapitulate that

2834
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,719
uh that's one thing the other thing of

2835
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:31,360
course is the task general or

2836
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:32,960
kind of domain general

2837
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:34,960
notion of ai

2838
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:37,840
and i think in order to perhaps

2839
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:39,679
tread into the department or turn into

2840
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:42,000
that field of more kind of

2841
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,080
task generality we're going to have to

2842
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:47,040
think about even simpler questions as to

2843
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,719
how can a system actually start

2844
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:50,560
maintaining itself

2845
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:52,639
uh according to its own tasks and again

2846
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:54,560
we come back to this notion of how can

2847
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,920
we actually

2848
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:58,080
uh set a system up

2849
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:00,000
you know to have its own intrinsic

2850
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,920
motivation

2851
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,280
uh

2852
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:05,440
and one way to do this is perhaps to

2853
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:07,360
piggyback on living systems so you

2854
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,960
introduce a living system to an

2855
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:11,040
artificial system

2856
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,159
uh

2857
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:14,080
and have to have them communicate in

2858
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:15,600
such a way

2859
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:16,880
uh that's

2860
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,360
you know analogous to some type of

2861
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,679
symbiotic system this is something again

2862
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:23,440
perhaps that mike levin michael levin

2863
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:25,360
has been thinking about doing actually

2864
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:26,639
in his lab

2865
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:28,960
uh and uh

2866
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:30,800
and i think this this is quite an

2867
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,400
interesting kind of method to think

2868
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,400
about the importance of

2869
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:36,719
uh of symbiosis in developing

2870
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:38,880
artificially intelligent systems you

2871
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:42,239
know um a system that can identify go go

2872
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:44,880
to go to a room an embodied intelligent

2873
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,560
agent that can like you know

2874
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:48,239
traverse a room and identify all the

2875
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:50,560
dogs that's great with it with an

2876
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:52,239
accuracy a high accuracy level that's

2877
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:53,760
fantastic but if

2878
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:55,920
if they can't respond to the dog knowing

2879
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:58,480
that a dog is going to actually you know

2880
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:00,320
dismantle it i'm not sure if i would

2881
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:02,400
want to call how intelligent that system

2882
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,560
would even be in terms of having basic

2883
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:05,679
intelligence

2884
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:07,520
and i think that fep and active

2885
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:09,520
influence allows allows a particular

2886
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:11,119
type of

2887
01:43:11,119 --> 01:43:13,280
perspective on the notion of basic

2888
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:15,360
intelligence or intelligence that's

2889
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:16,880
surrounded or

2890
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:17,920
uh

2891
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:20,159
yes that's that's

2892
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:23,040
grounded in the notion of kind of uh a

2893
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:26,000
nest a nest density

2894
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,440
or grounded in the notion of a type of

2895
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:32,880
a moving set point that's equivalent to

2896
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:34,800
a homeostatic

2897
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,800
moving homeostasis moving from static

2898
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,560
states and autostasis

2899
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:41,679
uh supporting states

2900
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:45,840
thank you matt shannon

2901
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:48,800
thanks for that i wonder um

2902
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:50,400
how important

2903
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:52,960
sort of drawing on what flu said and

2904
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:55,600
dave and steven i think also earlier

2905
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:58,320
how important

2906
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:01,600
some sort of effective or emotional

2907
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,520
state or awareness is

2908
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:07,840
in knowing and cognizing and um

2909
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:10,159
like how important that is for for a

2910
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:12,560
symbiotic relationship to be called a

2911
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:14,000
cognizer

2912
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,560
and whether you know like the neural

2913
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:18,239
network that is working with the human

2914
01:44:18,239 --> 01:44:21,119
maybe to compose a piece of music um

2915
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:22,480
how important it is for that neural

2916
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:24,639
network to have

2917
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:26,639
cognizing capabilities of its own or

2918
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:28,960
maybe some sort of effective

2919
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:31,199
awareness or some sort of effective

2920
01:44:31,199 --> 01:44:32,960
processing

2921
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:36,080
that it is able to develop in some way

2922
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:38,320
on its own or maybe only in symbiosis

2923
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:40,159
with a person

2924
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:41,360
um

2925
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:43,199
and i don't know if if this bobtail

2926
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:45,840
squid and the vibrio like do they have

2927
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:48,320
sort of effective awareness together or

2928
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:49,760
does this would seem to you know

2929
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,840
experience something like

2930
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,520
pain i suppose would be one of the most

2931
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:56,080
basic effective states we might have

2932
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:58,560
so how important would basically is

2933
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,960
effective processing in

2934
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:06,320
fi delineating individuals or cognizers

2935
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,639
a great question shannon

2936
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:09,600
um

2937
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:12,320
i'll take a go at it um i do think that

2938
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:13,199
uh

2939
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:15,119
at a certain level of complexity

2940
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:17,760
affective uh affective states play a

2941
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:19,280
huge role

2942
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:22,560
but i'm but because i'm i'm

2943
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,480
i suppose i'm making an assumption that

2944
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,719
cognition goes all the way down

2945
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:29,040
and not every system is going to be an

2946
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,520
affect have that capacity to have some

2947
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:34,239
type of effect actual awareness

2948
01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:35,920
one might actually think about some

2949
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:39,360
other type of uh the sub-component

2950
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:40,239
that

2951
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:42,480
plays a similar role as affect and

2952
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:44,400
perhaps that just might be something

2953
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:45,840
like um

2954
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:46,880
you know

2955
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,639
something that grounds

2956
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:50,159
uh

2957
01:45:50,159 --> 01:45:51,520
that grounds a particular type of

2958
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:53,840
motivation to stay uh to stay in

2959
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:56,239
homostatic states or to remain in

2960
01:45:56,239 --> 01:45:58,400
particular homeostatic states

2961
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:01,520
and this can be um

2962
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,760
oh pamela lyon has written about this

2963
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:06,960
just recently actually um

2964
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:08,239
and

2965
01:46:08,239 --> 01:46:10,239
it's not affect necessarily but it's

2966
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:12,400
valence negative and positive valence

2967
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:14,639
that might not and it has less to do

2968
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:16,159
with awareness

2969
01:46:16,159 --> 01:46:19,119
or sentience in that sense uh but more

2970
01:46:19,119 --> 01:46:20,960
to do with actually

2971
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:23,199
uh

2972
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:26,480
a a particular type of organism

2973
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:28,880
or particular type of system responding

2974
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:31,199
in ways uh that

2975
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:32,239
again

2976
01:46:32,239 --> 01:46:34,080
are responding in ways that keep it

2977
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:35,199
centered

2978
01:46:35,199 --> 01:46:36,960
and whether or not this whether or not

2979
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:39,040
that kind of valids

2980
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:42,080
a bacteria might climb a gradient of

2981
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:44,480
glucose for example

2982
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:48,400
but bacterium might not have any type of

2983
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,639
uh you know experience of that glucose

2984
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:52,320
gradient

2985
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:55,040
but somehow we might say that that

2986
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:56,960
bacterium is actually it's it's

2987
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:59,119
positively valenced it's

2988
01:46:59,119 --> 01:47:02,239
something that it's attracted to

2989
01:47:02,239 --> 01:47:04,960
right uh and maybe in maybe in simpler

2990
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:06,560
systems you have something more like the

2991
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:08,960
notion of valence rather than affect but

2992
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:10,400
a certain period of uh you know

2993
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:12,239
complexity after a certain perhaps a

2994
01:47:12,239 --> 01:47:14,960
degree of complexity arises

2995
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:15,760
uh

2996
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:17,360
affect is very important and i think

2997
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:19,199
particularly when it comes into

2998
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:21,360
multicellular systems

2999
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:22,400
that

3000
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:24,639
perhaps uh

3001
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:26,800
that have to actually

3002
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,159
compute

3003
01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:29,360
larger like

3004
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,280
much more information has to compete

3005
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:32,639
much more information and has to

3006
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:33,920
interact in their environments their

3007
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:36,000
environmental niches are much more uh

3008
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,400
using a term by chem sterling much more

3009
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:41,040
con opaque

3010
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:42,639
so uh

3011
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:44,880
effective information effective the

3012
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,639
matter in which we can use affect and

3013
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:49,040
how that effect how that affects

3014
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:50,880
uh cognition

3015
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:52,159
i think it becomes quite important

3016
01:47:52,159 --> 01:47:54,400
important but i'm not exactly sure

3017
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:55,440
what what the

3018
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:57,760
number one is probably not a line

3019
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:00,560
uh it probably develops

3020
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:03,199
but just what that function is is a

3021
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:04,560
different story i don't know do you have

3022
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:06,800
any ideas about that

3023
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:07,679
i

3024
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:08,960
don't have an idea about where that

3025
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:10,320
would start but i feel like it would

3026
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:12,239
fall off so we might have the small

3027
01:48:12,239 --> 01:48:15,360
scale like our bobtail squid and vibrio

3028
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:16,960
who might have something like valence

3029
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:18,320
that they're responding to and then as

3030
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:20,480
we get slightly larger organisms you

3031
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:22,400
know dogs people

3032
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,080
then affect will play

3033
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:26,639
a lot more of a role but then as we

3034
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:28,960
have bigger systems like multiple humans

3035
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:31,440
what is the effective like

3036
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:34,719
state of a crowd of people like we can

3037
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:36,639
ascribe like they look angry or they

3038
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:39,440
sound angry but they as a crowd are they

3039
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:41,440
feeling

3040
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:43,040
something as a crowd kind of like group

3041
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:45,280
intentionality is there a group

3042
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:46,800
effective state it might kind of start

3043
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:48,159
falling off again so you might have this

3044
01:48:48,159 --> 01:48:50,960
sort of u-shaped curve of where

3045
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:52,960
valence matters and then somewhere here

3046
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:55,040
in the sweet spot

3047
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:57,040
effective states or emotions really

3048
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:59,040
matter

3049
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:00,960
that's a that's super

3050
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:02,560
definitely something to absolutely

3051
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:04,800
something i want to think about

3052
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:08,080
oh and also reminiscent of the

3053
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:10,800
discussion of affect as well as higher

3054
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:13,760
order parameters in deep parametric

3055
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,679
active inference where we even talked

3056
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:18,560
about which states were opaque or not

3057
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:20,480
whereas opaque usually meaning like you

3058
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:22,960
can't see it you can't see in but

3059
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:24,239
actually the opaque mental states are

3060
01:49:24,239 --> 01:49:26,000
the ones that we do experience so that

3061
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,119
was in the sandved smith paper and

3062
01:49:29,119 --> 01:49:30,239
whether

3063
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:32,239
other systems feel things what is it

3064
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:33,679
like to be a squid what is it like to be

3065
01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:36,239
a symbiosis that's the phenomenology and

3066
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:38,560
the metaphysics but

3067
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:40,080
what is it like for us to model that

3068
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:42,080
system as if there's a higher level

3069
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:43,760
control parameter

3070
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:45,679
we can know what that's like it's a lot

3071
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:47,920
like this conversation

3072
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:50,239
so just

3073
01:49:50,239 --> 01:49:52,239
everybody can provide a last

3074
01:49:52,239 --> 01:49:55,040
comment on this awesome discussion i

3075
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:57,760
think the takeaway for me

3076
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:59,679
is that in a um

3077
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:02,320
post-darwin biology

3078
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:05,199
it's easy to use the simplified trifecta

3079
01:50:05,199 --> 01:50:07,280
of evolution by natural selection

3080
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:09,679
phenotypic variability heritability of

3081
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:11,599
the phenotype fitness correlation and

3082
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:14,080
variation in fitness and then

3083
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:16,800
project that onto all the kinds of

3084
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:19,280
individuality cognitive rights and

3085
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:21,599
responsibilities the economic unit the

3086
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:24,560
sentient unit all of those as just

3087
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:26,480
simply under the coattails of the

3088
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:28,800
darwinian replicator and i think

3089
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:30,080
pluralism

3090
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:31,679
and a bevy of other perspectives

3091
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:34,880
suggests that that's just not the case

3092
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:37,040
blue and then anyone else with a last

3093
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:38,639
comment

3094
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:40,719

coming i really enjoyed this discussion

3096
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,800
and i just started reading your paper

3097
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:47,360
your 2021 paper with pizzullo uh the

3098
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:49,679
modeling ourselves um and i hope you'd

3099
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:51,440
consider coming back to talk about it

3100

paper and coming to talk about it and

3111
01:51:13,599 --> 01:51:15,840
