00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,760
hello everybody

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,639
welcome to active lab live stream number

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,280
30.2 today it is

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,560
october 12th 2021

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,279
and we're having our second discussion

6
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,560
group discussion

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,359
on the paper of matt sims

8
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,680
how to count biological minds symbiosis

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,920
the free energy principle and reciprocal

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,640
multi-scale integration

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,040
welcome to the active inference lab

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,440
we are a participatory online lab that

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,920
is communicating learning and practicing

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,079
applied active inference you can find us

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,640
at the links here on this page

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,559
this is a recorded and archived live

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,000
stream so please provide us with

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,640
feedback so we can improve on our work

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,320
all backgrounds and perspectives are

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,719
welcome here and we'll be following good

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,840
video etiquette for live

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,600
streams at this short link you can see

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,160
some of the past present and future live

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,239
streams in the lab

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,119
and

26
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,080
in the first tab you'll see the tuesday

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,560
numbered live stream so every tuesday we

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,040
have a participatory group discussion

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,200
two weeks per paper and then there's the

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,040
dot zero video which is just sort of a

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,200
contextualizing video

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,720
and then these other tabs like guest

33
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,360
stream model stream and math stream are

34
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,680
opportunities for just one-off events on

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,479
any

36
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,720
topic that people think is relevant for

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,880
the lab so get in touch if you want to

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,600
join one or co-organize one of these

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,000
streams

40
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,960
today in 30.2 we're going to be

41
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,520
continuing to learn and discuss this

42
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,840
awesome paper by matthew sims

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,000
how to count biological minds

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,280
and

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,479
we're just

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,360
having fun and discussing

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,320
last week we had matt join which was a

48
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,079
great discussion

49
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,119
and

50
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,520
we look forward to everyone's input and

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,280
if you're watching in the live chat or

52
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,200
if you're leaving a comment later look

53
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,159
forward to continuing the discussion

54
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,318
today we're pretty much just going to

55
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,720
introduce ourselves and say hello

56
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,959
and then we will

57
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,000
go

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,480
wherever we feel relevance

59
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,640
and explore different questions people

60
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,599
can ask about a figure or a section of

61
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,000
the text and then also blue

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,840
and others have prepared some discussion

63
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,560
questions to get into

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,720
so we can start with the warm-up and

65
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,400
introductions

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,360
so i'm daniel and i'm a researcher in

67
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,800
california

68
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,000
and

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,760
i think the thing i'm excited about

70
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,640
today

71
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,040
just like with many dot twos

72
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,840
is taking a lot of these cool ideas that

73
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,160
came up in the paper and in the dot zero

74
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,599
and the dot one

75
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,360
and then

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,920
synthesizing and consolidating and then

77
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,959
asking okay well now what next

78
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,800
how do we go from this

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,000
conversation theory users and resources

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,400
reciprocal multi-scale integration

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,640
and then apply it to

82
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,560
different systems

83
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,120
so i think that will be a fun topic and

84
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,400
i'll pass to stephen

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,120
thank you yes steven here i'm in toronto

86
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,519
on a nice sunny day and um

87
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,959
i'm really interested as well actually

88
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,280
in these building on these ideas i'm

89
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,760
really excited that the folk psychology

90
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,680
and folk biology was brought up and i

91
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,959
think that

92
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,720
that gives permission i think to build

93
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,599
that further in and

94
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,599
maybe extends into

95
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,680
how our phenomenology

96
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,280
connects to our

97
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,120
folk psychology because our folk

98
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,480
psychology allows us all to be

99
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,560
inherent psychologists of ourselves

100
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,959
maybe so that's interesting

101
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,879
and we just enjoy it

102
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,120
analyzing our own reality so i'm going

103
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,280
to pass it over to dave um

104
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,840
yep i'm in the mountains of the

105
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,840
philippines

106
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,400
and uh it's the end of the rainy season

107
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,599
and so we'll have no weather until

108
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,120
next year

109
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,400
um i am pumped up about the

110
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,879
multiple disciplines that are coming

111
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,440
together in the discussion of the paper

112
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,238
that we're doing now and also about

113
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,880
bobby azarian who is not afraid to jump

114
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,759
down into the trenches and face the

115
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,320
lunatics with their machetes and and

116
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,639
even less pleasant uh

117
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,680
arms um

118
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,320
and getting a note together to him to

119
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,080
suggest some topics that we might want

120
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,040
to

121
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,360
talk about

122
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,840
well two two things one off a question

123
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,160
about bobby but first was when you said

124
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,840
there's no weather

125
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,680
it's kind of like what stephen said

126
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,160
about folk psychology

127
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
no experience you know just like well

128
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,759
now i'm awake and now experience is

129
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,880
going to stop

130
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,400
it's kind of like weather stopping like

131
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,320
weather is always happening

132
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,199
it's always changing in different ways

133
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,600
and our experience is also always

134
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,280
happening and always in different ways

135
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,880
but just like weather sometimes only

136
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,120
gets studied or discussed in the context

137
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,800
of catastrophe

138
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,720
or pathology

139
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,520
or of extremely unusual events

140
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,520
there's this like baseline weather

141
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,120
that's just the climate

142
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,080
and so

143
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,600
that's very interesting about our

144
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,120
day-to-day

145
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,600
felt realities and then how everybody is

146
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,759
in the driver's seat with respect to

147
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,720
their

148
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,440
experience so sort of the mundaneness of

149
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,400
weather

150
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,479
the mundaneness of experience but also

151
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,000
it's something that can be really

152
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,880
unpacked stephen

153
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,720
yeah exactly the mundaneness is

154
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,000
interesting especially when you think of

155
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,680
the priors that set things up because um

156
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,600
in some ways it's like

157
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,520
the psychologist

158
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,400
in psychology gets to decide

159
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,360
on

160
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,960
the modeling that's going to be used to

161
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,880
look at people whereas in folk

162
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,440
psychology this is the implicit

163
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,120
modeling that we are

164
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,520
framing ourselves around

165
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,199
and of course the same with the folk

166
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,120
biology which this paper brings up and

167
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,680
maybe the folk physics and whatever so

168
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,360
these kind of

169
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,600
implicit priors

170
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,120
um

171
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,280
you can't get away from them and maybe

172
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,120
in a way it brings us into this interest

173
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
in are those priors

174
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,880
how much of them are psychological or

175
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,400
are they more like practice based

176
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
phenomenological

177
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,840
questions so it's an interesting balance

178
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,720
there cool

179
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,319
and then the second question so bobby um

180
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,400
azarian is going to be doing a guest

181
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,520
stream in november we have a few guest

182
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,160
streams coming up so um

183
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,720
there's multiple but dave what made you

184
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,479
excited about

185
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,319
his presentation or work with the

186
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,960
universal bayesianism

187
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,520
well it's not so much that particular

188
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,080
approach it's that he's been doing a lot

189
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,400
of work on cult formation uh cult

190
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,120
dynamics the growth of violent cults

191
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,240
especially in the us right now and that

192
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,800
directly ties into

193
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,319
philip guerin's

194
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:20,720
work on the uh neuroscience of delusion

195
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,280
okay very interesting and so i'm just

196
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,199
showing on the screen

197
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,400
those are the dates november 19th

198
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,599
is um with bobby but we'll have um

199
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,080
greg enriquez on the

200
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,720
11th or on october 22nd for number 11

201
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,080
then martin boots for 12 on october 25th

202
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,720
adam saffron on november 8th and then

203
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,039
november 19th so cool guest streams

204
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,400
coming up and of course everyone's

205
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,560
always welcome to join so let's return

206
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,400
yeah i didn't notice you've gotten books

207
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,759
great i am very pleased

208
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,560
yeah

209
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,080
sometimes people just sneak in there you

210
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,879
know

211
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,199
um okay so let's

212
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,400
return to

213
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,919
30.2

214
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,520
and uh

215
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,160
i'm sure blue will join so let's just

216
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,000
save some

217
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,680
tasty pieces for her that she added in

218
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,160
and then otherwise i think we can

219
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,520
maybe let's start with these

220
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,960
questions on

221
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,000
seven

222
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,720
so

223
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,759
blue

224
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,440
in absentee

225
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,199
asynchronous blue

226
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,960
our favorite shade

227
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,199
contributing to the discussion

228
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,000
so

229
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,759
let's see what we

230
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,760
think and if we can connect it to

231
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,839
some of the ideas or sections or figures

232
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,240
of the paper

233
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,039
at any given time can agents act

234
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,120
autonomously as long as there is a

235
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,360
defined prior

236
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,880
and then i think maybe that's connected

237
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,240
to the second question is there a

238
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,399
difference between a cognizer and an

239
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,839
autonomous agent

240
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,800
so how are the terms of

241
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,720
cognition

242
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,519
agent slash agency and autonomy

243
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,279
how do these terms connect

244
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,399
like if we imagine a three-dimensional

245
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,600
space

246
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,279
and we think okay you could have you

247
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,600
know ten zero zero you have ten

248
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,279
cognition zero agency zero autonomy

249
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,760
what is the space of the possible

250
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,880
of cognition agency and autonomy

251
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,080
and then how are these different terms

252
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,800
linked are one out of necessity

253
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,880
uh leading the other or lagging the

254
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,640
other so

255
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,920
stephen and then dave

256
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,000
i mean this question about a defined

257
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,800
prior i mean the other option is

258
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,360
is it if they don't need a defined prior

259
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,600
and they can build up

260
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,800
their

261
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,420
inference

262
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,839
[Music]

263
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,399
process

264
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,880
without having that prior so i i'm not

265
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,120
sure which way that might be the most

266
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,880
important is it is the autonomous agent

267
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,320
obviously we're assuming the agent can

268
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,360
survive

269
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,880
you know this is not a

270
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,640
bolt of lightning or something so it's

271
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,399
something that can have

272
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,000
some sort of non-equilibrium steady

273
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,600
state over time

274
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,399
is it more about the autonomous agent

275
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,839
being able to

276
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,640
act and

277
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,120
process its active inference

278
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,040
independently of others

279
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,040
and that's maybe more key maybe that's

280
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,079
the sort of thing that happens with

281
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,040
cancer as well you know um so i don't

282
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,320
know

283
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,920
welcome blue we're just on slide seven

284
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,600
working through some of your interesting

285
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,480
questions dave

286
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,560
yeah on that the first question um

287
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,440
in the dialogue between christian and

288
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,920
marx solms

289
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,079
they use prior

290
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,079
basically to mean an affect or the other

291
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,320
brain stem resident

292
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,760
um

293
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,160
biological imperatives

294
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,000
and um

295
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,800
i think some would tell you that except

296
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,760
in

297
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,120
anesthesia you know deep deep anesthesia

298
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,240
and perhaps coma there's always

299
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,959
operative priors because you really

300
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,680
can't uh dissociate

301
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,640
the um

302
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,720
homeostatic

303
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,959
goal seeking from the higher processes

304
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:29,839
since

305
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,279
of the higher processes are

306
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,240
completely dependent on and shaped by

307
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,040
the

308
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,600
uh the homeostatic

309
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,120
uh activities and i wouldn't even accept

310
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,720
coma uh without qualification because of

311
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,560
the i don't know if this research has

312
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,639
been worn out but there are therapists

313
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,880
who have simply proceeded under the

314
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,560
assumption that

315
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,079
um

316
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,959
deeply comatose individuals actually are

317
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,480
taking something away from their

318
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,720
experience and they're finding that in

319
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,440
recovery from coma that yeah if you talk

320
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
to people on a daily basis so you talk

321
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,760
about interesting things or unresolved

322
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,560
problems this shapes the way they're

323
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,839
going to

324
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,079
uh talk about their experience

325
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,120
afterwards uh one thing that happens uh

326
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,880
is that people

327
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,000
people's thinking becomes extremely

328
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,920
slow

329
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,720
minutes rather than second

330
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,320
and that if you actually speed up videos

331
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,279
of the response of

332
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,600
comatose individuals

333
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,320
you'll see responsible just like if you

334
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,600
slow down

335
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,320
high resolution videos of infants you'll

336
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,399
see that yes they're highly attuned to

337
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,320
what's going on around them they're

338
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,279
they do have their own priors

339
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,880
that

340
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,040
through which they're responding to

341
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,440
events and actually shaping them in a

342
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,720
healthy diet

343
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,839
interesting

344
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,040
so i think starting with uh

345
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,959
with steven's point and then anyone can

346
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,560
of course can just raise their hand or

347
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,399
write a question live chat

348
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,920
so the question about starting with the

349
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,880
prior

350
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,200
and whether we start with a very defined

351
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,600
prior like a domain specific prior or

352
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,279
whether that's learnt

353
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,440
that is reminiscent of the difference

354
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,839
between first order cybernetics and then

355
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,639
higher order cybernetics like the first

356
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,040
order cybernetics of chemistry is your

357
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,519
priors on chemistry in the second order

358
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,480
would be

359
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,720
your approach to learning

360
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,720
or your dynamics of flexibility around

361
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,199
study habits or around updating your

362
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,199
generative model of chemistry as well as

363
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,959
the second order generative model of

364
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:49,920
learning

365
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,720
so

366
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,920
as we

367
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,160
start to sort of meet in the middle with

368
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,399
building active inference up

369
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,000
to

370
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,320
describe and model these increasingly

371
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,519
recursive

372
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,160
and symbolic cognizers

373
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,839
will start to see

374
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,680
the movement from models that merely

375
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,160
describe the mountain car

376
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,360
into

377
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,519
models of mental action

378
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,560
into

379
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,680
higher order cybernetic models of mental

380
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,920
action so that will be very

381
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,040
cool

382
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,720
and then um i think you mentioned the

383
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,079
lightning bolt

384
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,800
and so i was coming back to this this um

385
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,639
trilemma or these three terms there's

386
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,959
more terms could be added like

387
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,279
um does lightning bolt have agency does

388
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,880
it have autonomy

389
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,680
well

390
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,240
it sure seems to just act the way that

391
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,560
it's apt to so it seems like an

392
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,800
autonomous system it's not waiting for a

393
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,560
bluetooth connection with something else

394
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,560
so it's high autonomy

395
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,040
and then does it have agency though and

396
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,560
so how is

397
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,920
there a difference

398
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,839
and then cognition especially because

399
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,279
the example of the lightning bolt it's

400
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,480
electricity

401
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,040
so if what we've been talking about with

402
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,519
um professor levin and others is that

403
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,199
like bioelectricity is sort of the

404
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,360
fundamental that's where

405
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,920
biotic and abiotic cognition

406
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,360
come together or where they they blur

407
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,639
so then is a lightning bolt cognitive

408
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,639
and

409
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,839
so that was and then just a last

410
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:20,959
comment

411
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,959
was the speed of perception and

412
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,480
cognition action

413
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,720
well active inference is about

414
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,120
integrated modeling of perception

415
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,199
cognition and action

416
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,880
so then we're in a quasi-computational

417
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,000
framework

418
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,639
there are computationalists among us

419
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,079
people who think that cognition is

420
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,320
computation as well as people who take

421
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,440
more nuanced steps or reject that notion

422
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,519
but this is kind of like our clock speed

423
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,079
this is like the speed of that loop

424
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,079
what's the tick speed

425
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,360
of the generative model and that relates

426
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,040
to the thickness of our temporal

427
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,199
experience like flickering images at 30

428
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,320
per second

429
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,240
are perceived as continuous

430
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,320
so we don't know exactly what the clock

431
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,000
speed is or whether a clock speed is

432
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,639
even the apt metaphor but surely there

433
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,120
are stimuli that are so close spatially

434
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,440
or temporally we cannot tell the

435
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,639
difference

436
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,880
so it was just cool to hear like that

437
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,399
different ages and different conditions

438
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,880
might have different um

439
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,120
parameters for their internal generative

440
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,680
model and perception action loops

441
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,959
blue and then anyone else

442
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,279
so going back to whether or not a

443
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,839
lightning bolt um has an agency it

444
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,839
certainly seems that like if there is a

445
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,759
defined fire like for a lightning bolt

446
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,560
there's a defined like prior state that

447
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,800
you know like the dielectric constant

448
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,399
has to break down for the lightning bolt

449
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,519
to be able to

450
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,480
occur

451
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,600
so as long as there's that defined prior

452
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,560
then

453
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,560
yes like the uh the lightning bolt acts

454
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,000
autonomously

455
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,120
but but

456
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,199
does it have agency is like

457
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,839
well what's the goal of the lightning

458
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:00,880
bolt

459
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,079
is it to

460
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,319
like minimize the electricity build up

461
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,359
in the cloud or like what would the goal

462
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,119
of a lightning bolt be

463
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,439
um and so

464
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,599
that's kind of what you think about like

465
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,000
even or what i think about

466
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,599
when it comes to

467
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,679
like cells okay the goal of a single

468
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,799
cell organism is to maintain homeostasis

469
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,959
at some you know set point or within

470
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,640
some range

471
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
so but a lightning bolt really what's

472
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,200
the goal of a lightning bolt um and so i

473
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,679
think about that

474
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,760
i don't know so it does a lightning bolt

475
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,000
have a goal and and that's kind of where

476
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,080
the sense of agency

477
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,720
comes into play for me um and like yeah

478
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,919
if you define the goal like in a you

479
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,000
know autonomous car like your goal is to

480
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,559
safely transport people from a to b

481
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,559
without running anyone over or getting

482
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,280
smashed like or that's very simple i

483
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,640
know but you know obeying all the

484
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,200
traffic tools and so forth so

485
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,960
you can establish a goal for an

486
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,720
autonomous car but does the car come up

487
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,320
with its own goal

488
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,559
or is that like a human-driven goal and

489
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,559
is the car then a tool

490
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,520
for the humans so so there's like some

491
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,760
fuzzy boundaries here that kind of

492
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,200
always

493
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,320
point toward um the life-mind continuity

494
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,480
thesis which i think we probably haven't

495
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,280
gone to yet but maybe we'll get there

496
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,760
um where life has to

497
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,640
happen at some degree for for

498
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,520
um

499
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,080
cognition to occur maybe or maybe not

500
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,720
very cool so

501
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,640
the goal of the lightning bolt so let's

502
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,559
think of a few you know physical systems

503
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,120
we know and love like a ball rolling

504
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,200
down to the bottom of a bowl

505
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,679
it's minimizing its kinetic energy

506
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,760
differential that's one description not

507
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,280
to say that's the explanation but it's

508
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,520
minimizing something

509
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,679
by rolling to the bottom of the bowl

510
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,960
without fail

511
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,400
similarly when there's an electric

512
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,960
charge buildup between the cloud and the

513
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,360
ground or between two

514
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,960
electric components inside of a

515
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,840
electronic device there's like a zap of

516
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,080
electricity that can also be understood

517
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,000
in terms of minimizing some energy

518
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,840
differential

519
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,080
that's what's interesting about active

520
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,240
inference is we're also thinking about

521
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,919
minimizing

522
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,520
differentials

523
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,840
of

524
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,280
information and so

525
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,799
what stories

526
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,799
are explanations or descriptions of the

527
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,039
ball rolling down kinetically or the

528
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,840
lightning strike electromagnetically

529
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,679
and then are we going to have the exact

530
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,200
same template

531
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,559
of explanation

532
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,360
for

533
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,080
action of biological entities

534
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,559
so that's a and where it is teleology

535
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,160
and directedness

536
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,960
like

537
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,039
is the ball rolling into the bottom of

538
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,440
the bowl is that end directed or is it

539
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,600
just directed only by approximate

540
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,320
teleology like a next step only so

541
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,559
people say evolution has no end it's

542
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,120
just a local optimization process for

543
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,760
example so it's behavior along those

544
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,440
lines um

545
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,360
and then the second point then stephen

546
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,200
and dave was like

547
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,480
is the

548
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,280
system of interest the primary cognizer

549
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,440
or is it being used in an extended or an

550
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,600
instrumental fashion

551
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,640
wasn't sure on the answer there but that

552
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,240
speaks to

553
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,000
matt's paper

554
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,799
with the users and the resources

555
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,240
and so there's cases where you have like

556
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
an adaptive active inference agent

557
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,280
utilizing a mere active inferencer

558
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,200
as a tool

559
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
like you could be using a thermometer as

560
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,320
a tool as you investigate the cave

561
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,799
but then there's this other

562
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,360
reciprocal case where actually the the

563
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,280
primary cognizers are sort of adaptive

564
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,760
on both sides so there's a lot to

565
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,520
explore there stephen

566
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,840
yeah the idea of things being either

567
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,200
frozen

568
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,520
at a certain state or having the ability

569
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,640
to be a whole to stay in that state

570
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,840
um i think about um well i mean on a big

571
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,080
scale the sun right the sun

572
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,360
has got an energy differential but

573
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,400
um it's it's it's self-maintaining right

574
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,280
because as it keeps going it more more

575
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,200
material can be fused in the middle and

576
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,240
it keeps

577
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,400
so you get into the broader question of

578
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,919
complex adaptive systems of which

579
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,039
non-equilibrium steady-state systems are

580
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,000
a subset so you've got this um

581
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,840
you know there's an interesting point

582
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,840
there and when you have something which

583
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,320
dissipates and can't form a markovian

584
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,080
sort of boundary

585
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,320
um you so it will lose that but there

586
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,559
are times when you can maintain that for

587
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,080
instance

588
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,960
um if you have a globular molten

589
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,000
silica

590
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,320
plunge it into cold water

591
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,480
you can freeze the liquid state it's

592
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,919
still a liquid but it's glass now

593
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,280
so this same

594
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,360
so it's maintaining

595
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,320
that over longer periods of time

596
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,440
um

597
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,960
but is it

598
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,280
is it still not equal is has it has it

599
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,240
formed is it just waiting to allow its

600
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,080
energy gradient to dissipate or is it

601
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,480
now managed to hold its state more

602
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,120
concretely

603
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,360
very interesting has a true

604
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,120
pattern or structural integrity been

605
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,679
reached or are we just sort of

606
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,960
pausing or freeze freeze thaw

607
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,840
on the energy differential just sort of

608
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,760
make the ball made of velcro so it's

609
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,640
still stuck up there

610
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,440
dave yeah there's a hilarious tour de

611
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,720
force by uh stuart bartlett

612
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,919
on

613
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,840
life as a solution to the planet earth's

614
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,080
dilemma of having too much heat and

615
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,880
needing to get rid of it faster and he

616
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,840
breaks down all these amazing processes

617
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,400
culminating with the reverse krebs

618
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,760
citric acid cycle as increasing the

619
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,559
efficiency with which

620
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,039
heat can be radiated by creating just

621
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,760
the right kinds of molecules

622
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,679
in enough concentration to catalyze that

623
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,840
problem of boy it's hot in here

624
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,080
this um it's kind of like the science

625
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,320
fiction classification i don't know what

626
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,640
class you know class one class two class

627
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,440
three civilizations whether their energy

628
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,480
capacity is like less than a star

629
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,220
equal to a star multiple stars

630
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,640
[Music]

631
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,919
some thermodynamic perspectives on

632
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,440
the emergence and the elaboration of

633
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,720
life

634
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,120
when we see

635
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,279
living systems like schrodinger or scott

636
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,600
david as

637
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,840
entropic systems that are resisting

638
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,760
dissipation and you realize that for

639
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,919
every unit of order that is

640
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,480
constituted inside of the markov blanket

641
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,360
that more disorder must occur outside

642
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,600
you know that it can't be um

643
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,240
free lunch and it isn't going to be one

644
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,320
to one either so you're making an excess

645
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,880
of disorder which is what pulls chemical

646
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,279
reactions forward when you order like

647
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,200
for every you know one pound of muscle

648
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,440
organized on your body

649
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
more than one pound of muscle

650
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,520
equivalence have to be

651
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,480
um

652
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,840
dissipated

653
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,559
and then it is actually this imperative

654
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,960
that's thermodynamic for life to

655
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,360
continue inventing potentially even

656
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,159
increasingly seemingly inefficient

657
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,360
mechanisms

658
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,159
so

659
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,600
that's sometimes what i

660
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,039
think about when someone talks about the

661
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,600
energy use of cryptocurrency i think you

662
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,360
know if you went into the cell and you

663
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,200
said well we already have the enzyme

664
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,720
making the forward reaction why do we

665
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,840
need the one making the backwards

666
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,159
reaction that's wasting energy

667
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:54,960
well

668
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,880
it gives flexibility to the cell and it

669
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,559
pushes the reactions forward and it

670
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,320
gives capacity to regulate very

671
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,960
adaptively so it's not always like we

672
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,960
can just look at the um

673
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,400
the

674
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,919
heat producing light bulb and say that

675
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,320
that's the inefficient one so blue and

676
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,960
then stephen

677
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,400
so

678
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,840
i wonder too thermodynamically um

679
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,679
is like life

680
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,240
ultimately causing like the heat death

681
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,600
of the universe right like are we using

682
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,320
up all of the the thermodynamics free

683
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,720
energy that's available um with the

684
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,080
process of life like we are like in the

685
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,159
scott david sense

686
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,799
um you know entropy secreting right

687
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,799
we're the only entropy i mean life is

688
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,679
the only entropy minimizing

689
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,440
thing that i can think of but i mean

690
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,799
it's just ultimately going to lead to

691
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,120
the lack of free energy thermodynamic

692
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,919
free energy that's available to do work

693
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,320
um which is just an interesting thing to

694
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,960
think about and then also i was you know

695
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,640
listening to some older live streams and

696
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,760
um

697
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,000
maybe uh maybe dave actually probably

698
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,720
has the knowledge to kind of clarify for

699
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,679
me but

700
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,760
i always um

701
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,200
thought that informational free energy

702
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,520
was fundamentally connected to

703
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,400
thermodynamic free energy um

704
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,520
and so

705
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,480
is like in what someone had suggested

706
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,360
that

707
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,240
um that was not the intention of info

708
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,000
like of the free energy principle was

709
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,400
never supposed to involve thermodynamics

710
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,000
like initially

711
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,400
um and i just wonder

712
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,159
um is that like some abstract bridge

713
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,080
that was formed the connection between

714
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,919
infodynamic and thermodynamic um entropy

715
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,720
or is that a real concrete

716
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,520
um

717
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,360
connection and so for for me it's

718
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,720
something i've always thought about as

719
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,120
as like you know links through physics

720
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,880
and statistical physics like those two

721
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,039
things go together

722
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,640
but is there a disconnect there that i'm

723
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,960
perhaps not aware of and um was the free

724
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,200
energy principle not meant to include

725
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,919
thermodynamics so i would love to hear

726
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,000
what um you guys think about that

727
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,880
yeah dave go for it and then stephen

728
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,000
yeah you know i think both entropy and

729
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,960
the free energy principle are higher

730
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,000
order

731
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,760
metaphors or analogies at least um

732
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,480
i'm guessing an entropy is roughly a

733
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,840
third level analogy you have to

734
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,919
go up to that level of ramification to

735
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,000
cover the various cases

736
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
um

737
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,679
but there are people working on that i

738
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,200
think i sent you a paper by uh sean

739
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,320
carroll on the thermodynamic

740
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,480
uh interpretation of of

741
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,799
what was it the free energy principle i

742
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,880
just sent that a couple of days ago i

743
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,559
don't know if you saw that i dropped it

744
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,240
in

745
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,240
one of the chats

746
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,840
dropped it in the corner of a labyrinth

747
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,720
yeah

748
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,399
yeah i'm going to have to go back to

749
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,919
buying borges

750
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,080
i think he's i've left too much in his

751
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,039
various lab room

752
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,600
stephen

753
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,279
yeah there's a couple of good points

754
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,200
there um i suppose one thing in terms of

755
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,880
life it's it's trying to stay in that

756
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,960
golgi locked zone so there's times when

757
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,640
it's trying to

758
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,960
well in terms of heat anyway

759
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,760
um

760
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,679
get rid you know reduce the heat and

761
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,000
sometimes it might want to gain heat

762
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,720
but

763
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,120
it doesn't really care per se it's like

764
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,440
the the niche itself will be have a

765
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,039
greater fitness

766
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,679
and if there's enough fluctuations over

767
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,640
time and enough feedback loops in theory

768
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,399
you'll sort of

769
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,520
gain

770
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,320
the carbon dioxide levels as best can

771
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,080
serve

772
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,919
the overall

773
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,120
production of carbon mass in theory

774
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,600
but in terms of the piece around it's

775
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,919
really it's a good conversation around

776
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,320
um active inference versus the free

777
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,080
energy principle because the free energy

778
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,880
principle or variational free energy

779
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,399
um

780
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,640
jeffrey hinton's work and the

781
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,720
recognition models and work that just

782
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,600
takes you know perceptual

783
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,880
um

784
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,679
data coming in with deep mind can work

785
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:22,559
with

786
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,200
reducing free energy information but

787
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,760
when you bring action into the game

788
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,279
so that's the interesting thing because

789
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,600
then it's the action that brings in the

790
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,760
energy in a way because

791
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,200
by the action being more efficient

792
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,559
the um

793
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,880
the energy sort of becomes part of the

794
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,240
landscape

795
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,200
so

796
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,159
um whereas the perception

797
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,279
piece

798
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,000
you're kind of tied more to

799
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,840
if there was no actual active influence

800
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,600
and just bayesian influence it's kind of

801
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,000
all information up and down but

802
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,679
once you start bringing action into the

803
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,120
game

804
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,360
that's when it starts to get a bit

805
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,678
more interesting

806
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,720
it's a lot to

807
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,399
think about

808
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,159
information

809
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,840
is usually

810
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,360
framed more on the inference side than

811
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,039
the action site

812
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,120
we know there are information theoretic

813
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,279
approaches to control theory

814
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,880
and there's

815
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,039
all kinds of connections that you know

816
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,919
2021 we can look back at and say that

817
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,760
have been made but

818
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,600
information is

819
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,760
very aligned with knowledge and

820
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,120
inference

821
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,440
whereas

822
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,120
thermodynamics brings in

823
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,399
physical constraints energy and action

824
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,399
like what is temperature if not a

825
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,399
summary descriptor of

826
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,440
the actions of molecules

827
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,360
whereas information

828
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,760
tends to be a little bit more abstracted

829
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
and disembodied

830
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,679
and thermodynamics even if it hasn't

831
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,039
been

832
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,080
connected to 4e cognition extended

833
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,519
embedded and cultured etc

834
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,559
it at least is closer to it like the the

835
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,679
pressure volume relationships of a gas

836
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,039
they relate to

837
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,799
its context

838
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,159
and to

839
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,279
how it is actually enacting

840
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,720
physics

841
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,640
so then if we think about in

842
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,000
informational physics

843
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,279
first off how far can we get with

844
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,600
bringing thermodynamics

845
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,240
into information

846
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,320
big topic and then

847
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,559
where is control

848
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,840
and action

849
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,840
in that kind of a model stephen

850
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,679
yeah this is interesting to bring in and

851
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,840
also if you go back to gibbs free energy

852
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,799
and

853
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,799
the way it was traditionally used i mean

854
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,440
you basically have reactants

855
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,720
and you have products which is basically

856
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,960
where we were in terms of an equilibrium

857
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,200
state and where we ended up

858
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,640
and then there's a force that's going to

859
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,960
drive that there's an enthalpic force

860
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,440
i.e an energy change

861
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,600
which will drive things

862
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,880
um

863
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,960
and will succeed depending on the

864
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,799
activation energy of whatever's in

865
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,559
between

866
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,960
which can be calculated

867
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,840
and then there's this kind of

868
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,279
entropic force

869
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,240
which is basically cough cough um

870
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,880
it's just inferred basically by what the

871
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,200
reaction actually did but because you're

872
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,960
only going from equilibrium state to

873
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,559
equilibrium state

874
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,320
whatever happens in the middle was just

875
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,519
like

876
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,799
i don't know

877
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,799
let's be that's basically if you if the

878
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,320
truth be told it's just entropy right so

879
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,000
but that's not it's not just this

880
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
black box in this case it's actually all

881
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,600
the stuff that's going on on the

882
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,120
journeys

883
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,720
is where active influence is sort of in

884
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,279
the process so in tropy

885
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,640
or thermodynamic entropy

886
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,960
it's kind of interesting because

887
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,519
there's there is somehow this enthalpic

888
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,720
term in terms of energy that there's an

889
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,279
entropic force they call it in chemistry

890
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,799
which is like how the entropic shift

891
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,200
sort of pushes the reaction

892
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,240
and gives it a force which then combines

893
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,159
with the enthalpic force which is

894
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,679
basically just whether it's going to

895
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,519
give off loads of heat or

896
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,799
absorb heat

897
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,360
oh sorry i should say energy absorbable

898
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,159
um

899
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,039
you know

900
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,080
or emit energy so

901
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,200
this is where the the the

902
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,600
i think it's not entirely clear quite

903
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,159
how that might mix up in and maybe

904
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,919
sometimes it's safe is to not make the

905
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,120
analogy because it's non-equilibrium

906
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,960
and non-equilibrium chemistry has only

907
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,679
really started to happen in any sort of

908
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,559
coherent way since the 1990s in terms of

909
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,880
research it's all been equilibrium state

910
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,799
equilibrium state and

911
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,840
hand-waving in the middle

912
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,800
thanks steven blue

913
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,719
so

914
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,399
i um

915
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,960
like whatever happens in the middle uh i

916
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,760
only had abbreviated p chem and like

917
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,520
this kind of makes me wish that i had

918
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,679
more and you know then like a full

919
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,079
semester of thermodynamics to to really

920
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,159
like be able to screw these pieces

921
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,879
together but but maybe they don't all

922
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,399
actually screw together

923
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,040
with a perfect fit so i mean i think

924
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,359
about okay is it an exothermic or an

925
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,280
endothermic reaction does energy go in

926
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,119
or does energy come out

927
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,918
and essentially all life is

928
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:46,639
like

929
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,480
all of life is endothermic like some

930
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,639
energy has to go in and where is that

931
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,960
energy in life like because we exist in

932
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,879
this non-equilibrium point like life

933
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:55,760
isn't

934
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,000
spontaneous and so where is this like

935
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,920
storage happening

936
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,119
and like in some

937
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,440
like maybe it's a very abstract link but

938
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,119
but i think about the energy that going

939
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,760
that goes into creating life as

940
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
information because it's essentially

941
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,560
this dna blueprint that we all have that

942
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,640
carries on from generation to generation

943
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,320
that is

944
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,560
the catalyst for the reactions that

945
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,160
occur that create

946
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,040
life

947
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,520
um so i that's just always i don't know

948
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,760
how i think about it

949
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,119
here's here's one image that you'll see

950
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,079
on your

951
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,359
shared screen

952
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,599
so this relates to gibbs free energy i

953
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,880
mean

954
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,240
you mentioned it we've been talking a

955
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,640
little bit about chemistry

956
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,599
and so

957
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,640
this is already pre-adapted

958
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,280
to instead of be the gibbs free energy

959
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,240
it's like

960
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,320
the pain axis so we can

961
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,880
quibble with the specific metaphor but

962
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,880
the the piece that i think is

963
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,640
interesting is the difference between

964
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,480
the thermodynamically favored and the

965
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,160
kinetically favored

966
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,680
reactions

967
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,440
so the green line is kinetically favored

968
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,040
like

969
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,359
if there's a ball rolling it's easier to

970
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,040
climb the b hill

971
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,720
so it's easier to get on that there's

972
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,960
less friction less of a activation

973
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,400
energy cost

974
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,160
and therefore it's kinetically more

975
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,040
accessible to take the green route to

976
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,880
get you to product d

977
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,119
and then that a minus d is the delta

978
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,720
free energy

979
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,880
whereas the thermodynamically favored

980
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,200
product which is like a to e this is

981
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,880
like a complete combustion versus a

982
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,119
partial combustion more energy is

983
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,760
released there's a bigger delta g

984
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,800
but

985
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,480
that product may not be as kinetically

986
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,359
accessible and so this is like classic

987
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,640
ochem

988
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,880
chorus questions

989
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,320
some reactions you want to do them

990
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,680
really hot

991
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,280
because you just want to get over a

992
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,280
kinetic barrier and wherever you end up

993
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,640
is going to be okay

994
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,160
other times you want to carry out the

995
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,000
reaction very slowly

996
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,400
so that you can be sure that the only

997
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,880
high energy balls that come across

998
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,200
are only going to take this green road

999
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,440
and so it doesn't like combust so you

1000
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,200
keep the reaction cold

1001
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,880
and then in this example

1002
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,560
it's already been connected to sort of

1003
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,200
behavioral economics like making a bad

1004
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,280
decision versus making a good decision

1005
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,640
you know you're choosing what to eat for

1006
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,680
dinner is it going to be something with

1007
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,960
a low

1008
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,000
barrier

1009
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,599
high kinetic accessibility but maybe

1010
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:30,960
not healthy

1011
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,480
but where do we

1012
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,839
transmute

1013
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,880
from the kinetic versus thermodynamics

1014
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,640
of chemicals

1015
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,320
to kinetics and thermodynamics of

1016
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,160
information and decision-making and

1017
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,280
action

1018
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,720
and then

1019
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,680
the closing the triangle would be like

1020
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,359
is there a energetic or a metabolic

1021
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,640
account

1022
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,040
for decision making like it literally

1023
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,079
uses more glucose in your brain to make

1024
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,680
taxing decisions

1025
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,920
and that would sort of close the loop in

1026
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,680
an interesting way

1027
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,040
so stephen then dave

1028
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,800
yeah this is

1029
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,119
so this is also quite useful diagram

1030
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,079
because

1031
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,440
i mean you'd have that kind of

1032
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,079
activation transition state as being the

1033
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,560
kind of the hill right so the higher the

1034
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,400
hill the more

1035
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,200
uh

1036
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,119
energy is needed to make that transition

1037
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,000
state become available but it is a case

1038
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
of it going from left to right within

1039
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,440
reason i mean there is that idea that

1040
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,440
things can move both ways

1041
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,000
but what's interesting is

1042
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,240
the more dilly-dallian

1043
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,920
to use this i know that's an english

1044
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,359
phrase um which i do a lot of but

1045
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:42,320
um

1046
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,680
the more dilly-dallian is not

1047
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,359
necessarily the better thing there right

1048
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,560
because the more dilly dally and the

1049
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,920
molecules are doing the less they're

1050
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,920
going to get over the hump

1051
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,440
because it's really a case of this

1052
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,720
energy

1053
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,640
dynamic and

1054
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,400
entropy being

1055
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,920
maybe going to help um because

1056
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,079
because it in certain cases but normally

1057
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,839
it's a hindrance so something to slow it

1058
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,839
down but the difference is when you're

1059
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,240
dealing with variations

1060
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,400
see when you've got variational free

1061
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,520
energy

1062
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,599
now you can get information the dilly

1063
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:16,960
dalliand

1064
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,040
gives you

1065
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,200
variation in entropy

1066
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,119
and that can give you

1067
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,839
like entropy itself doesn't necessarily

1068
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:28,400
we don't entry is a funny term but noise

1069
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,599
alone doesn't give you any information

1070
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,520
variations in noise can give you

1071
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,800
information

1072
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,680
and variations in noise need a reference

1073
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,200
of none well they don't i don't know if

1074
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,040
they need that but let's say they it

1075
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,560
helps have a non-equilibrium steady

1076
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,720
state to reference against

1077
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,880
that whole non-equilibrium piece and

1078
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,160
complex

1079
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,240
um attractor states and all of that sort

1080
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,960
of stuff doesn't really feature it's not

1081
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,280
an attractor state at the top per se

1082
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,359
it's a it's

1083
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,720
trans a transition state that

1084
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,119
some molecules go to or some

1085
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,599
configurations happen to by chance

1086
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,520
arrive at so

1087
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,800
um

1088
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,880
but obviously it's maybe not like that

1089
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,880
alone there's this kind of inference

1090
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,359
process

1091
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,240
yes so this reaction would be reversible

1092
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,319
but imagine if the ball gets to here now

1093
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,560
it's a 50 50 it could roll either way

1094
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,400
it's at the transition point that's what

1095
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,720
enzymes stabilize transition state

1096
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,280
complexes they reduce activation energy

1097
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,599
barriers but now if you were down here

1098
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,200
in p2

1099
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,640
it would be a positive delta g

1100
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,560
so it'd be energetically uphill because

1101
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,599
this is what they call a

1102
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,319
thermodynamically irreversible reaction

1103
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,040
so keq like the coefficient of how

1104
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,720
complete the reaction is going to

1105
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,520
proceed is going to be way to the right

1106
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,640
on this one

1107
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,400
but if it just looked like a hump

1108
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,359
then

1109
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,720
in the long run

1110
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,160
you'd get

1111
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,000
an even number on both sides it's kind

1112
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,640
of like ergodicity and so it is there's

1113
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,640
a lot that can be seen here so dave and

1114
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,480
then blue

1115
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,400
yeah the uh advertising meme for that

1116
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,480
expensive can opener that needs to be

1117
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,520
pushed

1118
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,640
that would uh bind to

1119
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,079
the

1120
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,359
the hump

1121
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,839
and actually like use i think you said

1122
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:22,560
flatten the hump effectively

1123
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,030
um

1124
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,359
[Music]

1125
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,480
and how does that happen is there i i

1126
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,400
presumably you're getting a reduction of

1127
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,800
cognitive dissonance it no longer looks

1128
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,960
dissonant to imagine oh spending all

1129
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,920
that money i feel so guilty about

1130
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,839
buying a forty dollar book the other day

1131
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,920
how can i justify buying a twelve dollar

1132
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,319
can opener instead of a two dollar one

1133
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,040
and the point of sale oh just tap it's

1134
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,760
lower kinetic friction versus you know

1135
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,680
pull out your um

1136
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,400
your shells count them

1137
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,680
blue and then stephen

1138
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,920
so one critical thing when you're

1139
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,359
talking about the whether or not a

1140
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,720
reaction is reversible or not so

1141
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,359
you when you have the free energy of the

1142
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,880
product and the reactant if the free

1143
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,640
energy is the same it's completely a

1144
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,280
reversible reaction but the fact that

1145
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,119
it's an irreversible reaction is driven

1146
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,319
by the lower free energy of the product

1147
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,000
of the reaction

1148
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,880
and so

1149
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,319
i think about things like um

1150
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,560
you know even just the self-assembly so

1151
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,520
we can talk about self-assembly of life

1152
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,720
of cells but also self-assembly of

1153
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,520
molecules right so so molecules will

1154
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,680
spontaneously like you know salt small

1155
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,480
spontaneously dissolves in water

1156
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,800
and that's driven by charge right and

1157
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,200
hydrogen bonds and you know the polar

1158
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,200
polarity of water and so when you have

1159
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,880
this um

1160
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,119
you know kind of spontaneous reactions

1161
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,960
that occur that are driven by like

1162
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,359
molecular charge is that that's

1163
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,480
again like an information catalyst

1164
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,800
because the charge is is information is

1165
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,240
it positive or negative is it a north

1166
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,040
pole is it a south pole and and so that

1167
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,359
without that kind of information would

1168
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:10,960
these reactions

1169
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,839
push forward

1170
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,960
and one way that computers over the last

1171
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,880
hundred years have

1172
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,119
revolutionized this discussion

1173
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,200
is like if you just say well of course

1174
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,560
information has nothing to do with it

1175
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,480
we're talking about just chemicals

1176
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,240
tossing around in space and we're

1177
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,760
talking about thermodynamics there's no

1178
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,520
need to bring information into it and

1179
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,359
then someone says well i'm talking about

1180
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,079
the chemical components on my hard drive

1181
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,839
or i'm talking about the chemistry of

1182
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,520
this processor

1183
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,200
so it's like

1184
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,280
there is an information thermodynamic

1185
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,760
link we are putting energy into this

1186
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,599
processor or hard drive there is

1187
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,440
chemistry happening

1188
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,359
who will link it

1189
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,440
it's no longer a tenable position to say

1190
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,280
that there just is no linkage or it

1191
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,280
wouldn't even be useful at the very

1192
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,440
least it would be extremely useful

1193
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,480
if not beyond useful to understand this

1194
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,599
nexus so it's kind of like that info

1195
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,599
thermodynamic

1196
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,240
is already well in progress and we're

1197
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,960
using devices that are empirical proofs

1198
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,800
even if the conceptual details are not

1199
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,960
quite filled in yet blue and then

1200
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,119
stephen

1201
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,119
yeah just to respond to that it's like

1202
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,800
maxwell's demon

1203
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,560
is essentially can be

1204
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,440
replaced by a computer right like so a

1205
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,000
computer can sit on top of the box and

1206
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,760
decide whether the you know big

1207
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,359
molecules go this way or the hot

1208
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:36,560
molecules go this way and the cold

1209
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,000
molecules go that way but then you'd

1210
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,079
have to put the computer in a fridge and

1211
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,920
you'd have to plug the fridge in right

1212
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,440
so there's all this like the thought

1213
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,760
experiment of um you know the

1214
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,599
information separation or the

1215
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,040
information filtering taking place um

1216
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,880
with computers and so that's also like

1217
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,119
another direct link between

1218
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,560
the info dynamic and thermodynamic um

1219
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,520
you know

1220
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,040
capacities

1221
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,760
thanks steven

1222
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,400
yeah this is really interesting um

1223
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,520
yeah the this link so what gets really

1224
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,359
interesting is when it that when there's

1225
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:14,560
those endothermic so for instance

1226
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,319
um actually we used to use this when we

1227
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,560
used to do reactions

1228
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,960
in the lab so like if you want to you

1229
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,119
get a load of ice basically dump a load

1230
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,280
of salt into it and then your ice goes

1231
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,680
down to like minus 18 degrees

1232
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,040
right so now you can start doing

1233
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,880
reactions at minus 18 degrees in your

1234
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,319
beaker because you can immerse it in

1235
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:33,599
this so

1236
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:34,800
your um

1237
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,400
well what's just happened there right

1238
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,079
you've just dropped the temperature that

1239
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,160
doesn't make sense so this is where this

1240
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,359
entropic

1241
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:42,720
you know the ice

1242
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,200
the whole way the ice melts and

1243
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,880
thaws and

1244
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,560
if you know if you drop the temperature

1245
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,040
very very

1246
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,319
drop the temperature drop the beat

1247
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:55,920
drop the video chat

1248
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,760
rip steven

1249
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,160
we'll continue though he'll rejoin um

1250
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,119
this

1251
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,040
slide which i just put the image up this

1252
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,040
is like in the wikipedia article on

1253
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,520
kinetic versus thermodynamic control

1254
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,480
like

1255
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,280
one doesn't have to be a chemist

1256
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,599
to see that we're taking a few

1257
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:14,560
very

1258
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,440
interesting esoteric symmetrical

1259
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,040
molecules

1260
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,720
and there's some transition state

1261
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,079
complex

1262
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,440
and then

1263
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,400
in the blue if it's very cold

1264
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,319
it's going to form this product if it's

1265
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:31,280
very warm it forms a different product

1266
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,800
so

1267
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,800
the ratio and the temperature and the

1268
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,880
solvent there's so many details to

1269
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,920
explore

1270
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,160
but it's just an example about like

1271
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,200
thinking fast and slow type one and type

1272
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,440
two conomon you know

1273
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,680
decision making frameworks

1274
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,160
what's the type one decision

1275
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,640
where is it really being thought through

1276
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,960
you know hey chill out

1277
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,880
cool down slow your horses make the

1278
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,240
right decision

1279
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,440
versus

1280
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,720
um

1281
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,200
buying under pressure time pressure for

1282
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,240
decisions

1283
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,160
that's one of the major threats to

1284
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,240
cognitive security and good decision

1285
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,920
making is not having enough time

1286
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,560
or spending too much time on a decision

1287
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,160
which is implicitly taking away time

1288
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,079
from another decision because in the lab

1289
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:21,200
we can just heat things up cool them

1290
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,960
down but you know we only get one

1291
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,400
sequence of action

1292
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,200
so

1293
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,440
in a broader sense we can't just perform

1294
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,240
well

1295
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,559
on single decisions because we also need

1296
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,359
to do that sort of bayesian

1297
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,920
estimation of how much time should we be

1298
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,839
spending on this decision blue

1299
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,079
so just thinking about time i mean time

1300
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,119
is always the

1301
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,520
fourth axis right time is always the

1302
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,920
other other thing but i mean we have

1303
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,400
these things that we say like time is

1304
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,680
money right like so so what is the cost

1305
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,040
of time

1306
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,760
um and like i think about things like

1307
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,480
time effort energy and money as all like

1308
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,480
things that i put in to drive a reaction

1309
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,119
forward like things that i put in to

1310
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,599
create a result right time effort energy

1311
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,160
and money and so is there some kind of

1312
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,440
um

1313
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,160
like quantifiable

1314
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,559
interchange between time and money or

1315
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:19,440
time and energy or time and effort or

1316
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,640
um

1317
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,640
i mean it's time always the entropy

1318
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,599
increasing thing but like

1319
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,920
so okay entropy increases with time

1320
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,800
right

1321
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,520
but

1322
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,440
like i put time into something right

1323
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,480
so is this um am i putting entropy into

1324
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,640
something to create a result that seems

1325
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,079
very backwards

1326
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,160
um it and it's just cool to think about

1327
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,599
time as like you know something that you

1328
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,920
put in to drive a reaction

1329
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,559
forward i don't know

1330
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:49,440
and

1331
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,480
quality time like attention maybe it's

1332
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,119
like you know if we had a unit an erg or

1333
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,960
a calorie of attention

1334
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:01,119
you know the the the calories the

1335
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,240
temperature heat of some metal sphere

1336
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,000
and a cloud you know there's different

1337
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,240
amounts of specific heat

1338
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,280
and so

1339
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,119
maybe individuals attention will be

1340
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,079
different it's different to get the

1341
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,599
attention of

1342
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:15,280
peer reviewer one versus peer reviewer

1343
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,200
two but

1344
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,119
is there a commonality for attention and

1345
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,240
does that help make decisions

1346
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,400
get pushed along the road

1347
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,440
blue maybe you could introduce this

1348
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,520
nice set of slides on

1349
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,000
life-mind continuity

1350
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,680
sure um so there's a uh

1351
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,680
maybe maybe the first question first and

1352
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,880
then we can maybe talk about the

1353
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,119
life-mind continuity thesis so

1354
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,359
um this is a quote from the paper it

1355
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,760
says adaptive active inference requires

1356
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,000
that a system autonomously engage in

1357
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,520
active inference

1358
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,480
maximizing sensory evidence for its own

1359
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,000
existence

1360
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,800
so

1361
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,760
this kind of is a different um yeah and

1362
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,359
they cited this reference and this is

1363
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,040
from the sims paper

1364
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,040
but um

1365
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,800
i just thought about

1366
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,680
what is evidence for your own existence

1367
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,920
like when i pulled this quote out

1368
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,119
um

1369
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:12,960
and does that require

1370
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,040
self-awareness like like

1371
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,520
do i exist i think therefore i am it's

1372
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,640
very like descartes and um like that's

1373
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,280
evidence for your existence but like

1374
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,359
does the little cell

1375
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,119
it self-aware enough to know that it

1376
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,640
exists i mean it is like the desire to

1377
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,520
not be extinguished awareness of your

1378
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,440
own existence

1379
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,280
um so i think about you know it's

1380
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,760
sensory evidence for your model or for

1381
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,400
the

1382
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,720
validity of your model so that's kind of

1383
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,079
always how i think about it model

1384
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,000
evidence is not evidence for my

1385
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,720
existence it's evidence for the validity

1386
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,359
of my model so that's kind of how i've

1387
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,119
always thought about it but it just was

1388
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,359
interesting this um this phrasing that

1389
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:59,200
was used by by sims uh um because i just

1390
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,520
was curious is there a difference

1391
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,960
between

1392
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,960
evidence for your existence

1393
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,920
and

1394
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,280
model evidence

1395
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,880
and just what do you guys think about

1396
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,960
that or or am i the only one that was

1397
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,240
like that's kind of weird

1398
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,319
there's a lot of

1399
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,800
pieces here so one

1400
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,520
piece is that in active inference the

1401
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,640
preferences are over sensory outcomes

1402
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,520
not over hidden state estimates

1403
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,720
so

1404
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,119
instead of maximizing

1405
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:33,760
um you know values of hidden state

1406
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,040
estimates

1407
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,559
like making it maximally safe out there

1408
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,559
that situation of bodily safety would be

1409
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:44,079
reframed as maximizing evidence for

1410
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,319
observing our observations in their

1411
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:49,440
preferred states so one little

1412
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,599
flourish that is active inference

1413
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:52,640
germain

1414
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,760
is this focus on the sensory evidence

1415
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,040
rather than inferred hidden states

1416
00:51:59,040 --> 00:51:59,839
um

1417
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:00,960
and then

1418
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,040
that is an interesting question about is

1419
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,119
it is it the model of itself what is

1420
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,559
this how are we getting sensory evidence

1421
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,640
for

1422
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,960
ourself and is that the imperative

1423
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,720
for action and it just reminded me

1424
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,160
because you said um you know i think

1425
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,520
therefore i am there this is um

1426
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,760
uh latin post hoc ergo pro propter hook

1427
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,440
after this therefore because of this

1428
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,160
it's like the post hoc fallacy so i

1429
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,160
think therefore i am

1430
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,880
and then of course you know cue the 50

1431
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,400
fristen papers

1432
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,800
i am therefore i think

1433
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,200
every possible inversion

1434
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,119
like is it that

1435
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,079
thought begets

1436
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,359
life or does life be get thought

1437
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,440
and then if we're only going to find

1438
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,480
both of them inextricably tied up

1439
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,800
in actual systems

1440
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,559
what is the

1441
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,520
partitioning or the compartmentalizing

1442
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,800
that is

1443
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,880
variously meaningful or true or

1444
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,079
so that inversion's really cool and and

1445
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:10,800
also um speaks to the podcast that was

1446
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,720
released yesterday on the podcast

1447
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,960
episode where um it's clipped from i

1448
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,480
think live stream five six point no 5.2

1449
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,760
so

1450
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,680
there's a lot of discussion about change

1451
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,680
your mind change your life and then the

1452
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,160
inversion of that is change your life

1453
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,160
change your mind right i i think

1454
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,160
therefore i am i am therefore i think

1455
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,480
it's just that's all this action

1456
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,599
perception loop of active inference

1457
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:36,400
um

1458
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,640
yeah here's the first in paper i am

1459
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,839
therefore i think he he did go there

1460
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:44,400
he's been there

1461
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,160
this is an interesting um

1462
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,760
an interesting

1463
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,040
uh paper it it even begins um the first

1464
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,640
sentences how does schrodinger's

1465
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,480
question which is what is life

1466
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,480
touch on philosophical propositions such

1467
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,040
as descartes famous proposition cognito

1468
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,680
ergosum i think therefore i am

1469
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,480
and then a little not exactly a formal

1470
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,880
connection but um this weekend is

1471
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,760
kognitio 2021

1472
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,720
so

1473
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,280
kind of another illusion there

1474
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,280
but yeah what does it mean

1475
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,359
for sensory evidence of our own

1476
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:20,480
existence

1477
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,640
is that our um

1478
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,440
our proprioception and our our uh thermo

1479
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,440
perception and taste

1480
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,000
or is this referring to a higher level

1481
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
of mental activity like as we saw in

1482
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,839
the san fed smith paper on mental

1483
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:39,520
action the observables

1484
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,880
of one level

1485
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,359
so like the outcomes of the higher order

1486
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:44,640
mental model

1487
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,880
can be plugged into the priors of a

1488
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,200
lower model or the hidden state

1489
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,200
estimates of a lower model

1490
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,839
so like is observing

1491
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,680
our attention

1492
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,680
maximizing evidence

1493
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,760
for a model which we

1494
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,480
pay attention to different things

1495
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,720
uh where does where does that play in

1496
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,799
with life mind continuity what is that

1497
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:09,200
question

1498
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,040
oh

1499
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,520
gotta hit unmute i got it

1500
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,440
so um the

1501
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,319
the distinction that sims made in the

1502
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,319
paper between

1503
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:25,280
adaptive active inference and mere

1504
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,720
active inference so my question is

1505
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,960
whether this distinction

1506
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,280
follows the kind of evolutionary late

1507
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,680
comer path or if or if it's in line with

1508
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,760
the life-mind continuity

1509
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,480
thesis and so we can kind of unpack all

1510
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,280
of those in the next couple of slides

1511
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,640
okay

1512
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,040
so the um

1513
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,000
life-mind continuity thesis so i i i

1514
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,280
pulled from

1515
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,799
this paper by kirkoff and froze for what

1516
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,000
you see

1517
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,200
um

1518
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,480
where they asked the question are mental

1519
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,240
phenomena restricted to living systems

1520
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,839
and there's several viewpoints here

1521
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:10,078
um

1522
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:12,000
that

1523
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,119
the the first one is um

1524
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,359
obviously you can answer no and there's

1525
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:19,680
a couple of different um

1526
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,400
ways and and so the cognitivist

1527
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,359
viewpoint uh is that some cognitive

1528
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:27,760
systems can be living systems but mines

1529
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,319
are really associated with computational

1530
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:33,520
processes that have semantic

1531
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,359
contentful properties

1532
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,440
and minds can be realized independently

1533
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,599
from life given the right kind of

1534
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,319
artificial support system and so this

1535
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:45,280
this allows um mind to exist

1536
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,520
artificially essentially uh and then

1537
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,280
there's the overly generous

1538
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,880
non-cognitivist

1539
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,760
free energy principle um

1540
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,599
thought that that all systems can

1541
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,760
maintain their variables within a

1542
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,839
limited range of values

1543
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:01,599
all systems that do this can be

1544
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:03,440
understood as having some kind of

1545
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,559
mentality or proto mentality

1546
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,400
given that the fep

1547
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,160
casts any system that maintains

1548
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,559
structural integrity in a fluctuating

1549
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,480
environment um

1550
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,200
as engaged in predicting its own future

1551
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,280
states and this is kind of the

1552
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,960
pan psychic

1553
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,319
take on you know that life can exist

1554
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,319
in or that not that life but the mind

1555
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:27,520
can exist

1556
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,680
in things like molecules that are

1557
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,000
undergoing reactions so there's i mean

1558
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,799
in everything there's a mind

1559
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:37,680
thanks for this really helpful breakdown

1560
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,880
so

1561
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,040
huge topic

1562
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,480
you know a lot of implications is it

1563
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,319
okay just to throw out a cell phone that

1564
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:46,319
we're done using or would that be

1565
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,720
you know a a rights issue

1566
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,119
so are mental phenomena one-to-one

1567
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,440
restricted necessary sufficient

1568
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,079
how is cognition

1569
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:57,520
related to

1570
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,400
life as we thermodynamically know it

1571
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,079
and some some strong shots from the no

1572
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,880
side which is saying um

1573
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,119
which first off is always a somewhat

1574
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,280
easier position to defend because you

1575
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,280
can just say look it's a venn diagram

1576
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,319
overlap

1577
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:15,680
and we don't know

1578
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,000
so who's to say that it's restricted

1579
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,680
because maybe there's some overlap maybe

1580
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,440
there's a but not b maybe there's b but

1581
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,280
not a so first it's a general claim that

1582
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,040
one can deny a restriction

1583
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,799
by just saying we're not sure or it

1584
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,880
might not always be that way and then

1585
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,960
this is just really it's it's clear and

1586
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,480
funny how you've written it overly

1587
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,240
generous like relative to the

1588
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,240
expectations of who maybe someone's very

1589
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,720
stingy with their fep interpretation

1590
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,160
maybe someone else especially the

1591
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,319
authors how they wrote it so

1592
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:47,920
you're confident ferguson that's how

1593
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,559
that was their their their um

1594
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:51,760
terms

1595
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,319
nice so maybe there's an fep whale out

1596
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,079
there for whom this is still not

1597
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,520
generous enough but um i i i if it was

1598
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,000
cool i didn't mean to to edit it um but

1599
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:02,960
like

1600
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,200
there's uh the integrated information

1601
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,880
theory people

1602
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,680
their

1603
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,400
flavor of pan psychism would be like

1604
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,680
because all systems are on this

1605
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,480
continuum of integrating information

1606
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,319
pan psychism

1607
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:17,760
another approach is sort of this

1608
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,079
cybernetic pan psychism which is like

1609
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:22,960
because all systems are on the continuum

1610
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,000
of

1611
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,599
maintaining their variables within a

1612
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,680
limited range of values

1613
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,839
kind of like good regulator theorem

1614
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:33,119
in other words not because there's an

1615
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:34,960
information continuum but because

1616
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,200
there's a cybernetic control

1617
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,119
continuum

1618
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,880
dot dot

1619
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,319
pan psychism

1620
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:45,200
so there's an information centered

1621
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,760
inference pan inference equals pan

1622
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,680
psychism and here's like a pan control

1623
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,119
or pan

1624
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:55,839
resistance to dissipation equals pan

1625
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:57,680
psychism claim

1626
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,160
so that's pretty cool how that that

1627
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:03,040
action and inference thread

1628
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,720
come back

1629
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,520
um in different guises welcome back

1630
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,400
steven your surroundings are

1631
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,760
less

1632
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:12,640
blue

1633
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,839
but i hope that it will work

1634
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,720
yep we're on 11 we just

1635
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,720
heard some of the no

1636
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,319
uh voices

1637
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,640
on the question or mental phenomena

1638
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:27,760
restricted to living systems and then

1639
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:28,720
blue

1640
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,440
who

1641
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,160
is on the other side of the table

1642
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,599
well and then there's a couple of

1643
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:36,319
different um views that the authors put

1644
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:38,880
forward in the paper as well on the yes

1645
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,760
side

1646
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,839
so there is the non-cognitivist

1647
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:46,559
fep so that's the the second view from

1648
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,839
the no

1649
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:50,799
but plus um

1650
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:51,760
the

1651
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,119
evolutionary late come review so this is

1652
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,240
mind but not life requires sophisticated

1653
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,720
generated generative neural machinery

1654
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,119
that is not present in simple forms of

1655
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:05,520
life such as single-celled organisms and

1656
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,599
that was my question about adaptive

1657
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:09,760
active inference versus mirror active

1658
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,480
inference is that like putting mind

1659
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,319
above

1660
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:15,920
a certain is that at a certain

1661
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,240
evolutionary point such as like higher

1662
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,799
level vertebrates or whatever only

1663
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:23,040
perform adaptive active inference if

1664
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,119
they're evolutionarily at a certain

1665
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,400
point or

1666
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,359
in a certain as sims kind of implied

1667
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:31,280
in a certain amount of

1668
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,559
collectivity like so so uh in his paper

1669
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:36,240
he said that you know

1670
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,640
whole organisms can be

1671
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,640
can do adaptive active inference but not

1672
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,119
like cells within an organism and so

1673
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:44,240
that was kind of

1674
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,079
it's along the lines while it doesn't

1675
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,079
necessarily um

1676
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,160
link directly to sophisticated neural

1677
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,799
machinery it seemed like

1678
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:54,799
sophisticated

1679
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:57,760
collective autonomy or like like what

1680
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,799
what was the the sophistication and and

1681
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:03,039
where was this line and i kind of pushed

1682
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:05,440
matt on that when he was here but i just

1683
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,960
wonder is that

1684
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,960
is that linked somehow to this way

1685
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,559
um and then i don't know stephen did you

1686
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,079
want to say something or and then i can

1687
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:16,000
talk about the life minecon continuity

1688
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,160
views yes

1689
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,680
yeah um i think actually it can just

1690
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,119
kind of continues what you're saying

1691
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:24,720
continues a little bit with the graph

1692
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,480
that we had earlier there in the sense

1693
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,680
that

1694
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,200
i was thinking

1695
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:32,079
when when um

1696
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:34,480
something goes over that that graph and

1697
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,119
goes down the other side um

1698
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:39,200
with active inference the like with

1699
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,760
normal reactions right you do it anytime

1700
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,599
with the same reactants it's the same

1701
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:46,000
basic curve every time right because

1702
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,960
it's it's a standard thing but with

1703
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,680
life it gets a chance to

1704
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,240
know what the final outcomes have been

1705
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,640
and start to maybe change the energy of

1706
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,119
the hump it can actually change

1707
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:00,400
particularly maybe as well if there's

1708
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,319
non-equilibrium steady states in there

1709
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:03,119
but

1710
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:05,359
there's an actual ability to infer

1711
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:07,200
backwards and i suppose that that

1712
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,920
inability to infer backwards well in

1713
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,400
real time which in real time could be

1714
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,000
chemical time

1715
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,680
that that could kind of happen through

1716
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,559
enzymes or maybe through the mediation

1717
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:20,240
enzymes and whether that's cognition or

1718
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,520
whether that's

1719
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,559
could be done through some real-time

1720
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:28,319
um you know chemical inference

1721
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:32,000
process um and then of course you've got

1722
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,039
that happening over longer times um

1723
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:36,799
and this then becomes when do you start

1724
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:38,319
to move from

1725
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:40,480
a variational free energy into an

1726
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,880
expected free energy you know

1727
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,240
um but that ability to go backwards

1728
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:50,000
or forwards and start to sculpt

1729
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,920
the landscape

1730
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,960
of intermediaries

1731
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,280
um yeah i wonder i think that kind of

1732
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,400
ties into what you're saying

1733
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,440
i'm gonna do a little life-mind venn

1734
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,760
diagram

1735
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,480
what kind of a universe

1736
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,079
or world or

1737
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,400
simulation or whatever

1738
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,880
do life and minds

1739
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,160
look like

1740
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,160
partial overlap

1741
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,400
like in this world let's make this a

1742
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,039
little different color

1743
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,640
you know in this world

1744
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,720
there's things that are having mind but

1745
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,480
not life

1746
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,160
and vice versa

1747
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:30,960
so

1748
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:31,839
that

1749
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:33,280
is a strict

1750
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,400
um

1751
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,319
refutation of

1752
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:37,760
the restriction

1753
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,200
claim

1754
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,280
is it restricted to living systems

1755
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,640
this would be no

1756
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,319
but then let's just say it is restricted

1757
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:45,760
to living systems

1758
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,599
well it could be like that there are

1759
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:50,400
still living systems with no mind

1760
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,680
or

1761
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,880
could they be the same so

1762
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,079
um

1763
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:57,440
how would we know

1764
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,760
what would be the observation

1765
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,359
or the experiments

1766
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:03,440
or the measurement to make

1767
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,720
especially

1768
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,000
keeping in

1769
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,799
mind or keeping in life that

1770
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:11,599
mind is a little bit of a

1771
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:13,200
potentially

1772
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,520
unobservable phenomena so how do we

1773
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,799
integrate

1774
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,319
sort of

1775
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:19,839
meat and potatoes

1776
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:21,680
with minds

1777
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,920
in a way that's going to lead to

1778
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,079
testable predictions and optimally

1779
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:29,200
informative experiments blue

1780
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,520
well and so that is the the life-mind

1781
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,760
continuity visa

1782
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,880
thesis is that um there's it's 100

1783
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:37,920
overlap

1784
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,359
so the

1785
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:42,799
concept of a mind is grounded in the

1786
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:45,359
concept of life in terms of autocoesis

1787
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:46,240
and

1788
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,319
adaptivity but

1789
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,720
the problem that i have with that

1790
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,000
because the whole reason i brought this

1791
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,440
up is like

1792
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,599
back to schrodinger's questions what is

1793
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:58,480
life right and so um

1794
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,240
it's not

1795
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:03,440
binary necessary necessarily like

1796
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,559
there's

1797
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:07,839
some continuum between

1798
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:09,440
life and

1799
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,000
not life there's a lot of gray area

1800
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,039
there's

1801
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,119
you know obligate parasites there's

1802
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:18,000
viruses there's a lot of things that

1803
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,760
fall into that like

1804
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,559
fuzzy area and then also like going into

1805
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,640
the origins of life theory

1806
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,920
somehow

1807
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,880
some self-replication and autophysis

1808
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,559
happened in

1809
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:32,480
non-life that like

1810
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,280
drove the transition to life at some

1811
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,520
point in our evolutionary history and

1812
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:38,720
and so

1813
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:42,078
where's the mind there

1814
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:44,799
and that's one um other reason that pan

1815
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:47,440
psychists implicitly or explicitly

1816
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,760
promote their viewpoints is it there's

1817
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,960
no need for like a biogenesis for a

1818
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,680
mento genesis for the emergence of mind

1819
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,480
from non-mind you just say nope my

1820
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,440
belief

1821
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,480
is it's all continuums of mind so we're

1822
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,160
just like adding grains of sand to a

1823
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,240
pile there's a debate about when it's a

1824
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,240
heap versus when it's not a heap but

1825
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,440
there's no

1826
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,039
qualitative

1827
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:12,160
challenge

1828
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,799
with explaining the emergence of

1829
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:16,319
complex minds

1830
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:19,039
as described in gerda escherbach

1831
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:21,680
whereas other people who are not pancyst

1832
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,240
implicitly it's like saying you do need

1833
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,039
to

1834
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:27,440
have an account for how minds if you

1835
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,039
think they exist

1836
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:31,680
arise from non-minds or you can take the

1837
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,559
anti-psychic position and just say

1838
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:37,039
there's never emergence of mind

1839
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:39,680
so not in the little not in the big and

1840
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,599
so there's a few ways to be consistent

1841
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,280
you know pan psychism and then

1842
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,960
elaboration of mind

1843
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,400
uh

1844
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,240
mental denialism

1845
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,880
which is its own answer or

1846
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,599
some sort of qualified intermediate

1847
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:55,200
where you think that it emerges at a

1848
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:58,400
developmental stage or some evolutionary

1849
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,200
development or an ecological context

1850
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,200
or some informational requirement you

1851
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,880
have to be this many bits to have

1852
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,200
awareness so there's a lot of

1853
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,520
views in the space but this is just

1854
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:10,400
total

1855
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,319
fundamentals what systems are living

1856
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:14,400
which ones have mind which ones deserve

1857
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,719
to be treated using

1858
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:17,920
respect

1859
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,319
steven

1860
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:23,600
this also brings back the multi-scale

1861
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,479
question

1862
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:25,920
um

1863
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,319
maybe not necessarily i don't know if

1864
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:30,399
physical scale but

1865
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:32,880
temporal scale

1866
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,080
you know if something is

1867
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,520
actively

1868
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,120
variationally

1869
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,000
um

1870
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,198
enabling itself to um maintain its

1871
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:45,120
steady state

1872
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,158
um but it's purely doing it only at the

1873
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:49,520
level of

1874
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,399
maintaining a chemical gradient and

1875
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:53,198
that's

1876
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:54,719
that's the whole game

1877
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:56,399
i don't know if that's a bit it depends

1878
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:58,640
when it's not exactly clear where mere

1879
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,279
active influence active inference sits

1880
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:03,520
right so there is a slight ontological

1881
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,279
question there but the if something's

1882
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:07,279
maintaining itself but it's just doing

1883
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:09,520
one thing and it can do that maybe

1884
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,759
through chemical gradients or whatever

1885
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:14,080
but then you've got this temporal depth

1886
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,040
of

1887
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:18,158
okay doing that because it's inferring

1888
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:20,000
that by doing that it will allow it to

1889
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,679
do something else

1890
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:26,238
at what point do these kind of chain of

1891
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:29,439
events start to become

1892
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:32,158
more life like and

1893
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:35,120
does then then need to be

1894
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,839
is that in itself life and does there

1895
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:39,439
almost need to be

1896
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:41,679
a lifelike

1897
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:43,600
entity

1898
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,520
that is managing that and then that

1899
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,120
becomes mind

1900
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,880
and then this is this is that question

1901
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,080
that i suppose

1902
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,640
fungi raise a bit as well because they

1903
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,040
they mediate messaging part message

1904
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,159
passing and

1905
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:58,320
a lot of interesting stuff now are they

1906
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:03,760
kind of a mind or not uh i don't know

1907
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:04,719
so

1908
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:06,480
um we could definitely go to talking a

1909
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:07,770
little more about um

1910
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:09,199
[Music]

1911
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:11,920
mirror and adaptive active inference but

1912
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,280
it makes me think about you mentioned a

1913
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,480
chemical gradient well what are neurons

1914
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,480
and glia doing

1915
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,960
if not shuttling around

1916
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,280
chemical gradients and so it's like okay

1917
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,120
is mind

1918
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,840
in the sodium ion

1919
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,719
okay you know yes or no garden of

1920
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:33,520
forking paths is it in the system of the

1921
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,679
lipid membrane and the

1922
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:38,400
transport protein and the gradients it's

1923
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,199
like nope that still seems like a fairly

1924
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:44,320
no mind needed physical system okay well

1925
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,239
now we're gonna put some other bits of

1926
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:47,360
protein

1927
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,320
around it and now we're gonna

1928
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:53,040
converge towards biosemiotics with

1929
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,880
signaling at the membrane but it's still

1930
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,800
a purely physical system and so it's

1931
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:57,520
like

1932
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,280
you start building up

1933
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,520
and is there anything left to explain is

1934
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,080
that reductionism to just sort of make

1935
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,199
everything

1936
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:08,480
literally reduced to the explanation of

1937
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:09,840
the chemicals

1938
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,719
and it reminds me of a of a sapolsky

1939
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:15,520
article in 2004 where he says if if free

1940
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,600
will is lurking in the

1941
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,840
in the uh interstices of the brain then

1942
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,440
the crawl spaces are getting smaller and

1943
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,480
smaller

1944
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,159
because as we get tools that help us

1945
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:26,320
look closer and closer

1946
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,159
we're finding there's less and less

1947
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,820
wiggle room degrees of freedom

1948
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:32,080
[Music]

1949
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,080
tilly lally or whatever you

1950
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,000
called it less and less of that

1951
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,840
potentially

1952
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,920
with deeper and deeper investigation and

1953
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,480
dissection but are we just

1954
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,920
tearing

1955
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,440
something apart not understanding how

1956
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:49,360
it's actually composed blue

1957
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,080
so that just reminds me of back going

1958
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,400
back to the live stream that um we had

1959
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,760
with mike levin

1960
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:56,960
it's like

1961
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,679
if we are just

1962
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:02,000
at any given point

1963
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,560
our model essentially like dictates our

1964
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,400
action right so in under active

1965
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,800
inference we have the degenerative model

1966
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,360
the recognition model and constantly

1967
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,960
these are updated based on what's

1968
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:13,920
happening

1969
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:14,640
in

1970
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,920
our world

1971
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,080
can we in fact

1972
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,159
or do we have a choice when presented

1973
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:21,760
with any given

1974
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,400
circumstances in life in our environment

1975
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,280
do we have a choice whether or not to

1976
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,840
steal a candy bar from its tour or

1977
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,159
like like random things that you think

1978
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:33,600
about um

1979
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,400
and

1980
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,120
this also goes to change your life and

1981
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,520
change your mind so it's only through

1982
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,320
like practicing piano do we learn to

1983
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,960
play piano but do i have any choice but

1984
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,880
to sit down and practice the piano given

1985
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:51,040
my existing model or and so is there

1986
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,960
like at what point where does free will

1987
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,719
come in like

1988
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:57,440
right like does it play in and um mike's

1989
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:00,159
answer was awesome i think he said like

1990
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,400
no there's no free will but then he said

1991
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,840
okay there's some minuscule

1992
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,760
amount of

1993
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,080
free will that's non-zero but like the

1994
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,000
smallest possible

1995
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,159
non-zero number that you could have and

1996
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:16,239
so incrementally then you're able to

1997
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:18,000
effect changes on your model which then

1998
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,159
affect the decisions that you make given

1999
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:22,239
your model

2000
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:22,960
so

2001
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,960
just two quick things then steven so

2002
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,360
with a chaotic system

2003
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:30,640
with a big leopard of exponent so small

2004
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,520
changes have non-linear effects

2005
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,239
all you need is a tiny tiny bit so let's

2006
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:36,960
not

2007
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:40,320
um confuse the fact that we have small

2008
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,960
but potentially even infinitesimal or

2009
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,360
fractional free will whatever that means

2010
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:48,560
in the moment with our inability to have

2011
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,719
serious consequences through deep time

2012
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:52,320
because it is a chaotic massively

2013
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,480
interacting system and the second point

2014
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,480
is it's um you mentioned like stealing

2015
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,159
something

2016
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:00,960
that 2004 paper with zeki good enough

2017
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,400
and sapolsky

2018
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,159
is about the frontal cortex in the

2019
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:06,159
criminal justice system and this paper

2020
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:08,239
is really fascinating because it's like

2021
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:10,719
there's two modes to

2022
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:13,040
just i believe centering on the american

2023
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,199
legal system but replicated many other

2024
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:18,159
cases either somebody can be like um a

2025
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:20,320
rational sane actor

2026
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:23,120
or they plead a defense which basically

2027
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,320
amounts to

2028
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:27,280
being entirely incapacitated so like

2029
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,120
either you were fully you should have

2030
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,760
known that um the bank robbery would

2031
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,280
have gone this way you should have

2032
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,520
really waited it out all the ways

2033
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,199
or

2034
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:38,159
it was

2035
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:40,159
a situation of which there are multiple

2036
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:41,600
where you cannot be held to be

2037
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,360
responsible for the action but we still

2038
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,640
need to

2039
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,000
you know it's not to get out of jail

2040
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,640
free card but it's it is what it is and

2041
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,760
so they're

2042
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,440
arguing for

2043
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:54,080
a more nuanced perspective

2044
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,760
that respects all the different time

2045
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,239
scales of changes

2046
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:00,320
that influence our decision making so

2047
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:03,600
it's a really and and you know this is

2048
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,480
20 almost 20 years ago so a lot has

2049
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,320
changed in neuroscience and in law and

2050
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,560
society but this is a little bit of an

2051
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:11,440
older

2052
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,400
peep

2053
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:15,599
so stephen then dave

2054
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:21,040
now i think this is quite an interesting

2055
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,760
point that you're making here i i i on

2056
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:26,400
that slide if you go back to that slide

2057
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,640
that has the mind on it

2058
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,960
i'm just trying something here if a

2059
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,600
little idea i i've just got it

2060
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,719
if

2061
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:37,120
okay you say so if i was to put life you

2062
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,520
see there's life there put life over

2063
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,400
mind okay

2064
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,560
so i'll do actually just do that so it's

2065
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,120
like this

2066
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,440
okay so say

2067
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:52,080
this is i don't know this is an idea so

2068
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,280
say you've got

2069
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:57,199
life as in the organism's body

2070
01:15:57,199 --> 01:16:01,040
and then you've got life in terms of the

2071
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,679
the the the cognitive

2072
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:05,199
um

2073
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:06,640
neuronal

2074
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,000
life

2075
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,040
and

2076
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,360
they're like they're differentiated into

2077
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,600
two types of organism

2078
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,440
in the organism

2079
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,600
and the two organisms talk to each other

2080
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,920
and the boundary between the two talking

2081
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:22,159
to each other is mind as an emergent

2082
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:24,159
process

2083
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:25,760
something that's coming up

2084
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,280
as an idea

2085
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,239
very

2086
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:31,199
interactionist and relational and

2087
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:33,440
interfacial that maybe we shouldn't be

2088
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,840
looking for the reduced essence of

2089
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,040
atomic

2090
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:38,560
modular life

2091
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,600
but we should um relentlessly pursue it

2092
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,199
in the interfaces

2093
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:45,440
dave

2094
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,280
yeah the um

2095
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:51,360
if mind is entirely a matter of memes

2096
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,560
and memes need material processes to

2097
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,040
live in and material processes need

2098
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,360
means to keep themselves from falling

2099
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:03,120
apart then things become a lot simpler

2100
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,600
uh but i actually want to make a comment

2101
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,280
on the insanity plea i think it might

2102
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,360
have been dershowitz who went back and

2103
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,440
looked at the statistics of successful

2104
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,120
and unsuccessful

2105
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:16,239
insanity pleas and he found that when

2106
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:18,560
people when somebody is so completely

2107
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,960
berserk that you can't even begin to

2108
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,679
empathize with him juries say

2109
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:26,080
he's just crazy kill it

2110
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,560
but the places that people the juries by

2111
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:31,920
the the insanity plea is the juror

2112
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,679
saying to himself although he never

2113
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:35,840
quite comes out and says this

2114
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:36,880
you know

2115
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,120
under the circumstances i could see

2116
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,960
killing the guy that's all right

2117
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,800
whatever it takes to get him off uh you

2118
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,400
call that insanity okay we'll get him

2119
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,719
off with insanity

2120
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:48,480
so it's exactly the opposite of what

2121
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,960
you'd think you know the supposed

2122
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,440
elizabethan argument that well the guy

2123
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:54,880
didn't know the difference between right

2124
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,239
and wrong so you can't hold him

2125
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:58,239
responsible american juries don't think

2126
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:00,559
that way

2127
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,159
big questions about

2128
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,400
what the legal system is for and what it

2129
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,159
does flu and then there's a question in

2130
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:10,159
the chat

2131
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:12,400
so just on to like the legal system and

2132
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,640
i i wasn't like meaning to start spawn

2133
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,159
this entire conversation with the

2134
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:17,600
stealing candy bar

2135
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,480
but but you know so much of our

2136
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,480
creation of the model of the world

2137
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,360
occurs when we're young and in early

2138
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:28,560
development and and i think that um

2139
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,719
you know at least in the states the the

2140
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:33,199
amount of un

2141
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:35,520
unacknowledged childhood trauma that

2142
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,280
happens um

2143
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,840
for poverty and for drug abuse reason i

2144
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,080
mean there's a infinite number of

2145
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,480
reasons that people undergo some kind of

2146
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,159
abuse as a child

2147
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:49,040
all of that like really contributes to

2148
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,880
how well you're going to function

2149
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,080
in society in later in life and i don't

2150
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,560
think like while there there are people

2151
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,560
that plead insanity and there are some

2152
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,199
cases of of severe abuse and whatever

2153
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:03,360
where the people get off but but

2154
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,199
so much so many of the people that are

2155
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:07,120
in our prison systems and go through

2156
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:10,640
juvenile systems have these horrible

2157
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:14,400
early experiences that really are

2158
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:15,920
happening when their model of the world

2159
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,440
is being solidified

2160
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:20,640
and so for me it really um

2161
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,280
it explains a lot of the choices that

2162
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,880
are made um

2163
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:28,480
by people in those circumstances

2164
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,239
and it's helpful to think about it in

2165
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:33,520
terms of a trajectory we're not just

2166
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,000
um maybe taking a snapshot moment and

2167
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,719
just doing a snap judgment but we want a

2168
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:40,159
trajectory of

2169
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:42,239
healing and of um

2170
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:43,520
health

2171
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,280
stephen and then dave and then we'll ask

2172
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,040
the question

2173
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,800
yeah this idea because we talk about

2174
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,199
people being out of their mind you know

2175
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:53,120
and in some ways like you say these if

2176
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,600
someone has an experience or something

2177
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:56,320
or

2178
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,880
some biological

2179
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,600
condition the idea is it's like

2180
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:02,320
the

2181
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,640
i suppose the biological

2182
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,400
architecture

2183
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:10,639
means that the person's ability to

2184
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,159
mindfully

2185
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:14,880
choose isn't there in some ways it's

2186
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,560
almost like

2187
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:19,920
the yeah either the the somatic

2188
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,679
priors are so

2189
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:24,400
skewed or the uh

2190
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,360
the mental architecture is so distorted

2191
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,400
that

2192
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:32,480
a coherent mind isn't available

2193
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:35,120
thanks steve

2194
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:37,840
i met a lawyer

2195
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,880
who worked with the um

2196
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:44,400
criminal justice system in chicago

2197
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:47,520
on um child abuse cases

2198
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,120
and she's had a huge number of these

2199
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:52,000
cases of serious abuse like a

2200
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,840
three-month-old being put out on a fire

2201
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,920
escape in the middle of winter

2202
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,239
to toughen him up

2203
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:00,159
and she know instead of just saying oh

2204
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:01,600
this is so horrible you got to put the

2205
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:02,960
mother in prison

2206
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,719
they interviewed her says what do you do

2207
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:07,520
with babies and she had no idea she had

2208
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:11,280
never seen even minimally competent

2209
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,480
child rear

2210
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:13,760
from anybody

2211
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:15,760
and they found you explain to these

2212
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,920
folks you've given you know the

2213
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,199
supplemental education to understand why

2214
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:23,199
middle class people treat babies a

2215
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:25,920
certain way they think that's great oh

2216
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,000
that makes sense i just didn't know you

2217
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,639
could do that i thought you had to beat

2218
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:32,800
them they wouldn't stop crying if you

2219
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,639
don't beat them

2220
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:35,760
okay

2221
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,320
and say you know you put them on a long

2222
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,320
time probation that is not punitive at

2223
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,159
all just so you can keep track of them

2224
01:21:42,159 --> 01:21:43,920
and keep the education going and keep

2225
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,679
them away from the crazies and just it

2226
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:49,360
was working extraordinarily well

2227
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:52,080
thanks so here's a question from the

2228
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,520
chat i'll read the question and then

2229
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,280
i'll read one response in the chat

2230
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,840
already and then um anyone can

2231
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,440
jump in and we have some slides that

2232
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:02,239
speak to this so joseph wrote

2233
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:04,480
could the extent of how conscious

2234
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:05,840
something is

2235
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,679
be measured on the basis of how far

2236
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:10,560
ahead in time an organism cell creature

2237
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,960
can plan or minimize expected free

2238
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,800
energy and then

2239
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,000
um

2240
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,280
i know that some people will probably

2241
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,120
have things to say on that but tucker in

2242
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,280
the chat wrote

2243
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:22,880
under this idea

2244
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,719
then might the entropy chaoticness of

2245
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:26,320
the environment influence the degree of

2246
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,639
consciousness of a system a more dynamic

2247
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:30,639
system or environment would require a

2248
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:32,960
more adaptive agent in order to maintain

2249
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,199
negantropic coherence through time

2250
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:37,520
the more entropy the need for a better

2251
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,840
model

2252
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,800
super interesting questions and

2253
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,239
responses

2254
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:48,320
so i guess just uh glancing off of that

2255
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:52,320
uh legal and choice discussion into more

2256
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,480
broader questions it's so fascinating

2257
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:55,679
how

2258
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,840
especially if we're going to be locating

2259
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,440
function in the interface between the

2260
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:01,199
agent and the environment

2261
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:04,080
maybe depending on whether you're in um

2262
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:07,120
an unmarked room or a very

2263
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,960
interactable space

2264
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,320
consciousness is going to be different

2265
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,639
are you more or less aware and then the

2266
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:14,159
other piece that comes to mind and then

2267
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:16,560
stephen and anyone else is um

2268
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,800
from livestream 25

2269
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:21,520
computational boundary of a self

2270
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,000
and um there's the past

2271
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,320
and then there's the future below and so

2272
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,880
the past cone is kind of like the the

2273
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,880
depth and the breadth of what has

2274
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,960
influenced the system

2275
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,800
and then the uh

2276
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,040
the future cone is about the scope of

2277
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,199
planning so it's a really

2278
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:40,800
interesting question about temporal

2279
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,840
horizon but is it enough to just plan

2280
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,159
deeply like if you just plan

2281
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:48,719
sparsely but deeply over a hundred years

2282
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:50,480
versus a very rich

2283
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:51,440
plan

2284
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,760
very thick plan for 10 minutes

2285
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,360
which one of those is there gonna be a

2286
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:58,000
single currency that describes or

2287
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,840
compares those two

2288
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:02,480
how do we think about planning in

2289
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,400
heterogeneous systems

2290
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,760
that

2291
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,199
have different affordances or have

2292
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:08,800
different complexities of their internal

2293
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,480
generative model

2294
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,080
so there's a lot of great

2295
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,840
questions in this area stephen then

2296
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:14,840
anyone

2297
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:16,480
else

2298
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,600
yeah these are really good questions um

2299
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,440
i suppose if we're looking at measures i

2300
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:22,800
mean there's also this interesting

2301
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,159
question of

2302
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:26,880
not necessarily what you're able to do

2303
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,719
but how far you're able to get with what

2304
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:31,520
you're not able to do like the

2305
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,760
like when someone's really working hard

2306
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,520
cognitively it's like

2307
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,960
like i mean

2308
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:37,920
you know

2309
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,000
if i want to predict what the inside of

2310
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,800
a jar is going to be like i can just

2311
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,440
boil the liquid and it becomes sterile

2312
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,040
and i know it'll be like that for a long

2313
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,080
time

2314
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:51,360
um the question becomes when you've got

2315
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:54,760
these intractable kind of

2316
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,040
multifaceted things a bit like what's

2317
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,880
going to happen to a

2318
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,480
a collection of

2319
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,080
family members when they all meet

2320
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,239
together for thanksgiving right

2321
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:05,600
um this

2322
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,280
that that

2323
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,920
that that temple depth is is definitely

2324
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,080
a good point and i suppose there's that

2325
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,719
question of um

2326
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:17,920
how to penetrate

2327
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:18,880
time

2328
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,679
when it's hard to penetrate as much as

2329
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:23,600
how much are they able to plan but i'm

2330
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,600
sure the two things are linked and you

2331
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:28,159
could do both

2332
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:32,880
blue and then i'll have a thought

2333
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,800
uh give your thought first daniel and

2334
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,440
because i'm gonna go on a tangent okay i

2335
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,120
wanted to connect it to

2336
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,719
the paper that we're allegedly

2337
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:41,840
discussing

2338
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,239
and this user resource

2339
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:47,520
and mirror and adaptive active inference

2340
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:48,480
model

2341
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:51,360
so on the uni-directional the left side

2342
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,199
you have like a more adaptive agent it's

2343
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:55,040
here a spider and then you have this

2344
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,679
less adaptive but doing mere

2345
01:25:57,679 --> 01:25:59,840
active inference like a web okay so it's

2346
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,600
like a person with a thermometer or a

2347
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,360
spider with their web

2348
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,840
versus this reciprocal case

2349
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:08,560
where on both sides of the table there's

2350
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,000
a user

2351
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,360
and then

2352
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,440
we've heard before about how the time

2353
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:14,800
horizon

2354
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,400
of planning relates to the um the depth

2355
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,000
or the quality of the conscious

2356
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,480
experience for example the 2018 alias

2357
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,880
interview with myself and martin and

2358
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,840
carl fristen in the final question he

2359
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,560
even talks about the temporal scope and

2360
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,400
the existence of counterfactuals as

2361
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:33,760
being relevant for generating

2362
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:34,960
consciousness

2363
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:37,600
so then it made me wonder

2364
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,520
what if by going reciprocal

2365
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,199
multi-integration

2366
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:43,600
you actually shorten the time scale of

2367
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:46,400
planning like if i'm gonna um

2368
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,800
set out a buffet for myself it might

2369
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,480
take hours of planning

2370
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,800
and so there's a lot of um mere active

2371
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,400
inference happening on the stovetop but

2372
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,440
it's a very

2373
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,679
complex process one user and takes hours

2374
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:59,840
of planning but then to

2375
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,600
cook with a friends

2376
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:02,719
might be just

2377
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:04,639
a minute of planning we're going to

2378
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:06,960
agree to cook together and so actually

2379
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:10,320
the temporal explicit depth of planning

2380
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,360
in an improv improvisational or

2381
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:14,719
interactionist

2382
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:16,000
context

2383
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,520
the depth

2384
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,520
drops potentially

2385
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,719
because you might not need to

2386
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:25,520
explicitly prepare for so many

2387
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,280
counterfactuals

2388
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:29,360
and it's not like you're just moving

2389
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,199
pieces on the chess board

2390
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:33,120
you just need to take that first step

2391
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,120
listen to what they're gonna say

2392
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,960
then think about what your response is

2393
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,080
so then that almost challenges

2394
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:41,360
the um

2395
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:44,639
simple time horizon or counterfactual

2396
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:45,760
basis

2397
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:48,480
of cognition or phenomenology

2398
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,320
because um

2399
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,239
and it's a such a helpful distinction

2400
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:53,760
made by matt that i know we're going to

2401
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:56,320
use in other papers and research that

2402
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:57,760
these are really different kinds of

2403
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:00,480
systems this left system is stigmatic

2404
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:01,920
and it's still a collective system with

2405
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:04,000
emergent properties but then this kind

2406
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,880
of double stigma g interactionism

2407
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,800
brings us into a new territory that's

2408
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:11,199
very important to delineate

2409
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:13,679
stephen

2410
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:15,440
yeah this and this takes us into that

2411
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:17,760
realm of sense making different types of

2412
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:20,480
sense making because it's action

2413
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,000
yeah being able to

2414
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,239
act and interact

2415
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:26,560
in appropriate ways

2416
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,719
and in many ways the more appropriate

2417
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:31,120
ways can be stimulated by things in the

2418
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:32,639
environment i mean

2419
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:34,400
the fact that we have a very expressive

2420
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,239
face in a way

2421
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:38,400
puts our face out there as something we

2422
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,000
can inscribe

2423
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,320
and use in that process right we just

2424
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,320
look at each other's faces

2425
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,000
now

2426
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,679
for all the psychology in the world no

2427
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:49,760
one quite know you know it's it's it's

2428
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:52,159
all it's all it's all an interpretation

2429
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:54,000
but the the thing that i think this

2430
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,760
really highlights is

2431
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:58,880
the game in town is action policy

2432
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,679
it doesn't the game isn't for us to walk

2433
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:04,480
around as humans with big cognitive

2434
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:07,280
capacities on the top of our skull or in

2435
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:10,320
our skull the game is that we can

2436
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:13,040
interact and sense make

2437
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:16,480
um the ability to like you say to plan

2438
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,320
on our own

2439
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,440
is um

2440
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,840
is a nicety

2441
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,600
but actually it's

2442
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,600
been a bit of a

2443
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,840
we could say a wrong turn for the last

2444
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:31,520
200 years because it's all been about

2445
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,600
thinking as being the game

2446
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,239
and feelings being this kind of artifact

2447
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:37,360
that we've

2448
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:40,080
we try and minimize as some sort of side

2449
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:43,040
product that's somehow you know

2450
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,800
a weakness of the human mind or

2451
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,199
something and and it's so far from the

2452
01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:48,719
truth because it's

2453
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:50,159
pretty much what it was like before we

2454
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:52,159
took that wrong turn it's actually about

2455
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:54,639
how to act and feel in the world so

2456
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,320
this is a good point

2457
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:59,120
thanks steven blue

2458
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,199
so i'm going to go off on my tangent now

2459
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:02,560
but i really just want to address the

2460
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,520
first

2461
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:06,080
question in the chat about how

2462
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,400
consciousness relates to

2463
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,120
our ability to plan in in how far out

2464
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:14,320
that we plan and and so i'm reminded of

2465
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:15,600
and maybe daniel you can help me

2466
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,440
remember if it was

2467
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:20,400
deeply felt affect or sophisticated

2468
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:21,760
active inference

2469
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:23,760
but in in one of those papers we talked

2470
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:26,239
about um

2471
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:27,360
actually

2472
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:30,880
anxiety as trying to plan too far out in

2473
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,639
the future right so if you're trying to

2474
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:35,600
plan too many time steps ahead then that

2475
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,040
that is like the cause of a

2476
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:39,440
neuroatypical situation

2477
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,600
so i'm not sure i will and then i think

2478
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,920
that they said that maybe depression was

2479
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,920
staying too many steps behind or

2480
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,480
thinking about too many uh steps in the

2481
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:49,440
past

2482
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:52,159
so thinking about um

2483
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:54,880
and it was so my takeaway from that was

2484
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,639
staying in

2485
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:58,719
the present moment

2486
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:01,440
and so i don't know that the that um

2487
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,440
just briefly to respond to steven's

2488
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:06,159
comment i don't know that um having this

2489
01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:07,840
big cognitive

2490
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,280
um

2491
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:11,760
giant capacity giant cognitive capacity

2492
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,920
is for interacting

2493
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,480
as much as it is for adapting

2494
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:19,440
um because humans like cockroaches adapt

2495
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:22,719
to you know infinite circumstances right

2496
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:25,360
we live on all or are present on all

2497
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:27,840
continents in the world and and i mean

2498
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,600
even antarctica there's some research

2499
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,040
scientists there right now i'm sure

2500
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:32,560
digging holes in the glaciers to find

2501
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,480
out how much our ocean is going to rise

2502
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:35,360
i hope

2503
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:37,440
that somebody's there doing that anyway

2504
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,040
i'm not sure who's funding that research

2505
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,800
but but hopefully somebody's doing that

2506
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:41,760
so

2507
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:43,600
i don't know i think it's more adaptive

2508
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,679
the cognitive capacity than anything

2509
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:47,600
else

2510
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,560
and to so good good throwback there with

2511
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:53,040
the uh sophisticated and deep active

2512
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:55,679
inference and the anxiety the parametric

2513
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:58,159
investigations of anxiety that we've

2514
01:31:58,159 --> 01:31:59,520
been on before

2515
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:01,679
and one day when we have better keyword

2516
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:04,080
indexing if anyone is passionate about

2517
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:04,880
this

2518
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:06,320
they should collaborate with us because

2519
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:07,760
how cool would it be

2520
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,280
to have deeply

2521
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:10,400
richly

2522
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,639
indexed keywords for these papers and

2523
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:15,120
artifacts and discussions and have them

2524
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:16,320
translated

2525
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,560
into multiple human languages and

2526
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,280
computer languages so and graphics so

2527
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,639
that we could be really

2528
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:24,000
clear

2529
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,199
um

2530
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:26,880
so i mean

2531
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,639
there's a lot to say here and the only

2532
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:29,920
other throwback that i was going to add

2533
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:32,960
in was to way long ago in number 29

2534
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:34,719
active inference

2535
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:36,639
we talked about the scaling relationship

2536
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:39,760
of the ants brains with a larger colony

2537
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,080
having a proportionally smaller ant

2538
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:44,639
brain whereas larger mammalian societies

2539
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:46,480
have larger mammalian brains because

2540
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:48,880
mammalian sociality has to do with like

2541
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:51,199
memory of repeated interactions and

2542
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:52,560
theory of mind and the facial

2543
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:53,840
recognition all these things that we're

2544
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:56,960
talking about here whereas potentially

2545
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,280
colony organismality

2546
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:00,320
means that

2547
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:02,880
the increased scope

2548
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,239
or

2549
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:06,560
capacity of the colony

2550
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:09,040
can occur over evolutionary times

2551
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,440
through a diminution of the scope or of

2552
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:13,760
the cognitive processing on board each

2553
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:16,719
ant so joseph's question

2554
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:18,560
it's sort of it's just such a great

2555
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,320
question so thanks again for asking it

2556
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:21,440
because

2557
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:24,239
we can sort of look at it at the

2558
01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:26,719
i mean it's even asked across scales

2559
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:29,040
but what if like the cell

2560
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,480
plans less

2561
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:32,480
because it's it's part of a high trust

2562
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:35,600
system so now the the beta cell in the

2563
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,920
in the pancreas doesn't have to have a

2564
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,920
deep temporal model its temporal model

2565
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:42,400
just has to be like one step

2566
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,560
but it's playing a role in a system that

2567
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:47,280
now has a circadian regulation of sleep

2568
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:48,800
or a blood sugar

2569
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,960
and so where

2570
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:52,560
do we ascribe

2571
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,880
consciousness or awareness or cognitive

2572
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:57,280
possibility across different systems

2573
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:01,199
which again brings us back to um from 25

2574
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:04,239
these nested cones of cognition and

2575
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:05,840
their different shapes and their

2576
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:08,800
attributes blue

2577
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:10,800
um i just wanted to shout out to tucker

2578
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,960
as i was like i don't know drawing this

2579
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,719
big thing uh

2580
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:16,719
with the last question so tucker

2581
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:18,800
actually made the link between

2582
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:21,520
consciousness and adaptivity and i kind

2583
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,560
of just stole it i stole all the thunder

2584
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:26,639
um but but really uh

2585
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:29,120
and are those two things linked right so

2586
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,600
so planning very far in the in the

2587
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,159
future versus the having the ability to

2588
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:36,159
respond to whatever comes your way in

2589
01:34:36,159 --> 01:34:38,560
one time step those are really different

2590
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:41,040
like one seems very rigid and the other

2591
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,880
seems very fluid

2592
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,880
and and tucker actually um

2593
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:48,080
kind of used consciousness and

2594
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,880
adaptivity interchangeably which is an

2595
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,000
interesting

2596
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,880
connection and thought um i don't know

2597
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:57,600
maybe resilience and that adaptivity is

2598
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:59,760
is kind of what i would use but but it's

2599
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:02,719
interesting to think about

2600
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:05,600
thanks steven

2601
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,679
yeah and also i like that point you're

2602
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:09,199
making and suppose it ties with that

2603
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:12,320
adaptivity about the pancreas um

2604
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,239
you know you if you've got the pancreas

2605
01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:16,239
gives you the affordance of modulating

2606
01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:18,880
stuff in the body as do these other

2607
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:21,280
uh organs but like you say these cells

2608
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:22,000
and

2609
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
if i have a

2610
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,840
crude or

2611
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,960
multiple ways of

2612
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:31,760
mindfully or

2613
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:34,560
livingly i don't know if that's a word

2614
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:37,760
adapting that you can do something but

2615
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,080
you got no pancreas or you've got no

2616
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,600
cells that give you an affordance to

2617
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,320
actually change it you can have all the

2618
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:45,760
computational

2619
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:48,480
cognitive modeling whatever it is

2620
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:51,199
you can't do anything it's literally a

2621
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:55,119
conceptual framework without any way to

2622
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:58,080
do that sort of control so you know the

2623
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:00,239
more important thing is to have

2624
01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:02,239
something which can

2625
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:04,480
follow through at these across the

2626
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:06,159
scales

2627
01:36:06,159 --> 01:36:07,520
and

2628
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:11,040
change how they are maybe cybernetically

2629
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:12,719
integrated

2630
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:15,360
than it is to have the like i say it's

2631
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:18,239
not all about cognition it's about

2632
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:20,080
action policies and i think that's

2633
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:22,880
really interesting

2634
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:26,239
so earlier we had just those three right

2635
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:27,920
just cognition

2636
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:30,239
agency and autonomy

2637
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:32,239
and then that was um

2638
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:33,840
being inspired by just some of the

2639
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,840
quotes from the paper where those terms

2640
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:39,840
were used but we're thinking about

2641
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,199
that three

2642
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:42,960
then we've talked about like adapting

2643
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:46,000
and being flexible and learning over

2644
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,320
uh developmental as well as evolutionary

2645
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,800
time skills we can think about the past

2646
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,119
and the future like the time cone

2647
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:55,840
illustration to what extent does memory

2648
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:58,719
matter i mean can you have a memoryless

2649
01:36:58,719 --> 01:36:59,920
awareness

2650
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:02,000
or is awareness

2651
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,119
requiring memory or can you have

2652
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:08,400
awareness without planning

2653
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:10,560
some meditation practices might lead one

2654
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,239
to think so

2655
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:15,440
or is planning vital

2656
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,679
what about the capacity for interaction

2657
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:20,159
if we don't have interactions

2658
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:21,520
highlighted

2659
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:23,440
you know paging dean

2660
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:26,239
are we falling victim into

2661
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:27,600
a modular

2662
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,760
reductionist nightmare

2663
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:32,840
or how do we hold

2664
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:35,360
interactionism at every step

2665
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:36,400
what about

2666
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:39,040
kind of complex systems properties like

2667
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:41,040
resilience or anti-fragility or

2668
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:43,840
hysteresis phase transitions

2669
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:47,280
those are descriptors of various systems

2670
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,360
and are those just coming along for free

2671
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:51,920
with these do they grant the ability for

2672
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:54,480
these are they correlated dimensions are

2673
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:56,239
they uncorrelated

2674
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:58,480
and then

2675
01:37:58,480 --> 01:37:59,760
the

2676
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,159
million dollar question maybe we need to

2677
01:38:02,159 --> 01:38:04,560
scale that for inflation you know the 10

2678
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,239
bitcoin question

2679
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:09,360
where does consciousness come into play

2680
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:11,199
and is that something we can ever get a

2681
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:13,600
handle on or is consciousness always

2682
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:15,119
going to be at the fringes of our

2683
01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:16,480
explanations

2684
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:19,199
and some of these more accessible or

2685
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:21,119
opaque features

2686
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:22,719
will be amenable to quantitative

2687
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:24,400
descriptions whereas this

2688
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,239
um might be always in a different

2689
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:30,320
category so blue

2690
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:31,600
well i think that they're quantifying

2691
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:33,040
consciousness already

2692
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:35,840
but um memory is really what i wanted to

2693
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:37,679
talk about here the key word that's on

2694
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:39,600
this list and so

2695
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:42,080
i mean i don't know i think about memory

2696
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,080
right like there's the rom and there's

2697
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:45,040
the ram

2698
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:46,000
um

2699
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,760
and uh

2700
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:51,040
is memory or to what degree is memory

2701
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:54,400
required for a generative model

2702
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:55,440
and so

2703
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,760
i i just wonder like i mean all of the

2704
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:00,080
experiences contribute to the formation

2705
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:01,920
of the model and what is contained in

2706
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:03,920
the model is

2707
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:05,920
effectively like our action course i

2708
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:07,440
mean what's in the generative model does

2709
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:09,760
anyone know um i think about it like

2710
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:12,960
like what is um the actual i think about

2711
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:15,280
it like an action course or like the

2712
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:16,480
response

2713
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:17,760
i don't know i'd love to hear what other

2714
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:19,600
people think it's in the generative

2715
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:22,800
model what's inside of that um and also

2716
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:26,400
um whether or not memory is required

2717
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:28,799
stephen

2718
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,639
i think this also you can bring in there

2719
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:33,520
with like affordances coming they say

2720
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:34,880
you know like you say interaction

2721
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:36,560
capacity

2722
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:38,159
with affordances

2723
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:42,000
uh i suppose you could say memory

2724
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,520
is an interaction capacity

2725
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:48,480
with the affordances to whole priors you

2726
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:49,760
know they

2727
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:54,760
um so there's an interest in um

2728
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:58,799
there's an interesting sort of

2729
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:01,840
dynamic here between

2730
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:04,719
these processes and

2731
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:06,639
the affordances

2732
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:07,600
and

2733
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:10,800
normally affordances are

2734
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,800
well for practical purposes are normally

2735
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:15,440
thought of or used in terms of

2736
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:17,920
something a bit more concrete and

2737
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:19,920
at the human scale but

2738
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:23,119
when it kind of is multi-scale as well

2739
01:40:23,119 --> 01:40:25,280
isn't it

2740
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:26,400
you know if we're going to talk about

2741
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:27,920
mental action

2742
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:30,320
and thought as mental planning

2743
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,560
then absolutely

2744
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:34,800
there are mental affordances in the

2745
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,880
model as formalized by sandved smith and

2746
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:37,840
others

2747
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,760
and then to blue's memory question about

2748
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:41,040
where it's related to the generative

2749
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:43,199
model so i thought of a few different

2750
01:40:43,199 --> 01:40:46,000
options not exhaustive so the generative

2751
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,560
model could have an implicit onboard

2752
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:50,560
memory like that d

2753
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,760
prior

2754
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,600
that could just be a summary variable

2755
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:56,080
that summarizes memory so you can just

2756
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:58,560
say the past moments temperature here's

2757
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:00,000
my prior on the past moment's

2758
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,280
temperature

2759
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:02,719
or

2760
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:04,639
the past sequence of temperatures could

2761
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:07,360
be explicitly represented as like kind

2762
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:09,840
of like a list or a vector so

2763
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:11,360
there could be on-board memory like

2764
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:13,600
within the internal states the internal

2765
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,679
generative model of the active inference

2766
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:16,639
agent

2767
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:18,000
could either have just sort of a

2768
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,880
snapshot summary implicit memory which

2769
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:22,639
is good enough in many cases so we might

2770
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:25,040
just model it as if anyway or there

2771
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:26,639
could be this explicit

2772
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:29,280
just like a policy is a sequence of

2773
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:32,480
actions you could have a multi-time step

2774
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:33,920
prior over

2775
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:37,360
previous states aka memory but then the

2776
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:38,210
other

2777
01:41:38,210 --> 01:41:39,280
[Music]

2778
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:40,239
option

2779
01:41:40,239 --> 01:41:42,480
is like this extended or stigmatic

2780
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,960
memory with a recognition model like do

2781
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:47,679
i remember what i looked like at that

2782
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:50,159
one family dinner when i was three

2783
01:41:50,159 --> 01:41:53,040
no would i recognize the picture

2784
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:55,440
yes would i know where to look for the

2785
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,280
picture yes

2786
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:59,360
physically what about asking somebody so

2787
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:01,040
we're thinking okay affordances social

2788
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:04,000
affordances spatiotemporal location of

2789
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,159
extended cognitive process recognition

2790
01:42:06,159 --> 01:42:07,199
model

2791
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:09,520
but do i remember that

2792
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:13,119
or am i merely remembering or preferring

2793
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:15,679
certain affordances that bring me

2794
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:18,000
to the edge of that abyss

2795
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,159
and then the recognition model takes

2796
01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:21,679
over once the picture has been

2797
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:24,639
physically presented that's the stigma g

2798
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:25,840
and then

2799
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:29,040
just using matt's distinction

2800
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:31,679
that's there's you in the photo library

2801
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:33,920
that's the unidirectional

2802
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:36,719
multi-scale inference integration

2803
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:38,639
and then there's the conversation where

2804
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:41,119
we actually spur each other's memory

2805
01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:44,239
uh and that's where we get that sort of

2806
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:46,400
next level of reciprocal integration to

2807
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:50,080
kind of bring it back to that idea blue

2808
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:52,960
really nice with the extended sigmoidy

2809
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:55,440
recognition model um

2810
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:58,080
and i think that like there's some

2811
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:00,639
like ram some kind of ram is required

2812
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:02,960
for any generative model like like i

2813
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:04,560
think about the generative model a lot

2814
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:05,840
like the software that we're running and

2815
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:07,360
in order to have software you have to

2816
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:09,199
have some ram

2817
01:43:09,199 --> 01:43:12,159
um but but

2818
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:14,719
is the long-term

2819
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:16,480
memory required

2820
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:20,080
also like so or is the long-term memory

2821
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:22,560
just what goes into creating

2822
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:24,400
the generative model and then all of

2823
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:26,000
that can be forgotten and and what i'm

2824
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,440
thinking about that i'm thinking about

2825
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:29,679
people that have lost their memory for

2826
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:32,480
whatever reason um like so so cases of

2827
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:34,560
amnesia like the person can't remember

2828
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:36,560
anything like i think about um the old

2829
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:38,560
movie memento and like you know every

2830
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:39,840
day i can't remember anything i can't

2831
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:41,360
remember anything but like i still know

2832
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:43,119
how to brush my teeth or i still feel

2833
01:43:43,119 --> 01:43:44,239
like when i wake up in the morning i

2834
01:43:44,239 --> 01:43:45,360
need to brush my teeth or i need to

2835
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:48,320
shower or i remember what food is right

2836
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:49,600
like so i don't need to like you know

2837
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:51,119
try this or that to see if it's edible

2838
01:43:51,119 --> 01:43:52,639
again so there's some

2839
01:43:52,639 --> 01:43:55,360
things that are maybe stored in

2840
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,199
the generative model and maybe some

2841
01:43:57,199 --> 01:44:00,080
things are irrelevant

2842
01:44:00,159 --> 01:44:03,119
thanks blue steven

2843
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,199
yeah this

2844
01:44:05,199 --> 01:44:08,719
this is um ties into

2845
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:11,280
the action policies of

2846
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:14,400
remembering like if all memories is an

2847
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:15,600
act of

2848
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:17,840
imagination

2849
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,719
is an act of

2850
01:44:19,719 --> 01:44:21,520
recapitulation

2851
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:23,920
then

2852
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:26,239
what needs to be present as you're

2853
01:44:26,239 --> 01:44:30,080
saying is is a way to evoke

2854
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:33,440
affordances and you could say that the

2855
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:35,840
affordances of

2856
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,679
remapping

2857
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:40,560
uh sensory states you know maybe where

2858
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:42,480
you look with your eyes and maybe when

2859
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:44,639
someone's amnesic it's not that they

2860
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:47,280
haven't got the priors or the knowledge

2861
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,119
they haven't got the action

2862
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:51,600
capacity to recapitulate

2863
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:52,800
from

2864
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:54,639
whatever priors were there i mean this

2865
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:56,320
is a bit speculative

2866
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,440
but uh

2867
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:59,040
anyway

2868
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:02,320
it reminds me of the uh neuroscience on

2869
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:05,520
taxi drivers and spatial reasoning and

2870
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:07,520
general relationships between spatial

2871
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:11,679
memory and practice there and cognitive

2872
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:13,679
capacity and preventing cognitive

2873
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:17,199
decline and memory palaces like memory

2874
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:19,600
palace is kind of this weird quirk i

2875
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:21,520
mean how weird you can imagine a place

2876
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,360
with file cabinets and walk around it

2877
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:25,119
and have stories about that place and

2878
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:28,159
remember you know pi to 5 000 digits or

2879
01:45:28,159 --> 01:45:31,280
remember the iliad how weird oh wait

2880
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:33,040
mental action

2881
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:35,280
spatial cognition

2882
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:38,000
narratives of action

2883
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,679
it's like

2884
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:41,920
you can build that physical palace and

2885
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:43,760
have the photos there

2886
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:44,719
or

2887
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:46,800
you can update your generative model

2888
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,159
to include

2889
01:45:48,159 --> 01:45:52,560
a spatial context where those cues exist

2890
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:54,480
and so it's just a very

2891
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:56,840
interactionist way of thinking

2892
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:59,520
about architecture including mental

2893
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:00,800
architectures

2894
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:02,639
like you just need to have the exit sign

2895
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:03,920
and then when somebody wants to leave

2896
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:05,840
they're going to recognize it and walk

2897
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:08,080
towards it and then the next step

2898
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:10,400
will be there and so the architect puts

2899
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:12,320
the next step there safely and

2900
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:14,480
accordingly to function but when we're

2901
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:17,040
the interior mental designer or

2902
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:19,760
architect we can make spaces that also

2903
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:20,960
prompt us

2904
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:23,040
and so it's not like we're storing the

2905
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:27,360
memory itself in that location were

2906
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,840
remembering a very compressed version of

2907
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:33,760
the cues that interact with us to then

2908
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:36,400
generate um upon demand

2909
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:38,639
stephen

2910
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:40,320
yeah that's a good example the memory

2911
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:42,000
palace because

2912
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,360
is is the

2913
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:44,719
question

2914
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:47,440
that when something's laid down in such

2915
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:48,560
a palace

2916
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:50,400
if you go to visit

2917
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:53,360
the palace and you get this whatever

2918
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:56,560
sensory cues that come up

2919
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:59,440
it's um

2920
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:01,280
it's solid enough that you will come

2921
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:03,679
back up with us with a particular answer

2922
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:05,679
you know what i mean you'll remember x y

2923
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:06,800
and z

2924
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:09,199
from that so it appears like you've

2925
01:47:09,199 --> 01:47:11,440
remembered the thing

2926
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:13,360
so to speak but actually

2927
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:15,520
it's just that that combination of

2928
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:17,920
bayesian inferences

2929
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:19,119
will

2930
01:47:19,119 --> 01:47:21,920
lead you to act to recapitulate it in

2931
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:22,960
the way

2932
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:24,480
now obviously the average person can't

2933
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,400
do it as well as these trained experts

2934
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:28,239
but and they they can actually do it in

2935
01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:30,880
a very sophisticated way

2936
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:32,080
but um

2937
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:35,040
because the in terms of pure floating

2938
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:38,159
ideas is that whole they say six plus or

2939
01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:40,000
minus one is all you can keep in your

2940
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,639
brain at any one time in terms of a

2941
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:45,040
just a concept that's floating and

2942
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:46,480
that's uh but

2943
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:48,719
then that obviously that that isn't

2944
01:47:48,719 --> 01:47:50,320
what's the case when you can start to

2945
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:52,000
use memory palaces so it's a very

2946
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,040
different

2947
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:55,679
thing going on

2948
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:57,679
it reminds me of um one

2949
01:47:57,679 --> 01:48:00,239
class as we go to our closing notes a

2950
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:02,159
class where just each week the homework

2951
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:04,400
and class was to memorize a poem and

2952
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:05,679
then recite it

2953
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:08,239
that's kind of how education has often

2954
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:09,360
proceeded

2955
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:11,600
and it's something that um

2956
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:14,320
is just fundamental for oral cultures

2957
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:16,800
and has been a skill that is less

2958
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:19,600
emphasized in literate cultures

2959
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:20,560
and

2960
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:22,080
there's that dense

2961
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:23,440
cross-linking

2962
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:27,520
of like rhyme and narrative and tonality

2963
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:28,639
and rhythm

2964
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:31,360
so that you really don't need to keep

2965
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:34,239
50 things or 80 lines in your working

2966
01:48:34,239 --> 01:48:35,679
memory in your ram with a

2967
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:38,080
computationalist metaphor

2968
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:41,119
what is being remembered or recalled or

2969
01:48:41,119 --> 01:48:42,239
prompted

2970
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:44,400
and that investigation well if it's not

2971
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:47,280
being just stored as a text file

2972
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:48,880
what is it

2973
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:50,480
and then it's just so cool how it

2974
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:54,800
dovetails very nicely with deontic cues

2975
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:57,280
and ostensive cues in active inference

2976
01:48:57,280 --> 01:48:59,040
and conversational

2977
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:01,920
theory and a lot of other areas

2978
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:04,000
blue and then we'll have last comments

2979
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,239
here

2980
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:08,719
so just what you guys we're both talking

2981
01:49:08,719 --> 01:49:11,360
about um reminded me of cal newport's

2982
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:12,159
book

2983
01:49:12,159 --> 01:49:14,480
deep work if you haven't read it i

2984
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:16,719
highly recommend it it's awesome but in

2985
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:19,440
that book he talks about um creating a

2986
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:21,040
memory palace and learning how to

2987
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:24,239
memorize a deck of cards as an old skill

2988
01:49:24,239 --> 01:49:26,480
that people just don't have anymore so

2989
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:27,760
you construct the memory palace you

2990
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:29,679
learn to have a set of cards memorize

2991
01:49:29,679 --> 01:49:32,159
instead of like you so you can literally

2992
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:34,800
memorize 52 things in your memory palace

2993
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,639
anytime so you can memorize the order of

2994
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:39,599
a deck of cards just like he says to

2995
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:41,280
build this as a skill because it's

2996
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:43,280
enhancing of

2997
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:45,760
memory and i wonder if this isn't going

2998
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:47,760
to be something you know as we're

2999
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:50,560
becoming more and more illiterate um

3000
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:52,320
which is it's an interesting i think

3001
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:53,840
we've reached like the crescendo of

3002
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:56,560
literacy at least in the in the us

3003
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:58,960
um and have we reached this crescendo

3004
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:00,480
because of

3005
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:02,639
technologies like this like i don't need

3006
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:04,400
to read that paper i'm just gonna listen

3007
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:06,639
to this group of people talk about it

3008
01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:09,119
right and get the key points out of the

3009
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:10,719
paper and their summary and their

3010
01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:11,920
discussion and then i'll have some

3011
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:13,599
interesting things to say about that

3012
01:50:13,599 --> 01:50:16,800
paper um and so is it is it art kind of

3013
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:18,960
technology that's paving the way for

3014
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:21,440
illiteracy again and will memory become

3015
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:22,960
increasingly important is great to think

3016
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:24,719
about and i'll just give my final

3017
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:26,560
thought here um thanks for the

3018
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:29,040
interesting discussion today and to matt

3019
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:31,199
also for the for the provocative paper

3020
01:50:31,199 --> 01:50:33,360
and i'm looking forward to reading and

3021
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:36,239
discussing more of his work

3022
01:50:36,239 --> 01:50:39,199
thanks blue steven or dave any last

3023
01:50:39,199 --> 01:50:41,520
comments

3024
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:44,480
yeah i do quickly thank you again a

3025
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:46,960
really good conversation and uh

3026
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:48,159
yeah i think there's definitely

3027
01:50:48,159 --> 01:50:49,599
something here

3028
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:50,840
um

3029
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:53,599
around maybe the idea of adjacent

3030
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:55,599
possibles as well so was there something

3031
01:50:55,599 --> 01:50:57,199
about the memory palace that one thing

3032
01:50:57,199 --> 01:50:59,760
is then an adjacency to the next thing

3033
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:01,440
when you have to hold something on its

3034
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:02,719
own

3035
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:04,880
it's going to have to be supported by

3036
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:07,119
its own infrastructure i suppose

3037
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:09,040
and that's quite an overhead

3038
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:09,920
um

3039
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:11,840
so yeah

3040
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:13,199
because there's also this thing of how

3041
01:51:13,199 --> 01:51:15,520
long you can hold something in your

3042
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:18,800
memory without having a way to ground it

3043
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:20,800
it just sort of fizzles maybe for some

3044
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,880
people quicker than others but uh so

3045
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:24,880
yeah all very good i'd have to go back

3046
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:26,880
and think over a number of points came

3047
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:28,320
up here that we could expand on in the

3048
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:29,520
future

3049
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:34,719
thank you stephen dave any last comments

3050
01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:36,960
nope just gotta followed up on these

3051
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:39,920
references thanks all thank you well

3052
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:41,440
to matt

3053
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:42,400
sims

3054
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:45,119
for writing this great paper and joining

3055
01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:48,080
our dot one and watching the dot zero

3056
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:50,159
for um dave and blue and stephen for

3057
01:51:50,159 --> 01:51:52,159
joining and for for helping in different

3058
01:51:52,159 --> 01:51:54,080
ways on the dot zero

3059
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:55,119
that

3060
01:51:55,119 --> 01:51:57,520
brings us to the end of

3061
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:59,280
30.2

3062
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:01,040
and next week's

3063
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:03,199
at this same time

3064
01:52:03,199 --> 01:52:05,679
we're going to be in 31

3065
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:07,520
non-equilibrium thermodynamics and the

3066
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:10,239
free energy principle in biology by

3067
01:52:10,239 --> 01:52:13,280
patricia palacios and matteo colombo so

3068
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:15,440
at least one author will join at least

3069
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:16,880
one week

3070
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:18,400
uh

3071
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:19,760
stay in touch

3072
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:22,000
let us know if you want to join for 31

3073
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,520
or beyond

3074
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:27,800
and see you all later
