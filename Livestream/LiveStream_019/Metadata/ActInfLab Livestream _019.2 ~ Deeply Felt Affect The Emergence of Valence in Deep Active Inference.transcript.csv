"Speaker 1","00;00;14;20","00;00;48;01","Hello and welcome to the Active Inference Lab. This is Active Inference live stream number 19.2 on April 13th. 20, 21. So welcome everyone and thank you for joining. We are the Active Inference Lab. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing active inference. You can find us at the links that are listed here this is recorded in an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so that we can be improving on our work."
"Speaker 1","00;00;49;03","00;01;22;08","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we will be following good video etiquette for livestreams. Today we're in the follow up discussion. 19.2 our third discussion following on the zero contextualizing video and the dot one first discussion last week with Caspir and everyone else. And so today in 19.2, we're going to be continuing this discussion on deeply felt affect, hearing some slides from Caspir, bringing up some of these questions that we're having about implications and other topics."
"Speaker 1","00;01;23;16","00;01;56;06","So really the goal is just to learn and discuss and we'll be going through whatever we need to and next week and beyond, we'll be discussing different papers. So let's just do a quick round of introduction and then we can see and hear what Caspir has brought to share with us today. So I'll start. I'm Daniel. I'm a post-doc in California, and I'll pass it to Scott Scott."
"Speaker 2","00;01;56;06","00;02;11;25","David, I'm the director of the Information Risk and Synthetic Intelligence Research Initiative at the University of Washington Applied Physics Lab. And I'll transfer it to Alex Thanks."
"Speaker 3","00;02;12;27","00;02;24;05","I'm Alex. I'm a researcher in Systems Management School in Moscow, Russia. And I set blue Good morning."
"Speaker 4","00;02;24;05","00;02;42;27","I am Blue Knight. I'm an independent research consultant based out of New Mexico. And I will pass it to Dean I am Dean. I'm up here in Calgary, Canada, retired, trying to keep up with all this activity and stuff. I'll pass to Stephen Hello."
"Speaker 5","00;02;42;27","00;03;00;09","I'm Stephen. I'm in Toronto. I'm just working on a practice base. I do a lot of work with participatory theater and social topographies for exploring community development, and I'll pass it over to I think it's now Casper. Is that right?"
"Speaker 3","00;03;01;17","00;03;16;15","Yes. So my name is Casper Hespe. I'm a busy student at the University of Amsterdam focusing on the emergence of social cognition in development and evolution."
"Speaker 3","00;03;18;19","00;03;57;08","And today I'll be will be continuing standing on so from last time. So I'll be mostly assuming that your already listen to that lecture as well. But just for for everybody's sanity, I'll get the short intro on what we've been discussing so far. And just to describe the context of this research and I was I was when I started this particular topic, deeply felt effects for this paper."
"Speaker 3","00;03;58;10","00;04;32;01","I was in the process of setting up the topic of my busy research and focusing on social cognition. But then in doing that, I realized that we were seriously lacking. There were serious gaps in the literature on how we actually connect from our bodily existence to an abstract social world, our expectations about our social world and shaped the way we feel physically and how that's recursive we shapes the way we think about our social environments."
"Speaker 3","00;04;33;16","00;05;21;22","And that's where I actually got into this. I don't know you colors or rabbit hole of effects and emotions because I think that affected and it's basically the kind of through emotions. It's what links the social world, the abstract social relations that we are experts at innately safe and to a large extent, if you look at the efficiency with which children in elementary school kind of track each other's popularity, and where they're part of the group or not in this kind of and I mean, of course, we're not making I know this dichotomy of nature and nurture, but it's an emergence."
"Speaker 3","00;05;21;24","00;06;02;11","I mean, it's like there's an interaction going on and it's you can say that we're you know, one of the things we teach each other to do, and that's where our system is kind of prepared to do in a large, large degree. Is to track events happening in our social environments. And from an evolutionary perspective, that's a very logical thing to do because for hundreds of thousands of years, you could say our each of our, our, our survival would be entirely dependent on our capacity to be part of the group, so to speak."
"Speaker 3","00;06;03;06","00;06;48;24","Our capacity to function in a group complex, not just on an individual level, but also on the group level. So our ability to survive as a species depends on our capacity to coordinate and distribute tasks and specialize in different directions. So in the very same way, shaping and basically forming a body at the higher level of organization and just like the cells in our bodies are differentiated in different directions we as humans have to differentiate ourselves to form one large functioning body and and you think like, what does this have to do with the paper?"
"Speaker 3","00;06;48;25","00;07;42;16","All essentially the idea is that the affective states, as we talked about them, less time in terms of kind of subjective fitness, we focus largely on the affective states of single agents doing some task in like a teammate's but today we can move towards a steps beyond that and in particular the way in which tracking the effective states of others in in the body so to speak in the unit of organization as a group and how that's tracking can allow you to to find your place your body just in a completely analogous to the way which cells track each other's stress signals in the body."
"Speaker 3","00;07;43;17","00;07;59;14","So the being basically the empathy, our capacity to empathize with others would be very similar to the way in which cells respond to each other stress signals. Yeah. Stephen."
"Speaker 5","00;08;01;03","00;08;27;08","I'll just be curious to know in your sort of journey, often affect is tied to sensory feelings, you know, at the kind of personal level and so, so that it becomes a kind of a, a macro social sort of measure. Was that something that you already had in mind or is that something that sort of evolved as you were exploring this these questions yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;08;27;09","00;09;00;16","I was especially interested in that connection between the very strong like experiential aspects of effects. Like when you feel embarrassed, you're literally getting you can get red face basically. And so it's like a very much an embodied aspect of that. And somehow you're able to connect that to let's say what other people your beliefs about how other people are perceiving."
"Speaker 3","00;09;01;11","00;09;19;22","Right? So that connection between the bodily states and those abstract beliefs about social environments is something that has kind of driven this and this effort."
"Speaker 2","00;09;20;01","00;09;59;26","And Scotland one thing fascinating to me is that the the notion that there might be multiple levels of that harmonic coupling. Right. And multiple pathways so that the dynamics of it, it certainly, you know, it's everything every relationship and interaction is describable potentially as a binary. And then you then you can elaborate on it. Right. And so there is all sorts of nested affordances that have direct and indirect qualities to informing those interactions."
"Speaker 2","00;10;00;11","00;10;30;17","And so that picking apart and disambiguate in the general relationship is fascinating. Right? So that and the and it feels like just anticipating these surprises, that active inference continuously brings us that there's going to be a yes. I would not just say a scale independence, but also a local independence to some aspects of it. So what I mean by that is there be analytical interoperability."
"Speaker 2","00;10;30;17","00;11;02;13","I would expect that more broadly than we might get with other analytical framings, simply by nature of the manner in which active inference approaches the questions of relationship. So know what I guess I'm saying? And that is I think it may be possible this is my years as a lawyer it may be possible to insert rhetorical artificial or let me use the word synthetic instead linkages in there."
"Speaker 2","00;11;02;13","00;11;31;07","And that's something I'd be very interested in understanding what your thoughts are and how we can, you know, we assert them into being right and we and so describing them, if it's efficacious to describe them in a certain way, then they become adopted. Those things don't exist in nature until we describe them. So we have an opportunity now to describe and disambiguate these things in a way that I'll use the it's like tampering with the Bach and the Well-Tempered Clavier."
"Speaker 2","00;11;31;07","00;12;08;01","We get to decide on the notes or like when they decided on 360 degrees in a circle because it divides. Well, I think that was the reason the Phoenicians or whoever did that. So here we get to just maybe get to decide without doing an injustice to reality on how to pass the linkages anyway. It's, it's exciting because I love the way you introduce that possibility of starting to pick apart those things and call and name them in a way that starts to do like David Boehm stuff where every reality is first thought and here we're having the thought."
"Speaker 2","00;12;08;01","00;12;11;17","So thank you for inviting us into that space. It's fantastic."
"Speaker 3","00;12;12;23","00;12;50;19","Thank you. Thanks for joining and we'll get more into that in this second book. I read it like it's kind of refers back to what I talked about last time in terms of composition, reality, or the kind of Lego box instance that yeah, these abstract relationships can be applied from different levels of organization. That gives you a freedom in the sense that if you're able to capture this relationships on Earth and the way they talk to each other on the different levels of description, that's and that's really essential."
"Speaker 3","00;12;50;19","00;12;54;02","I think also Blue was within brands."
"Speaker 4","00;12;55;29","00;13;22;01","So I'm anxious to see how this model unfolds in tracking others. I think that that's a great way to add an extra layer. But I wanted to kind of ask first about the model as we discussed it last week, it's just something I've been thinking about. We talked about how surprise is, is related to like negative aspects, right?"
"Speaker 4","00;13;22;09","00;13;43;15","So like, you know, whenever your prediction doesn't track that, that's the negative aspects or that's the as opposed to the positive valence. And so I just was wondering, like, do we ever leave room for pleasant surprises? Like, you know, if, I don't know, shopping, I don't expect there to be a chocolate cake in my fridge. But I come home and I find a chocolate cake."
"Speaker 4","00;13;43;15","00;13;50;12","I'm like, it's not so is there a reason for that or is it like the incongruence or how do you resolve that?"
"Speaker 3","00;13;51;10","00;14;29;00","Yeah, it's a necessity that comes out of the fact that we talked about last time that the effective charge only emerges when there's a difference between the prior and the posterior so like, you can be pleasant, you can be positively surprised, your predictions can be better than expected. And essentially. So where did the, let's say, reality can be closer to your preferences than you thought it was or like further away, let's say so pleasant surprises when you get nice presents from from your loved ones or something."
"Speaker 3","00;14;29;00","00;14;39;24","But then basically there's like a kind of an surprise in a sense that there is a certain preference being met that you hadn't anticipated."
"Speaker 1","00;14;40;19","00;14;54;03","And yeah, it's like thanks, thanks for the gift card. Oh, wow. It's so much. It's like another surprise after you re normalized it to the fact that you were receiving a gift, you made an expectation. Oh, maybe you'll be $20 and then it's more."
"Speaker 3","00;14;56;20","00;15;36;02","I mean, there's that aspect and then there's then also purely on the information processing level, so to speak, when you're listening to music or some kind of something that's esthetically pleasing and there's often these kind of stimulation have some patterns that have inherent predictability. So like there you could say there can be surprisingly easy to resolve. And so usually starts with setting up some tension and then suddenly resolving that."
"Speaker 3","00;15;36;04","00;16;02;26","You can see that many art forms and storytelling and jokes, telling jokes, you basically have to create the tension and then suddenly the punch line resolves that tension and that's exactly the unsurprised or sorry, the surprising part of that reduction in the free energy distinction. This one was. Yeah, this is a very good question. I mean, I think that's a very common misunderstood thing also."
"Speaker 3","00;16;03;06","00;16;34;22","And that's an understandable misunderstanding. But that's because once you get to these hierarchical models, things are often kind of get much more nuanced. And you can just say, like, surprise is always bad and it's a surprise with respect to a particular generative model that specifies your ideal world, so to speak."
"Speaker 3","00;16;38;05","00;17;02;07","That's that's what creates this negative offense. And then once you on the meta level, start to create expectations about how close you are to this ideal, then once you get surprised on those expectations, it can be negative or positive. So you so that's a long winded answer to your question."
"Speaker 1","00;17;02;21","00;17;21;01","Look, let's have a question from Dave and then maybe Kasper, we'll go through anything you want to present because we could definitely just keep on peppering with questions. I totally feel it. So Dave and then continue on oh, you're muted, Dave. Continue."
"Speaker 4","00;17;22;04","00;17;55;12","Apropos of Bloom's question, some of the older researchers on affect notably Sylvan Tompkins and York Pang SAP go into a lot of detail on the differentiation of the emotions and sensations and affects and drives and so on. One of the things that Tompkins did a lot on was the speed of change, very specifically at a rapid change in a sensation may have a very different effect from a slow change."
"Speaker 4","00;17;55;24","00;18;20;21","Also, that's reflected in the face and the and what he considered inborn facial expressions underneath all the layers of acculturation. A rapid smile is something his drum is sometimes directly contradictory to a slow smile. What a fast smile make. Oh, you idiot. A slow smile means, Oh, you got it to OK."
"Speaker 3","00;18;21;00","00;18;58;19","I agree. I mean, there's indeed the temporal dynamics that come into play really really important as well. And especially because these nested levels, they tend to the higher levels tend to be slower. So for feedback through trickle down, let's say you need some time. So then if it's a slower moving change, then your top down, let's say prior scanning going already at depth a little bit before next step happens."
"Speaker 3","00;18;59;13","00;19;28;20","And I mean, that's what you see in, for example, in music where to really make something to have an impact on the listener, you need to have some kind of temporal slowness to the piece where there's like an intro and it's different stages to really kind of prepare your expectations so to speak. And actually the joke examples also like some people are bad at telling jokes."
"Speaker 3","00;19;28;20","00;19;35;19","They tell the punchline too early, whereas like don't give the tension time to kind of emerge basically."
"Speaker 1","00;19;36;17","00;19;55;29","Yes. Sarah actually just made a comment in the chat about how this model might be associated with humor. And then can we think about humor in terms of surprise only or how do we think about these complex layers of emotion like catharsis surprise at different layers of the model. Like you had mentioned yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;19;55;29","00;20;13;20","I think humor, of course, many different levels. And there's this really simple jokes, right? It's like one question. And then and surprising answer. I sometimes in lectures, I use this example like how do you call somebody without a body and without a nose?"
"Speaker 3","00;20;18;14","00;20;44;25","Nobody knows it's like a really silly one, but it's kind of nice as an illustration because you can think basically the free energy is actually a seat that's right. So complexity minus accuracy. And so when you get a question like that, then you get to concepts without a body, you know, and you try to find one unifying concept and it doesn't work."
"Speaker 3","00;20;46;02","00;21;08;25","And then you get the answer. And the answer is both true, false is accurate, and it's like a reduction in complexity. So you get like a double bonus in this case, but that's an easy one because the more interesting types of humor, I guess, emerge when you have like complex storylines and there are certain I don't know like satire and all these kinds of things."
"Speaker 3","00;21;08;25","00;21;39;03","So that's that's where it's not as easy to describe. But I think it's also possible if you had some kind of dramatic model of the social environments and then certain things are kind of inappropriate and then certain things are so inappropriate that they become funny or something like that. There is every country has those comedians, I think that they're able to walk that thin line with the extremity and so there is another question and comedy."
"Speaker 3","00;21;39;24","00;21;41;04","One more question. Yeah."
"Speaker 1","00;21;43;20","00;21;45;26","Yeah, just Scott, you want to go for it?"
"Speaker 2","00;21;47;00","00;22;23;10","A question so much is just on on that on the measurement of the subtleties of the free energy. There are books on rhetoric and I'm trying to find the title here, but it's specifically list dozens, hundreds of techniques of rhetoric, like the juxtaposition of words in a sentence. Does one come before the other as priming or whatever conceptual linking of multiple sentences, paragraph structuring, use of foreign languages, French tends to indicate certain thing of style."
"Speaker 2","00;22;23;18","00;22;53;03","German tends to you get accuracy, whatever. And so those notions of metrics from there, things that can be observed so they can be measured. So the metrics from the humanities, let's call it linguistic psychology, they are positioned and ready to dove in to inform those variables in that space. Right? And so that is the next interoperability is not going to be technical interoperability."
"Speaker 2","00;22;53;03","00;23;17;28","We got plenty of that. It's going to keep going. But what we have is this deluge of interactions. As a result, the true exponential increase in interaction volume is because of fifth order effective Moore's Law. And what we need is meaning now to be interoperable and that's where we get to the drive here of the shared framings of rhetoric."
"Speaker 2","00;23;18;24","00;23;49;15","Right. And so one of the point, 100,000 years ago, we were one village in the Horn of East Africa. We radiated out around the world. We came up with different food, different language, different politics, different gods, et cetera. And now the Internet brought us together for show and tell. Everyone's got everyone's work. An active inference on each other, whether we know it or not, and if we name it as such, it gives us a sandbox to play in at massive scales."
"Speaker 2","00;23;49;15","00;24;11;08","And so I love the way you're naturally and I think appropriately and not by analogy, but by direct application of the concepts bringing in our behaviors that are beyond what are seen as passive. Maslow's hierarchy of needs basically is beautiful. You're doing beautiful work, so thank you for inviting us into the space is great."
"Speaker 3","00;24;12;08","00;24;30;27","And actually that comes back to the kind of needs hierarchy of needs or how to deal with that. So that's I just see one more question questions. We can until we find a break, then we can give you you."
"Speaker 4","00;24;30;27","00;24;59;10","Well, my mind isn't really a question in this. I'm curious whether or not I have a question later, but what I wanted to find out was when you discuss implications whether or not my question gets answered before I have to ask it, because I think from an effective standpoint, that's the part that's going to get really interesting. So I just wanted to put that out there because I actually do have it written down because it's a long one, but I want to ask it yet."
"Speaker 4","00;24;59;10","00;25;10;21","I want to see whether or not in the implications that you're going to share with us, whether or not my expectations align with what you think we want to kind of find out more about."
"Speaker 3","00;25;13;06","00;25;25;11","Them and I'll try our best thing. And it's impossible to be exhaustive about our own best. Yeah, actually about the book, the rhetoric of style."
"Speaker 2","00;25;25;11","00;25;25;17","Yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;25;27;17","00;26;00;12","That's actually interesting. And another excellent. This is like the art of movie directing, like choosing the shots, which shots are like and they're fully fluent, so to speak. And if you were creating a horror movie, you like the exact opposite of that. And then ways you can create anxiety or like different kinds of emotions based on how you how you move the camera around and which parts you do and don't show those really I guess it's off the paper rather than with our image."
"Speaker 2","00;26;00;22","00;26;25;10","And 11 reason that just this book in particular just that anyone take a look at this if you're looking, is it has hundreds of different examples. Each one is one page. It's like sentence construction, sentence basics, etymological things, tropes, blah, blah, blah. It just goes on. It's a checklist, but it's this thick. And so this is the things to measure for influencing other groups."
"Speaker 2","00;26;25;10","00;26;40;23","And so this is I really this is Gene Fahnestock, F H and E Stock K. I really thought this one was a really helpful one from a checklist and systems approach because we're really doing processes here trying to anticipate those processes that we can make interrupt also good stuff."
"Speaker 3","00;26;42;08","00;26;45;01","And what the style of rhetoric or."
"Speaker 4","00;26;45;01","00;26;45;14","Style."
"Speaker 3","00;26;46;17","00;26;46;27","Describing."
"Speaker 2","00;26;48;29","00;27;24;21","Rhetorical style, the uses of language in persuasion by gene bond stock F A, H and E Stock K and in fact one of the things just we're doing in our program is we're trying to come up we're we're not trying to come up with coming up with metrics for business operating legal, technical and social variables so we take technically feasible systems like what we're talking about generally here, A.I. and others, and then test them for Bolt's reasonability and the way we get there is just by rhetoric because we it's storytelling, it's folkways, you know, they just folkways for the future."
"Speaker 2","00;27;25;00","00;27;39;29","And that's why the act of inference gives us that framing it basically says, you tell us what your things are in your minds. You group, and we'll take them and synthesize them and feed them back to you. And then you get to decide whether you like it or not. And so it's just really an interactive element."
"Speaker 3","00;27;39;29","00;28;02;18","So thanks. You're very interesting. Yeah. All right. So let let me try and get to the actual slides that I was going to share. But I'm sure we can find many of these slides on. Let's see, I'm going to share my room."
"Speaker 1","00;28;02;18","00;28;03;29","On the bottom left the middle."
"Speaker 3","00;28;04;05","00;28;04;10","Yeah."
"Speaker 1","00;28;05;12","00;28;12;25","And then I'll resize it so it can look however it looks on your everybody's computer all make it look normal. So no worries about that."
"Speaker 1","00;28;16;15","00;28;17;00","Looks good."
"Speaker 3","00;28;19;02","00;28;52;27","Yeah. OK, so just to kind of recap a little bit, I mean, we already did that, but this thing we're talking about, this nested set of inferences essentially that happens or appears to happen. Actually, I'm pretty much to kind of hint at the instrumentalist discretion. I, I'm pretty much fine with completely being completely instrumentalist. And so I don't I don't mind if it's as I said, I like to always say that all models are wrong, but some are useful."
"Speaker 3","00;28;52;27","00;29;26;10","So I think this is a very useful way of looking at it's instrumental and whether it's true in the realist sense, I don't really care that much. I guess in the end but mostly because I just don't have a I don't think there's a way to make that claim I'd say that there's no way to prove it. I mean, there's no way you can believe in it or something."
"Speaker 3","00;29;26;10","00;30;21;03","But and you can say that you require some amount of evidence to believe in that as long as it works. I guess for most applications that I'm interested in or maybe all occasions, doesn't really matter whether it's what's what the philosopher thinks about, whether it's real or not. As long as it works so that's my I don't that's why I always say I don't have a dog in this fight and yeah, just to recap a little bit, the last time we talked a lot about Valence, but there's also other types or dimensions of effects, and some of them are like there are like three fundamental dimensions, just like arousal being like kind of your, your"
"Speaker 3","00;30;21;07","00;31;22;20","activity level, your current amount of resources that your, your body is expanding and for the current task of hands or for context, power and control so the perception of water agency, you can say whether you are in control of the situation or not, and it's not exactly the same as valence in the sense last time we talked a lot about control as well, and you can have a highly positive experience, let's say, if you're able to if you're trust, that's your that your needs are being met even though you don't have control over them yourself and so there's these different dimensions that to some extent can can correlate with each other and but don't always"
"Speaker 3","00;31;22;20","00;32;15;12","and you have another one this something like approach and avoidance which is often related to violence. But you can think of cases like anger where you have an aggression, you have an approach reaction, you're angry and you're so you're at negative valence, high arousal and approach response. So there's these different dimensions that sometimes correlate, but not always. And there are ways to let's say in very simplistic organisms, there's the dimensionality is very much reduced and when you're, let's say a baby and you start out with very simplistic dimensions, you feel content or if you discomforts as you get older, you start to get more of this."
"Speaker 3","00;32;15;17","00;32;51;16","This dimensionality starts to become more nuanced, so to speak, and starts changing. And then the way I'm relating this to to take this one step further is to think about what this means for. And when we have internal generative models, what that and what those generative models, what kind of influence they have on your affective states or current affected states."
"Speaker 3","00;32;53;03","00;33;23;10","And that's where it gets an interesting application in psychiatry. Because as we all know, there is a dark side to our imagination, and that is that imagination to use induced effects plays a role in all kinds of mental conditions. And also just on the everyday life and so these are two extreme extremities, of course, the psychiatric diagnostic condition categories."
"Speaker 3","00;33;23;10","00;34;03;29","But everybody I think the extent has experienced at least a few of these types of effects inducing thoughts. And basically I will I can just run you quickly through them. But imagination of imagined threats and flashbacks to something that's experiences PTSD, craving. So this like imagining obtaining of drugs that you have and that you're attached to but can be also other types of addiction OCD."
"Speaker 3","00;34;03;29","00;34;39;23","So obsessive compulsive disorder is a really, really strong example of people basically. And kind of you could say they're the affective responses that they get when they have certain thoughts are reinforcing the false. So they are afraid of breaking their own rules and they they get this kind of dread of breaking them. So there's like a cycle and this kind of cycle is very self-reinforcing cycles of affective states."
"Speaker 3","00;34;39;23","00;35;11;27","And that then guide the way your imagination works and then that triggers more effective responses in depression and a reaction. I mean, you can go on, I think almost I haven't really found any disorder in psychiatric like the DSM that doesn't really fall into this except for perhaps the really more like physical problems, but those are often psychosomatic."
"Speaker 3","00;35;11;27","00;35;42;01","So and there's also a connection there. And anyway, so just for as a very abstract analogy, we can construct the narrative to give this some flavor and can be of some social environment. And let's say you start and you have four locations can make this as complex as you want. But just to give you give that for the sake of the simulation which I'm going to be showing, you can start neutral."
"Speaker 3","00;35;42;12","00;36;09;06","So some safe space, there's a place that's safe, relatively safe, but you get only a small reward and there's a place that's a little bit risky, but you can get the high reward. And why is it risky? Well, because it has the probability of transitioning to this absorbing painful states can think of this as like asking somebody out on a date."
"Speaker 3","00;36;09;13","00;36;37;28","You have the risk of getting rejected or as a hunter and hunting like a big a big prey can be dangerous, can get hurt, can also do something safer. But you get the smaller reward. So there's like many types of situations in the world where this kind of this kind of structure, communistic or the higher and higher rewards are often associated with potential adverse events."
"Speaker 3","00;36;39;12","00;37;22;03","The problem with this type stay space is that it's very quickly explodes when you want to search into the future and the events as they unfold and something we call a combinatorial explosion. But let's say you want to plan ahead and for a few time steps, in this case four time steps, you want to anticipate what's going to happen and very quickly, it's going to it's the number of possibilities just becomes hard to track and the types of generative models that I've been working on and conferencing recently with a paper with me and Thomas Bar in Downey Jr."
"Speaker 3","00;37;22;13","00;37;51;06","Eisner and developed new. Yeah, it was basically sophisticated inference something I mentioned last time as well, a way to do this kind of research without having the whole thing become computationally intractable and yeah, I'm not really going into the technical details here, but essentially the core idea is that you, instead of having the whole policy space, which is multiplicative."
"Speaker 3","00;37;51;06","00;38;26;21","So you have in this case the policy space for each transition and you have three options here. You have four. So you get something to the order and four to the power of four and less in this case. But this is just for and for two, three, four, two, three, four, just for three times. And of course, in reality, we often anticipate more steps into the future just step without even thinking about it explicitly."
"Speaker 3","00;38;27;26","00;39;19;04","And so there needs to be a way to do this in a way that is that you prevent overloading the system with anticipating too many possible outcomes. And and what is interesting is that you can design a model in which the way you explore the future is guided by your affective states. And and this what I did for this simulation where you have this exploration of the future itself, an action model in the sense that you're an X experimenting internally with potential futures and the way you train to basically travel through a decision tree is guided by this action."
"Speaker 3","00;39;19;12","00;40;14;10","And because it's an action model is guided by your affective state and because it's the way I've linked in my research is by adding having this action model decision that we talk about in terms of the failing states so what you get as an interesting example, what I simulate here is a model that can do over thinking. And basically it's something that you may have come across in the way you describe some escape affective inference a long time ago is essentially this model actual precision is guiding the way the tree search is, and this performs but then at some points, this agent starts to imagine a little bit, yeah, some negative events and starts to"
"Speaker 3","00;40;15;26","00;40;41;06","basically the precision starts to drop off. That's the way to exploring the future. And they start and it starts to become more likely to imagine negative outcomes when the precision of their actual is high. And basically you have the confidence kind of course of action in mind and where they would go and would automatically down regulate unlikely negative events."
"Speaker 3","00;40;41;06","00;41;27;28","But once this precision started dropping, this agent started basically imagining these negative outcomes and that's made the precision drop more. And then this agent, yeah, you can see I kind of calculated in terms of the fraction of imagined events that were negative of negative outcomes like truth, perception or something. And, and just as an illustration of how you could simulate a process, something like what we would call ruminate and or at least like, yeah, a negative consequences produced by overthinking the situation and that's interesting because it means that your acting can also model too much."
"Speaker 3","00;41;29;08","00;42;17;07","You would think in machine learning that the longer you run your model, the better it gets. But once you get this kind of recursive relationship, you can actually get a kind of breakdown in in the way the future is imagined or anticipated. And you bring this one step further and it can also actually I have a picture here and then we'll just run so this is where something that looks a little bit like Maslow's hierarchy can come into play even, especially when you start to make this extra layers."
"Speaker 3","00;42;17;08","00;43;07;03","But here I just connected this sophisticated affective inference to high level states that in this case that describe exhaustion, hunger, and then states and the point is and is something I also highlighted last time we didn't show in the model so that the more hungry you are, the more strongly or driven by preferences for fruits, the more exhausted you are, the more strongly you are driven, driven to prevent expending energy and violence is then a kind of summary of how well you're able to manage all these different kinds of preferences."
"Speaker 3","00;43;07;17","00;43;41;01","And here and just showing an example simulation where you have these three different high level states and they're kind of, yeah, valence, sorry, exhausts, the exhaustion and hunger are kind of competing in a sense because the agent needs to to get foods, they need to expend energy and but yeah, well, they're at home resting. Their hunger increases. The energy levels."
"Speaker 3","00;43;41;06","00;44;19;05","Yeah, the exhaustion decreases. So there's this kind of cycle cyclical behavior where, yeah, if you follow, it's kind of interesting. You see that there is hunger in this case as a very strong driver of negative affects. And you see that whenever hunger is high and then it states as though and the best situations. Yeah. Are in this kind of cases where you see that both of them are low and sometimes they're basically, you know, not hungry and not exhausted either."
"Speaker 3","00;44;20;18","00;44;49;17","I mean, there's different kinds of balances you can implement here. And this is, in that sense, just an illustration that you can already think of ways in which and this also relates to things like depression, for example, where these people with depression would often reports or have that have experienced depression and with report that they have a lack of interest or reduced appetite."
"Speaker 3","00;44;50;17","00;45;34;10","Because if you're really exhausted, that means that you're have a strong preference against expanding energy. And that means that you're can anticipate the pleasure of eating in more than you can even experiencing because you have this extreme exhaustion or in this case, the Express, the Depression states will be associated with experience of lack of energy and I mean, this is like a sample of how different kinds of phenomena that we know from psychiatric conditions actually emerge."
"Speaker 3","00;45;34;10","00;46;00;12","Once you start to construct these types of models in detail. Let's see if I can see there's this aspect, too. So this is kind of on an individual level. And as I said, I wanted to share with you how this works. When you start to think about multiple unless there are any questions and I'll just continue."
"Speaker 1","00;46;01;22","00;46;10;12","You can hit hide on that stop sharing thing to move it. And then I think let's have Dean and then Stephen. So Dean, go for it."
"Speaker 4","00;46;12;05","00;46;42;14","Well, point being being being my question fits perfectly with what you just talked about. So essentially comparing a T search to a tree search, which I think of as natural order and your slide about combination or explosion. My question was in simple likelihood, mapping the binary is what it is. The Explorer action is limited. Answering what is good and what is bad on some version of valence continue on past that."
"Speaker 4","00;46;42;26","00;47;04;00","One wonders about what happens when trade offs become trade ins. This would add a layer of complexity by keeping what is good, what is bad in a what if to the mix in the teammates example, there would be a third option trapdoor with optioning as function being the key that there door would contain say four times reward and two times pain."
"Speaker 4","00;47;04;20","00;47;40;28","So not enough to cause permanent consequence, but still exponential relative to the cute outcome if we know Q To this option only the barrier that is either charged or not is transparent. You can see the reward, you can see the lightning bolt signaling signaling that the barrier could be charged based on what if, which extends the epistemic and specific of the simplified likelihood mapping to now include distribution which is third possibility and perception sensing, which is the potential shock just as part of a forex result."
"Speaker 4","00;47;40;28","00;48;06;29","Do you think effective charge remains continuous in terms of the path to renewed confidence? I know that's a really long thing, but essentially I thought this was the direction you might go with this work. And as it turned out, way to go because this is exactly the kind of question when you have a learner who's thrown into a novel context, they don't tend to only have a binary choice."
"Speaker 4","00;48;07;19","00;48;16;17","So how do we model for it? Because we want this to apply in real situations. So clap, clap. That's perfect."
"Speaker 3","00;48;18;00","00;48;52;25","Thanks. I mean, the continuous versus discrete stage space problem is pretty universal. Yeah. When I think the way our minds tend to deal with it is by course grading, it's first in like categories, and then later on when you're a locally installation, you end up sorting out the details on a continuous level. Exactly. So and that's I didn't I kind of ignored the continuous state space story here and just for the sake of the simulation."
"Speaker 3","00;48;53;16","00;49;09;07","But what's nice is when you start to look at the parameters actually you get do we get to continuous or like this or that way? The variables vary over the course of simulation. You got to the continuous part back so cool."
"Speaker 1","00;49;09;07","00;49;32;07","And also, Dean, in that I saw like you're approaching a t turn. It's a discrete choice in the moment, but when you pull back and when you include what if it almost makes continuous through the generative model of the learner in this case, it makes that situation go from discrete to continuous. And also when you're learning, you could rest or you could eat."
"Speaker 1","00;49;32;19","00;49;51;23","And so it's actually like our affect as learners, as we're optimally foraging. It really does need to be considered in an embodied sense because at any point, you know, when reading Kasper's paper, we all could have thought, wow, we're a little tired and then that changes. That's a binary decision, but it's part of multiple overlapping continuums."
"Speaker 4","00;49;52;05","00;49;55;01","So it's to reflect, reconcile, recover."
"Speaker 1","00;49;55;29","00;50;01;21","Cool. So thanks for the question, Dean. Stephen, go for the question and then anyone else. And then it's not Casper."
"Speaker 5","00;50;02;09","00;50;21;22","You know, just like to get your thoughts on how context comes in. I see that often we think about scaling and it's very tempting to sort of, oh, this can scale in many ways, but this almost speaks to this idea of like talk about trans contextual, anti AI. We need to think about different ways that we in the environment."
"Speaker 5","00;50;21;22","00;50;44;28","And I think that the way that also ties in with the psychiatric challenges is that, like you say, the affect starts to run away from itself so that unlike someone who maybe doesn't have that disorder and can recalibrate or re attuned to the new environment, someone with the disorder, it's sort of like you said, it runs away from itself."
"Speaker 5","00;50;44;29","00;51;00;07","But be interesting because one of the things with this work is it puts the environment into this, the potential treatment regime. And it doesn't just make it all about the mind and the body so just context and how that that that has an impact."
"Speaker 3","00;51;02;00","00;51;43;07","And yes, so in this types of models, in this case, I sympathize but as you remember from last time and this D high level D, which also includes contextual states and then those contextual states can be infer based on other things like external cues and so, for example, me observing myself and sitting at the dining table and smelling foods, I could trigger a kind of hunger state."
"Speaker 3","00;51;43;29","00;52;20;27","And then that increases my appetite or like increased my preference for eating food. So there's, there is as yeah, there's space to include just things like where the context determines the way your preferences are structured and or at least influences the way they're structured. So and this has an interesting implications for things like PTSD where people would get flashbacks when they're in a certain context that they associated with this experience or addiction."
"Speaker 3","00;52;20;28","00;52;47;21","It's almost like people on the first line of treatment in strong addictions as just take people out of their context so that these cravings aren't triggered so and I think when you say trans contextual, that's a really interesting worth. I guess what you mean is that you have a different version of you for every different context in the sense."
"Speaker 5","00;52;48;26","00;53;32;16","Yeah, and it's all it's that, that, that that piece. And they're talking about that a lot now with developing Gregory Bates in his work in terms of looking at multiple contexts and warm data to talking at warm data. So it's not just dead data, but is alive in a way. The sort of stuff which has affective content and trans context reality means if you want to understand different context and not just deal with them separately and interrelated and then the mess to be some way that they're the live in component, you know, context is somehow held alive yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;53;32;18","00;53;42;10","This is actually maybe that's a nice segue way unless there are other questions. That's a nice segue way to the culture part because great."
"Speaker 1","00;53;42;10","00;53;43;13","Yep. Go for it. Yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;53;44;16","00;53;44;25","OK."
"Speaker 3","00;53;47;17","00;54;29;01","Because the most stable part of our complex and besides basic physical variables like temperature and cetera, but our body temperature, for example. But once you move beyond that, one of the most stable components is other people in our environment and how we how we coordinate with them. And and it comes back to also some of the points that were made on the rhetorical story."
"Speaker 3","00;54;29;14","00;54;58;09","But just on a I guess I kind of like to start building on that. So I just start with the way the affective states translate sort of shared affects and culture emotions. So in this case, I constructs a few generative models and I can have the ones that are associated with competition or with cooperation. And there are different kinds of models."
"Speaker 3","00;54;58;09","00;55;29;14","And there would be if I believe somebody is an opponent, then I have a certain expectation about what they prefer. If they're antagonistic, then so in the sense that they prefer they like to observe that, I don't I don't get any reward or they may be just competing in a sense that they just want to maximize their own gain and different kinds of generative models I can have for the way other agents behave."
"Speaker 3","00;55;29;14","00;56;08;16","So that would be like the the antagonistic and competitive versions. And then there is like cooperation it can also have different flavors. You can have agents who genuinely have preferences for maximizing your gain as well. Or you can have agents who only cooperate when it's just because it happens to maximize their gain. And that these kinds of preference factors is basically what you can infer based on how people behave and what kind of situations they want."
"Speaker 3","00;56;08;22","00;56;44;16","And something like an altruistic altruism versus ego is an exit. I think they'd like that. But and then beyond egoism, there is something like Machiavellian is something like you want the other person to have less. And it's something I guess even beyond egoism, anyway, there's different kinds of generative models that you can apply to make sense of the behavior of others and just want to share with you a general like dynamic model with them."
"Speaker 3","00;56;44;16","00;57;18;17","It's and quite a long time ago before I actually got into active inference and modeling per se, and then it took a while to get published. But this is the work from students to ideas. And it's been and it was a pretty big challenge to get it published because people yeah, it's like the moment it's not very easy to sell to just psychologists are used to their tests and everything."
"Speaker 3","00;57;20;03","00;57;47;16","But this model was about child play or actually play can be any interaction between agents. Actually, it's less child play was more like the immediate application. But what is happening here is that every agent generates a decision and just the binary decision in this case zero and one. And so was mentioned before and you can often reduce it back to binaries."
"Speaker 3","00;57;48;29","00;58;42;07","And in this case it's about playing. So are they playing together, yes or no? If the agent tries to play with the other agent, then only if both of them are trying to do that. They have the emergent play outcome is playing together. So there is kind of conditionality embedded in there. And finally, if one of them tries to play together and the other one doesn't, then then you get the zero sense that they both end up being left the scale builds these dynamic model context I builds this Bernstein self influences on the self this based on emotion theory by Nicole Wright and her name is kind of famous in the Netherlands that the emotion"
"Speaker 3","00;58;42;07","00;59;18;11","theorists but then kind of revamps for dynamical system theory and the basic idea is that you have these concerns so that was also referred to these muscle pyramids and these concerns tend to drive behavior but they also tend to drive or tend to generate appraisals in terms of what are your concerns are are being met and that can trigger emotional expressions which then influence the other person in the body and vice versa, of course."
"Speaker 3","00;59;19;14","00;59;54;21","Oh, that was something from previous work. And then started to use this to generate an translated text, which essentially is pretty easy to do. So you can do this with almost any almost any dynamical model. So if you're interested in actually inference that you already are familiar with some other dynamical models, usually it's pretty straightforward. Translation just means that you're re-interpreting certain parts of the mass and sometimes means reorganizing certain equations."
"Speaker 3","00;59;54;21","01;00;30;18","But often the core notions underlying model because I mean, most models are always all I mean usually there of through quite carefully by scientists. So I tend to think of every model as potential. And yeah, that has something of value that can be translated into the new, into this interpretive framework and here it's about what kind of preferences the agents have and, and this is the lower level."
"Speaker 3","01;00;30;18","01;01;00;05","So I make it takes their preferences for being alone, being together. And then the kind of this parameter here would be something like a symmetry bias. So this preference against doing something else, then the other person it's, it's a more open hypothesis. As I said before, every model is that prioritization is an hypothesis and it can be tested there, such as symmetry bias and practice."
"Speaker 3","01;01;00;05","01;01;41;20","There does seem to be such a thing anyway, just not to overwhelm you with numbers, but we can then make this hierarchical and let it play out over and over time steps and then this agent starts to be able to manage their concerns over time. So some agents might like to play together a lot more than others. So then you get something like a baseline and concern for autonomy or that playing alone and versus and concern for togetherness or belonging."
"Speaker 3","01;01;43;07","01;02;13;09","And those would be, I think in every person are kind of competing so the idea here is that you're gathering evidence for each of these states and there they are driving your preferences but when you starts to feel too lonely, then you might be willing to sacrifice autonomy. And when you start to identify this person, when you need do you need more autonomy?"
"Speaker 3","01;02;13;22","01;02;50;06","Might be willing to and to play along. I mean, this is the basic concept. It can be applied to any kind of balancing act between preferences and you can also apply. Actually, this is another slide here. Anyway, I have applied the same concept to model things like trust. So trust games where you're trying to get a sense of are we in an context where we're working together or are we in the context of where we're at turn against each other?"
"Speaker 3","01;02;50;29","01;03;39;02","And it's actually the same types of models, but then with one additional twist is that now you're also inferring the preferences of the other agent instance and with the same models apply. So there's one I in addition to this, there's one final thing I wanted to see on what we have for quite some time is I just wanted to share with you a few slides from and finish this from a talk I gave with Max Ramstad in the Canadian neuroscience spotlight was there in September."
"Speaker 3","01;03;39;02","01;04;10;28","20, 20. And just to go a little bit more in depth on what you do when you have this type of model that's characterized with some psychiatric condition or. Correct. Right. So there's always different kinds of domains of the state space. And we start with something we kind of presuppose a functioning or at least the potential to function or to model."
"Speaker 3","01;04;12;14","01;04;44;01","And that's the kind of starting point. But then you look at, OK, in what ways can break down and what types of combinations of parameters result in different types, what we call computational phenotypes that could be associated with affective disorder. In this case, what's nice there is that you can now start to do computational phenotype together a kind of map of difference different kinds of problems that can emerge."
"Speaker 3","01;04;44;17","01;05;20;24","And this map doesn't need to be strictly categorical in the sense that the parameter space can be largely continuous. So you can get clustering, but it doesn't have to be absolute. You can co-morbidity you can get it for free because there's like this kind of coupling and you can get. Yeah, they simply combine it with things like our doc in an art, you're familiar with them, but this kind of alternative to the DSM, which is a category, has mostly a categorical approach."
"Speaker 3","01;05;22;11","01;06;01;08","Our doc tries to focus more also in the underlying mechanisms that generate these different networks. And in that sense, this type of computational phenotyping could be the underlying statistical tool that guides different kinds of investigations of not just affective disorders in the basic but also social emotional functioning because of course, as we started out in the beginning, those are intricately linked to each other."
"Speaker 3","01;06;03;07","01;06;39;20","And that's where the context becomes important and the way this is the final slide that I want to share and that we can now use these types of tools let's say we can fit them to individuals and based on a wide variety of data, can be self reports, can be objective measures can be also things like even the more traditional measures could be used to kind of initialize them all."
"Speaker 3","01;06;40;16","01;07;04;04","And there's different kind of different approaches you can take there. And the basic point is that now you can have and if you want, you have a model of the model, right? It's a, it's a mental model. It's a model of the model that tends to describe the way a person generates their behaviors and their false and the way their feelings evolve over time."
"Speaker 3","01;07;05;16","01;07;35;10","Once you have that, you can use that to employ and to basically forecaster and weather, so to speak. And those can be context dependent. They can be to come up with that kind of time back to your question, that was both on trans contextual and we know that the chances of rain are dependent on certain contextual factual factors that don't really depend on."
"Speaker 3","01;07;35;10","01;07;43;29","And the higher level dynamics on the scale that are not local. Yeah, it's not local."
"Speaker 3","01;07;46;07","01;08;36;24","In the same way what's happening down inside your body or let's say your heart rate can be contextualized by what's happening in the rest of the system and and in the end, what's to come dream for this psychiatric application? Objective of affective inference would be that therapists and psychiatrists, etc. don't have like a static thing, like a book like DSM that just puts people into boxes but instead they have this dynamic tool that updates itself by through feedback with the clients then release that through help the therapists, and then the therapists can also improve that too."
"Speaker 3","01;08;36;26","01;09;14;03","So in that sense, you get to try it where and this can be applied not just to therapist client relationships, but also can be applied to, let's say, help clients within their home environments to relate to their and their loved ones in school and or their unit and their work environments. This would be personalized treatment prediction tool and treatment monitoring."
"Speaker 3","01;09;14;03","01;09;51;14","So there's two different levels of application. I mean, I've focused here a lot on psychiatric applications because I think personally that's one of them. Yeah. One that finds the most fascinating. There's loads of other applications. You can think all these types of models can be used for all kinds of commercial purposes. If you think about entertainment industry, how to generate output, that it's kind of personalized to entertain somebody."
"Speaker 3","01;09;53;01","01;10;02;29","I mean, there's so many, so many steps that you can take. I just focus on the psychiatric side and that's pretty much it for now."
"Speaker 3","01;10;04;29","01;10;15;02","I'm sure there we can find some nice rabbit holes through, but let me see how I can stop cheering yes."
"Speaker 1","01;10;16;05","01;11;00;23","Yeah. Awesome. Thank you, Casper. Super great to have you. Just kind of help us revisit the paper and also some of your past work and some of this other work. And it really just struck me that you're talking about moving beyond the DSM into dynamic systems, modeling the other DSM so it's a little acronym overlap, but it just shows how when we have general principles, it helps us descend into the nuance and the context, the subtlety of a clinical relationship, an entertainment relationship, educational relationship, and actually do full justice to the complexity of the embodied situation rather than thinking that we're going to just have some sort of measly level theory that ends up actually"
"Speaker 1","01;11;00;23","01;11;17;18","falling in between. Sometimes General and dynamical systems theory or complexity theory and then on the actual specifics. So it was awesome to hear about these cases. So we have Steven and then Scott and then anyone else who raises their hand yeah."
"Speaker 5","01;11;17;18","01;11;51;04","Thanks. This is really exciting. I've been I've been reading some of the work around the, the dynamical sort of options for psychiatry that you've been doing. And I think one thing I notice is you talked about the self the other and then the outcome and like the outcome, it seems that as people get immersed in the outcome, it gives a way to resolve this self other dilemma, which is in a way that the trap of modern psychology and psychiatry is you name of the self because you can analyze the self and the other because you can name and analyze the other."
"Speaker 5","01;11;51;04","01;12;15;26","And then everything else just goes from there. And the model is just like is dominant but never spoken about. Whereas here that model center stage. But if you start to make it about the outcome and the context and then suddenly the self and the other can start to take a more dissolved space, you know, and, and the positive psychology and the client can start to have more agency in their own life."
"Speaker 5","01;12;15;29","01;12;25;18","So I was just interested in just how you saw that relationship to self other and outcome yeah."
"Speaker 3","01;12;25;18","01;13;07;10","I mean in the, in the interaction, the distinction kind of dissolves to some extent in the sense that they are going co-creating each other's models, so to speak, and they end up having like a shared reality in certain degree. And and what makes this reality real of like shared expectations is the fact that they have them together and many of things in society are actually function only because other because we all to some extent believe in them."
"Speaker 3","01;13;07;10","01;14;01;03","Like money is a very clear example. Like the only value money has is that other people believe it has value and again, I mean self other I guess you can't really escape it in the end I don't think we need to because if this just a matter of the level of description, I guess just like the cells in the body are clear units at the same time they are part of one whole and just like their gestalt, psychology kind of comes back to haunt you in the sense there's no emergent all this other than the sum of its parts I don't really mind talking about the units as long, but I think what you describe"
"Speaker 3","01;14;01;03","01;14;14;01","is really important that you keep in mind that there is like it's just one level of yeah, in the end a reduction I think there was another issue to follow up question."
"Speaker 5","01;14;15;20","01;14;35;22","Yeah, I think that makes sense. I think just like you were saying, if, if the outcome is being measured, does that change the way that we think about like if we start looking at the space, the environment, the outcome, the context I mean, are we in a whole different paradigm for treating disorders?"
"Speaker 3","01;14;35;28","01;15;03;19","OK, now that's a really interesting one because I mean, I know some really interesting research on the way in which psychiatric categories have influenced cognition and behavior across cultures. It's people believing they have depression or they have depression, and then they can get out of it because they ended up believing that that's their disease like a kind of discrete thing that they just stuck in."
"Speaker 3","01;15;04;13","01;15;35;05","And so that's really interesting. Some where categories in that sense are kind of like minds where and they program in the kind of specify the way you structure your world and what I like about this kind of individualized modeling is that you can move away from those categories. You don't even have to tell a person that they have a clinical diagnosis."
"Speaker 3","01;15;35;26","01;15;56;07","You can tell how you know how to help them because then they have individualized predictions for treatment, which you don't have to tell them, like, Oh, we're putting you in this building when there's somebody and it's like, it becomes like a spectrum and there's different attractors in that space."
"Speaker 3","01;15;58;27","01;16;11;12","We don't need to make this dichotomy. I mean, maybe for the insurance, that's the only limit it's like the insurance companies want to know, do we have to pay for this or not?"
"Speaker 1","01;16;11;26","01;16;35;15","And it it's so true that the implicit story of diagnosis is, you know, you got two kinds of people, the diagnosed and the undiagnosed. And if you have three of these five symptoms, you're in this box and it almost made me laugh for this last point about insurance. How about a paper affective charge? Let's continuously tune that dial if they just need a like, you know, a little bit, pay a little bit or something."
"Speaker 1","01;16;35;25","01;16;46;04","There's a whole level of nuance. That's when we're thinking about this in a in a big way. So thanks for that answer, Scott. Go ahead, Kasper."
"Speaker 3","01;16;46;04","01;17;11;29","That Scott want to respond to that because I had this interesting point where I was there was something I also was trying to I gave a talk in my psychology department or like the brain mission in my version where I was basically saying that in principle, if we can automate this, we can treat everybody to the extent that they're interested in like improving aspects of their life."
"Speaker 3","01;17;11;29","01;17;33;15","I think everybody has some things they would like to improve. So there's like don't even need to just limited to like the kind of model where you just wait until things go horribly wrong and then you start to try to help. And so like preventive treatments that are not based on this guy and this kind of disease model essentially."
"Speaker 1","01;17;35;28","01;17;48;27","And those programs might be revealed through these inferred parameters like uncertainty. So before the real situation begins, it's really a good point. So Scott, Dave in blue."
"Speaker 2","01;17;50;04","01;18;23;14","So fantastic. There's so many things, so many threads here. Let me pull a couple together. And it's on this space of social and internalized norms and folkways. So DSM four used to list the cultural phenomenon that weren't considered disorders like Tarantella or, you know, or the different things that, you know, they were cultural, not considered disorders but that always seemed to be very imperialistic the way they did that."
"Speaker 2","01;18;23;27","01;18;48;10","But it's kind of interesting when you start to move into the you mentioned insurance companies and what they will pay for the naming of disorders is, is many of them are just called disorders because they don't let you function as an industrial worker. You know what I mean? There's there's all sorts of contexts outside that dictates whether a disorder is a disorder."
"Speaker 2","01;18;48;21","01;19;20;25","And so I love that notion you were talking about, about the clustering and the predictive elements. There's a and a people in public health, non mental health a physical disease health talk about 40% for zero 40% of the global health effort for any emerging pandemic is repeated from one to another. So imagine the cost savings and resource savings if you can start to do predictive mental health like people have been talking about, the COVID is causing the PTSD generation."
"Speaker 2","01;19;21;18","01;19;59;12","So you can have these clusters of things that need to be dealt with and scales of billions of people. And that idea about merging treatment into norms. So really nothing about treatment. You're just talking about a continuity of existential support in society. That's that really is fascinating. Here's the question. So it's kind of an interesting there was an article in Soft Paternalism a number of years ago in The Economist, that idea that, for instance, if I have a gambling problem, I can register with the state of Missouri to not let me into the gambling ship that go up and down the Mississippi."
"Speaker 2","01;19;59;19","01;20;17;02","When I have a moment of clarity, I can say, don't let me on the ships and then I'm registered there and then they won't let me on the ships. When I'm feeling the urge to go gamble. So there's this kind of inviting that externality in. One of the things I wanted to ask you about is your thoughts, your gut thoughts on sovereignty."
"Speaker 2","01;20;17;24","01;20;55;15","And so I define a sovereign as something that doesn't need to ask for permission or forgiveness, and it's always an external teleology. It's always a projection, whether it's a deity or royalty or a country or a company. We project it out so we can self bind to it. OK, that's my assertion. OK, so I'm looking at that. Sovereignty has to have an abstraction of its subjects because that's the notion of so we project out it to be abstracting us so we can deal with the big problems and then the anomalies we take care with of with a mass customization of localizing it."
"Speaker 2","01;20;56;06","01;21;25;03","Right. So it feels like your clinical notion about psychological states could be employed for political purposes. And I'm talking about in a positive way, not in a bad manipulation, but through good intentional manipulation of the affective states that are positive for civic engagement. And then you basically use the same notions is psychological disorders, but you start correcting for, let's call them political disorders."
"Speaker 2","01;21;26;18","01;21;47;24","Right, because that's normative states. Right? So that's what I'm curious about is have you done any thinking about how to project cultural states from a group like like projecting on the screen and then everyone watches it and says, huh, that's us up there. Let's go move towards that. Now, sort of a question."
"Speaker 3","01;21;48;27","01;22;21;27","And the really interesting question and I have asked doing that works on like community if cultural dynamics and simulating the way in which beliefs kind of in a kind of minimalistic way that can be seen as um yeah. Mobile to the choir similarly to viral spreads of but then they're from the perspective of the beliefs that are spreading it's kind of like every time it's trying to be it's somebody tries to transmit it to the next person."
"Speaker 3","01;22;22;25","01;22;50;04","The question is how well does this fit with the next mindset? And only then only if it's close enough and it can be fixed, can reproduce essentially so then your question is kind of like one level beyond that where you're like you're trying to predict which message will fits which group of people, and then that can be taken in very evil directions."
"Speaker 3","01;22;50;17","01;23;03;20","But you can also kind of use it maybe to break political bubbles and extremism or something. So there is different kinds, of course, in the ends of a tool, and that's right."
"Speaker 1","01;23;04;07","01;23;25;27","And one note on that political side and something people bring up is we're not simply talking about the communications or just the rhetoric display. It's actually about doing a systems identification and potentially finding latent areas of agreement that are just two terms being used by two communities, for example. So, yeah, but very important and interesting topics."
"Speaker 3","01;23;26;15","01;23;51;19","I was just wondering, so you talked about sovereignty, so I was wondering how you view that connection to sovereignty, because the way I see sovereignty is just like a sovereign body is like something that has complete power over certain domain. And then talking about people within that domain. So they're completely under the sovereignty of that governing body."
"Speaker 2","01;23;52;01","01;24;08;29","Right the way the way the link happens is my assertion is that all sovereigns are projections, so they are the gods. I don't say you invented God because I'm an atheist, but it might be a blasphemy to other people. So we invented deities. This is different."
"Speaker 3","01;24;09;01","01;24;11;28","As so it's like we."
"Speaker 2","01;24;11;28","01;24;39;06","Invented royalty, we invented countries, we invented companies. Name another sovereign. They're the things that don't ask for permission or forgiveness. We invented them so that we can organize at larger level. So we didn't say it explicitly, but that's why we did it. And so all of them are projections so they're all stories from us now. They take on a separate life, so sort of, but they can never be identified."
"Speaker 2","01;24;39;06","01;25;02;22","That's the thing about sovereigns there's always a metaphysical element. They can never be identical to the subjects. That's why you that's why when a sovereign dies in office, it's a it's a real difficulty for the sovereignty. When a human who represents the sovereign dies because it has to be separated out. You have a state funeral but then the body has to be separated from the body politic."
"Speaker 2","01;25;03;10","01;25;26;09","It's it's hard. It's a leviathan thing. Leviathan can't be composed of the individual parts. It takes on a separate nature and anyway, so that's why this is so interesting. That rejection and that act of collective projection is totally where we are right now. Think about all the problems climate change, global resources, water resources, finance, things that can be done by nation states."
"Speaker 2","01;25;26;15","01;25;54;08","We need new sovereign levels, active inference is going to be the way that we synthesize them. It will be whether we call it active inference or not, because it's all we've ever done as biological than living and social organisms, and it's a way of framing it. And so it's a way of now to me, it's a new teleology we can project forward, just like you're saying, predicting and psychology I think we can predict politics and social states because we can use predictive analytics of clustering."
"Speaker 2","01;25;54;08","01;25;56;03","It's the same thing. You take a bunch of."
"Speaker 3","01;25;56;24","01;26;16;17","Another student who was modeling the elections, American elections with the same I like what you said about it's kind of subjective. It's like the attribution of power, and then it's like a totally imaginary thing, just like we had to use power to money."
"Speaker 2","01;26;17;07","01;26;35;22","Yeah, no. Yeah. I mean, money is, is de-risking. Consolidator, you know, is one form of money. Waksal and Smith and human, they all have different ideas about money. But one way you can look at it as a de-risking consolidator. So it takes all risk and makes it into one risk, which is how can I get more money? And if that's the case, it's an interaction de-risking tool."
"Speaker 3","01;26;36;03","01;26;57;05","Right? This could give us a way to discuss the reasons also to the earlier point of instrumental ism and really just the fact that money has instrumental value. This would make it real. I mean, that's like kind of an interesting question that I don't have an answer to, right? Yes. In practice, is really this people look at this thing."
"Speaker 2","01;26;57;19","01;27;20;08","And one thing one thing I just suggest you look at as somebody just surprised me a couple of months ago about Christopher Alexander's work in architecture. If you haven't run into that, check it out. Because what he does is basically looks at patterns in architecture through deep time and and through space. And the idea is that existing practices are captured in patterns of practice."
"Speaker 2","01;27;21;00","01;27;42;29","And if you want to look at a solution for an early for a problem, look at patterns of practice from other situations and bring them into the situation here. Similarly, it feels like we can in your work, it's revealing that we can look at patterns of practice and then take them as predictive models. And so that's what Chris Alexander does that in architecture."
"Speaker 2","01;27;43;07","01;27;55;04","And it's very straightforward there because it's physical instantiations like an archeology of the mind of architecture in a way, or the archeology of the problem space anyway. Something to look at. It might be fruitful. Thanks."
"Speaker 3","01;27;55;13","01;27;55;22","Thank you."
"Speaker 1","01;27;56;01","01;28;00;26","Scott. So we have Dave Blue and then a question from the chat. So go ahead, Dave."
"Speaker 4","01;28;04;02","01;28;40;13","Yeah. If you could turn toward the realistic side of your experience with these questions. Do you, Casper, have the feeling that people's real models are of the same structure as these trans personal models or person to environment or organism to environment? Folks in this field seem to kind of assume that, oh yeah, it is all turtles all the way down, or it's blanket's all the way down."
"Speaker 4","01;28;40;13","01;28;43;18","And I don't know that I'm convinced of that. What's your intuition?"
"Speaker 3","01;28;45;01","01;28;46;03","Interesting question."
"Speaker 3","01;28;50;08","01;29;18;00","I think that it's kind of similar to the way that the, um, you can last time we talked about dimensionality and you can project from 3D into 2D space but like understanding a 3D space while you're in a 2D space is kind of impossible. Essentially, in the end, it's a little bit similar. Like looking down on the hierarchy."
"Speaker 3","01;29;18;01","01;29;30;02","I think it's much easier, makes things feel much realer, more real because essentially they can they're within your you know, your minds can grasp them."
"Speaker 3","01;29;32;13","01;30;15;24","And when you move upwards, you're sort of the transpersonal part. I think it's and our minds don't have the capacity to fully grasp something like that. We can. So it doesn't have this same experiential Yeah, I say detailed maybe. And so, yeah, I think you're getting at an interesting point where there seems to be a difference between the way what experientially feels real and what's in it from an instrument instrumentalist perspective."
"Speaker 3","01;30;16;02","01;31;00;19","And there doesn't seem to be much of a difference if you through the transpersonal. Let me just like as I said, I think in principle humans conform, but higher levels of organization conform bodies together. And every humans unit in this body, just like every cell and every organ in the end has its own local experience. So to speak, its own local data, maybe that it's being integrated and to form their states and their decisions."
"Speaker 3","01;31;02;25","01;31;33;01","But then there's the global pattern, and that's the local elements never have direct access to it. And I think that's something that's it's at this point that you're describing Yeah, I guess I don't have a real answer just experientially what you're saying in the sense that definitely there are things that feel real There are things that don't exist, that feel real."
"Speaker 3","01;31;33;02","01;31;53;21","That's also so there are ways in which our friends personal concepts can start to trigger hallucinations. People, for example, getting all kinds of edge cases. And this that answer your question, I think is a really interesting one. I don't have a good answer for you."
"Speaker 4","01;31;53;23","01;32;17;12","It does. Yeah, I think it is. An elephant in the room, perhaps. Yeah. And if I could just run off on a tangent on that. Um, the relation between inner in the sense of what's inside A for stony and blanket and inner in the sense of what's going on in various parts of the nervous system or the organism."
"Speaker 4","01;32;18;10","01;32;51;29","I tend to come at this by thinking that what the, the physiological, the anatomical correlates of what we've been focusing on for the last two weeks are largely going on in the midbrain, the brain stem some of the lower structures in the cortex, but the modeling goes on in the neocortex. So the inside is actually executed outside in the portion of the nervous system."
"Speaker 4","01;32;51;29","01;33;13;10","That's really good at doing algorithms and pattern matching and re-investment of pattern transformations. But the purpose of doing the whole thing is largely, especially in a small child or a non-human mammal outside the cortex. So that probably blows the whole thing."
"Speaker 3","01;33;15;13","01;33;50;08","In principle from the models that the eye builds. That usually doesn't really matter where the data comes from. Like A can be into internal signals, external It's more important what the inference is about. So, like extra perception is this perception about external states of the world through deception, about an internal states system that I can have access or external signals that may give me information about my internal states and vice versa."
"Speaker 3","01;33;51;17","01;34;07;16","And so this distinction is pretty important. So that yeah, that doesn't entirely resolve the issue. And I like the fact that the models are kind of agnostic about where exactly the information come from."
"Speaker 1","01;34;09;15","01;34;16;28","Whom a lot to say on this blue. And then a question from the chat and then anyone else in the chat or here who wants to ask."
"Speaker 4","01;34;19;14","01;35;05;16","So I loved the diagnosis or the elimination of diagnosis and clustering instead of, of diagnosing people except like when it comes to insurance. And so, Kasper, I'm going to charge you with obliterating this in the minds of, of insurance companies. Also because they think that there's this fundamental thing that happens. And I mean, maybe I'm wrong, but if I, you know, if I display some behavior of you know, someone with ADHD and I display a lot of those behaviors, so if I display some of this behavior, but then I go see a psychiatrist and I'm diagnosed with ADHD, I think that there's a large degree, especially in younger children, like as they're coming into themselves"
"Speaker 4","01;35;05;16","01;35;32;06","and dealing with identity crisis teenagers. And so forth. I think that there's a large degree of of excusing or perpetuating my behavior because I have a diagnosis. Right. So so if I'm diagnosed with something like ADHD, like maybe that will, you know, give me I'll give myself permission or excuse or or I'll cluster more strongly into the group of people that have those kinds of behaviors."
"Speaker 4","01;35;32;13","01;35;36;20","Because I have a diagnosis. I think that this is very plausible. What do you think."
"Speaker 3","01;35;38;28","01;36;25;04","And that's also what I was starting to get a sense that people tend to use use these internal representations to structure their experience and then to respond to generate their responses. And then these boxes become self-fulfilling prophecies. And to certain extent, there's that side, but there's also then there's another side to it is that there are also positive reports that people, when they can attribute the effects to something makes them feel less anxious so they can kind of explain things away."
"Speaker 3","01;36;26;23","01;36;33;22","And and yeah, I don't know what's downsides and upsides and."
"Speaker 1","01;36;34;14","01;37;09;19","Yet a very sensitive and interesting thing, but it reminds me of the 12 steps and the first step is to acknowledge the kind of person that one is. Obviously, we're not going to go into this and it's for others to investigate, but it's a trade off between having a narrative certainty, a diagnostic confidence versus the alternative. And so there's our teams in meaning or in narrative space, which one of these bifurcation paths narratively will we then have the lower levels of our model, like whether we exercise or not or whether we have a job or not?"
"Speaker 1","01;37;09;29","01;37;32;14","Those kinds of things. Come into play. I want to ask the question from the chat and then Dean and Stephen and Scott. So in the chat someone wrote, Can free energy principle based models reach a level in the future to be able to precisely predict when emotion or valence happens, and more importantly, when in the temporal dynamics of that cycle, those thoughts subside."
"Speaker 1","01;37;33;03","01;37;44;23","So how is our experience of thought related to some of these simulations with, you know, the countervailing affect of countervailing you know, here in the States? Where does our experience of thought come into play?"
"Speaker 3","01;37;47;03","01;37;47;12","Hmm."
"Speaker 3","01;37;49;12","01;38;58;06","I mean, it's to some extent already being done in the sense that there's applications of in Amsterdam, they have they have been treating OCD with deep brain stimulation and they identify the locus of intervention using ephemera and ephemera. It's driven by design, which is driven by energy minimization. So we're already doing that to some degree, identifying the kind of recurrent self-destructive loops of behavior in the brain, essentially internal behavior of the system, and then identifying ways to break break those loops and then plants just try to find the kind of nodes at which the loops through which the loop is circulating and then they disturb that node once in a while."
"Speaker 3","01;38;58;17","01;39;53;01","And that actually leads to an in provement in function It's kind of funny because when they remove and loops tend to return pretty quickly. So it seems not to be an it can. It's not the pool treatment's more like a prevention when it gets more interesting if you have like real time way of getting into the then that you don't you need not just like an electrode there like a whole a whole array of throws that are like tricking and it's a little bit scary, but in principle you could have like a whole weather tracking system inside and then if there's a hurricane emerging and blocking them, I mean, they tried to do that already"
"Speaker 3","01;39;53;01","01;40;31;17","for people with epilepsy and I guess then we all become like a cyborg or something. If you start to go to that, the investments, maybe not the I mean, what I guess I find more interesting or more appealing is some if we start to become more aware of how these feelings are generated by our relation with the external world, so mean there is this use case of tracking warehouse workers."
"Speaker 3","01;40;32;02","01;41;27;00","I've been seeking to apply some of my work to where you could track their affective states over the course of the day. And every person has a different prototype. Every person has different times of day when they feel most energy. And it depends also on how well they've slept recently, et cetera. And so if you had an intelligence warehousing system, then you could best you could distribute tests and schedule the warehouse could be adjusted to suit the preferences to maximize well-being of the workers and potentially in the process also increase productivity, sort of like capitalist stick potentially if we could could start things like that and we could use our modeling of these affective dynamics"
"Speaker 3","01;41;27;00","01;42;00;11","over the course of day by day for each individual, we could use them to be care for people, to make them to prevent burnout and and potentially make that feeling for people who are just driven by money, by profits. And fortunately, they're always just most companies are just driven by profits. So to make that too realistic and scalable, you need to show that also is good for the business anyway."
"Speaker 3","01;42;00;11","01;42;08;24","So that's like something else I have in reaction to this question. You know, there was a subcomponent. What was the second part? Could you read that again?"
"Speaker 1","01;42;10;11","01;42;15;14","More importantly, where in this temporal dynamical cycle does thought subside."
"Speaker 3","01;42;16;15","01;43;01;02","To and that's a very mean this question. And I wish I knew. Let's keep thinking on it. I guess there's certain parts of our system that are able to are, of course, abusing to our verbalization and the way our few fault, at least the kinds of introspective thoughts that scribble and tends to be that internal internalized social skills and training and you first need to learn about how to speak with others."
"Speaker 3","01;43;01;02","01;43;31;08","And then that's the child. I guess when you're really young, at some point you start to be able to have these dynamics run internally. And my suspicion is I think there's some recent actually confirming this to some extent, but in order to create the verbal thoughts, you need to access the firm and you just attenuates the actual motor execution and that's how they tend to think about it in the literature."
"Speaker 3","01;43;32;18","01;44;34;23","And then there's imagery art, which is in a sense even more amazing, maybe because that's not something you can I mean, verbal, that's an actual action that you do and so it's kind of easier to imagine how you could have this action you like unfolds internally. But imagery is not something that you actually do in life. It's something you can somehow when you control your own internal pathways that you normally you would use for for having a visual sensation your mental actions can somehow control your visual processing pathways, which are a hard time imagining how exactly thing I mean, I can build a model of that."
"Speaker 3","01;44;34;23","01;44;43;06","I think that's how it works in like biologically I find it quite hard to yeah."
"Speaker 1","01;44;43;11","01;45;04;02","Well, that's, that's the instrumentalist tango. We can build a few model architectures. We could think about some differentiating experiments. We could imagine some informative observation ins go from there, continue the discussion from there. So in our last little bit, let's go with Dean Scott, Stephen thanks."
"Speaker 4","01;45;04;08","01;45;26;17","Real quick, we talked about personalized stuff and the loop seems to come back on politics because remember a couple of weeks ago, I the first thing I think I said to you after high was we can't unlearn this. Once we start using these diagnostic tools, we can't unsee it. So there's a lot of politics involved. And people have this ability to to see things."
"Speaker 4","01;45;27;23","01;45;54;01","One thing, one reference I wanted to mention and be especially I think, helpful to Scott if he hasn't already read it about this personalized versus political is an author by the name of Paul Kohn, Paul W Klein and his book is called Origins of Order. And what it does is it tries to bring those two ends of that continuum into some sort of a not like there's no balance between the two, but there's kind of a back and forth."
"Speaker 4","01;45;54;14","01;46;20;07","And it's very looking at rules, but not just on a legal level, but on the on on much bigger scales. So it kind of fits nicely with what Blue said about the diagnostics. Well, we've touched on a couple times both the instrumental stuff, but I still think that if you try to apply a lot of this stuff, too, which is what I did before, I use very rudimentary ways of expressing this."
"Speaker 4","01;46;20;07","01;46;43;14","But I gave young learners these tools and boy, was it political, the results of that, because they could just see things and start doing things. And there's a whole lot of people that went Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. They're getting way too much power from this. But anyway, that's just an aside. I just wanted to share the reference because I think it really ties in nicely with some of the stuff that Scott was talking about earlier."
"Speaker 4","01;46;43;14","01;46;48;29","And obviously, I don't think the political part of it goes away no matter how much we want to be agnostic."
"Speaker 3","01;46;49;08","01;47;17;15","Thanks I mean, in a political context, in a sense, what we're trying to determine is what what is the generative model that governs the body? So like this conflict and tension and tension resolution and kind of the price we pay for being able to organize."
"Speaker 1","01;47;17;26","01;47;34;08","It's it's the body politic the leviathan as brought up earlier. Will we turn left? Will we turn right? Will we look forward? Will we look backwards? There's a lot to this multilevel political approach. So Scott and then Stephen."
"Speaker 2","01;47;35;28","01;48;00;22","Yeah, thanks to the it is a big it's like moving a slime mold but you know from outside the couple of things that jumped in in the last bit and where I'm going with this is the notion of a capitalist enclosure of consciousness with the categories of abstraction. So the painter Kandinsky and I've said this before, it just preys in my mind."
"Speaker 2","01;48;01;00","01;48;24;29","Painter Kandinsky said that violent societies yield abstract art. And one of the things I've always wondered about is, is the reverse also true is abstraction a form of violence? And so here one of the things that I was thinking about in the last couple of comments was symbolic synesthesia right? When we don't really have a perceptual synesthesia, but we take symbols and we substitute them in for things."
"Speaker 2","01;48;25;11","01;48;42;29","So like if I drank tequila when I had a bad experience with some bad tequila experience with something else, then I'll remember the bad tequila experience as associated with that other thing. Not that I ever had a bad tequila experience. I'm just saying if it ever happened. So that abstraction, you know, we had, that kind of becomes our prior whatever."
"Speaker 2","01;48;43;09","01;49;10;14","And it goes back to that notion of the humor element to the abstractions are taking us to a place and then revealing the reveal comes. Right? And so one of the things I was wondering about on the capitalist side, we don't want surprise. We don't want punchlines for jokes because that's risk right now. You don't have innovation then that's the problem is there's this tension between innovation and status, right?"
"Speaker 2","01;49;10;22","01;49;33;09","And so they want innovation, but they want somebody else to innovate and take the risk, but then they want the benefit anyway. So from Coppola's enclosure perspective, one of the things I'm wondering is, does active inference and this is the question, does active inference we're all taking care of each other's active inference exhaust. Right? We're all taking the we're everyone's doing active inference on each other and we're all the externality is for everyone else."
"Speaker 2","01;49;33;09","01;50;15;06","And so we're all having to internalize everyone else's discovery pathway in a sense. Right. We're if you do it, we're loading on each other. So that space of exhaust management is a commons in a way. We're co-managing the risk. So when I talk about money as a universal risk consolidator, might the metrics of value in markets give us insight, not entire insights, because markets don't tell you everything and not everything is measurable that way, but give us insights into preferences in a way that starts to give us the insight into that whole management of the active inference exhaust, essentially."
"Speaker 2","01;50;15;14","01;50;37;23","So it's really treating it commons not as a fisheries commons like with an asset commons, but as a risk commons. And it's basically consciousness as a commons. So the imagine that the mind exists in language rather than the brain. The brains are tuned in to the shared mind and now we've got to manage that share mind so we get nonsense in there."
"Speaker 2","01;50;37;23","01;51;00;16","Something that's wrong science or bad politics or not functional economics or whatever. And we want to get rid of that because it's spoiling the commons so just that was what came to me that this idea of the sovereign feels like how we synthesize an externality to say, whoa, whoa, whoa, we got to get this right because we got some big scale stuff we got to do, like ants and bees can do without memos."
"Speaker 2","01;51;00;16","01;51;24;09","We got, we have memos, we got to write the memos. The what are the memos say and that's why you get the DSM and stuff like that. And what they're saying is, just like Poco said, pastoral control is what drives people together with certain behavior. Right? And so it's that same thing. Are we being driven? Is it is are we being driven to be industrial workers or now we're being driven to something else?"
"Speaker 2","01;51;24;09","01;51;34;08","And how do we manage that, that commons of our inference, active inference commons to aspire to what we want to be. Now, there is a question. It's very."
"Speaker 3","01;51;36;09","01;52;05;16","Bad. I mean, it kind of makes me think about the way in which in the major religions that mostly emerged, the Sunnis, at least during the same amount of time that they ended up being able to write about on this thing. So it's like there was a recursive relation for example, you basically need a culture. And for that level of unity, there's two directions you can go, and I guess it's probably both ways."
"Speaker 3","01;52;05;16","01;52;24;05","But on the one hand, you need to be organized enough to have a culture that you're able to write things down. And once you're able to do so, you can basically you can kind of hard code the structures and then the having a competitive advantage over other potential models."
"Speaker 2","01;52;25;10","01;52;50;20","So maybe the mind and culture are emerging phenomenon of complexity, right? Maybe complexity causes the mind because we need we need to when we say we need to do something we often think it's in response to something. But maybe that thing itself is another instantiation of complexity itself. And so maybe what we're doing is merely red cleaning the whole thing, right?"
"Speaker 2","01;52;50;20","01;53;19;09","Just keeping up. We think we're actually innovating and doing things. But really what's happening is with increasing exponential increase in interaction volume, and this and this is that this is what I actually believe in pursuing. It is a raw increase since the Big Bang, an exponential increase in interaction volume. Maybe all we do is just keep up and keep dealing with that externality as living organisms."
"Speaker 2","01;53;19;09","01;53;29;08","In order to maintain neg entropy states, maybe we just have to keep rushing into higher levels of order organization in order just to not dissipate it. Anyway."
"Speaker 1","01;53;30;05","01;53;30;22","Thank you."
"Speaker 2","01;53;30;23","01;53;31;17","Scott. Good stuff."
"Speaker 3","01;53;32;01","01;54;07;21","There's also opposites ways thinking about like, why are these organized structures are like the best way to dissipate energy. So there is like a kind of just like the convective bubbles in in some kind of heat. The volume of water or fluid. And the substructure basically helps the system to dissipate the energy so there are certain it's like an interesting two ways of looking at same thing."
"Speaker 2","01;54;07;21","01;54;25;19","And yet it's that structural dissipation of risk is what you have in law. And that's that's all it is. It's just it's a time machine that predicts the future. Everyone can look at the prediction in a contract or law. It's enforceable and they can rely on it. And so it saves resources. So it's exactly what you're saying."
"Speaker 1","01;54;27;09","01;54;31;26","Thank you, Steven. If you wanna make a really quick last comment, because we're out of time and then we'll close out."
"Speaker 5","01;54;32;17","01;54;56;24","Yeah, thanks. I was just going to say, I mean, so tired of this idea of abstraction. And the fact is, I do a lot of work with action methods and ways of working in space. And I think it ties into this question. I think it might also tie into next week's talk is the certain things that we can realistically get a handle on if we can take a perspective on it."
"Speaker 5","01;54;56;25","01;55;23;08","So for instance, you talked about exterior perception at some times it gives you information you take your perspective on to reflect on your internal state and maybe you look at your internal states. But I think there is this danger that this abstraction starts to take over because there's a whole load of levels, particularly you know, we don't see in body, which we can't see."
"Speaker 5","01;55;23;08","01;55;54;12","And that's OK. You know, these these blankets and blankets can go down and it's beyond our perception to take a thought on. And the reason that I think that can be interesting is, is because in action methods in psychology drama and these types of action approaches rather than the Freudian approaches which basically took over, is, OK, you can't take all these precepts, perspectives and analyze it in the way that we've got in this habit of doing."
"Speaker 5","01;55;54;26","01;56;36;23","But these other ways of knowing, embody and exploring I think that that also is another direction which often is not thought about. So I just think that as we go into this what you're saying and the way that we think about Instrumentalize action is that we might need to instrumentalize using the sort of the more embodied affective methods and processes, as well as this kind of other approaches, because I think that we will hit the limits of an analysis and I think that might be something that this conversation sort of talked about."
"Speaker 5","01;56;36;23","01;56;41;21","So I just sort of put that off again. If you got any thoughts on that now, thanks a lot for a great presentation."
"Speaker 3","01;56;42;24","01;57;27;14","Now, I mean, I think you're make a very good point and that's and thanks for the compliment. And I mean, just the connection, the integration across levels let's say that's important for your wellbeing then what you described is a very logical pathway to improve people's mental state as well when they're more connected with their embodied existence. Instead of living in that abstract space I mean, I think I have as a scientist, I have a pretty increased risk of going down that path because you're always thinking about things."
"Speaker 3","01;57;27;14","01;57;45;20","So and I totally agree that that's probably many treatments actually. I mean, that's my meditation session used to be such an effective tool. The tool yeah. Yeah. Thanks for the thoughts. Very good points."
"Speaker 1","01;57;45;28","01;58;04;13","Yeah. Thanks so much everyone for participating. And Caspar, it's you're not always thinking sometimes you're coming on and hanging out with us, I guess, but maybe thinking during that too. But really fun discussion. We hope to have all of you on again, whether it's a paper you've authored or not. So thanks a lot."
"Speaker 3","01;58;04;13","01;58;05;27","And yeah."
"Speaker 1","01;58;06;17","01;58;23;16","Till next time. Next time it's time. So next time. So this time. Next time. This time. Next time. Next time. It's time."
