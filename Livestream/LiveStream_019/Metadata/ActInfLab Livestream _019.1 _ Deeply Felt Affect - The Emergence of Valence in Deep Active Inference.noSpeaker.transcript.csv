"Unknown","00;00;10;26","00;00;45;04","Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Active Inference Lab and to the Active Inference Live Stream. This is Active Inference Live Stream 19.1 on April 6th 2021. Welcome to the Active Inference Lab. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at our links and contact information here. This is recorded in an archived live stream, so please provide us feedback so that we can improve our work all backgrounds."
"Unknown","00;00;45;04","00;01;12;27","And perspectives are welcome here and we'll be following hopefully video etiquette for livestreams such as muting when there's noise in our background and raising our hands so we can hear from everyone who wants to speak. You can go to this shortened link to see the upcoming streams of different kinds. Today we're in 19.1 on April six, and we'll be having a follow up group discussion next week on April 13th."
"Unknown","00;01;13;16","00;02;02;27","Hello, Stephen. We're already life. So today in Active Inference 19.1, the goal is really just to learn and discuss about this really awesome paper. Deeply felt affect the emergence of Valence and Active Inference by Kasper Hespe, Brian Smith, Thomas, PA, Mika Allen, Carl, Kristen and Maxwell Ramstad. And we're really appreciative that Casper has joined us today and anyone of these other authors are free to join us next week or the following in 19.1, we're going to go over the various parts of the paper in any order that people want to raise them and we can just start with some short introductions and warmups that will be culminating in Casper and giving a little maybe just"
"Unknown","00;02;02;27","00;02;35;03","introduction or a background. And that will be great to start with. So I'm Daniel. I'm a postdoc in California, and I will pass it to Sarah I'm Sarah. I'm a person stuck in Berlin because I can't update my visa next Hello, I'm Steven. I'm in Toronto, and I'm very much looking forward to learning more about Affect and its relationship to active influence."
"Unknown","00;02;35;03","00;03;04;11","And I'm going to pass it to Dave Gay, Dave Douglas, Simon, the mountains of the Philippines retired from information technology, including natural language processing and machine translation. Background in process philosopher Lee Whitehead especially and cybernetics. And I will pass to Dean if he hasn't spoken yet. I'm Dean. I'm from Calgary."
"Unknown","00;03;06;19","00;03;41;18","Retired, but really interested in this stuff. I don't know who I can pass to other than maybe Casper at surf. Yeah. My name is Casper. I'm the student at the University of Amsterdam, currently doing that kind of being co supervised by two professors at Amsterdam and one being at the University College London. So that's one you all know person."
"Unknown","00;03;42;29","00;04;25;06","It's like my name and external supervisor. And this paper was developed, and there he is in his lab simply with a bunch of three wonderful people. Actually, my go first author and is not here today, but I am aware that there's been Ryan Smith has been with you on many of these sessions and yeah. So I think I will just go into the intro of the paper and I guess it will be interesting because you can read in the paper itself."
"Unknown","00;04;25;06","00;05;06;14","So kind of formal motivation. I will tell you a little bit more about the story behind how this how this came about. For me, when I first entered the group, there was most of the modeling that was done was the single layers, and there was already some preliminary work from deep temporal modeling and that's essentially working out the implications of this kind of hierarchical models that start to look more like the one that you might have come across some deep learning research."
"Unknown","00;05;07;02","00;05;50;24","The now with invasion invasion flavor and one of the things that I was missing personally was a meta cognitive aspect that moves beyond just estimating confidence is one aspect. But then reflecting on that confidence estimates to give you an idea of something that can regulate other parts of the system. So we ended up going back and forth on this topic with and Thomas Barr was held there as well."
"Unknown","00;05;51;07","00;06;27;14","And then he's also on the paper essentially thinking about these action models of influence and about presupposing some degree of familiarity. But I suppose I can quickly recap and essentially the way I've presented it in paper, it's really meant to be something that you start from zero knowledge about equity inference, and they kind of build it up in steps so that people who are not super familiar with it."
"Unknown","00;06;27;17","00;07;13;10","Yeah, I guess it's like an that these, these steps essentially the point is that these diagrams have a very mathematical meaning for very specific mathematical and when you just present people the whole diagram of once what they call directed cyclical graphs, it usually is pretty overwhelming so for this paper, I decided to go back and just give the viewer, the reader, the very stepwise kind of incremental priming to go and we start with these first two states and then they're being linked."
"Unknown","00;07;13;23","00;08;02;09","It's the types of states and seven states and sensory states. And that's really the kind of core. And what's interesting is that it's very modular. So if you go to the next slide, we and so don't if you just ignore the maps for now. But the nice idea here is that these graphs are entirely or it's kind of like a Lego box essentially so once you understand the first piece of the puzzle in and one and inferring it in states based on sensory states, you can basically understand all the other graphs as well."
"Unknown","00;08;03;01","00;08;36;21","Certainly the three point we introduce links between continuous and discrete states basis. So that's where it gets a little bit more mathematically the one thing to keep in mind when reading these figures is that down stream on the arrows is always about prediction. So here for example, the prior over and states on the top the predicts and the hidden state, we know that it's for downstream on the arrows."
"Unknown","00;08;36;21","00;09;06;06","We're talking about prediction upstream, we're talking about inference. So in this case you have you start from the prior make prediction about what the hidden states are appearing and then moving from these hidden states make a prediction about what the sensory states. So that's where like you see them. So that's one crucial aspect. So downstream prediction, upstream inference."
"Unknown","00;09;07;08","00;09;38;19","Then there's another crucial part that you need to know in order to interpret these figures is that the circles are variables and the squares are parameters. So in this case, hidden states and sensory states, those aren't lives within the circles the essence of those can vary over the course of the simulation. If you set it up in this very simplistic way, then the squares are big so the values in the prior and the likelihood method are fixed in this very simple system."
"Unknown","00;09;39;23","00;10;11;27","And once you understand this, you can start hooking these things up to each other so we can once we linked another circle to the square, then this the mappings become variable as well and you will see that come back later. Maybe that's it without generalize this reading of the figure to the second. And so to do exactly the same Max is applied to this way."
"Unknown","00;10;11;27","00;10;33;26","The states over time. So generative model anticipation is using current states to make predictions about features that's that's where we come to the third part of these kinds of graphs. This pretty important to know is that from reading from left to right it's supposed to be the temporal dimension."
"Unknown","00;10;36;01","00;11;14;10","So as one is used to make predictions about a student and a base, if you have knowledge about a student you can make inferences about what is one what's the most likely state in the test as well. So it works both ways. The and so that's perception and anticipation and obviously entirely reduce to the most simple that's simplistic any kind of form that you want to come up with essentially."
"Unknown","00;11;15;24","00;11;50;16","So that often these models are criticized for being too simplistic. Well, I think that's kind of the beauty in the sense that we obviously start with these components, the Lego blocks, so to speak. The individual blocks are pretty simple, but once you start looking them up to each other, you get emergent dynamics that are pretty are already pretty pretty quickly become hard to wrap your mind around."
"Unknown","00;11;50;16","00;12;28;17","So that's why we're presenting them in stepwise fashion. I would say if you're really interested in the math, then you would probably want to go into some of the deferrals, for example, that Ryan Smith, Bruce Newman, I don't like some of everything and today, right now we see works through the actual equations and then the stuff that you really well, you can put any links in the YouTube live chat so that everybody can see it otherwise only will be able to see it."
"Unknown","00;12;29;13","00;12;30;06","Oh yeah."
"Unknown","00;12;32;09","00;13;10;02","Cool. Thanks for all these clarifying points on Figure one and I agree it'd be awesome to have Ryan. Is it been on a few times so yeah. OK. Question related to figure one. Stephen. Yeah, just one question. When you mentioned the predictions and inferences do you tend to think about like the downward predictions across all the components and then the inference is more although it's happening are all components more in terms of like the big block jumps between like what M1 and M2 info in relation to each other."
"Unknown","00;13;10;02","00;13;36;06","So you do tend to think about it more that way. So you look at each pieces as more sort of smaller ideas, predicting down and linking and then the inference is more thought of in these, you know, broader sense of something that you could get your head around as a human. So to speak it depends on which level of description you're currently focusing."
"Unknown","00;13;36;13","00;14;34;06","But in the sense, in a sense the answer is yes, that once you kind of stick another layer on top of it, so to speak, that layer can start to and is basically perceiving in a weird way you could say it's trying to perceive the perceptions and then that allows the system to report on these perceptions so that's like the kind of matter meta level of representation that if the system and its capacity to reflect on its own, on its own, the inferences on the lower level, we have also worked on paper where we apply this to the precision on the likelihood method and the probability of getting to that two months from now."
"Unknown","00;14;34;06","00;15;00;27","But it's anybody's interest. So let me just say, I've found I've gotten access to the likes. Let me just both say hello and then I'll make you a mod so that you can post links. Yeah. Thank you for adding links to Livestream. Anyone else have a question on figure one? Otherwise, it'd be nice to, I think, continue this incremental unrolling of the model and then we'll definitely get to a lot of different topics."
"Unknown","00;15;00;27","00;15;31;07","I think in a broader discussion to and in the light of this. So here's the paper by and large, Smith and then there there's now your moderator. So now nice on the Stephen question on figure one or broader question. Yeah, just building on what was just mentioned a second ago with Fig. one is you know, thanks for that clarification."
"Unknown","00;15;31;07","00;16;03;10","And so like you say this, this, this idea of like a meta level of inference is useful. And I think and this came up in the previous livestream with Ryan Smith. This seems to be something about the update in between. So as well as like going from one chunk to the next chunk, so to speak, and 1 a.m. to and given that as a way to get a handle on an inference, there's like something that can be done with whatever gets message passed up."
"Unknown","00;16;03;18","00;16;36;05","And so from what my understanding that looks like the two ways in to the inferential piece. So great. Yeah. So that's where essentially one of the core innovations that we present in this paper is something we like to call deep parametric active inference where you're making inferences about the parameters of lower level models and then that is guiding your and your expectations."
"Unknown","00;16;37;08","00;16;59;04","We're going to get into that more once we go down that step and see. So I've managed to get the exercise I think. So what is the moderation? Help me. I expected I'm crazy. You could post links, I think people who cannot post links, but we got your also the tutorial paper and the meta awareness paper are in the live chat."
"Unknown","00;16;59;05","00;17;01;28","Thank you. OK, cool."
"Unknown","00;17;04;04","00;17;35;12","Yeah. So I just to illustrate the point, I think it makes sense to go to go further because essentially what I think it was Dean was mentioning or those was days I couldn't see my own site, but anyway, so and what was mentioned is that yeah, you have these Lego blocks and you start building your hierarchy, so to speak."
"Unknown","00;17;36;03","00;18;16;04","And one of the things that was, has already happened by the time I came around was this step presented here where again, the circle here with the pie inside is the variable and the simple act of connecting this variable to the state conditions on the lower level. So basically the variable pie, which then Sapolsky starts to dynamically control your beliefs about how the state, how the states of the world all the time be yes."
"Unknown","00;18;16;04","00;19;07;22","So this is then controlled by the prior and and this is the read a little bit of a funky aspect of well active inference in that formulation because the prior on this on these policies is informed by A the expectations B and the inspectors energy is funky because it recapitulates the entire generative model down below. The expected spring energy includes the expectations of the organism about the world so there is this thing that Karl and Thomas Bar have called the generalized three energy where they reformulate this and unpack what's inside the policy variable."
"Unknown","00;19;08;10","00;19;44;09","And in terms of the whole kind of generative model that mirrors the perception aspect, don't get me to get too deep into that, but essentially unpacking what the the expected energy here that's in the model and it's pretty important because the expected free energy is what introduces the what I call typically or phenotype congruence action will it's also going to be answering one of the questions."
"Unknown","00;19;44;27","00;20;43;04","I watched the previous livestream that you have from this paper and we'll get to that in a second, but we can use it to answer one of the questions that came up about whether the affective charge wave depends only arises when there is a difference between the prior and posterior of action. We'll get the difference. So the expected free energy, you can think of it as recapitulating the entire activity with one big difference, namely that it's biased by phenotypic outcome preferences so it's essentially the phenotypic outcome preferences basically bring into an active inference what the reward function does in reinforcement and it does this because it's essentially biasing the way the agent behaves towards the"
"Unknown","00;20;43;04","00;21;14;19","world and trying to match make it match. It's preferences that are specified here purely in probabilistic terms. So the phenotypic preferences can be something that can be ingrained, that can be learned. It's not really it's pretty agnostic where it comes from, but that's because it has this hierarchical nature. So I have models in which these preferences themselves are state with them."
"Unknown","00;21;14;26","00;22;06;11","So let's say you're hungry when you're hungry. Your preference vector for for food is this upregulated essentially this makes more a stronger driver of your actions when you're tired, then you have a stronger preference against exerting effort. So there's these kinds of this preferences themselves can be made state dependent if you just add another legal block before you start typing inferences about how hungry you are, how tired you are, and you can have an organism that's managing its energy resources then there's this last component that be discussed is the eat here and the matrix."
"Unknown","00;22;06;20","00;22;39;09","You can you can think of it as the kind of habitual provider or what they call immobile in their reinforcement during the call in Mobile three, we it's just counting the number of times this particular action occurred. It's not evaluating it by any and any like by any reward or something like that. It's just I mean, I would I actually don't like the term mobile three because in essence it is still mobile."
"Unknown","00;22;39;09","00;23;13;06","It's just a mobile that has a separate parameter for every possible action. And so this kind of thing, it's kind of like when you took your driver's lessons. And I remember repeating mistakes, not because I like to make this mistake, but just because I made them before and my body and brain kind of stored that information and I ended up repeating those mistakes just because this pathway hasn't been explored before OK, so that's like a little bit of unpacking here."
"Unknown","00;23;13;09","00;23;40;00","And the way you can read this diagram is, again, from left to right so you start with the action model and the expected strategy guiding the a priori expectations. And this is a kind of group of scientists would say it is biased towards not what you believe the world to be accepting, but more towards what you would like the world to be like."
"Unknown","00;23;41;06","00;24;05;09","Or what if you are currently doing well, what you would expect the world to be so it's pretty I mean, it's an intentional but like the biases introduced and that's fine. And then if you look on the other side, we'll get the perceptual evidence it's the free energy. You can think of that as a kind of reality check."
"Unknown","00;24;06;27","00;24;44;21","So I can have lots of expectations about what I want the world to be like and where I want to end up or what I want my shoes to be like when I buy them. I remember this example from lesson and but then I need perceptual evidence to actually see if the shoes actually fit a but let's say and so this perceptual evidence gives very this is a very crucial point of how the whole movie really the kind of perceptual feedback."
"Unknown","00;24;45;17","00;25;09;17","Without that, your agent would be living in a fantasy world. And so we read so we can if there's unless there are any questions, we can move to the next slide. Anyone can raise their hand otherwise. Stephen, question on this figure or a broader question. OK, go for the question. I just want to ask you one question there with your action model."
"Unknown","00;25;11;18","00;25;42;10","Because with expected free energy, you often have the risk, ambiguity and pragmatic gain as three terms on one side. So is it like the pragmatic gain is is built into the action model implicitly? So it's kind of you rearranged it slightly with that in mind so that all action as some sort of pragmatic gain built into the phenotypic or morphology of the animal or something like that yeah."
"Unknown","00;25;42;10","00;26;14;12","So here the first metric part, so this is the kind of the see outcome preferences. So your preferred observation essentially is built into its part of the risk. So if you look at this equation on the left to the right hand side with the left there and working at the big risk you see there, you take the the difference between the logarithm of your expected outcomes minus the preferred outcomes then in terms of units of nets."
"Unknown","00;26;14;14","00;26;43;18","So information for you, right? So what you're essentially the risk here is just quantified in terms of the difference between your preferred outcomes and the expected outcome given the particular direction it makes sense. Cool. And it's also interesting, it's the natural log of oh sub phi. So it's conditioned on a policy. So it's not like some sort of all by all chessboard."
"Unknown","00;26;43;18","00;27;11;15","It's all strategies and all situations. It's very constrained with respect to what actually matters which are in the end the affordances and the niche of the actual agents in the scenario. So it's really cool to see how that gets baked into the model, not like a secondary pruning or a higher ristich. Yeah. So this, this just pulls out of calculating the expected and under a certain policy."
"Unknown","00;27;11;26","00;27;42;20","And so this is conditions and policies, lessons and one interesting aspect here is that if you make the generative model more sophisticated, then this is going to become more sophisticated as well. So you can add if you add learning or parameters of, let's say the likely then the expected and you also expense accordingly and it ends up having a term for active learning."
"Unknown","00;27;42;27","00;28;33;21","So your agents can anticipate basically that exploring the environment can allow to reduce uncertainty about these perceptual mappings. So then you get an agent that's intrinsically curious about it. You can do the same with the B matrices. So the transition matrices so you get some agents like a child who kind of just experiments exploring different states of the world and then starts picking up on different kinds of control and can even at some point and even learn to anticipate that if it's experiments in a certain way, it might be able to learn new things about these methods."
"Unknown","00;28;35;02","00;29;14;20","So this is this is currently not in this particular model because if you remember to do that, you need to add variables to the particular mappings. And the nice thing about this Lego blocks of active inference, let's say that you're completely free to just add and to make anything variable as long as you can, as long as you specify certain probability distributions, you can do the same thing again and again."
"Unknown","00;29;14;22","00;29;40;10","Different from this creating continuous basis. So I think this is a nice segway into oh, here you first introduced in table three. Some of the equations and then see here we have table three up on the screen or do you want figure three? Now I think we can go on to I mean, unless somebody wants to go deeper into this with that, I think you already can discuss this."
"Unknown","00;29;42;00","00;30;00;23","Yep. It was really helpful to see the takeaway laid out. This is again, this actually not the way I delivered the table to the Journal it's just that they have read I mean, crazy. You pay them money, fix it, you know, but then they make it work. So like basically they have like a new what layouts and their web layouts."
"Unknown","00;30;00;27","00;30;23;00","And this is stuff most of the figures. And so when you want to read it, I would really recommend downloading the PDF and not using their website. Yeah. Oh, yes. This is their web layout. It definitely makes sort of a false equivalence or a way of making it look like there's something missing on one side or the other."
"Unknown","00;30;24;16","00;30;45;13","Yeah. And so just read the PDF and it's unfortunate because it's supposed to be their job, but well, here we are on figure three and so we have to figure three. And then we also have that part with the AC, if you want to kind of highlight that because I know that's something we really want to understand. Yes."
"Unknown","00;30;45;13","00;31;37;14","So just we're going to continue are our building or this and different we're adding these different blocks together. And now what we add on top of this is we have this is the recapitulation of the entire X. We add a variable on top of it that modulates the extent to which I rely on this action level. And so the precision is like any barrier value between zero and infinity and and it just tells me when I predict what's going to happen in the world and anticipate what's going to happen and how is how much can I rely on my actual model that's biased by my preferences."
"Unknown","00;31;38;15","00;32;31;11","So this is not the same as I mean, that's kind of where it comes into into story Y and it's this effect, the charge that we're talking about. And so depending on the difference between PI and prior and the posterior so essentially what this precision is striking is striking the match between the predictive value, you can say of G for predict for the actual policies that I end up selecting the actual state conditions of the world and then how well they are predicted by my action and this is my scientist model, right?"
"Unknown","00;32;31;11","00;33;17;09","That's like the next example that's trying to realize our preferences and affective charge is essentially the kind of we call it like that because later on it's getting a special role and when you go to a hierarchical set of we add one more leg of this, but essentially whenever my whenever and so if you unpack this effective charge equation, you see that it's calculating the difference between my prior policy vector that's just based on my preferences, my actual model and and the posterior."
"Unknown","00;33;18;01","00;33;46;16","And that's the one that happens that I have after I integrate perceptual evidence. So and then that difference so that's why it's a little bit hard to measure. But basically the difference between these two is kind of like the rate of change of over time of my beliefs. And then you take those predict of that with the expected and what's what you essentially want to know is."
"Unknown","00;33;47;13","00;34;23;13","And after integrating perceptual evidence, do they get closer to matching the expected strategy distribution anticipated by that or do they get further away? So that's why I call this phenotypic progress. If I get if you expect this and is the best predictor, then this term ends up being negative. If it's a group predictor of being positive, and I mean, there's like a little bit of a play with signs there and we just define it in a way that it's positive."
"Unknown","00;34;23;22","00;34;50;01","The positive value is a good thing. That's like always a little bit confusing because in some different fields they use there's even fields where that energy is defined in the opposite way. So the whole story is that that's why I always have to be careful how you predict how you define it locally in this paper."
"Unknown","00;34;52;29","00;35;25;26","And when you come from a different field, you have to make sure that you've got your signs in, your signs in the room, so to speak. And so if I can say that one major field, there are differences that physicists often go downhill gradient descent optimization. We're going to minimize the loss function. And biologists often talk or think about hill climbing and fitness peaks and optimization maximization and congruence and the best possible world that kind of pain gloss world."
"Unknown","00;35;26;05","00;35;47;20","So totally agreed. And especially when there's a lot of natural logs and negative signs and differences and divergences that can only be positive and things that are strictly negative or bounded. But when it's something where it really needs to be walked through slowly because it's so easy to get tripped up in how these things flip back and forth."
"Unknown","00;35;48;09","00;36;08;22","So yeah, really important notes to kind of just go slow and really make sure that we're using the right tools to establish that we're connecting the right qualitative ideas with these variables because it's not just like you throw up the equation and it's going to be easy to define what each of the variables are for real systems. Yeah."
"Unknown","00;36;09;07","00;36;43;02","And and on that note, we basically yeah, we have interpreted this as in the paper as a type of subjective difference. And that's because literally correcting the degree to which your preference bias action model is fitting with the actual perceptual evidence that you're getting back and that's why the affective charge can only be nonzero if there's some mismatch between your prior and the posterior beliefs."
"Unknown","00;36;43;02","00;37;37;18","Of course, because there's only when there's some mismatch between what you expect that you got and it makes sense to talk about updating your beliefs about perceiving can be in the positive direction or in a negative direction. So might it can be better than expected or worse than expected. That's my way of describing in the abstract that this lends design, these predictions essentially, if you think about just in terms of predictions, this kind of predictions, either wrong or fair, you OK, so then I mean, if you want to know, if you go to this macro level where you're estimating how long am I, so is my prediction getting better or worse?"
"Unknown","00;37;37;25","00;38;09;26","That's that's where time comes into the story and where you can talk about improvements or improving or worsening the state of the world. But speaking, stay true to yourself. And this three applies to any kinds of states by the way. So it can it can be about internal states tracking and as I said, hunger and fatigue. It can also be about the affective states, other specifics."
"Unknown","00;38;09;26","00;38;41;22","So this kind of subjective fitness can be linked to any arbitrary state that interests them. And if you go to the next level, then the state of inference can be an observation or the next level. So that's hierarchical three. And it's I think the power a little bit, the sense is that we have freedom to do what we want to do with our Lego blocks."
"Unknown","00;38;41;23","00;39;11;15","And depending on this system of interests, it's we try to keep it simple while we're still just demonstrating possibility that then the implications get really, really big once you start to release the simplicity constraints, then you just go wild on constructing models, hierarchical models with different you can have expected ranges at different levels. You can have these kind of precision terms at different levels."
"Unknown","00;39;11;15","00;39;40;09","So you can have competing and effective charges you can have the effective charge from your lower level. Let's say you're trying to fight your addiction or something like that. The lower level parts of your system are like kind of create generating this craving in the higher level parts are like trying to generalize and generate this kind of self-actualization or something like that where you're basically having conflicting drives."
"Unknown","00;39;42;02","00;40;08;17","So I mean, that's where where we can go to get there. We need to move to add states on top of this. And and I think that's there. Yeah. If there are questions, then look I'm going to ask a question from the live chat and then anyone else who has spoke yet or asked a question and then we'll ask a question about anything else."
"Unknown","00;40;08;17","00;40;27;10","We've talked about Stephen. So in the chat someone asks, can we relate affective charge with motivation as motivation can also affect policy so where do we how do we think about motivation in this kind of a model? Is it an affective charge? Is it affective charge?"
"Unknown","00;40;31;29","00;41;25;14","Yeah. So motivation in that sense is a very fuzzy concept, right? But if you think about the term you're modulating the extent to which you're relying on your action and, and the see the preference objective kind of modulating the and the extent to which are driven by your preferences. I mean combining them together essentially means that, I mean, there are if you have let's say, a high and you need high confidence, these are actual do we actually allow it to influence your your expectations?"
"Unknown","00;41;26;03","00;42;10;24","So in that sense, there is definitely a link with motivation. Then again, you also need preferences that motivate you to move towards. Right. So what's interesting is if you take away the preferences, then you can have an agent that's motivated entirely by epistemic factors so I suppose to some extent it's kind of interesting because you get the precision starts to modulate curiosity and so that's the different kind of motivation anyway."
"Unknown","00;42;11;02","00;43;09;04","I can say much more because it's such a fuzzy concept, but very true, I think reward motivation, curiosity, motivation. There's expressivity in the model to actually talk about motivation with respect to specific framings of it. Well, and, and the way I recently thought about it is also that if you add a higher level and you connect it to the preference matrix and you can basically modulate the extent to which you're motivated by different kinds of outcomes and that means that you're if you're like monitoring on the higher level, which extends you're currently satisfying but simple and so you're you're hungry so you're up regulates a preference for eating good and then you get your food,"
"Unknown","00;43;09;18","00;43;40;16","you get feedback, intercepts the feedback that you're satiated and then you're open for more for epistemic drives, let's say. So and there's an extended sense in which the various types of motivation have to be balanced by a higher level. This current figure is not able to do that in a way. If I mean, our whole Lego box can definitely do that."
"Unknown","00;43;41;00","00;44;14;13","But the current figure, I think is still doesn't have the naming preferences. I think that's what you need to get more satisfying for motivation in general. Thanks for that awesome response. All right, Stephen. And then anyone else who raises their hand and just one question. You mentioned dot product with expected free energy. And just just if you could just clarify that a little bit, because I think you've got something to do with the precision and the the larger free energy piece."
"Unknown","00;44;14;13","00;44;16;08","So if you could just clarify, that would be helpful."
"Unknown","00;44;19;21","00;44;53;25","Yeah. So this effective search term is not something we came up with, right? It's something that comes out of the mess when you start with this gamma distribution sort of capital on that distribution, this particular mathematical shape and exponential natural exponent based on this word exponent. And when you use that as a permit to distribution. So it has this kind of tail that runs goes towards infinity."
"Unknown","00;44;54;27","00;45;44;15","The express expectation value of this deal is regulated by what's called here the temperature parameter and it's also called the rate parameter and all this context that essentially the temperature parameter kind of regulates how and how strongly this the distribution is shifted towards zero and and essentially what what happens is that this when you use that as the previous distribution, you try to optimize the best this better parameter to best fit what's happening in your you can do this for energy minimization to do that and what you get out of this kind of for free."
"Unknown","00;45;44;26","00;46;20;29","And once you write that down in probabilistic terms, you get this effect of starts there. And what I was talking about is essentially an interpretation of what OK this is what we got out when we took the giant model. Minimize that minimize for additional energy on this this better parameter then we just it just spits out this affective charge to and I was but then it's a matter of interpreting like what does this mean in mathematical sense?"
"Unknown","00;46;21;09","00;47;01;16","And essentially what it's doing is taking it between two vectors. One factor on the left is the difference between the prior inputs there or reaction. And the other factor is and we expect this to be energy for each policy and essentially if the two vectors are pointing in the same direction for an organism, that's bad news, right? Because if my posterior is results in larger express energy, then then that's bad because I'm trying to minimize it."
"Unknown","00;47;01;29","00;47;58;29","And then wait, let me turn the light and dark room salt. What's the salt is arguing and yeah. So the idea is basically that the expected energy, you can think of it as a kind of landscape across the domain of potential actions and what I want to know is that after integrating my perceptual evidence and then it gets close like it did, was that better look like on the left is match the original vector terms of the expected energy and that's why if you look closely it's the prior minus the posterior and that's the negative rate of change and deposit like the actual rate of change would be the posterior minus the prior."
"Unknown","00;48;00;06","00;48;30;24","But we flipped the sign there so so that you get you can interpret the effect charges like being positive when the position goes up, being negative when precision. But that the answer your question set the spectrum. Yeah, I think that's very helpful. This one, one example that came to mind was like you're driving and you're having a maps application tell you it's going to take one hour and then as the estimate gets worse, it's like it's bad."
"Unknown","00;48;31;03","00;48;47;01","If you want to get there, if your preference is to get there on time. Now, if your preference was to get there later, maybe it is more neutral. But then as the update is changing and your relative policy, it could be like, oh, it's going to be eight more minutes because of this crash up, but then this speeded up this way."
"Unknown","00;48;47;14","00;49;07;12","And so we're always in a really specific situation conditioning on policy and the information we're getting. And so we're not doing the whole traffic city flow. This is about like the person getting the info from the screen and then making decisions about, Oh, maybe I should get gas here or not. Not every possible decision they could be making."
"Unknown","00;49;07;19","00;49;43;15","So very, very interesting way to frame this variable and this. But it's the way I don't know how many people here mature with the way this kind of factor of this and then we work that since we can just think of it as the kind of calculating the degree of overlap between the vectors and if they're anti if they are actually in the opposite directions, then this very negative they're pointing in exactly the same direction."
"Unknown","00;49;43;15","00;50;15;05","Then this maximally positive input and that's what are the dimensionality. So you're talking about them as vectors, but are they scalar or is there's just one entry in the vector or are there potentially multiple or how do we think about these one number? Or is it a list of numbers like a long vector and so in this older formulation of the expected strategy, it's like one value for policy essentially."
"Unknown","00;50;15;14","00;50;56;19","So every policy has, which is like an action sequence. And so every policy has a total kind of some of the expected strategy associated with it. So then it's a vector in the sense that every policy has its own element in the vector. But more recently we've actually extended this in there. So it's the kind of sophisticated inference paper because I mean, anybody who's worked with policy spaces knows about this problem computer."
"Unknown","00;50;56;20","00;51;42;24","You'll explosion that once you start considering or selection in time, then every to every point in time you expand it further. And the more and the more untenable and intractable the problem becomes in the more recent iteration, we we actually divide it further in terms of the actions, components and instead of having one single policy vector that has to regulate all the machinery we have every time step has its own action variable."
"Unknown","00;51;43;12","00;52;14;12","And your inference, the inference on that on every time step this makes the problem prevents you from having to integrate everything right away. The end result of that is again, integration. But because you're example last for parallel computing, let's be funny, but that's that's a different basis. I can actually also I think we actually read it, but you know, it all blurs together."
"Unknown","00;52;14;17","00;52;41;04","But we did read Sophisticated Inference I think at one point. All Yeah, yeah. Nice. Yeah. You treat lots of papers as you have them. We're going to catch up. We got to catch up. You're leaving them as fast as we can get to them. I mean, I made more recently in a paper called Sophistic Games Affective Difference where so you have another thing to better."
"Unknown","00;52;42;01","00;53;29;01","But essentially combining this effective inference theory that we're talking about today, combining it with this Article three search and and which allows you to simulate agents that response has an effective response to imagined futures would be cool to maybe at some point to come back to discuss that connection or if cool. So Dean with a question and then anyone else who raises their hands Casper, would you go from A to D M one M to two or three D action?"
"Unknown","00;53;30;09","00;54;08;27","Is that anyway, have you thought a little bit about the sort of the less about the integration, more about the deflation and inflation that happens when you go from fewer dimensions to two to more um, yeah. So that's one of the motivations for going to new types of generative model because I mean, this policy variable here can explode pretty quickly once you get to multiple steps in the future."
"Unknown","00;54;09;05","00;54;50;03","And they need somehow to reduce the dimensionality of the stage space that you're considering. And then what's kind of what's kind of one thought that kind of suits me when I build these types of models is that even though, as we say, all models are wrong, but somewhere useful. Right? But even though that's the case, we know that the organisms that we're trying to model exactly the same problem with namely they're trying to make something that's generally inflexible, flexible, so simple applications when we're trying to build a model of their model of the world."
"Unknown","00;54;50;18","00;55;30;03","And you can actually justify the implications in the sense that they are trying to deal with, they have to do oversimplifications as well to be able to make sense, any sense at all. And I mean, I don't know if this exactly answers your question, but this is what came up in response and this you're had an interesting point about the dimensionality increasing and one thing that happens is that you basically have to simulate potential features internally."
"Unknown","00;55;30;16","00;56;03;23","Once you start conditioning the space in your actions, that means every possible action has an all parallel kind of process of inference that's happening to predict what's going to happen in the future in every dimension you add on top of the and potentially make the whole thing intractable. So we're always kind of facing that challenge. And the dean."
"Unknown","00;56;03;23","00;56;31;23","And that's a quick follow up. So, so sometimes you hear the expression, oh, well, that problem is going to require some outside the box thinking. And of course, that's so ambiguous, nobody really knows what that means. But what you've done here, I think, is given people an opportunity to get out of the spatial envelope, get out of the I'm an agent and develop by the world around me."
"Unknown","00;56;31;23","00;56;53;00","And you've given them a bit of an eyes of this perspective. They can actually get outside and see how as an agent they're perceiving the world, how they can then potentially act on the world. That, as you said, they're constantly updating. A lot of this stuff isn't front of mind as they're doing it."
"Unknown","00;56;55;06","00;57;18;07","But I think that's one of the big things about going from 2D to 3D. You're not just zooming in and zooming out. You're, you're you're not just now you're able to look down on something. But if you hit the button on the Google map and you suddenly see a 3D, it doesn't it doesn't stay at one position it actually circles around the thing that you're looking at."
"Unknown","00;57;18;07","00;57;26;29","And I think that's what this provides people is that sense of not just being inside of something, but actually being able to step outside of it as well."
"Unknown","00;57;30;05","00;58;03;12","I mean, that's something that's actually does happen in this type of model is when you have this by the same three you end up expanding the whole thing. And it's is like you said, like stepping from two to three D in a sense because you're you're you're expanding the whole number of possibilities with being mobile and in the same way."
"Unknown","00;58;03;12","00;58;27;17","It's kind of hard to wrap their minds around it. And I think that's part of what makes me figure it's hard to reach for people, especially when you present to the top level great graduate it's like asking somebody to step from one from one dimensional to three dimensional, right in one go. You kind of have to go through the the increases in dimensionality step by step."
"Unknown","00;58;28;16","00;58;54;27","So this is also part of what motivates this whole incremental presentation, which is awesome question. Thank you, Dean. So blue so we read this sophisticated aspect of inference like a long time ago. And I always think about it, and I think that I brought it up in the Dodd's zero livestream, actually, but I thought it was the big five paper."
"Unknown","00;58;54;27","00;59;14;26","I think we read them like right at the same time, and they're very different. But this sophisticated actor aspect of inference was really like prevalent with anxiety, like the future time steps. The further out you go in the future, like, the more like you can't predict what's going to happen. And so that's like the underlying basis for anxiety."
"Unknown","00;59;14;26","00;59;38;22","And I thought about this and I also thought about the question about motivation. And it made me think of Tony Robbins has this like theory that there is like six driving factors that like influence people or motivate people through life and like, you know, depending on personality type or whatever. And they're like certainty is one of them. Uncertainty is also one of them."
"Unknown","00;59;38;22","01;00;01;04","Like people who like variety or then there's like growth and altruism and I can't remember like all of them what they all are. But it's interesting to think about like the motivation, what underlies like what's an underlying motivation for people and how that relates into this type of model as well as like those driving forces through life, like how you might start to model those things."
"Unknown","01;00;01;04","01;00;18;09","Like, you know, someone who's driven by uncertainty versus someone who's driven by certainty, like the uncertainty driven people might place more of like an epistemic value there than an actual than an actual action reward value. So it's just interesting to think about that."
"Unknown","01;00;20;13","01;00;52;05","Yeah. I mean, there is like a paper in the works that got stalled, unfortunately. But I think where we're trying to do something like that, where you're talking about the way the Big Five have kind of emerged as apparently pretty strong factorization people's behavior or people's behavioral tendencies over long periods of time. So their personality form and why they tend to drives like that."
"Unknown","01;00;52;09","01;01;28;09","And and to what extent you can capture them with something that looks like this with at least one more layer, I would say to some extent, yes, you can kind of step through this. Then this this was exploration, the kind of exploration drive we need versus so risk aversion and risk let's be risk seeking behaviors. We need they went from that cool blue."
"Unknown","01;01;28;09","01;01;52;18","That was really interesting. And it reminded me about how people prefer, let's just say to read different amounts and to read different topics. So for some people, historical fiction versus fiction, science fiction, all these different genres and subgenres, it's related to maybe what their regime of attention will latch onto. And that's something that's different as you age and it's in cultured and it's embedded as well."
"Unknown","01;01;52;18","01;02;24;26","So it's kind of an interesting example that we could go into. And then we did a lot of fact check active 11 way back when in 2020 we did do sophisticated affective inference simulating anticipatory responses paper and that was way more anxiety driven. No it wasn't just because it was really funny. And then also the first one of this year with Adam Safran and Colin DeYoung was the big five cybernetic big five kind of free energy inspired or based as well."
"Unknown","01;02;25;03","01;02;49;06","So yeah, it's just it's good. You know, you did say we're kind of going through them fast, but there's so many to read and just to even get a little bit of a grasp on it, it's to read 25 in a year or one every two weeks. It's kind of a pace that we have to hold up to, but I'm sure you read more than one every two weeks."
"Unknown","01;02;49;06","01;03;15;00","So yeah, I guess I didn't read it somewhere and I was like, Where are you? And I wasn't sure. I didn't remember what it was like. Sophisticated inference or sophisticated affected but so one, it was just the conference proceedings though, so it was very short lived to minimal, I think there really was more like a technical no. Yeah."
"Unknown","01;03;15;26","01;03;48;11","It would be hard to really get it just based on if you're not Yeah. So familiar with the modeling and the actual like nitty gritty, you know, like it's like Innocence Conference proceedings are just a way to communicate to some people are just in exactly on this technical or it's domain not the best for communication to broader scientific audiences yet."
"Unknown","01;03;49;03","01;04;18;16","Well kind of on that point and anyone can raise their hand, I move the slide to the additional information where there's the code and maybe just what would you say about the code? What are the inputs or the outputs? What would somebody need to run this code or like what could they do with it? And it's really cool that you did provide all this information, but to kind of bridge that gap that you just mentioned, what does this function do or what do these different scripts do?"
"Unknown","01;04;22;02","01;04;42;09","Yeah. So essentially you first need SBM Flow and is that correct? Contains the core functionality for. Yeah, that it's based on. And then these scripts are like additional or like adaptations of scripts in well."
"Unknown","01;04;44;24","01;05;26;00","And the only thing you need to do is run and spin. And if you keep the X, you know, X, and so that stands for Emotions Spectrums, which is something I worked on. Some point and in the, in the rest of the so let me see. And so that's of course not enough to for you to and then you just get the model that we already have."
"Unknown","01;05;27;04","01;06;01;03","We run mouse generate figure. Yeah. The one that's on this slide before. So this. Yeah. This one. Yeah. And the one above it. The so let me just it's enough. I know it's so long that I to most of the this is cool, but we're in the process of what I would recommend actually in the future. I mean, I don't, to be honest, I don't like not, not at all."
"Unknown","01;06;02;19","01;06;41;21","The only reason I worked with it was that the existing ISP and actually inference modeling was part of the existing spam package, but there's lots of, yeah, important work that's been done by elections and the rights to others to transform everything to Python and to do conversational optimization already. So there is this GitHub page of interactively. Yep. Here we are on it."
"Unknown","01;06;42;26","01;07;29;24","Hi, MDP interactively is the GitHub repo. Yes. So, um, instead of trying to get and trying to get my blog running on your PC, I would recommend just working with it. And then in the future and we'll have a module in there that can do the same of what we did in this paper. Awesome. So that's something I think that it's much more sustainable for the future and we're working on integration with GPUs, et cetera, to make things that can be similar and scalable and scalable way and integrate with TensorFlow."
"Unknown","01;07;29;24","01;08;01;28","So you can even do hybrid modeling with what they call a more active inference of like deep learning models that are connected to components of these Lego Lego boxes and those describing but if you want, I can I mean, I can run you through this and MVP be in modeling. It's just that I'm not myself that will be I think it will be a little bit of fun."
"Unknown","01;08;01;28","01;08;35;11","Yeah, I think yep. Let's definitely have a model stream for the python because I know that will be something a lot of people are interested in. Because the MATLAB, it has a certain charm to it, but I can see how you might want to develop with other approaches, even though when Christopher and Ryan walked us in the model stream through the code, just seeing how the matrices multiply, there's something nice about how it was done in MATLAB but it's not interfacing with all these modern tools like TensorFlow that you mentioned."
"Unknown","01;08;35;11","01;09;14;28","So yeah, cool. Anyway, but and then you see so I think we can, we can move on. But I think what I should do basically based on your feedback is a little bit of an explanation of what to do with those codes. If you want to run that, let's say you do want to use mobile. If you want to run what you should do and this actually useful feedback is the reason I added these codes."
"Unknown","01;09;14;28","01;09;44;25","This mostly for reproducibility. So in case other technical folks want to look at what I did, but only it's not really out of the box in the way that anybody not familiar with it easily use it and yet my advisor should always say, make it so that the anthropologists from Mars will know what to do with that spreadsheet."
"Unknown","01;09;45;06","01;10;12;25","Because even for people in the field or even yourself months later, it's like, Wait, that was my research then yes, certainly. I mean, the prepare for practice, it's like how to like me based on the input. I mean, this is, you know, this evening. Yeah. I guess in my mind just kind of transitioning away from kind of filmmaking yeah."
"Unknown","01;10;13;16","01;10;47;19","But I do bring the sweet round of that part of the documentation too long. Yeah, yeah. Blue or Stephen, either of you raise your hand you just just one point about the effective charge piece that you mentioned before. Can I just check is, is that like an in between level between one inference layer and the next? Is it so is that correct?"
"Unknown","01;10;48;09","01;11;30;21","That's entirely correct. Once we go to bigger and I think it is six you see it's six, seven, seven, three. Yep. So essentially now we connect what's happening in higher level connected to inferences about and our sort of predictions about what's happening on the lower level. And that's when I mean the effective charge basically becomes like an ascending message that informs the inferences."
"Unknown","01;11;31;14","01;12;06;09","And so there is equation in the manuscript. I don't see even this. That was a separate table. This part we got figures this, this, these are the prior. So this is like this in describing the first theory or beliefs, the effects of charge basically factors that comes into the eye. And then there's figures in the paper we didn't include that."
"Unknown","01;12;06;17","01;12;51;25","But if you go to we mean it's in multiple places essentially what we call affective evidence which files based on the 20 but the actual pages 23 no pdf. OK just for here we go yes and zero question I mean yeah that's so just to illustrate what's happening or to explain and in this paper we use bars to elicit to indicate posterior beliefs."
"Unknown","01;12;52;18","01;13;38;13","So here the bar is on the left, the bar is like posterior beliefs at the time capital T so this is the cross trial times. That's a large and large cross trial time essentially subscript the superscript there is indicating the affect effect. It's there. So what's the area state the posterior affective state on the higher level is soft expansion of the consists of the prior belief, which is the logarithm of the previous books area from the previous time step multiplied by the transition matrix."
"Unknown","01;13;39;14","01;13;41;05","So that's where the prior comes from."
"Unknown","01;13;43;09","01;14;44;09","And then this term that you see accidents comes from what we call Bayesian model reduction and it's what you need. What happens when you want to connect discrete and continuous states basements and then it drops again. This term drops out of the derivations that you can do based on this formalism, Bayesian model reduction, and in this case this sort of energy minimization, assuming that the changes are small enough locally or small enough to make this connection and then if you ask what small enough, well, that's something you would have to test in in world and see if this approximation holds essentially what you see here is the effective charge coming back to haunt you, so"
"Unknown","01;14;44;09","01;15;35;19","to speak. But now, as the message that this stuff works and so the higher level state is consists of two and kind of extremes. So the the extreme positive side so beta plus and the extreme negative side beat the minus. And at any point in time, the organism is somewhere in between as never extreme not it's never like at the exact extremes it's beliefs just like you can never have 100% certainty about anything because down downwards in the hierarchy we make predictions that's where we do Bayesian model averaging and upwards you have together these messages."
"Unknown","01;15;35;19","01;16;14;29","So that's political the goal and the star use Bayesian model reduction yeah. So that's essentially a very long answer to your question. But yeah, no thanks. Actually not just just one of the thing with that is this then gives a way for somatic kind of process is, you know, in everyday or even in trauma to be integrated in a way because it could be that non cognitive processes could be at play in just this affective charge or keeping a score of that."
"Unknown","01;16;16;19","01;16;48;07","And then that could then be that could give a way for that to influence perception or action model selection. This and this high level state is not constrained in any way in terms of what you, you you can add other types of evidence from other action models and other components of your system can as their own effective start so that's at some point in the beginning we mentioned this affective workspace theory."
"Unknown","01;16;49;13","01;17;29;23","So like and we call it effective start because it's essentially a pre domain general can be gathered from any kind of action model. It can also be used to model the way when you're listening to music your attentional action model is kind of being played around with and with congruence. And this congruence you can kind of and creates mismatches and matches and then you can create them and see and this, this fluency and this will create some kind of affective rollercoaster so to speak."
"Unknown","01;17;29;27","01;18;05;10","So the ups and downs can be gathered from an action model that would be guiding your attention. States So the question of what to attend to when you're listening to a piece of music and could be something that generates affective perspective charts and then informs your, your cadence that can also be purely associative. So it doesn't exclude generally associated types of feelings."
"Unknown","01;18;05;29","01;19;02;07","So there can be certain things that comes back in the contextual evidence. If you go a little bit down on I think it's up here. Oh yeah. OK, so you can also gather evidence in this case, we just talked about contextual states in terms of what are the foods on the left or the right, but you can also have contextual evidence being passed back up and that can generate some kind of plot locked in learning where you just learn to associate particular contexts with particular positive states or negative states so there's also space in it's kind of what I think are computationally a little bit less interesting types valence, valence experience."
"Unknown","01;19;02;29","01;19;38;23","They're just kind of happy and learning sense, but that doesn't make them less important for more experience. So these purely associative relationships also come actually we discuss that in the there are some descriptions that some see how far we get to you. Nice. So I wanted to ask actually about Figure Ten. What were you showing in Figure Ten or how could we read this?"
"Unknown","01;19;40;00","01;19;47;05","Mm hmm. And does it apply to your model only or future models, other categories of models?"
"Unknown","01;19;49;22","01;20;35;14","And everything that's happening here from the orange orange level downwards, let's say, is this what we implemented that everything that's in the grid, it's basically something we presuppose. So we presuppose, for example, that this read already learns how to how the maze works. Hmm. We presuppose that they have some perceptual capacity or it's in some actions control over, let's say, where their body is, you know, like and so all the things that we produce needed to presuppose in order to actually do simulation demonstration or."
"Unknown","01;20;36;17","01;21;09;11","Yeah. Or kind of the great part of this box. And, but the nice thing is that once so what if you follow the arrows this great part? So application development and learning, it's also important in terms of time scales it's known and the nice thing is that it's always a circular story. So you get all of these different nested time scales."
"Unknown","01;21;09;14","01;21;36;29","They're all influencing each other recursively. And once you get down to our actual computational experiments, you you are at the point in time where you enter basically on the left this gray arrow that points into the affected box it's kind of yeah, you can think of that as the one that's in this close of the simulation, so to speak."
"Unknown","01;21;37;10","01;22;21;28","So this gray arrow is in this close. Everything that allowed us to even simulate it and then we explore the dynamics of what happens within that. And all the other arrows are basically illustrating that. So the orange arrows provide price precision for the action model for it and the perceptual state. So that's all the orange arrows and then from the matter minimal metacognitive cognition level, again there is this arrow pointing down to form action jointly the effects and the informing perception."
"Unknown","01;22;23;21","01;22;49;09","And then it kind of passes through in the way that you described also less than the less session. And that's where it kind of connects to the worlds of and then it passes back up again. And that's where this kind of perceptual integration happens and circles upwards into all of these layers we could have simulated learning as well."
"Unknown","01;22;49;16","01;23;24;13","So that's where this orange arrow puts the points back up on the right through the posterior phenotype. We didn't simulate learning because there wasn't the focus of the paper and but we have we have the machinery. It's in our legal books. That's and that's actually, I think, what will make this story much even more interesting because then you can think about active learning and how that influences affective states."
"Unknown","01;23;24;21","01;24;10;08","So how people can enjoy learning just for the sake of learning and how they can learn to associate affected states and contextual states. We and how that recursively influences their their system. There's one simulation that I've been preparing where we have a setup like this and we actually simulated that and the development and learning as well. And the idea there that you have a child, you can simulate a child, and it has this hyper parameters that influence different parts of this lower level model."
"Unknown","01;24;11;09","01;24;51;09","But in the beginning, these high parameters are very unstable. And then there is a kind of parent simulated parents with labels. The states like like basically kind of reflecting and giving the system labels to work with them. And in the end, what's the idea of the labels and the stabilize thing, the influences on this kind of to simulate the idea that as we know, that social interaction is crucial to develop any kind of emotional control, emotional self control."
"Unknown","01;24;51;16","01;25;33;26","And so there's this famous story about children growing up with involved something like that and then never really reached a level that they can exert this type of self, self control and reflexive that's communicative. That's the stuff we have anyway. So that's another tangent very, very interesting. Yes, very interesting. Stephen. And then anyone else with a question and in this diagram you mentioned, so you mentioned minimal metacognition and then you've got aspects and contexts."
"Unknown","01;25;34;12","01;26;05;16","So would that minimal metacognition be the sort of phenomenological consciousness, the kind of the awareness that you can't necessarily take a perspective on? And it goes up into aspects and contexts, and that's where it's consolidated enough to be able to still take a perspective on it. Would that be correct? Or and that's how I do tend to view it to some extent."
"Unknown","01;26;05;16","01;26;39;07","I mean, and the actual representation of these decisions and often and assumed or publicized to be to occur in in a localized fashion in the brain to some extent, these three and I mean, that's, that's just an hypothesis that can be tested and it's actually an interesting thought and that other systems, other biological systems can have entirely different kinds of representations for this kind of proceeding."
"Unknown","01;26;40;16","01;27;09;21","And so Daniel works with and they might have their own way of encoding this type of reliance on X and molds and that maybe has to do with weather conditions or something like that. There can be some kind of shared very minimal way of encoding that reliance that doesn't oh, this doesn't necessarily it's not this is pretty agnostic on how it's presented."
"Unknown","01;27;10;17","01;27;44;16","And you can just test hypotheses how it works in real and also it's really interesting how we can draw out that link to qualitative concepts or to phenomenological experience, but that's not part of this model. This is a claim about a modeling architecture that lends itself to certain kinds of calculations that maybe previously would have followed within the domain of information theory or just control theory or cybernetics or just Bayesian inference or just multi scale systems modeling."
"Unknown","01;27;44;29","01;28;08;14","And I know those are some of the areas that you've drawn on in your work, Kasper, which is why you could kind of see that there was kind of like one, two, three, but not four or five, 64 where the active inference model was going. Because you even discussed how before some of your recent papers, the active inference model had less temporal depth and less metacognitive depth."
"Unknown","01;28;09;06","01;28;43;21","So it's just really cool to hear about how it kind of re maps where the questions and the modeling approaches fit in with respect to maybe previous disciplinary approaches. So Dean and then anyone else with a question Oh, your meta dean yep. So because you've got that the time flow from left to right and that's pretty much consistent and you've got that parabolic introduced from top down and then back up."
"Unknown","01;28;44;21","01;29;16;03","Can you see, Casper, that the idea that around perception, around action, around minimal metacognition and around effect in context, there could be a counterclockwise spin because I actually saw that in the way that people were working, not even aware of this model, but that that's kind of the direction where you've got the flow across the bottom and then the introduction of the parabola from top down and then back up."
"Unknown","01;29;16;15","01;29;52;13","And that's where you could actually get people looking through both directions. That's why you had the effect of Valence. That's part of where the charge came from. Or am I sort of confusing the matters? Because when I looked at that figure, I actually saw how people in that flow state were able, what direction the spin was actually going around the middle, the middle of your middle of your of your figure yeah."
"Unknown","01;29;52;23","01;30;32;18","I mean, this figure is smaller. Yeah. It's not it moves away from the very precise mathematical meaning of the other graphs, right. That there is a critical grasp, but it's a little bit of the same ideas there, like you said, in the sense it doesn't really matter. We're moving on. And the reason that I put the, of course, arrows on the right is that in the temporal sense, it's, it's, it's representing the posteriors that's working from the prior to the posterior."
"Unknown","01;30;33;17","01;31;12;15","But then if you would and because it's nested every next level means that you already cycles from basically yesterday's posterior is tomorrow's prior or like yesterday or series two days prior in some way. Right? So the capacity to integrate the next iteration and can also be itself a problem. So you see that a lot with people with traumas that actually integrate and experience too strongly in the way they work."
"Unknown","01;31;12;22","01;31;45;02","And this actually comes to the very interesting questions where it's like functional forgetting something like the lot of maybe a lot of these meditative practices actually are able to do. It's like help us forget the relevant, the irrelevant bits or the things that we shouldn't take to the next iteration. I the that's sort of the the counterclockwise spin is just essentially making expressing reflection."
"Unknown","01;31;45;11","01;32;06;08","And so sometimes you choose to reflect on something, sometimes you over reflect on it, which is what you're describing. But all I'm saying is, is that when I saw this, it was it was just more confirmation version of. Yeah, I think it's I think it's correct. That's just one. I mean, it's a nice idea in how it's done."
"Unknown","01;32;07;00","01;32;37;28","In the reflection boards and kind of becoming aware of the things that you want to do. So how you want to learn basically. I mean, it's something that we we did try to capture in the and it's gets very interesting. You start to be able to simulate processes like meditation and what's happening in the mind when you develop control and these attentional processes on the higher level."
"Unknown","01;32;38;09","01;33;05;25","And anyway, but I think Steven wants to say, yep, yep, Stephen, go for it. Yeah. Just following on from that and this this was interesting is how this brings in this idea of affective representation and how we think of representation normally as something as a thing in the head as opposed to maybe objects in the niche which we act on or create or interact with."
"Unknown","01;33;06;05","01;33;42;07","And now you've got an idea in s t of S2. I suppose this kind of what could be stored in an accessible form where the prior phenotype may not be entirely accessible except through science, you know, is this affective representation. I just wondered how you see because we've had quite a lot of conversations about this is what you see representation being in all of this or the possibility for active inference and representation yeah."
"Unknown","01;33;42;07","01;34;20;10","So what I like about this approach is that we basically don't have to pin down exactly what the effective state means as long as we're just figuring, trying to figure out what, how it can be perfect for an organism and the organism can use very limited use. The vertex, and then you have like a whole kind of organic state of the system that will correlate with that influence."
"Unknown","01;34;20;10","01;35;16;16","To some extent. You just as the organism is doing is doing that internally, and usually we think about this in terms of animals, but it's interesting to think about more abstract types of representation. And three, just in terms of statistical concept, the I work with models where you add a layer on top of this affective contextual layer. So like here, just in terms of an to link it back to verbal expressions and if you ask me what does the representation mean in this case, it just has a very specific connotation or affects on how we think of it as a generative model, generative models."
"Unknown","01;35;17;20","01;36;03;18","So each affective state will be correspond with a certain modes of cognition and action and all the way down to the lowest level. The model doesn't have to integrate or specify all of those details as long as you know how, let's say the connections on each level often happen the rest becomes like an emergent whole. And I think I've tried to be sensitive of the way in which the internal representations can be are not necessarily the same as the actual affective state."
"Unknown","01;36;04;04","01;36;36;07","If you look at all the different layers combined, and that's when you think about that, but then you start to get into really interesting domains like this this connectedness between your beliefs about your affective state and the way your system is behaving and the different kinds of affective disorders you can start thinking about basically hallucinations or like self reinforced anxiety."
"Unknown","01;36;36;18","01;37;20;27","That's one of those papers I guess I don't really have a very complete answer because these representations are are meant to be abstract until you start to model that in specific contexts and I think, Oh yeah, you want to. And yeah, now I think that that that makes a lot of sense. And also, if all represents if what I see has being a representation or models that we people think is in people's heads are actually always something in the niche that we work with, so to speak."
"Unknown","01;37;20;27","01;37;53;25","So what we know is the action model for how to act and perceive, to recapitulate it it just feels like we have that also in the brain. But if it's actually to some extent this would be the most concrete model is the emotional imprint that helps then undertake the interaction with the models that we work with. But those models don't need to be in the brain in that representational form, but you might need some affective code."
"Unknown","01;37;54;24","01;38;20;15","Is it possible to know how to and that ties in a lot with some of the work with micro phenomenology and some of the work with working with mental space psychology. So it's quite interesting and so thanks for this point. Yeah, I mean, what motivated me actually to move in this direction is something that's not really included to figure that much here that's super important is the social dimension."
"Unknown","01;38;21;02","01;39;20;22","And, and then once you think of this affective state like kind of internal representations that are inferred from any number of cues, any number of arbitrary number of sources of data, you can also think of the facial expressions of Michael specific as being important to my effect. So you start having a very natural way of modeling things like contagion and and just in general, this kind of empathic responses where if you're also kind of tracking the group up and that has places prior on your in your individual experience, you basically have a very natural way of moving from the connecting of the body and interaction with the world."
"Unknown","01;39;20;22","01;40;06;15","In the new system to this abstract social relations, that repression all the time learning quickly. So I'm involved in a project right now that's foraging, primate foraging, and it's really interesting to think about the group dynamic versus like seeking out your own epistemic knowledge, right? So this is just foraging and it's, you know, agent based modeling project. But I wonder to what extent like instead of knowing which trees have fruit, for example, like if I could just follow a group member like so do you know, I mean, just what you had said about the social dynamic, is this kind of interchangeable like just following the group?"
"Unknown","01;40;06;23","01;41;01;11","I mean, we're modeling contagion and so forth. So following the group, is that like interchangeable for epistemic knowledge? Really so there's there's different things you can do. I mean, 11 of the ways you suspected of in there, it's like where something that has been worked out in the media and goes beyond the cues, basically cues that other specifics give you the kind of indicate in what context why and then your action model specifying for this particular context what is the appropriate action and so a very simple thing can be like in whether you are in a context where you are following another specific animal can be something that I think bees have there kind of"
"Unknown","01;41;01;11","01;41;23;11","dance that they do to indicate whether other bees should be following. So there's like a kind of way in which these levels can talk to each other signaling basically the appropriate what the context is. And then from that inference about the context, you can have the whole action model rolling out on the lower level."
"Unknown","01;41;26;13","01;41;52;00","And I think the following day for that you describe does have a pretty direct analogy to our innate tendency to synchronize affective states with our specific even with not not even with other animals. That's actually pretty interesting."
"Unknown","01;41;54;19","01;42;31;28","So you think that we're the other animals also seem to be able to do pick up on the nervousness across species? I've seen the stress markers of stress. We seem to be able to kind of pick up on those we kind of cross those species. One generalization then cool. It's like endless number of repetitions we can go down here's here's one more little rabbit hole looking at this figure."
"Unknown","01;42;31;28","01;43;03;08","And it reminded me of concurrent programing languages like Go Golang and the idea of having nested processes that were defined by interfaces. So we've been talking a lot on the interfaces, as Mark called, blankets or holograms with Chris Fields, but interfaces are also programing patterns that make nested processes that can be effective or tractable or run on distributed computation without halting or spiraling out."
"Unknown","01;43;03;22","01;43;29;02","So in addition to the Python, potentially there could be something like a concurrent implementation. And then it relates to this question about representation, like is the representation a static object? Is it a dynamic process? And I don't know what the formal answer is, but it reminds me of what we did talk about with Chris Fields, where the types as processes and the two spaces."
"Unknown","01;43;29;14","01;44;07;04","So maybe by defining these interfaces with the right dimensionality or bandwidth or structure, however the screens are defined, then there will potentially be model ability, not philosophical clarity on whether always the group is the party conscious or the person or the part of the brain. It's like the ant question. Those are going to be potentially perennial debates, but the model ability of the ant colony evacuation is going to be more akin to the model ability of these other higher level processes because of how abstractly but also accessibly defined the interfaces are."
"Unknown","01;44;08;20","01;44;42;02","I think in a similar way, the way I see these representations, I'm kind of fine with just thinking of them entirely as implicit and just descriptions and something that's implicitly and occurs in system, basically like a kind of tool essentially and if you make it explicit, it ends up being amenable to modeling doesn't mean that there's ever this kind of explicit representation in the system."
"Unknown","01;44;42;19","01;45;15;26","Actually, all we're doing is making these things explicit so we can actually compute things. And I'm pretty happy with being agnostic about whether there is anything and I pretty and I have no dog in this by the representational ism. There's some activism. I think they're both pretty. I mean, they both have points. And I'm pretty happy with the models being agnostic on this question."
"Unknown","01;45;15;27","01;45;44;07","It's models that speak for themselves. I mean, the cool it's almost like you're putting up your code and your model as in evidence. And if they want to prosecute the case, if they want to have their debate and debate whether your evidence is supporting their notion or this notion or some future notion, it's a second level question. And the first level is actually what you're just laying out here and how the variables are linked to each other."
"Unknown","01;45;44;18","01;46;14;12","And then there's alternate architectures that are possible yeah. Every every model is in the sense, just a very elaborate hypothesis and you can just test it. I mean, like doing empirical work yet and then every architecture has yeah. Has An and B compare to each other. Once you have and to do that and you need to go explicit."
"Unknown","01;46;14;29","01;47;27;13","And that's the only path I think where you can you know, we're doing being reductive to make it together with computational grips on the scientific. You could say we actually I have been working on getting more observational strands in these types of movies, but there is such an amazing richness of things to explore by just even just capturing the phenomenology of our that we already have accessible for any first person who we that's often you can already get very far by just making sure that whatever your model is going to be, it has to be able to recapitulate, ah, our lived experience that we have directly accessible and it's actually one of the more recent"
"Unknown","01;47;27;13","01;47;57;28","paper that I could share is from generative models to generative strategies of you are familiar with this kind of work, by long you mean let's see if I can ask one question on this. I figure, Kasper So you mentioned that models are hypotheses which might be really interesting to people because they might think about the model as generating hypotheses, which it also can do."
"Unknown","01;47;58;04","01;48;22;08","But actually you're talking about how the architecture and the way that the variables are connected is itself, not some authoritative claim or final description of the system, but it's a hypothesis. So it makes me wonder if somebody says, well, I think that there's, you know, a letter, you know, insert your favorite letter here and I want to hook it up to E, I want E to be influenced by a new letter or something like that."
"Unknown","01;48;23;11","01;48;45;04","Is that going to keep this nice mathematical tract ability? Are there certain kinds of wires that if you cross them, just the script is going to die? Is there certain pieces where we know that we can build the Legos really well, or there's just how do we know which pieces can be tinkered with and what structural changes could even be done?"
"Unknown","01;48;45;04","01;49;27;13","Or is it like all all by all um, well, one of the constraints is this basically the way it works is that you can have only local interactions. You mean and that's the Marco Blanket we so in the end, the way it's kind of kept at least close to biological possibility is by assuring that a certain thing that you only specify local interactions would be variables."
"Unknown","01;49;28;28","01;50;31;20","And that's what these errors and so one kind of forbidden thing to do would be to connect this policy variable directly to the observations because then you're breaking the mark as the policies are directing in this case the relations between different states and then you can states generate them or like based on the hidden states who generating observations, predictions about them and so there are certain kind of forbidden things in these direct basic graphs, meaning that being said, it's pretty universally I mean, at the said, whenever there's an error actually implies bi directional interaction and you're completely free to at a higher level states that modulates or e matrix so the the sky's the limit"
"Unknown","01;50;31;20","01;51;03;11","so to speak. I mean in the end you should be able as long as you keep this Markov data structure intact and unique. So you ensure that it's biologically possible and what you're doing and then you can go, yeah, you can make any number of states connect to each other. And if there's like redundancy in your model, this would show up because energy and decompose this accuracy minus sort of complexity minus accuracy."
"Unknown","01;51;04;04","01;51;43;28","So any increase any increase in the number of states in your model will result in an increasing increase in uncertainty about the parameters and and that's the complexity. So like OK, arms raisers built in to the way these models work and so in. So yes, you're free to do almost anything here. But if you look at the model evidence in the answer, it will punish you if you made your model unnecessarily complex thanks for this awesome response."
"Unknown","01;51;44;05","01;52;32;26","We'll have a question from Dave and then any closing thoughts and then that will be it for 19.1. So Dave, go for it. Yeah, two points about the point of local interactions only they're kind of at odds with one another. First is that actually the definition of locality, whatever interacts immediately is by definition local. Second, in one of the computer simulations that was put together at the first lab several years ago, the dots on the screen where he's trying to get up north spike, I assume a simple model of how market Markov Blanket's work."
"Unknown","01;52;33;27","01;53;09;10","He found that the distant portions of the simulation were more accurately modeled than the nearby ones. And in my mathematical in literacy, I cry out, oh, so it's all working holographic graphically the intermediate entities are focusing the more distant ones yeah. So this is very interesting that you picked up on this because and this is why we kind of start with this Markov Blanket Theorem."
"Unknown","01;53;10;02","01;54;14;02","But then when you start and when you kind of go into the way economics word actually gets more interesting once you're able to predict things that are outside of your system, and the further away, the harder it gets. And but like you describe in this and so I think you're talking about Markov, the kind of person then learning someone the emerging life paper and in that case, for some reason, this also has to do with the way you set up the stage space system but the way he identified basically he did it just in terms of cross correlations between the states of these chemical particles and the locations of the states of the particles outside."
"Unknown","01;54;16;11","01;54;53;13","And it was an emergent effect I'm not sure if I think it has to do with the particular simulation so that if you if we kind abstracted a little bit away from that particular simulation, then when you go to deep temporal models, actually, and what you're trying to do is you're trying to you could call it the hologram, I guess in some way, you're trying to create an image of what the future looks like outside of the current blanket and that's why they call these the temporal models in the sense semi Markov."
"Unknown","01;54;55;21","01;55;23;00","So lots of these interesting cognitive phenomena that actually emerge when you start to hack your way out of your blanket, so to speak, and you're trying to get a grip on what's happening the outside. And this can be spatially, it's going to be temporary. So temporary will be the future of space will be basis. We can reach an so yeah, that's a very interesting question."
"Unknown","01;55;23;01","01;56;03;01","I think the own aspect, it's something that has been discussed recently. I think it's also an important key to the way our cognition works is that by absorbing information over time and combining with the right priors and the right, so nature and nurture have to be kind of coalescing in a way that gets you a grip on things that are not immediately sensible anyway."
"Unknown","01;56;03;23","01;56;34;11","So that's a very interesting question that I can't directly answer because this we just know that for any physical system through like the value system to work, we can only assume local interactions. And then the rest of the story is trying to figure out how far you can get with just local interactions and to create those what you call holograms, I guess you could call them this is our particular literature."
"Unknown","01;56;34;11","01;57;01;16","You're drawing them, you use them to increase fields. Actually talks about Holograph specifically Dave what were you thinking of? A hologram? It's interesting. For example, I got that from the chapter of Mark Solms book that just came out last number of weeks, where he first is talking about actually visiting Karl first, but he doesn't use the term holographic."
"Unknown","01;57;01;22","01;57;37;18","The only place I've seen that in this kind of context is some discussion of using interferometry to see around corners. This is something that presumably people can't do, but instruments can, that the there's a holographic or holograph like effect that allows both either with sound or with light to image objects that can't be seen visibly, but you have to have a corner as long as this corner."
