00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,000
hello everyone

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,400
welcome to the active inference lab and

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,239
to the active inference live stream

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,400
this is active inference live stream

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,840
19.1

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,519
on april 6 2021

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,080
welcome to the active inference lab we

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,519
are a participatory

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,679
online lab that is communicating

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,199
learning and practicing

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,440
applied active inference you can find us

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,840
at our links and contact information

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,960
here

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,040
this is recorded in an archived live

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,719
stream so please provide us

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,320
feedback so that we can improve our work

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,000
all backgrounds and perspectives are

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,160
welcome here and we'll be following

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,920
hopefully video etiquette for

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,239
live streams such as muting when there's

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,360
noise in our background

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,960
and raising our hands so we can hear

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,520
from everyone who wants to speak

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,640
you can go to this shortened link to see

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,239
the upcoming streams of different kinds

27
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,600
today we're in 19.1 on april 6th

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,360
and we'll be having a follow-up group

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,200
discussion next week

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,880
on april 13th hello steven we're already

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,759
live

32
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,280
so today in active inference 19.1

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,119
the goal is really just to learn and

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,680
discuss about this really awesome paper

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,680
deeply felt affect the emergence of

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,200
valence in deep

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,600
active inference by casper hesp ryan

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,400
smith

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,520

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,040
and we're really appreciative that

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,720
casper has joined us today and

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,640
any one of these other authors are free

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,840
to join us next week or the following

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,040
in 19.1 we're gonna go over

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,880
the various parts of the paper in any

47
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,560
order that people want to

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,399
raise them and we can just start with

49
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,840
some short introductions and warm-ups

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,040
that will be culminating in casper

51
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,880
and giving a little maybe just

52
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,960
introduction or a background

53
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,680
and um that will be great to start with

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,560
so

55
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,920
i'm daniel i'm a postdoc in california

56
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,599
and i will pass it to sarah

57
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,680
i'm sarah i'm a person stuck in berlin

58
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,280
because i can't update my visa

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,840
uh next

60
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,080
hello i'm stephen i'm in toronto and uh

61
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,480
i'm very much in looking forward to

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,160
learning more about

63
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,560
effect and it's a relationship to active

64
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,879
inference and i'm going to pass it to

65
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,000
day okay dave douglas

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,879
i'm in the mountains of the philippines

67
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,480
retired from

68
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,200
information technology including natural

69
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,319
language

70
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,760
processing and machine translation

71
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,680
background in process philosophy

72
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,200
whitehead especially and cybernetics

73
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,360
and i will pass to dean if he hasn't

74
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,800
spoken yet

75
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,560
i'm dean i'm from calgary um

76
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,640
retired but really interested in this

77
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,800
stuff i don't know who i can pass it to

78
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,200
other than maybe casper i'm not sure

79
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,640
sure yeah my name is uh casper i'm

80
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,000
a phd student at the

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,480
university of amsterdam i'm currently

82
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,120
doing

83
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,640
yeah um kind of being co-supervised by

84
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,239
two professors at the university of

85
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,239
amsterdam and um

86
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,040
one being at the university of uh

87
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,200
college london so that's uh

88
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,120
the one you probably all know called

89
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,040
kristen um

90
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,239
it's like my um

91
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,920
external uh supervisor

92
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,120
and this paper was developed

93
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,159
under his um yeah in his lab

94
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,040
basically with a bunch of really

95
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,560
wonderful people actually

96
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,560
my co-first author is not here today but

97
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,360
i am aware that he has been brian smith

98
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,120
has been with you on many of these

99
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,760
sessions

100
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,879
and yeah so i

101
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,000
think i'll just go into the intro

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,238
of the paper and

103
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,440
i guess it would be interesting because

104
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,360
you can read in the paper itself

105
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,400
in a kind of formal motivation

106
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,000
i will tell you a little bit more about

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,919
the story behind how this

108
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,440
how this came about when i first entered

109
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,720
the group

110
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,240
there was most of the modeling that was

111
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,120
done

112
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,479
was with single layers

113
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,800
and there was already some preliminary

114
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,560
work on deep temporal

115
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,160
modeling and

116
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,040
that's essentially working out the

117
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,639
implications of

118
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,919
this kind of hierarchical models that

119
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,600
start to look more like um the one that

120
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,520
might have come across some deep

121
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,960
learning research

122
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,840
but now with the bayesian beijing flavor

123
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,160
and one of the things that i was missing

124
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,240
personally

125
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,440
was a meta cognitive

126
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,590
aspect that

127
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,720
[Music]

128
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,919
moves beyond just estimating

129
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,680
uh confidence it's one one aspect

130
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,000
but then reflecting on that confidence

131
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,750
estimate

132
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,840
[Music]

133
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,560
to give you an idea of something that

134
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,039
can

135
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,320
regulate other parts of the system

136
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,600
so we ended up

137
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,919
going back and forth on this topic with

138
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,000
uh with carl and

139
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,479
thomas farr and was a huge help there as

140
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,280
well

141
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,759
and he's also on the paper essentially

142
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,800
thinking about these action models in

143
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,840
active implants

144
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,440
and i'm not presupposing certain degree

145
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,600
of familiarity but i can

146
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,680
suppose i can quickly read that

147
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,039
essentially the way i've presented it in

148
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:13,600
paper

149
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,680
is really meant to be something that

150
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,800
you start from zero knowledge

151
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
about active influence and i kind of

152
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,560
build it up in steps

153
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,120
so that people are not super familiar

154
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,120
with it yeah i guess it's like

155
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,520
yeah these these steps essentially

156
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,039
the the point is that these diagrams

157
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,000
have a very mathematical meaning um a

158
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,080
very specific mathematical

159
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,880
and when you just present people the

160
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,759
whole diagram

161
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,560
at once what we call directed acyclical

162
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,840
graphs

163
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,199
it usually is pretty overwhelming

164
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,000
so for this paper i decided to kind of

165
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,960
go back

166
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,039
and just give the viewer the reader

167
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,400
a very stepwise kind of

168
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,599
incremental primer we call it

169
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,240
and we start with um these first two

170
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,400
states

171
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,960
that are being linked is the the types

172
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,800
of states is hidden

173
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,560
states and sensory states

174
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,280
and that's really the kind of core and

175
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,880
what's interesting is that it's very

176
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,800
modular so if you go to the next

177
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
slide

178
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,680
yeah so

179
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,160
don't if you just ignore the maps for

180
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,319
now but the nice idea here

181
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,360
is that these graphs are entirely

182
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,800
or it's kind of like a lego box

183
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,879
essentially so once you understand

184
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,560
the first um piece of the puzzle

185
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,479
in m1 where it's inferring

186
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,560
hidden states based on sensory states

187
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,879
you can basically understand all the

188
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,479
other graphs as well

189
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,960
to a certain degree i mean at some point

190
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,000
we introduce

191
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,599
um links between continuous and discrete

192
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,199
state spaces that's where it gets a

193
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,240
little bit more

194
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,440
complicated mathematically the one thing

195
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,960
you can keep in mind when reading these

196
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,599
figures

197
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,720
is that down stream on the arrows

198
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,000
is always about prediction

199
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,879
so here for example the prior overhidden

200
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,599
states

201
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,639
on the top d predicts um

202
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,279
the hidden state below that s

203
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,799
so downstream on the arrows we're

204
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,559
talking about prediction

205
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,399
upstream we're talking about inference

206
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,920
so in this case you have

207
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
you start from the prior make prediction

208
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,760
about what the hidden states are a

209
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,800
priori

210
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,120
and then moving from these hidden states

211
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,720
make prediction about

212
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,240
what the sensory states are

213
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,680
and that's where the likelihood nothing

214
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,720
comes in and then so that's one crucial

215
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,600
aspect so downstream prediction upstream

216
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,200
inference

217
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,120
then there's another crucial part that

218
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,880
you need to know in order to interpret

219
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,839
these figures is that

220
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,680
um the circles are variables

221
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,600
and the squares are parameters so

222
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,920
in this case hidden states and sensory

223
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,080
states those are listed in the circles

224
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,279
the s and the o those can vary over the

225
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,440
course of the simulation

226
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,040
and if you set it up in this very

227
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,120
simplistic way then the squares are

228
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,920
fixed so the values in the prior and the

229
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,880
likelihood method

230
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,399
are fixed in this very simplistic

231
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,720
section

232
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,680
once you understand this you can start

233
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,480
hooking

234
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,120
these things up to each other so we can

235
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,160
once we link

236
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,440
another circle to a square then this

237
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,640
uh the mappings become

238
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,440
variable as well and you will see that

239
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,760
coming back later

240
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,040
but it would now generalize this

241
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,480
reading of the figure to the second and

242
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,839
so m2 here exactly the same

243
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,200
maps is applied to this way the states

244
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,079
evolve over time and so generative model

245
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,600
anticipation

246
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,880
is using current states to make

247
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,279
predictions about future states

248
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,680
that's where we come to the third part

249
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,640
of these kinds of

250
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,680
graphs that's pretty important to know

251
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,120
is that to right it's supposed to be the

252
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,000
temporal dimension

253
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,839
so s1 is used to make predictions about

254
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,600
s2

255
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,959
and base if you have knowledge about s2

256
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,599
you can make inferences about what s1

257
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,680
was the most likely state

258
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,640
in the past as well so it works both

259
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,880
ways

260
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,000
so that's perception and anticipation

261
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,120
and obviously

262
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,240
entirely reduced to the most sim

263
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,279
yes simplistic

264
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,120
kind of form that you couldn't come up

265
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,760
with essentially

266
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,200
something often these models are

267
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,720
criticized for being too simplistic well

268
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,600
i think that's kind of the beauty in the

269
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,440
sense that

270
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,720
we obviously start with these

271
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,440
components the lego blocks so to speak

272
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:33,920
the

273
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,040
individual blocks are pretty simple but

274
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,640
once you start hooking them up to each

275
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,360
other

276
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,560
you get emergent dynamics

277
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,040
that are pretty uh hard to already

278
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,079
create yeah pretty

279
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,600
quickly become hard to

280
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,440
wrap your mind around so that's why

281
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,880
we're presenting them in a stepwise

282
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,800
question

283
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,120
i would say if you're really interested

284
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,320
in the maps then

285
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,519
um you would

286
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,920
probably want to go into one somewhat

287
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
the tutorials for example that

288
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,880
ryan smith recently made i can actually

289
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,440
send

290
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,120
a link to that

291
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,600
right now

292
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,320
because he works through the actual

293
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,600
equations

294
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,959
in this step-by-step session

295
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,720
cool you can put any links in the

296
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,880
youtube live chat so that everybody can

297
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,320
see it otherwise only we'll be able to

298
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,000
see it

299
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,600
yeah cool thanks for all these

300
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,440
clarifying points on

301
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,440
figure one and i agree it'd be awesome

302
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,880
to have um

303
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,240
ryan uh these have been on a few times

304
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,800
so yeah

305
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,200
um okay question related figure one

306
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,120
stephen

307
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,399
yeah just one question when you

308
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,320
mentioned the predictions and

309
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,279
inferences do you tend to think about

310
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,600
like the downward predictions

311
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,079
across all the components and then the

312
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,600
inference is more

313
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,800
although it's happening at all

314
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,639
components more in terms of like the big

315
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,920
block

316
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,160
jumps between like what m1 and m2 is

317
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,240
inferring in relation to each other so

318
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,680
you tend to

319
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,600
think about it more that way so you look

320
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,120
at each piece as a

321
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,399
as more of smaller ideas

322
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,200
predicting down and linking and then the

323
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,519
inference is more

324
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,800
thought of in these you know broader

325
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,079
sense of something that you could get

326
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,360
your head around

327
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,480
as a human so to speak

328
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
um it depends on which level of

329
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
description you're currently focusing

330
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,920
but um in the sen in a sense the answer

331
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,399
is yes

332
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,680
that um once you

333
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,920
kind of stick another layer on top of it

334
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,720
so to speak

335
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,600
that layer can start to um it's

336
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,279
basically perceiving

337
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,000
uh in a weird way you could see say it's

338
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,680
trying to perceive the perceptions

339
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,000
and then that allows the system to

340
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,199
report

341
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,600
on these perceptions so that's like a

342
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,639
kind of meta

343
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,800
and meta-level

344
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,519
representation that gives the system

345
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,079
this capacity to reflect on its own

346
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,440
on its own inferences on the lower level

347
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,480
we have also worked on

348
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,680
paper where we apply this to the

349
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,720
precision on the likelihood

350
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,199
and should probably not get into that

351
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,800
too much for now but

352
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,440
it's if anybody's interested so let me

353
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,160
just i

354
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,920
found i've gotten access to the live

355
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,839
stream now let me just post

356
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,680
say hello and then i'll make you a mod

357
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,199
so that you can post links

358
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,120
but yeah thank you for adding links to

359
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,240
the live stream

360
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,440
anyone else have a question on figure

361
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,839
one

362
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,360
otherwise it'd be nice to i think

363
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,160
continue this incremental

364
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,160
unrolling of the model and then we'll

365
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,680
definitely get to

366
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,360
a lot of different topics i think in a

367
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,320
broader discussion too

368
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,240
i'm in the live chat right now so

369
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,519
here's the paper by ryan smith

370
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,240
and then there's

371
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,560
now you're a moderator so now nice

372
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,440
okay steven question on finger one or

373
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,720
broader question

374
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,639
uh yeah just building on what was just

375
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,639
mentioned a second ago with figure one

376
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:28,880
is

377
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,279
you know thanks for that clarification

378
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,079
and

379
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,279
um so like you say this this this idea

380
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,720
of like a meta

381
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,600
level of inference is useful and i think

382
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,000
and this

383
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,199
came up in the previous um live stream

384
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,680
with ryan smith that there seems to be

385
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,920
something about the updating

386
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,959
between so as well as like going from

387
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,639
one chunk to the

388
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,839
next chunk so to speak of m1m2 and

389
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,759
giving that as a way to get a handle on

390
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,040
an inference

391
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,120
there's like something that can be done

392
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,040
with whatever gets message passed

393
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,759
up and so from what my understanding

394
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,240
that looks like the two ways into the

395
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,440
inferential piece so

396
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,199
great yeah so that's where um

397
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,160
essentially one of the core innovations

398
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,759
that we present in this paper is

399
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,800
something

400
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,519
we like to call deep parametric active

401
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,800
inference

402
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,360
um where you're making inferences about

403
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,720
the parameters of

404
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,240
lower level models

405
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,279
and then that is guiding your your

406
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,880
expectations

407
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,120
and we're going to get into that more we

408
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,399
once we go down

409
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,600
this path and let me see

410
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,560
so i've managed to get access i think so

411
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,440
what does the

412
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,480
moderation help me oh

413
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
you could post links i think people who

414
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,079
are moderators cannot post links but we

415
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:54,720
got your links

416
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,040
so the tutorial paper and the meta

417
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,240
awareness paper are

418
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,560
in the live chat so thank you yeah good

419
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,600
okay

420
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,439
cool um yeah so

421
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,679
i just to illustrate the point i think

422
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:08,880
it makes sense to go

423
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,559
to go further um because

424
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,480
essentially what uh i think it was dean

425
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,439
was mentioning or was it dave i couldn't

426
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:19,919
see

427
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,039
and it's my own site but um

428
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,439
um anyway so

429
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,000
and what was mentioned is that yeah you

430
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,600
have these lego blocks and you start

431
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,080
building your hierarchy so to speak

432
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,360
and one of the things that was

433
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,200
had already happened by the time i came

434
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,000
around was this step presented here

435
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,240
where again the circle here with the pi

436
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,559
inside is a variable

437
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,960
and the simple act of connecting this

438
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,679
variable

439
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,520
to the state transitions on the lower

440
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,600
level so basically

441
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,399
the variable pi which stands for policy

442
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,840
starts to dynamically

443
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,520
control your beliefs about how to stay

444
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,280
how the states of the world equal all

445
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,600
the time

446
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,640
yes so this is um

447
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,760
then controlled by the prior

448
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,120
um and this is a really a little bit of

449
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,080
a funky

450
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,280
aspect of active inference in that

451
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,480
formulation

452
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,799
because the prior on this on these

453
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:33,520
policies

454
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,039
is informed by a the expected free

455
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,320
energy

456
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,400
the expected free energy i call is funky

457
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,039
because it recapitulates the entire

458
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,160
generative model

459
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,919
down below the expected free energy

460
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,919
includes the expectations of the

461
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,630
organism about the world

462
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,360
[Music]

463
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,720
so there's this thing that carl

464
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,840
and thomas bar had called and

465
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,240
the generalized free energy where they

466
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,760
reformulate this

467
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,120
and impact what's inside the policy

468
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,640
variable and in terms of a whole kind of

469
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,600
a generative model that mirrors um the

470
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,480
perception

471
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,160
aspect um don't get need to get too deep

472
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,039
into that that's

473
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,039
essentially unpacking what uh the

474
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,160
expected free energy here does in the

475
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,200
model

476
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,480
um it's very

477
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,880
important because the expected free

478
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,720
energy is what introduces

479
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,000
the what i call the phenotypic

480
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,600
or phenotype congruent action model

481
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,679
it's also going to be answering one of

482
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,679
the questions that came up i watched the

483
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,440
previous live stream that you had on

484
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,240
this paper

485
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,600
and we'll get to that in a second but we

486
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,200
can use it to answer one of the

487
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,720
questions that came up about

488
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,919
um whether the effective charge

489
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,120
uh why it depends only arises when there

490
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,960
is a difference between the prior and

491
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,919
posterior

492
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,360
objection we'll get to it

493
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,280
so the expect free energy you can think

494
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,640
of it as

495
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,120
recapitulating the entire action model

496
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,200
with one big difference

497
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,320
namely that it's biased by

498
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,760
phenotypic outcome practices so

499
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,120
it's essentially the phenotypic outcome

500
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,880
preferences basically

501
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,240
bring into an active inference

502
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,880
what the reward function does in

503
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,840
reinforcement

504
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,440
it does this because it's essentially

505
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,720
biasing the way the agent behaves

506
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,840
towards the world

507
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,600
and trying to match make naked match

508
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,720
its preferences that are specified here

509
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,240
purely in probabilistic terms so

510
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,360
[Music]

511
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,158
the phenotypic

512
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,120
preferences can be something that can be

513
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,960
engrained that can be learned

514
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,880
it's not really it's pretty agnostic

515
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,240
where it comes from

516
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,679
um that's because there it has this

517
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,080
hierarchical nature so i have models in

518
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,840
which these preferences themselves are

519
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,880
state dependent

520
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,919
so let's say you're hungry um

521
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,039
when you're hungry your preference uh

522
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,400
factor for um for food

523
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,600
is then is up regulated essentially it

524
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,840
makes um more uh a stronger driver

525
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,880
of your actions essentially when you're

526
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,600
tired

527
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,520
then you have a stronger preference

528
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,679
against exerting effort

529
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,720
so there's these kinds of um these

530
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,559
preferences themselves can be made state

531
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,640
dependent if you just add another lego

532
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,679
block on top

533
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,880
and you start having inferences about

534
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,600
how hungry you are how tired you are and

535
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,080
you can

536
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,720
have an organism that's managing its

537
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,840
energy resources

538
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,080
then there's this last component that we

539
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,200
discussed is the e

540
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,600
here the e matrix

541
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,760
you can think of it as a kind of

542
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,200
habitual

543
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,240
prior or what they call in mobile in a

544
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,960
reinforcement

545
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,080
and they call it model 3

546
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,320
it's just counting the number of times a

547
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,520
particular action

548
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,000
occurred it's not evaluating it by any

549
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,520
any like by any rewards

550
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,280
or something like that it's just um

551
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,600
i mean i would i actually don't like the

552
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,280
term model 3 because

553
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,760
in essence it is still model it's just a

554
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,919
model that has a separate parameter

555
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,960
for every possible action right so just

556
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,760
counting

557
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,320
it's kind of like when you took your

558
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,919
drivers

559
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,360
lessons and i remember repeating

560
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,080
mistakes

561
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,159
not because i liked to make those

562
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,760
mistakes but just because i made them

563
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,320
before

564
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,159
my body and brain kind of

565
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,799
stored that information and i ended up

566
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,960
repeating those mistakes just because

567
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,720
this pathway has been explored before

568
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,400
okay so that's like a little bit of

569
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,960
unpacking here and

570
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,000
the way you can read this diagram

571
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,640
is again from left to right so you start

572
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,080
with the action model

573
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,120
and the expected free energy guiding

574
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,080
the a priori expectations and this is a

575
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,640
kind of

576
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,679
crooked scientist i would say it is

577
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,120
biased towards not what you believe

578
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,080
the world to be exactly but more towards

579
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,679
what you would like the world to be

580
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,400
like and or what's if you are

581
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,120
currently doing well what you would

582
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,120
expect the world to be

583
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,320
so it's pretty um

584
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,840
it's it's an intentional but yeah like

585
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,000
the bias is introduced in that site

586
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,080
and then if you look on the other side

587
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,600
you get the perceptual evidence

588
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,679
it's the free energy you can think of

589
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,880
that as a kind of reality check

590
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,919
so i can have lots of

591
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,240
expectations about what i want the world

592
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,600
to be like

593
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,039
and where i want to end up or what i

594
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:17,600
want

595
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,480
my shoes to be like when i buy them i

596
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
remember this example from last time

597
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,679
um but then i need perceptual evidence

598
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,039
to actually see if the

599
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,760
shoes actually fit after i bought them

600
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,840
let's say

601
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,760
um so

602
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,559
this perceptual evidence gives a very

603
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,840
it's a very crucial

604
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,960
component of how

605
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,240
how the whole the kind of perceptual

606
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,520
feedback

607
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,679
without that your your agent would be

608
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,039
living in a fantasy world

609
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,679
right so we can if there's unless there

610
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,039
are any questions we can move to the

611
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,320
next

612
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,559
slide anyone uh can raise their hand

613
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,400
otherwise stephen question on this

614
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,080
figure or a broader question okay go for

615
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,840
the question this figure

616
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,760
just want to ask you one question there

617
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,360
with your action model

618
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,440
because with expected free energy you

619
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,640
often have the risk

620
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,520
ambiguity and pragmatic gain as three

621
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,159
terms

622
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,520
on one side so is it like that the

623
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,039
pragmatic gain is is built into the

624
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,640
action model

625
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,760
implicitly so it's kind of

626
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,679
you you've rearranged it slightly with

627
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,320
that in mind so that all action

628
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,640
has some sort of pragmatic game built

629
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,559
into the phenotypical

630
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,320
morphology of the animal or something

631
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,080
like that

632
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,960
yeah so here in the pragmatic part so

633
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,720
that's the kind of the see the outcome

634
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,600
preferences

635
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,840
like your preferred observations

636
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,600
essentially is built into

637
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,919
its part of the phenotypic risk so if

638
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:54,799
you look at

639
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,200
the equation on the left and so the

640
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,919
right hand side to the left term

641
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,559
for phenotypic risk you see there you

642
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,840
take the the

643
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,039
difference between the logarithm of your

644
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,799
expected outcomes

645
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,000
minus your preferred outcomes

646
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,120
then in in terms of units of nets so

647
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,600
information to your experience so what

648
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,039
you're essentially the risk

649
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,960
here is just quantify in terms of the

650
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,240
the difference between your preferred

651
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,159
outcomes and the expected outcomes

652
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,279
given a particular action

653
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,480
that makes sense cool and

654
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,080
it's also interesting it's the natural

655
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,520
log of o sub

656
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,640
pi so it's conditioned on a policy

657
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,960
so it's not like some sort of all by all

658
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,799
chess boards all strategies all

659
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:45,840
situations it's

660
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,720
very constrained with respect to what

661
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,480
actually matters which are

662
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,880
in the end the affordances in the niche

663
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,400
of the actual agents

664
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,600
in the in its scenario so it's really

665
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,400
cool to see how that gets baked into the

666
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:00,960
model

667
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,640
not like a secondary pruning or a

668
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,559
heuristic

669
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,720
yeah so this this just falls out of

670
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,679
calculating

671
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,520
and the expected to energy under a

672
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,960
certain um

673
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,559
policy and so this g is conditions on

674
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,000
policies in that sense

675
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,039
um and one interesting aspect here is

676
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,600
that if you make the generative model

677
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,960
more

678
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,360
sophisticated then this g is going to

679
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,120
become more sophisticated as well

680
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,399
so you can add if you add

681
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,480
learning or parameters of let's say the

682
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,840
likelihood then the aspect of your

683
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,399
energy

684
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,799
also expands accordingly and it ends up

685
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:41,919
having a term for

686
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,320
active learning so your agent can

687
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,399
anticipate

688
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,279
basically that exploring the environment

689
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,159
can allow

690
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,039
uh to reduce uncertainty about these

691
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,159
perceptual

692
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,360
um mappings so then

693
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,159
you get an agent that's intrinsically

694
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,240
curious about the world

695
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,360
you can do the same with the b matrices

696
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,039
or the transition matrices

697
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,960
so you get an agent like a child who

698
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,240
kind of just

699
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,039
experiments exploring different states

700
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:13,919
of the world

701
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,039
and then starts picking up on

702
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,480
different kinds of control that it has

703
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,880
and can even at some point can even

704
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,159
learn to anticipate

705
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,159
that if it's um

706
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,039
experiments in a certain way it might be

707
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,480
able to learn new

708
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,120
things about these methods so

709
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,640
this is this is currently in not in this

710
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,240
particular model because

711
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,520
if you remember to do that you need to

712
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,399
add

713
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:50,159
variables to the particular methods

714
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,159
and the nice thing about this lego box

715
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,840
of active inference that speaks that

716
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,320
you're

717
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,159
completely free to just to add um

718
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,000
to make anything variable as long as

719
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,399
you can yeah as long as you specify

720
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,520
certain the probability

721
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,840
distributions you can do the same trick

722
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,440
again and again in different on the

723
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,480
street in continuous state spaces

724
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,480
so i think this is a nice segue into

725
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,720
oh here you first introduced in table

726
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,520
three

727
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,559
some of the equations

728
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,279
um here we have table three up on the

729
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,919
screen or do you want figure three

730
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,000
no i think we can go on to i mean unless

731
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,039
somebody wants to go

732
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,880
deeper into this but i i think you

733
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,390
already kind of discussed this

734
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:42,000
[Music]

735
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,600
yep it was really helpful to see the

736
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,240
table anyway laid out this is work yeah

737
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,840
this is actually not the way i delivered

738
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,279
the table to the journal

739
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,159
it's just that they have three i mean

740
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,640
it's crazy you pay them this

741
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,399
money to fix it you know but then they

742
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,080
make it worse so like basically they had

743
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,120
like a new what

744
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,440
layout and their webplay items and

745
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,480
messes up the

746
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,000
most of the figures and

747
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,080
so when you want to read it i would

748
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,240
really recommend downloading the pdf

749
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,600
and not using their web

750
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,640
oh yes this is their web layout it it

751
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,240
definitely makes sort of a false

752
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,039
equivalence

753
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,279
or a way of making it look like there's

754
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,720
something missing on one side or the

755
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,480
other

756
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,000
yeah so just read the pdf and

757
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,760
it's unfortunate because it's supposed

758
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,559
to be their job

759
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,840
well here we are on figure three and so

760
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,200
we have just the figure three and then

761
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,000
we also have

762
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,399
that part with the ac if you want to

763
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,760
kind of highlight that because i know

764
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,960
that's something we really want to

765
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,960
understand

766
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,960
yes so um just we're going to continue

767
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,000
our our

768
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,399
um building this um

769
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,840
different we're adding these different

770
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,000
blocks together and

771
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,960
now what we add on top of it is we have

772
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,440
g

773
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,720
this is the recapitulation of the entire

774
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,840
action mode

775
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,480
we add a variable on top of it that

776
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,760
modulates

777
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,480
the extent to which i rely on this

778
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,000
action model

779
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,640
and so the precision gamma can take any

780
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,519
barrier

781
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,760
value between 0 and infinity and

782
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,120
and it just tells me when i

783
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,799
predict what's going to happen in the

784
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,240
world and i

785
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,240
anticipate what's going to happen um

786
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,679
how much can i rely on my action model

787
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,559
that's biased by my preferences

788
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,600
so this is not the same as

789
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,880
um i mean yeah

790
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,440
that's kind of where it comes into into

791
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:47,919
um

792
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,840
story why and it's this effective charge

793
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,159
that we're talking about

794
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,000
ends up being depending on the

795
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,519
difference between

796
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,720
pi and prior and the posterior

797
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,799
so essentially what this precision is

798
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,760
tracking

799
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,640
is tracking the match between

800
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,000
the predicted value you can say of g

801
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,039
or predict for the actual policies that

802
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,399
i end up selecting

803
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,720
um the actual state transitions of the

804
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,000
worlds

805
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,120
and how well they are predicted by my

806
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,039
action

807
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,120
and this is my crooked scientist model

808
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,559
right so it's like the max

809
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,559
action model that's trying to realize

810
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,840
preferences and

811
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,600
effective charge is essentially the kind

812
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,480
of um

813
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,159
we call it like that because later on

814
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,000
it's getting a special role

815
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,559
and when you go to hierarchical setup we

816
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,080
add one more

817
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,840
lego block on top of this but

818
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,120
essentially um

819
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,720
whenever my um

820
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,000
whenever um so if you unpack

821
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,440
this effective charge equation you see

822
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:07,919
that

823
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,760
it's calculating the difference between

824
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,159
my prior policy vector that's just based

825
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,640
on my preferences my action model

826
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,080
um and the posterior

827
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,240
and that's the one that happened that i

828
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,840
have after i integrate perceptual

829
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,240
evidence so

830
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,799
and then that difference so that's where

831
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,320
it's a little bit hard to imagine maybe

832
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,039
but

833
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,600
basically um the difference between

834
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,640
these two

835
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,200
is kind of like the rate of change you

836
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,159
could say

837
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,760
over time of my beliefs

838
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,440
and then you take the dot product of

839
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,760
that with the expected free energy

840
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,679
and what what you essentially want to

841
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,440
know is

842
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,039
um after integrating perceptual evidence

843
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,080
did they get closer to

844
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,840
matching the expected free energy the

845
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,559
distribution anticipated by that

846
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,960
or did i get further away so that's why

847
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,159
i call this

848
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,279
phenotypic progress if i get

849
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,039
if the expected pure energy is a bad

850
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,480
predictor

851
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,918
then this term ends up being uh negative

852
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,760
if it's a good predictor it ends up

853
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,399
being positive

854
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,199
and i mean there's like a little bit of

855
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,800
a play with signs there

856
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
and we just define it in a way that it's

857
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,000
positive the

858
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,610
positive value is a good thing

859
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:28,239
[Music]

860
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,560
that's like always a little bit

861
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,760
confusing because in some

862
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,560
different fields they use there's even

863
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,079
fields where the

864
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,960
free energy is defined in the opposite

865
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,679
way

866
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,440
so the whole story clips on his head

867
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,159
that's why you always have to be careful

868
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:46,879
how you

869
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:52,000
how you define it locally in each paper

870
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,560
and yeah when you come from a different

871
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,040
field you have to

872
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,800
you know make sure that you've got your

873
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,240
signs

874
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,960
in your signs in a row so to speak um

875
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,599
yeah so if i can say that one major

876
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:08,880
field there difference is that

877
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,520
physicists

878
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,920
often go downhill gradient descent

879
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,839
optimization we're going to minimize the

880
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:14,880
loss function

881
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,359
and biologists often talk or think about

882
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,400
hill climbing

883
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,200
and fitness peaks and optimization

884
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,440
maximization and congruence in the best

885
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
possible world that kind of pangolos

886
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,240
world

887
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,880
so totally agreed and especially when

888
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,720
there's a lot of natural logs

889
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,920
and negative signs and differences and

890
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,320
divergences that can only be positive

891
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,320
and things that are strictly negative or

892
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,320
bounded but when

893
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,760
it's something where it really needs to

894
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,599
be walked through slowly because

895
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,320
it's so easy to get tripped up in how

896
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,320
these things flip back and forth

897
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,960
so yeah really important notes to kind

898
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,160
of just go slow and

899
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,560
really make sure that we're using the

900
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,520
right tools

901
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,119
to establish that we're connecting the

902
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,880
right qualitative ideas

903
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,119
with these variables because it's not

904
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,720
just like you throw up the equation and

905
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,160
then it's going to be

906
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,359
easy to define what each of the

907
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,400
variables are for real systems

908
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,520
yeah and on that note

909
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,560
we basically yeah we have um interpreted

910
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,599
this comma as

911
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,160
uh in the paper as a type of subjective

912
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,599
fitness

913
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,079
and that's because literally is tracking

914
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,760
the degree to which your

915
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,839
um preference biased action model

916
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,040
is fitting with the actual perceptual

917
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,839
evidence

918
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:36,400
that you're getting back and and

919
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,560
that's why the effective charge can only

920
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,720
be non-zero if there's some mismatch

921
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,560
between your prior and your posterior

922
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,880
beliefs about policies

923
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,000
because um

924
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
there's only when there there's some

925
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,839
mismatch between what you expected

926
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,800
when you got and it makes sense to talk

927
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,520
about

928
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,800
updating your beliefs about procedure

929
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,520
and can be in a positive direction or in

930
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,960
a negative direction so

931
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,960
my fit can be actually better than

932
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,000
expected

933
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,599
and or worse than expected that's why

934
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,160
why describe in the in the abstracts

935
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,920
that this lens is assigned

936
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,040
to these predictions essentially

937
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,960
because if you think about just in terms

938
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,640
of predictions it's kind of

939
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,839
well prediction is either wrong or very

940
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:24,320
wrong

941
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,440
okay so then i mean if you want to know

942
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,000
um if you go to this meta level where

943
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,520
you're estimating how wrong

944
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,960
am i so is my prediction getting better

945
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,760
or worse

946
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,240
that's that's where the sign comes into

947
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,839
into the story and where you can

948
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,040
talk about um improvements or

949
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,160
uh improving or worsening

950
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,800
state of the world speed and state of

951
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,680
yourself

952
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,359
and this really applies to any kinds of

953
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,560
states by the way so it

954
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,079
can um

955
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,560
it can be about internal states tracking

956
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,000
and as i said hunger

957
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,720
and fatigue but it can also be about the

958
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,160
objective states of

959
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,680
other specifics so um

960
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,680
this kind of subjective fitness can be

961
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,599
linked to any

962
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,640
arbitrary state that of interest

963
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,280
and if you go to the next level then the

964
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:23,920
state

965
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,280
of inference can be an observation

966
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,440
for the next level so that's

967
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,520
hierarchical trick

968
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,960
and is i think the power of it

969
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,720
is that yeah we have freedom to

970
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,280
do what we want to do with our lego

971
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,560
blocks

972
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,599
depending on this system of interest

973
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,760
but we try to keep it simple while we're

974
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,359
still just demonstrating

975
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,520
possibilities but then the implications

976
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,680
get

977
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,160
really really big once you start to

978
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,079
release the simplicity constraints

979
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,119
and you just go wild on constructing

980
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,440
models hierarchical models with

981
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,160
different

982
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,920
you can have expect your energies at

983
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,440
different levels you can have these kind

984
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:09,760
of

985
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,599
precision terms at different levels so

986
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,000
you can have competing

987
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,599
um affected charges

988
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,040
you can have the effective charge from

989
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,640
your lower level let's say

990
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,880
you're trying to fight your addiction or

991
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,920
something like that

992
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,160
the lower level parts of your system are

993
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,119
like kind of great

994
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,359
and generating this crating and the

995
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,079
higher level parts are like trying to

996
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,240
generalize and generate this kind of um

997
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,880
self-actualization or something like

998
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,040
that where you basically end up having

999
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,839
conflicting drives

1000
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,520
and so i mean that's where where we can

1001
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:43,920
go

1002
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,160
but to get there we need to

1003
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,670
move to add states on top of this

1004
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,359
[Music]

1005
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,800
and i think and that's there yeah

1006
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,400
if there are questions yep i'm gonna ask

1007
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,079
a question from the live chat

1008
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,240
and then anyone else who has didn't

1009
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,599
spoke yet or asked a question

1010
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,000
and then we'll ask a question about um

1011
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,680
anything else we've talked about steven

1012
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,800
so um in the chat someone asks

1013
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,440
can we relate affective charge with

1014
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,480
motivation

1015
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,319
as motivation can also affect policy

1016
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:21,599
so where do we how do we think about

1017
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,119
motivation in this kind of a model is it

1018
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,880
an affective charge is it effective

1019
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,200
charge

1020
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,200
yeah so um

1021
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,800
motivation in that sense is a very i

1022
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
mean kind of fuzzy concept right but

1023
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,640
um if you think about the

1024
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,800
gamma term here it's modulating the

1025
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,079
extent to which you're

1026
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,440
relying on your action model

1027
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,720
and the c the preference factor

1028
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,870
kind of modulating the um

1029
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,119
[Music]

1030
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,200
the extent to which you're driven by by

1031
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,720
your preferences

1032
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,079
and combining them together essentially

1033
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,200
means that um

1034
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,400
you're if you have um

1035
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,520
let's say a high and yeah

1036
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,920
you need high confidence in your action

1037
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,040
model to be

1038
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,400
actually allow it to influence your

1039
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,520
your expectations so in that sense

1040
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,960
there is definitely a link with

1041
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,520
motivation but then again you also need

1042
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,160
preferences that motivates you to move

1043
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,960
towards them

1044
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,560
right so what's kind of interesting is

1045
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,640
if you take away the preferences

1046
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,079
then you can have an agent that's

1047
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,760
motivated entirely by

1048
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,670
epistemic family

1049
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,839
[Music]

1050
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,319
so i suppose

1051
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:54,720
to some extent um

1052
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,599
it's kind of interesting because you get

1053
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,640
the

1054
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,920
precision starts to modulates

1055
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,760
curiosity and so that's a different kind

1056
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,400
of motivation

1057
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,480
anyway i can say much more because it's

1058
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,680
such a fuzzy concept

1059
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,400
but very true i reward motivation

1060
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,920
curiosity motivation

1061
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,240
there's expressivity in the model to

1062
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,839
actually talk about motivation

1063
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:26,560
with respect to specific framings of it

1064
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,880
yeah and and um

1065
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,800
the way i've recently thought about it

1066
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,000
is also that

1067
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,480
if you add a higher level and you

1068
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,680
connect it to

1069
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,079
this preference matrix um

1070
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,319
you can basically modulate the extent to

1071
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:45,200
which

1072
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,520
you're motivated by different kinds of

1073
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,800
outcomes

1074
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,079
and that means that um you're if you're

1075
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:52,640
more

1076
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,040
like a monitoring on a higher level to

1077
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,000
which extent you're currently satisfied

1078
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,640
for example um so you're

1079
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,800
you're hungry so you upregulate your

1080
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,319
preference for

1081
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,359
eating food and then you get your food

1082
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,040
and you get feedback intercepted

1083
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,720
feedback that you're you're

1084
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,720
you're satiated and then

1085
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,920
you're open for um more for

1086
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,440
epistemic drives let's say so um

1087
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,760
there's an extended yeah a sense in

1088
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,640
which

1089
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,880
the various types of motivation have to

1090
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,000
be balanced

1091
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,520
by a higher level this current

1092
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,079
figure that is not able to do that in a

1093
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,119
way

1094
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,680
if i mean our whole lego box can

1095
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,040
definitely do that

1096
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,400
but the current figure i think is still

1097
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,520
um doesn't have dynamic preferences

1098
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,200
i think that's what you need to get a

1099
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,920
more satisfying account for

1100
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,440
motivation in general thanks for that

1101
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,520
awesome response all right stephen and

1102
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,720
then anyone else who raises their hand

1103
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,640
just one question you mentioned dot

1104
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,720
product with expected free energy and

1105
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,760
just

1106
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,440
just if you could just clarify that a

1107
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,520
little bit because i think

1108
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,800
you've got something to do with the

1109
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,640
precision you've got the

1110
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,800
the larger free energy piece so if you

1111
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,160
just clarify that would be helpful

1112
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:22,480
um yeah so this effective charge term is

1113
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,319
not something we came up with

1114
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,000
right it's something that comes out of

1115
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,880
the maps when you start with um

1116
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,480
this uh gamma distribution um

1117
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,960
sorry the capital gamma distribution is

1118
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,880
um particular

1119
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,160
mathematical um yeah

1120
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,119
shape and exponential natural exponent

1121
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,440
based on natural exponent

1122
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,760
and when you use that as a probability

1123
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,800
distribution

1124
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,839
so it has this kind of tail

1125
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,880
that runs goes towards infinity um

1126
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,079
the expectation value of this tail is

1127
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,119
regulated by

1128
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,400
what's called here the temperature

1129
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,240
parameter and

1130
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,920
also called the rate parameter in other

1131
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,280
contexts

1132
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,040
but essentially the temperature

1133
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,040
parameter kind of regulates

1134
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,720
um how um how

1135
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,560
strongly this yeah the distribution is

1136
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,560
shifted towards zero

1137
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,400
and essentially

1138
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,800
what's what happens is that this when

1139
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,079
you use that as the probability

1140
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,480
distribution and you try to optimize

1141
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,520
the best this better parameter

1142
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,880
to best fit what's happening

1143
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,599
your you can do this for energy

1144
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:40,880
minimization

1145
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,599
to do that and what you get out of it

1146
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:44,880
kind of for free

1147
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,040
and once you write that down in

1148
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,720
probabilistic terms

1149
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,680
you get this objective charge there and

1150
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,079
what

1151
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,800
i was talking about is essentially an

1152
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,760
interpretation

1153
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,720
of what okay this is what we got out

1154
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,800
when we took the generative model

1155
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,280
minimized let it minimize variational

1156
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,240
free energy

1157
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,599
on these this battery parameter then

1158
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,640
we just it just kind of spits out this

1159
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,839
effective charge too

1160
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:16,079
and i was

1161
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,920
yeah then it's a matter of interpreting

1162
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,680
like what does this term mean

1163
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,839
in mathematical sense and essentially

1164
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,119
what it's doing

1165
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:24,720
is taking dot product between two

1166
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,240
vectors

1167
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,599
one vector on the left is um

1168
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,359
the difference between the prior and the

1169
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:34,000
posterior over action

1170
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,119
and the other vector is um

1171
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,560
the expected free energy for each policy

1172
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,520
and essentially if the two vectors are

1173
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,079
pointing

1174
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,200
in the same direction for an organism

1175
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,480
that's bad news

1176
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,680
right because um if

1177
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,599
my posterior is um results in larger

1178
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,760
expected per energy

1179
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,560
then that's uh that's bad because i'm

1180
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,839
trying to minimize it

1181
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,520
and then wait let me turn the light

1182
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,280
because it's looking good

1183
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,960
um dark room solved

1184
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,880
what's wrong just solve the dark room

1185
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,800
and yeah so

1186
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,000
the the idea is basically that the

1187
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,920
expected free energy you can think of it

1188
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,280
as a kind of landscape

1189
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,160
across the domain of potential actions

1190
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:26,880
and

1191
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,119
what i want to know is that um after

1192
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,520
integrating my perceptual evidence

1193
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,880
and did i get close like did

1194
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,720
what that vector look like on the left

1195
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,839
did it match the original vector i had

1196
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:45,839
in terms of the expected energy um

1197
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,480
that's why if you look closely it's the

1198
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,280
prior minus the posterior

1199
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,520
because that's the negative rate of

1200
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,359
change right it's

1201
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,280
the posit like the actual rate of change

1202
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,079
would be the posterior minus the prior

1203
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,720
but we flipped the sign there such that

1204
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,200
you get

1205
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,040
um you can interpret the effective

1206
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,720
charge as like being positive

1207
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,040
when the precision goes up being

1208
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,559
negative when precision goes down

1209
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,359
is that does that answer your question

1210
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,880
satisfactory

1211
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,599
yeah i think that's very helpful thanks

1212
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:20,079
one

1213
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:21,760
one example that came to mind was like

1214
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,000
you're driving and you're having a

1215
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,839
maps application tell you it's gonna

1216
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,200
take one hour

1217
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,760
and then as the estimate gets worse it's

1218
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,960
like it's bad

1219
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,079
if you want to get there if your

1220
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,599
preference is to get there on time now

1221
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,040
if your preference was to get there

1222
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,000
later

1223
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,119
maybe it is more neutral but then as the

1224
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,920
update is changing and your relative

1225
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,440
policy it could be like oh it's going to

1226
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,359
be 18 more minutes because of this crash

1227
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,359
up but then this speed it up this way

1228
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,720
and so we're always in a really specific

1229
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,760
situation

1230
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,280
conditioning on policy and the

1231
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,119
information we're getting and so we're

1232
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:56,000
not doing the whole

1233
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,160
traffic city flow this is about like the

1234
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,720
person getting the info from the screen

1235
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,880
and then making decisions about oh maybe

1236
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,960
i should get gas here or not

1237
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,800
not every possible decision they could

1238
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,400
be making so very

1239
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,319
very interesting way to frame this

1240
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,720
variable

1241
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,520
and this dot products and the way i

1242
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,000
don't know

1243
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,960
how many people here familiar with the

1244
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,720
way this kind of vector calculus

1245
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,520
uh tends to work that essentially you

1246
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,280
can just think of it as the dot product

1247
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:25,680
kind of

1248
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,800
match yeah calculating the

1249
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,000
degree of overlap between the vectors

1250
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,200
and if they're anti

1251
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,359
uh if they are exactly in the opposite

1252
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:38,400
directions

1253
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,520
then the dot product is very negative

1254
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,040
they're pointing in exactly the same

1255
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,599
direction than this maximally positive

1256
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,960
um but

1257
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,359
and are these yeah what are the

1258
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,720
dimensionalities

1259
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,480
so you're talking about them as vectors

1260
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,000
but are they scalars there's just one

1261
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,160
entry in the vector or are there

1262
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,680
potentially multiple or

1263
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,280
how do we think about are these one

1264
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,280
number or is it a list of numbers like a

1265
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,359
long vector

1266
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:10,640
and so in this order formulation of

1267
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,319
the expected energy it was like one

1268
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,640
value per policy

1269
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,400
essentially so every policy has

1270
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,000
which is like an action sequence and

1271
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,559
so every policy has a total kind of sum

1272
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,400
of the expected free energy associated

1273
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,480
with that

1274
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,480
so then it's a vector in the sense that

1275
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,760
every policy has its own

1276
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,720
element in the vector but more recently

1277
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,960
we've actually extended this in the

1278
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,079
sophisticated

1279
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:47,040
sophisticated inference paper because

1280
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,319
um i mean anybody

1281
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:54,079
who's worked with um policy spaces

1282
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,000
and knows about this problem of

1283
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,640
combinatorial explosion

1284
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,800
that once you start considering

1285
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,480
um courses of action in time

1286
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,200
then every time every point in time you

1287
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,319
expand it

1288
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:14,480
further uh the more um yeah

1289
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,280
the more untenable and intractable the

1290
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,040
problem becomes

1291
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,040
but in a more recent iteration we

1292
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,079
actually sub yeah divided further in

1293
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,559
terms of the

1294
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,760
actions components

1295
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,760
in turn yeah instead of having one

1296
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,960
single

1297
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,440
policy vector that has to regulate do

1298
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,960
all the machinery

1299
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,839
we have every time step has its own

1300
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,440
action variable

1301
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,040
and your performing impedance

1302
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,359
doing inference on that on every time

1303
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,839
step and

1304
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,480
this makes the problem prevents you from

1305
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,160
having to integrate everything right

1306
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,680
away

1307
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,280
the end result of that is again an

1308
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,359
integration but because here

1309
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:03,680
it kind of allows for parallel computing

1310
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,599
let's speak

1311
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:06,880
anyway but that's that's a different

1312
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,800
paper i i can actually also post it

1313
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,119
i i think we actually read it but you

1314
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:14,559
know it all blurs together

1315
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:17,280
but we did read sophisticated inference

1316
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,280
i think at one point

1317
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,960
oh yeah yeah nice yeah you tweeted lots

1318
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,000
of papers yes

1319
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,480
that's why you have them catch up we

1320
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,079
gotta catch up you're leaving them as

1321
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,720
fast as we can get to them

1322
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,240
i mean i made uh more recently uh in a

1323
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:34,800
paper

1324
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,720
on called sophisticated effective

1325
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,720
influence where

1326
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,000
um so you have another thing to catch up

1327
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,240
but it's essentially combining this

1328
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,599
effective inference story that we're

1329
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:46,800
talking about today

1330
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,440
and combining it with this article

1331
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,480
research

1332
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,160
and which allows

1333
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,520
you to simulate an agent that

1334
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,400
responds has an effective response to

1335
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,200
imagined

1336
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,960
futures it would be cool to

1337
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,960
maybe at some point to come back to

1338
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,079
discuss that one as well

1339
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,559
cool all right so dean uh with a

1340
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,079
question and then anyone else who raises

1341
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,480
their hands

1342
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,400
casper when you um go from a

1343
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:28,480
2d m1 m2 to a 3d

1344
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,839
action is that

1345
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,839
have you thought a little bit about the

1346
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,920
sort of the less about the integration

1347
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,280
more about the

1348
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,400
deflation and and inflation

1349
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,160
that happens when you go from

1350
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:49,040
fewer dimensions to to to more

1351
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,319
um yeah so that's

1352
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,480
kind of one of the motivations for going

1353
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,920
to new

1354
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,680
types of generative models because

1355
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,720
this policy variable here can explode

1356
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,280
pretty

1357
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,160
quickly once you get to multiple steps

1358
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,200
in the future

1359
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,160
and you need somehow to reduce the

1360
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,359
dimensionality

1361
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:14,960
of the state space that you're

1362
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,119
considering and then

1363
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:19,040
what i kind of what kind of one thought

1364
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,720
that kind of suits me when i build these

1365
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,480
types of models is that

1366
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,920
even though um as we say all models are

1367
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,440
wrong but some are useful

1368
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,400
right but even though that's the case

1369
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,359
and

1370
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:33,040
we know that the organisms that we're

1371
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,040
trying to model have exactly the same

1372
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:35,520
problem

1373
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,599
that we have namely they're trying to

1374
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,680
make something that's generally

1375
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,119
intractable

1376
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:47,040
tractable so the simplifications

1377
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,640
when we're trying to build a model of

1378
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,559
their model of the world

1379
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,559
and you can actually justify the

1380
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,079
simplifications

1381
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,640
in the sense that they are trying to

1382
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,760
deal with

1383
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,079
they have to do oversimplifications as

1384
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,240
well to be able to make sense

1385
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,960
any sense at all with their empowerment

1386
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,200
and

1387
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,359
i mean i don't know if this exactly

1388
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:10,880
answered your question but this was

1389
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,400
part of it came up in response

1390
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,880
this year had an interesting point about

1391
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,839
the dimensionality increasing

1392
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,000
one thing that kind of happens is that

1393
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,760
you basically have to stimulate

1394
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,880
potential futures internally once you

1395
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,160
start conditioning

1396
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,079
these days on your actions that means

1397
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,440
every possible action has a

1398
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,559
parallel kind of process of inference

1399
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:43,839
that's happening um to predict what's

1400
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,319
going to happen in the future

1401
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,320
in every dimension you add on top

1402
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,640
[Music]

1403
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:55,760
can potentially um

1404
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,880
make the whole thing interactable so

1405
00:55:58,880 --> 00:55:59,599
we're always

1406
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:03,040
kind of facing that challenge

1407
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,599
yeah dean and then that's quick

1408
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,119
follow-up so

1409
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:11,440
so sometimes you hear the expression oh

1410
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,079
well

1411
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:13,680
that problem is going to require some

1412
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,520
outside the box thinking

1413
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,480
and of course that's so ambiguous nobody

1414
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,160
really knows what that means but what

1415
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,079
you've done here i think

1416
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:25,440
is giving people an opportunity to

1417
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,440
get out of the spatial envelope get out

1418
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,880
of the

1419
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,119
i'm an agent and enveloped by the world

1420
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,960
around me and you've given them

1421
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,880
a bit of an eyes of this perspective

1422
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,160
they can actually

1423
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,440
get outside and see how

1424
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,880
as an agent they're perceiving the world

1425
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,920
how they can then potentially act on the

1426
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,440
world but as you said

1427
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,000
they're constantly updating a lot of

1428
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,280
this stuff isn't

1429
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,200
front of mind as they're doing it um

1430
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,880
but i think that's one of the big things

1431
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,359
about going from 2d to 3d you're not

1432
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:00,160
just

1433
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:04,160
zooming in and zooming out you're

1434
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,079
you're not just now you're able to look

1435
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:07,599
down on something but if you hit the

1436
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:08,720
button on the

1437
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,599
google map and you suddenly see it 3d it

1438
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:12,160
doesn't

1439
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,720
it doesn't stay at one position it

1440
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,480
actually circles

1441
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,160
around the thing that you're looking at

1442
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,480
and i think that's what this provides

1443
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,480
people is that sense of

1444
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,240
not just being inside of something but

1445
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,400
actually being able to step outside of

1446
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,880
it as well

1447
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:34,000
i mean that's something that um

1448
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:36,480
yeah actually does happen in this type

1449
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,520
of model

1450
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,720
is when you add this um pie let's say in

1451
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,480
m3 and

1452
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:48,880
you end up expanding the whole thing and

1453
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,480
it's is like you said like stepping from

1454
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,000
two to three 3d in a sense

1455
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,040
because you you're

1456
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,799
you're expanding the whole number of

1457
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:01,599
possibilities basically

1458
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,079
and in the same way it's kind of hard to

1459
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:04,640
wrap

1460
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,720
your mind around it and i think that's

1461
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,160
part of what makes these figures

1462
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,000
hard to read for people especially when

1463
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,559
you present the top level right away

1464
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:14,720
it's like asking somebody to step from

1465
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,640
one from one dimensional to

1466
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,520
three-dimensional

1467
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:21,040
right in one go you kind of have to go

1468
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,880
through the the

1469
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,400
increases in dimensionality step by step

1470
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,079
so this is also part of what motivates

1471
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:31,680
this

1472
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:35,359
incremental presentation

1473
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,559
thanks awesome question thank you dean

1474
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:41,200
so blue

1475
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,520
so we read this sophisticated affective

1476
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,599
inference like a long time ago and i

1477
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,119
always think about it and i think that i

1478
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:51,440
brought it up in the dodge zero live

1479
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,400
stream actually

1480
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,880
but i thought it was the big five paper

1481
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,000
i think we read them like right at the

1482
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,359
same time and they they're very

1483
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:57,920
different

1484
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,799
but this um sophisticated active

1485
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:02,640
affective inference was really

1486
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,760
um like prevalent with anxiety like the

1487
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:06,319
future

1488
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:08,240
time steps the further out you go in the

1489
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,760
future like the more

1490
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,839
like you can't predict what's gonna

1491
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,359
happen and so that's like the underlying

1492
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:15,680
basis for anxiety and i thought about

1493
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,160
this

1494
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:19,040
and i also thought about um the question

1495
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,880
about motivation and it made me think of

1496
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,799
tony robbins has like

1497
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:25,839
this um like theory that there's like

1498
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:28,160
six like driving factors that like

1499
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,760
influence people or motivate people

1500
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,520
through life and like you know depending

1501
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,440
on personality type or whatever and

1502
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,920
um they're like uh certainty is one of

1503
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:36,720
them

1504
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,799
um uncertainty is also one of them like

1505
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:40,319
people who like variety or

1506
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:44,000
um then there's like growth and altruism

1507
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,440
and i can't remember like all of them

1508
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,000
but what they

1509
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,079
all are but it's interesting to think

1510
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:49,359
about like the motivation

1511
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:51,599
what underlies like what's an underlying

1512
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,119
motivation for people and how that

1513
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:54,880
relates into this type of model

1514
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,520
as well as like those driving forces

1515
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,640
through life like how

1516
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,119
you might start to model those things

1517
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:03,280
like um you know someone who's driven by

1518
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,040
uncertainty versus someone who's driven

1519
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,040
by certainty that like the

1520
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,720
the uncertainty driven people might

1521
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,119
place more of like an epistemic value

1522
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:14,640
uh than an actual um then an actual

1523
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,280
um action reward value so it's just

1524
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,240
interesting to think about that

1525
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,480
yeah i mean there's like a paper in the

1526
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,760
works that got

1527
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,480
installed unfortunately but um i think

1528
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,920
where we're trying to do something like

1529
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,119
that where you're

1530
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:33,040
talking about um the way the big five

1531
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,960
um have kind of emerged as

1532
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,640
apparently a pretty strong factorization

1533
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,079
people's behavior people's behavioral

1534
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:46,079
tendencies over long periods of time

1535
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:49,520
so their personalities

1536
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,400
and why they tend to factorize like that

1537
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,200
and

1538
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,160
and to which extent you can capture them

1539
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:56,720
with

1540
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,839
something that looks like this and with

1541
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:01,920
at least one more layer i would say

1542
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,680
but to some extent yes you can

1543
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:08,319
capture this tendencies towards

1544
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:09,599
exploration

1545
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:13,359
a kind of exploration drive

1546
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:17,030
versus so risk aversion and risk

1547
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:19,119
[Music]

1548
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:25,839
basically risk seeking behaviors

1549
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,520
um cool blue that was really interesting

1550
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,880
and it reminded me about how people

1551
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,400
prefer let's just say to read

1552
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,240
different amounts and to read different

1553
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,480
topics so for some people

1554
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,720
historical fiction versus fiction

1555
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,760
science fiction

1556
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,359
all these different genres and

1557
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:44,000
sub-genres it's related to maybe what

1558
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,599
their regime of attention

1559
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,520
will latch onto and that's something

1560
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,280
that's different as you age

1561
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,599
uh and it's in cultured and it's

1562
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:53,280
embedded as well so it's kind of an

1563
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,640
interesting example that we could go

1564
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:55,200
into

1565
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,039
and then we did a live fact check

1566
01:01:58,039 --> 01:01:59,839
active11

1567
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:02,319
way back when in 2020 we did do

1568
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:03,760
sophisticated

1569
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,680
uh affective inference the simulating

1570
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,920
anticipatory responses paper

1571
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,280
and that was way more anxiety driven

1572
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,039
no it wasn't just because it was 20 20

1573
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:15,440
and then also the first one of

1574
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,240
this year with adam saffron and colin

1575
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,039
deyoung

1576
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:22,000
was the big five cybernetic big five

1577
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
kind of free energy inspired

1578
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,280
or based as well so um yep it's just

1579
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,880
it's good you know you you you did say

1580
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,160
we're kind of going through them fast

1581
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,119
but

1582
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:33,680
there's so many to read and just to even

1583
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,000
get a little bit of a grasp

1584
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,920
on it it's it to read 25 in a year

1585
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,799
or one every two weeks it's kind of a

1586
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:44,480
pace that we have to

1587
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,079
hold up to but i'm sure you read more

1588
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:49,280
than one every two weeks

1589
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,039
so yeah yeah i i guess i did um

1590
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:54,720
i did read it somewhere and i was like

1591
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,799
whoa you um

1592
01:02:56,799 --> 01:02:58,720
i wasn't sure i didn't remember whether

1593
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,319
it was like sophisticated inference or

1594
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:02,319
sophisticated affected intensive but so

1595
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:03,599
what is the effective one

1596
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:05,599
it was just the conference proceedings

1597
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:08,000
though so it was very

1598
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,720
short um yeah it's a little bit too

1599
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,240
minimal i think to really

1600
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,839
um it was more like a technical note

1601
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:16,559
yeah it would

1602
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:20,400
be hard to really get it just based on

1603
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,160
if you're not yeah so familiar with the

1604
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,680
modeling

1605
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,960
and the actual like nitty-gritty you

1606
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:29,599
know like

1607
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,920
it's like in that sense confidence

1608
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,839
proceedings are

1609
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:38,000
just a way to communicate to some uh

1610
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,640
people who are just in the exactly in

1611
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,640
this technical

1612
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,520
part domain not best for communication

1613
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,400
to broader

1614
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,920
scientific audiences yep well

1615
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,000
kind of on that point and anyone can

1616
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,119
raise their hand i

1617
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:54,960
move the slide to the additional

1618
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,799
information where there's

1619
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:00,400
the code and um maybe just

1620
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,960
what would you say about the code what

1621
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,119
are the inputs or the outputs what would

1622
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,599
somebody

1623
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:08,720
need to run this code or like what could

1624
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:09,839
they do with it

1625
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:11,039
and it's really cool that you did

1626
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:12,960
provide all this information but to kind

1627
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,079
of bridge that

1628
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,240
gap that you just mentioned what does

1629
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,680
this function do or what do these

1630
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,399
different scripts do

1631
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,520
um yeah so

1632
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:27,359
essentially you first need spm 12

1633
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:29,920
is that contains the core functionality

1634
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,839
for um

1635
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:35,039
yeah that it's based on and then

1636
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:38,880
these scripts are like additional

1637
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:44,240
or like adaptations of scripts in spm-12

1638
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:48,319
and the only thing you need to do is run

1639
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:52,839
spm mdp pbx emo

1640
01:04:52,839 --> 01:04:56,319
app um

1641
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,920
so that stands for emotions factorized

1642
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,520
which is something i worked on at some

1643
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,000
point and

1644
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,400
but yeah in the in the rest of the

1645
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,839
so let me see

1646
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:15,280
sorry that's

1647
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,880
of course not enough to

1648
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,640
for you to

1649
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,359
and then you just get the model that we

1650
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:26,319
already have

1651
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:30,160
uh re-run generate

1652
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,720
here yeah the one that's on this uh

1653
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,400
slide before

1654
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,599
so this yeah this one yeah and the

1655
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:41,359
one above it

1656
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,079
so let me just it's not by now it's so

1657
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:49,039
long but i would have to

1658
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,720
um this is cool but um

1659
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,039
we're in the process of um what i would

1660
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:56,559
recommend actually in the future

1661
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:00,319
i mean i don't to be honest i don't like

1662
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,520
mob at all

1663
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,720
um the only reason i worked with it was

1664
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:05,280
that

1665
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,559
the existing spm

1666
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:12,000
and active influence modeling was

1667
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,559
part of the existing spm package

1668
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:19,680
but there's a lot of yeah

1669
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,000
important work has been done by alex

1670
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,760
chance and connor heinz

1671
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:28,559
and a few others and to

1672
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,720
transform everything to python and

1673
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,960
to do computational optimization while

1674
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:35,920
we're at it

1675
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,359
so there's this github page called

1676
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:40,480
interactively

1677
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:44,400
yep here we are on it pymdp

1678
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,760
infractively is the github repo

1679
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:52,720
yes so um instead of

1680
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,839
trying to get um

1681
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:57,760
trying to get motlop running on your pc

1682
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:58,960
i would recommend

1683
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,480
just working with five and then

1684
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:05,680
in the future um we'll have a module in

1685
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,480
there that

1686
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,720
can do the same as what we did in this

1687
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,520
paper

1688
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:13,599
um awesome so that's something i think

1689
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:17,039
is much more sustainable for the future

1690
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:20,240
we're working on integration with gpus

1691
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,640
etc

1692
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:26,079
to make things that can be simulated and

1693
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,799
scalable in scalable way can integrate

1694
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:31,680
with tensorflow so you can even

1695
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:35,119
do um kind of

1696
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,520
hybrid modeling with what they call

1697
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,640
amortized active inference it's like the

1698
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,839
learning models that are connected

1699
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:46,880
to components of these lego

1700
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:50,480
lego boxes that i was describing

1701
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,920
but if you want i can i mean i can run

1702
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:54,799
you through this

1703
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:57,680
mdp in motlock it's just that i'm not a

1704
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,200
fan of

1705
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,119
myself so it would be i think it would

1706
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:02,799
be a little bit of a yeah

1707
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:05,599
i think yep let's uh definitely have a

1708
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,599
model stream for the python because i

1709
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:08,799
know that will be something a lot of

1710
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:09,200
people

1711
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,839
are interested in because the matlab it

1712
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:12,640
has a

1713
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:15,760
certain charm to it but i can see how

1714
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,319
you might want to develop with other

1715
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:19,198
approaches

1716
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:21,759
even though when christopher and ryan

1717
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:23,279
walked us in the model stream through

1718
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:24,399
the code

1719
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:26,799
just seeing how the matrices multiply

1720
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:28,479
there's something nice about how it was

1721
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:28,880
done

1722
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,000
in matlab but it's not interfacing with

1723
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,679
all these modern

1724
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:35,359
tools like tensorflow that you mentioned

1725
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:36,839
so

1726
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:41,279
um yeah um anyway but

1727
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:46,319
uh let me see so

1728
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:50,479
i think we can yeah we can move on

1729
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:54,560
but uh i think what i should do

1730
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,640
basically based on your feedback is

1731
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,600
write um

1732
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,719
a little bit of an explanation of what

1733
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:02,080
to do with those codes

1734
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,759
if you want to run it let's say you do

1735
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:06,000
want to use mobile if you want to run it

1736
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,359
what you should do and that's actually

1737
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:10,080
useful

1738
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,359
feedback yeah

1739
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:15,520
the reason i added these codes was

1740
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,920
mostly for

1741
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,319
yeah reproducibility instead in case

1742
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:21,679
other technical

1743
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:24,799
folks want to look at what i did but

1744
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:27,679
and it's not really out of the box in a

1745
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,359
way that

1746
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:32,719
anybody not familiar with it

1747
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:36,319
could easily use it

1748
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:40,238
yep my advisor she would always say

1749
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:42,560
make it so that the anthropologists from

1750
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,238
mars will know what to do with that

1751
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:45,198
spreadsheet

1752
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:47,120
because even for people in the field or

1753
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,479
even yourself

1754
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:50,479
months later it's like wait what that

1755
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:52,960
was my research

1756
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,000
yeah yeah i mean the proper

1757
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,400
proper practice is to add like a how to

1758
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,360
like a

1759
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,880
read me page on the github

1760
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:08,960
it's in my mind the kind of

1761
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,960
transitioning away from what

1762
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:15,760
i kind of felt like but i do agree

1763
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,199
should round up that part of the

1764
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:19,360
documentation

1765
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,400
well yeah yeah um

1766
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,120
blue or steven uh either of you raise

1767
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,159
your hand

1768
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:29,600
um just just one point about

1769
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,239
the effective charge piece that you

1770
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:33,679
mentioned before

1771
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:36,320
can i just check is is that like an

1772
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,080
in-between

1773
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:41,280
um level between

1774
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:45,040
one inference layer and the next

1775
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,320
is it so that is that correct

1776
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,480
that's entirely correct once you go to

1777
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,660
figure um

1778
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:53,440
[Music]

1779
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:57,280
i think it's figure six

1780
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:00,719
um let me see here

1781
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:03,840
seven sorry yep

1782
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:08,480
so um essentially

1783
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:12,080
now we connect um

1784
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:15,840
what's happening in a higher level

1785
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:19,280
connected to inferences about

1786
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,960
our sort of predictions about what's

1787
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,640
happening on the lower level

1788
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,840
and that's when the effective charge

1789
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,440
basically becomes like

1790
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,000
an ascending message that informs the

1791
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,440
inferences

1792
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:34,640
um so

1793
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:38,159
there is an equation in the manuscript

1794
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:41,199
i don't see because it was a

1795
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:45,440
separate table oh this part

1796
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,320
we split figure seven yeah this is just

1797
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,159
this these are the prior so this like

1798
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:54,960
um doesn't describe the posterior

1799
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:55,840
beliefs

1800
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,679
the effective charge basically factors

1801
01:11:57,679 --> 01:11:59,760
yeah comes into

1802
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,040
yeah i i understand there's many figures

1803
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,400
in the paper

1804
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,679
you didn't include that one but if you

1805
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,000
go

1806
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,159
to

1807
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:16,680
it's in in multiple places

1808
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,159
[Music]

1809
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:21,280
essentially what we call effective

1810
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,600
evidence on page

1811
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,800
files page 420 but

1812
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:30,239
the actual page is 23 you know with pdf

1813
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:30,640
but

1814
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:34,080
okay um just for

1815
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,360
here we go yeah answer your question and

1816
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:41,120
yeah yeah so

1817
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,920
just to illustrate what's happening uh

1818
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,600
or to explain

1819
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:49,360
and in this paper use bars to

1820
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,640
illustr to indicate posterior beliefs

1821
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:56,159
so here the bar is on the left

1822
01:12:56,159 --> 01:13:00,000
the bark s is like posterior believes

1823
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,679
at time capital t so this is the

1824
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:07,920
cross trial time steps a large um

1825
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,080
yeah large yeah cross trial time

1826
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,040
essentially

1827
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,960
a subscript the superscript here is

1828
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,159
indicating the effect

1829
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:17,760
effective state so um

1830
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,760
state the posterior effective state on

1831
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:20,880
the higher level is

1832
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,880
a soft max function of um

1833
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,320
that consists of the prior

1834
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,679
belief which is the logarithm of

1835
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:34,400
the previous posterior from the previous

1836
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,320
time step

1837
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:39,440
multiplied by the transition matrix

1838
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:43,199
so that's the where the prior comes from

1839
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,480
and then this term that

1840
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,560
you see after that comes from what we

1841
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,159
call bayesian

1842
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:53,199
model reduction and it's what you need

1843
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:53,840
to what

1844
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,000
happens when you want to connect a

1845
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,679
discrete and continuous state space

1846
01:13:57,679 --> 01:13:58,480
modules

1847
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:02,080
and it drops again this term drops out

1848
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,360
of

1849
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,560
the derivations that you can do

1850
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:10,320
based on this um formalism

1851
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:13,600
bayesian model reduction and in this

1852
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,880
case this sort of free energy

1853
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,640
minimization

1854
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:21,360
assuming that changes are small enough

1855
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,640
locally are small enough to

1856
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:28,080
make this connection and then if you ask

1857
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,600
what's small enough well

1858
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,199
that's something you would have to test

1859
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:32,800
in in the world

1860
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:37,199
and see if this approximation holds and

1861
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:41,120
essentially what you see here

1862
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,679
is the effective charge coming back to

1863
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:44,800
haunt you so to speak

1864
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,280
but now as a message that this passed

1865
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,280
upwards

1866
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:52,560
so the higher level state

1867
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:56,000
is consists of

1868
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,920
two um kind of extremes and so the

1869
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:03,920
the extreme positive side so beta plus

1870
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:07,040
and the extreme negative side beta minus

1871
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:09,360
and at any point in time the organism is

1872
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,679
somewhere in between

1873
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:14,000
it's never extreme it's not it's never

1874
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:14,800
like

1875
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,600
at the exact extreme it's it's beliefs

1876
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,440
just like you can never have 100

1877
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,480
certainty about anything

1878
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:25,920
because down downwards in the

1879
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,719
hierarchy we make predictions that's

1880
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:31,360
where we do beijing mobile averaging

1881
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:35,120
and upwards you have to gather these

1882
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,719
messages so that's what i call

1883
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:39,840
effective techniques that's where we use

1884
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,960
bayesian model reduction

1885
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,040
yeah so that's essentially a very long

1886
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,760
answer to your question

1887
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:51,199
but yeah no thanks

1888
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:53,600
just just one other thing with that is

1889
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,040
this then gives a way

1890
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:59,120
for somatic kind of processes

1891
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,960
um you know in every day or even in

1892
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,880
trauma to be

1893
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,679
integrated in a way because it could be

1894
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:07,560
that

1895
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:11,040
non-cognitive processes could be at play

1896
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,679
in adjusting this effective charge or

1897
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:15,600
keeping a score of that

1898
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,560
um and then that could then be that

1899
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,400
could give a way for that to influence

1900
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,280
perception

1901
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:25,360
or action model selection

1902
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,840
yes and and this high-level state is not

1903
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,199
constrained in any way

1904
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:31,840
in terms of what you you can add other

1905
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,480
types of evidence from other

1906
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,920
action models and other

1907
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,480
components of your system can add their

1908
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:41,920
own effective charge

1909
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:45,280
so um that's at some point in the

1910
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,960
beginning we mentioned this affected

1911
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,440
workspace theory

1912
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,839
so like

1913
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,080
we call this effective charge because

1914
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,000
it's essentially a pretty domain in

1915
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:56,560
general

1916
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,400
it can be gathered from any kind of

1917
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,719
action model it can also be used to

1918
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:02,080
model the way

1919
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:05,040
and when you're listening to music your

1920
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,000
attentional

1921
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,880
action model has is kind of being played

1922
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:09,760
around with

1923
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,199
and with congruence and this congruence

1924
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:16,480
and you can kind of um

1925
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,520
create mismatches and matches

1926
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,360
and you can create fluency

1927
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:26,560
and this this fluency and this will

1928
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,320
create some kind of effective

1929
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:31,199
rollercoaster so to speak so these ups

1930
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:31,920
and downs

1931
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:35,120
um can be gathered from an

1932
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,199
action model that would be guiding your

1933
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:38,159
attention

1934
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:41,520
states um so

1935
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,920
the question of what to attend to when

1936
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:47,440
you're listening to a piece of music

1937
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:51,199
could be something that generates

1938
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:52,640
effective

1939
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:55,360
effective charge and then informs your

1940
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,239
balance state

1941
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:00,310
it can also be purely associative so

1942
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:01,760
[Music]

1943
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,320
um it doesn't exclude purely associative

1944
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,920
types of valence

1945
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,800
so there can be certain things and that

1946
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,120
comes back in the contextual evidence if

1947
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,199
you go a little bit down

1948
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:16,239
anymore i think it's here

1949
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:19,520
oh yeah oh yeah yeah

1950
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:22,640
so you can also gather evidence from

1951
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,000
in this case we just talked about

1952
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,920
contextual states in terms of whether

1953
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:27,600
the food is on the left or on the right

1954
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,800
but um you can also have contextual

1955
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,560
evidence

1956
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,159
being passed back up and

1957
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:38,880
that can generate some kind of top

1958
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,800
poplopian learning

1959
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,880
where you just learn to associate

1960
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,239
particular contexts

1961
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:46,640
with particular positive states or

1962
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,360
negative states

1963
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:52,400
so there's also space to include these

1964
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:55,600
kind of um what i think

1965
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,440
are computationally a little bit less

1966
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,640
interesting

1967
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:02,560
types of valence uh paleons experience

1968
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,400
because they're just kind of happy and

1969
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,600
learning in a sense

1970
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,520
and but it doesn't make them less

1971
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:08,640
important for

1972
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:12,239
um or experience so these

1973
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:16,239
purely associative

1974
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:19,360
relationships also come actually we

1975
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:20,080
discussed that

1976
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:23,920
in the there's in the discussion section

1977
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:30,159
see how far we get nice

1978
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:34,560
i wanted to ask actually about figure 10

1979
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,440
what were you showing in figure 10 or

1980
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,480
how could we read this

1981
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:44,000
and does it apply to your model only or

1982
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,520
future models

1983
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:49,040
other categories of models

1984
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:52,560
and everything that's happening here

1985
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,640
from the orange

1986
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:57,360
orange level downwards let's say is is

1987
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:00,159
what we implemented

1988
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:02,640
but everything that's in the grade is

1989
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:06,159
basically something we presupposed

1990
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:09,840
so we presupposed for example that this

1991
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,239
rat already learns how to how the mace

1992
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:14,559
works

1993
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:16,880
and we presuppose that they have some

1994
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,560
perceptual capacity

1995
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,600
or instance some action control over

1996
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,000
let's say where their body is you know

1997
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,199
like

1998
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:29,280
um so

1999
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:30,960
all the things that we needed to

2000
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,199
presuppose in order to actually do

2001
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:36,560
the simulation demonstration or uh

2002
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:39,920
yeah are in kind of the great great part

2003
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:40,880
of this um

2004
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:45,040
box um but the nice thing is that once

2005
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:48,320
you so what if you follow the arrows

2006
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:51,840
um these gray parts so evolution

2007
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:52,719
development

2008
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:55,920
and learning are it's also

2009
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,480
comported in terms of time skills right

2010
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,120
so

2011
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,400
um and the nice thing is that it's

2012
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,679
always a circular

2013
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:07,600
story so you get um

2014
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,520
these different nested time skills that

2015
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:10,719
are all

2016
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:14,239
influencing each other recursively

2017
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:16,560
and once you get down to our actual

2018
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,840
computational experiment

2019
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,639
you you are at the point in time where

2020
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:23,199
and you

2021
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:26,000
enter basically yeah on the left this

2022
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
grey arrow that points into the affected

2023
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,199
box it's kind of yeah you can think of

2024
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:32,719
that as

2025
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:36,320
the one that initializes the simulation

2026
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,880
so to speak so this gray arrow is what

2027
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:39,760
initialized

2028
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,760
everything that allowed us to even

2029
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:42,960
simulate

2030
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:47,199
it and then we explore the dynamics

2031
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:49,199
of what happens within that and all the

2032
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:50,320
other arrows

2033
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:53,520
are basically illustrating that so

2034
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,560
the orange arrows provide

2035
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:59,040
priors for the precision for the action

2036
01:21:59,040 --> 01:21:59,679
model

2037
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:02,800
for the perceptual state so that's all

2038
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,430
the orange arrows

2039
01:22:04,430 --> 01:22:06,719
[Music]

2040
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:09,600
then from the meta minimal according to

2041
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:10,639
cognition level

2042
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:14,400
again there's this arrow pointing down

2043
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:19,120
to perform action jointly

2044
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:23,760
the effects end up informing perception

2045
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,840
and then it kind of passes through in

2046
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,520
the way that you described also last

2047
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:27,840
time

2048
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:31,120
in the last session and that's where it

2049
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,640
kind of connects to the world

2050
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:35,040
[Music]

2051
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:38,400
and then it passes back up again

2052
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,560
and that's where this kind of perceptual

2053
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,920
integration

2054
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,560
happens and it trickles upwards into all

2055
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:47,199
these layers

2056
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,600
we could have simulated learning as well

2057
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,960
so that's where

2058
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,239
this orange arrow puts points back up on

2059
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:55,120
the right

2060
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:58,159
to the posterior phenotype

2061
01:22:58,159 --> 01:22:59,679
we didn't simulate learning because it

2062
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:02,960
wasn't the focus of the paper

2063
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,840
but we have yeah we have the machinery

2064
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:07,760
it's in our lego box

2065
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:11,679
to add that um and that

2066
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:14,159
actually i think will make the story

2067
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:16,880
much even more interesting because

2068
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:20,400
then you can think about um

2069
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:23,440
active learning and how that influences

2070
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:24,639
affective states

2071
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:28,159
so how people can enjoy learning just

2072
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:31,199
for the sake of learning

2073
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,560
or how they can learn to associate

2074
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:38,639
affective states and contextual states

2075
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,480
and how that time recursively yeah

2076
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:45,600
influences their their system there's

2077
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,920
one simulation that i've been

2078
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:51,120
preparing where we

2079
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,440
have a setup like this and we actually

2080
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:55,440
simulated the

2081
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,199
yeah the development and learning as

2082
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:59,280
well

2083
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:02,000
and the idea there is that you have a

2084
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,400
child you kind of simulate the child

2085
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:07,440
and it has this um hyper parameters

2086
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,360
that influence different parts of its

2087
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,199
lower level model

2088
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:12,480
but in the beginning these hyper

2089
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,320
parameters are very unstable

2090
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,480
and then there is a kind of parent

2091
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,840
simulated parent

2092
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:21,199
that labels the states like

2093
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:24,880
um like basically kind of reflecting

2094
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:28,159
um and giving the system

2095
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:31,199
labels to work with

2096
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:34,159
and in the end what's the idea here is

2097
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:35,840
that the labels

2098
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:40,560
end up stabilizing the inferences

2099
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,400
and this kind of to simulate the idea

2100
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:43,679
that

2101
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:46,080
as we know that social interaction is

2102
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,639
crucial to develop any kind of emotional

2103
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:52,560
control emotional self-control and

2104
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,159
so there's these famous stories right

2105
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:56,080
about children growing up with

2106
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,239
involved something like that and then

2107
01:24:58,239 --> 01:25:00,000
never really reach a level where

2108
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,520
they can exert this

2109
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,560
um type of

2110
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:11,600
self self control and reflected

2111
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,639
that's the communicative capacity

2112
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:18,000
that we have anyway so that's another

2113
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,040
tangent

2114
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:22,480
very very interesting one yes

2115
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,960
very interesting stephen and then anyone

2116
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:27,840
else with a question

2117
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:29,920
and and in this diagram you mentioned so

2118
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,760
you mentioned minimal metacognition and

2119
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:32,320
then you've got

2120
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:35,120
effect and context um so would that

2121
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:38,080
minimal metacognition be

2122
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:41,600
a sort of phenomenological consciousness

2123
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:42,719
the kind of

2124
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:45,920
the the the the the awareness that you

2125
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:48,400
can't necessarily take a perspective on

2126
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,639
and and it goes up into affect and

2127
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:52,080
context

2128
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,239
and that's where it's consolidated

2129
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:56,400
enough to be able to

2130
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,480
sort of take a perspective on it would

2131
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:01,920
that be correct or

2132
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,880
and that's how i do tend to view it to

2133
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,840
some extent i mean

2134
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:10,880
um the actual representation

2135
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:14,639
of these precisions um is often

2136
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:17,920
uh assumed or hypothesized to

2137
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,840
be to occur in in a localized fashion in

2138
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:24,000
the brain to some extent

2139
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,360
in this trade and that's that's just a

2140
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:29,280
hypothesis that can be tested

2141
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,600
and it's actually an interesting part

2142
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:32,719
and that

2143
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:34,719
other systems other biological systems

2144
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:36,639
can have entirely different kinds of

2145
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:38,480
representations for this kind of

2146
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,679
this precision term so

2147
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:44,000
daniel works with ants colonies they

2148
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:44,960
might have their own

2149
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:48,239
way of encoding this type of

2150
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:51,040
reliance on action mode and that maybe

2151
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:52,480
has to do with weather conditions or

2152
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:53,600
something like that there can be some

2153
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,040
kind of shared

2154
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:58,080
very minimal way of

2155
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,679
encoding that reliance

2156
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:05,280
it doesn't

2157
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,440
it doesn't necessarily it's not in that

2158
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,120
sense pretty agnostic on how it's

2159
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,400
represented

2160
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:13,199
and you can just test hypotheses and how

2161
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:15,678
it works

2162
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:19,520
and also um it's really interesting how

2163
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:20,639
we can draw out

2164
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:23,600
that link to qualitative concepts or to

2165
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,280
phenomenological experience but

2166
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,360
that's not part of this model this is a

2167
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,480
claim about

2168
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,480
a modeling architecture that lends

2169
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,000
itself to certain

2170
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,560
kinds of calculations that maybe

2171
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,159
previously would have fallen within the

2172
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:37,120
domain of

2173
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:39,360
information theory or just control

2174
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:40,800
theory or cybernetics

2175
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,880
or just bayesian inference or just

2176
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,880
multi-scale systems modeling

2177
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:47,120
and i know that those are some of the

2178
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,880
areas that you've drawn on

2179
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,800
in your work casper which is why you

2180
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,239
could kind of see that there was kind of

2181
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:52,960
like

2182
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,840
one two three but not four five six for

2183
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:56,480
where the

2184
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:59,280
active inference model was going because

2185
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:00,000
you even

2186
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,480
discussed how before some of your recent

2187
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:03,360
papers

2188
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:05,040
the active inference model had less

2189
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,880
temporal depth and less

2190
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:10,480
metacognitive depth so it's just

2191
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,960
really cool to hear about how it kind of

2192
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,480
remaps

2193
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,719
where the questions and the modeling

2194
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:18,000
approaches fit in

2195
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,920
with respect to maybe previous

2196
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,520
disciplinary approaches

2197
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,360
so dean and then anyone else with a

2198
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:25,679
question

2199
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:29,840
oh you're meter dean

2200
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:34,080
yep um so because you've got that

2201
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,480
the time flow from left to right and

2202
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:37,360
that's pretty much

2203
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:40,480
consistent and you've got the parabolic

2204
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:43,440
introduced from top down and then back

2205
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:44,639
up

2206
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:48,320
can you see casper the the idea that

2207
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:51,199
around perception around action around

2208
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:53,520
minimal metacognition and around effect

2209
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:54,560
and context

2210
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:58,719
there could be a counterclockwise spin

2211
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:01,440
um because i actually saw that in the

2212
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,239
way that

2213
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:05,199
people were working not even aware of

2214
01:29:05,199 --> 01:29:06,480
this model

2215
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,639
but that that's kind of the direction

2216
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:10,239
where you've got the

2217
01:29:10,239 --> 01:29:12,400
flow across the bottom and then the

2218
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,159
introduction of the parabola

2219
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:16,560
from top down and then back up and

2220
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:17,679
that's where you could get

2221
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:21,520
actually get people looking through

2222
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,199
both directions that's why you have the

2223
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:24,719
effect of valence

2224
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:26,560
that's part of where the charge came

2225
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,719
from

2226
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:31,840
or am i sort of confusing

2227
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,520
the matters because i when i looked at

2228
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:37,440
that figure i actually saw how people

2229
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:40,960
in that flow state were able

2230
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,719
what direction the spin was actually

2231
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:44,320
going around

2232
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:48,000
the middle the middle of your um

2233
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,560
the middle of your of your figure

2234
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,520
yeah i mean this figure is is more like

2235
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:56,560
yeah it's not

2236
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,320
it kind of moves away from the very

2237
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,560
precise um mathematical

2238
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:04,320
meaning of the other graphs right that

2239
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,560
direct exactly progress but it's a

2240
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,239
little bit of the same ideas here

2241
01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:10,800
like you said um in that sense it

2242
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,239
doesn't really matter

2243
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:15,280
where they're moving

2244
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:19,920
i mean the reason that i put the upwards

2245
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,600
arrows on the right is that

2246
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:25,280
in temporal sense um

2247
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:30,000
it's it's representing the posteriors

2248
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,760
right so you're moving from the prior to

2249
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,520
the posterior

2250
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:36,560
but then if you would um because it's

2251
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:37,440
nested

2252
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:40,159
every next level means that you already

2253
01:30:40,159 --> 01:30:41,199
cycled

2254
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:44,639
from basically yesterday's posterior is

2255
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:46,159
tomorrow's prior earth

2256
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:48,480
like yesterday's for serious two days

2257
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:49,199
prior in

2258
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:52,400
some way right so um

2259
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:55,679
the capacity to integrate to the next

2260
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:58,400
iteration

2261
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:03,440
can also be itself a problem

2262
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,040
so you see that a lot with people with

2263
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:06,560
traumas

2264
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,840
that actually integrate an experience

2265
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:14,080
too strongly in the way they work

2266
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:15,600
and this actually comes to very

2267
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:16,960
interesting questions where it's like

2268
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,960
functional forgetting

2269
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:22,320
something like a lot of

2270
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,239
maybe a lot of these meditative

2271
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:25,920
practices actually

2272
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:28,239
are able to do it's like help us forget

2273
01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:30,400
the relative the irrelevant bits or

2274
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,719
the things that we shouldn't take to the

2275
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:33,760
next iteration

2276
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:36,000
right

2277
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,960
the counterclockwise spin is just

2278
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,800
essentially

2279
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:45,679
making it expressing reflection and so

2280
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:47,360
sometimes you choose to reflect on

2281
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:48,000
something

2282
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,080
sometimes you over reflect on it which

2283
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:51,760
is what you're describing but

2284
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:53,679
all i'm saying is is that when i saw

2285
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:54,960
this it was

2286
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:58,800
it was just more confirmation of yeah

2287
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:01,920
i think it's i think it's correct

2288
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,639
that's not just one yeah it's a nice

2289
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:05,120
idea

2290
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:08,560
and how it's uh i mean the reflection

2291
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:09,199
part

2292
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:12,880
and kind of becoming aware

2293
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:16,080
of the things that you want to

2294
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:19,280
so how you want to learn basically

2295
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:22,320
um it's something that we

2296
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:26,400
we did try to capture in

2297
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,159
and it gets very interesting you start

2298
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:29,920
to be able to simulate processes like

2299
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,280
meditation

2300
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:32,960
and what's happening in the mind when

2301
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:35,040
you develop

2302
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:37,120
control on these attentional processes

2303
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,320
on a higher level

2304
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:41,920
um anyway but i think stephen wants to

2305
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:42,560
say that

2306
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:46,239
yep yep just even go for it yeah just

2307
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:48,080
following on from that and this this

2308
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,000
what's interesting is how this brings in

2309
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:50,800
this idea of

2310
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:54,960
effective representation and how we

2311
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:56,639
think of representation normally as

2312
01:32:56,639 --> 01:32:58,960
something as a thing

2313
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,600
in the head as opposed to maybe objects

2314
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,440
in the niche which we

2315
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:06,639
act on or create or interact with and

2316
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:10,960
now you've got an idea in st

2317
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:14,639
of st2 i suppose of this kind of

2318
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:17,520
what could be stored in an accessible

2319
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:18,560
form

2320
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,159
where the prior phenotype may not be

2321
01:33:20,159 --> 01:33:22,320
entirely accessible except

2322
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:25,120
through science you know is is this

2323
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:27,360
effective representation i just wondered

2324
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,440
how you see because we've had quite a

2325
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:30,800
lot of conversations about this

2326
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:33,760
is what what do you see representation

2327
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:34,400
being

2328
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,159
in all of this all the possibility for

2329
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:40,320
active inference and representation

2330
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,760
yeah so um what i like about this

2331
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,199
approach is that

2332
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:50,719
we basically don't have to um pin down

2333
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:52,159
exactly

2334
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:55,519
and what the effective

2335
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:58,719
state means as long as we we're just

2336
01:33:58,719 --> 01:33:59,280
figuring

2337
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:01,440
trying to figure out what it is yeah how

2338
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,040
it can be purged

2339
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:07,120
or an organ and the organism can use

2340
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:08,080
very limited

2341
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:11,280
cues to infer that and then you have

2342
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,040
like a whole kind of

2343
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:15,519
organic

2344
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:18,400
state of the system that that will

2345
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:20,239
correlate with that inference

2346
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:23,040
to some extent but just as the organism

2347
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:25,120
is doing is doing that internally

2348
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:28,639
um and usually we think about this in

2349
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:31,840
terms of animals but

2350
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,840
it's interesting to think about more

2351
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:37,760
abstract types of representation

2352
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,040
and three just in the end the

2353
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:41,600
statistical concept

2354
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:45,280
so i

2355
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,119
work with models where you add a layer

2356
01:34:47,119 --> 01:34:48,719
on top of this effective

2357
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:51,679
contextual layer so like here just in

2358
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:53,920
terms of um

2359
01:34:53,920 --> 01:35:00,400
to link it back to verbal expressions

2360
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:03,760
and if you ask me

2361
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:06,400
what does the representation mean in

2362
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,199
this case

2363
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:10,239
it just has a very specific

2364
01:35:10,239 --> 01:35:13,440
computational effect on how

2365
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,119
you can think of it as a generative

model generative models

2367
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:19,440
so each effective state will be

2368
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:20,719
correspondent with

2369

2371
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:30,560
all the way down to the lowest level

2372
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,380
the model doesn't have to

details

2376
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:40,239
as long as you know how let's say the

2377
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:43,360
connections from each um in each

2378

level happen

2379
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:49,040
the rest becomes like an emergent hole

2380
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,320
and i think

2381
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,480
i've tried to be sensitive of the way in

2382
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,718
which

2383
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:59,040
the internal representations

2384
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:02,080
can be are not necessarily the same as

2385
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,080
the actual effective state

2386
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:05,610

papers

2404
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,119
i guess i don't really have a very

2405
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:46,400
concrete answer because these

2406
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:47,360
representations

2407
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:51,520
are are meant to be abstract

2408
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:54,560
until you start to model their them in

2409
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:57,600
specific context

2410
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:03,119
and i think oh yeah you want to

2411
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:05,840
yeah now i think that that that makes a

2412
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,440
lot of sense and also

2413
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:10,800
if our represents if

2414
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,719
what i see as being a representation or

2415
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:14,159
models that we

2416
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:16,000
people think is in people's heads are

2417
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,800
actually always something in the niche

2418
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:21,440
that we work with so to speak so what we

2419
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:22,000
know

2420
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,239
is the action model for how to act and

2421
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:25,520
perceive

2422
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:28,639
to recapitulate it just feels like we

2423
01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:30,880
have that also in the brain but if it's

2424
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:33,199
actually

2425
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:35,360
to some extent this would be the most

2426
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:36,239
concrete model

2427
01:37:36,239 --> 01:37:40,400
is the emotional imprint that helps

2428
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:44,320
then undertake the interaction with

2429
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,719
the models that we work with but those

2430
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:48,480
models don't need to be in the brain in

2431
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:48,960
that

2432
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,040
representational form but you might need

2433
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,280
some affective

2434
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:56,880
code isn't it possible to know how to

2435
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:58,159
and that ties in a lot with some of the

2436
01:37:58,159 --> 01:38:00,159
work with micro phenomenology

2437
01:38:00,159 --> 01:38:02,960
and some of the work with um working

2438
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:03,920
with mental space

2439
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:07,360
psychology so it's quite interesting um

2440
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:11,520
yeah yeah so um thanks for this

2441
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,760
yeah i mean um what motivated me

2442
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,280
actually to move in this direction is

2443
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:16,719
something that's not really included in

2444
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:18,239
the figure that much here

2445
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:19,840
that's super important it's the social

2446
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:22,400
dimension

2447
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,000
and then once you think of this

2448
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,320
effective state

2449
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,480
like kind of internal representations

2450
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,480
that are inferred on any number of

2451
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:31,199
queues

2452
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:34,239
and any number of

2453
01:38:34,239 --> 01:38:38,800
arbitrary number of sources of data

2454
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,960
you can also think of the facial

2455
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:42,960
expressions of micron specifics

2456
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:46,159
as being informative my effectively you

2457
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:46,719
start

2458
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:48,880
having a very natural way of modeling

2459
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:51,920
things like contagion

2460
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:54,800
and just in general this kind of

2461
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,480
empathic responses

2462
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:59,920
and where if you're also

2463
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:03,119
kind of tracking the group

2464
01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:06,320
effect and that has

2465
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:10,840
places priors on your in your individual

2466
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:13,920
experience basically have a very natural

2467
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:14,800
way of moving

2468
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:18,400
from the connecting kind of the bodily

2469
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,880
uh interaction with the world in the

2470
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:21,600
niche as you

2471
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:24,080
described to this abstract social

2472
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:25,600
relations that we're tracking

2473
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:28,080
all the time

2474
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,719
so i'm involved in a project right now

2475
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:36,080
that's um

2476
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:38,320
forging like primate foraging and it's

2477
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:40,400
really interesting to think about

2478
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,880
the group dynamic versus like seeking

2479
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,239
out your own

2480
01:39:44,239 --> 01:39:46,159
epistemic knowledge right so this is

2481
01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:47,600
just foraging and it's you know

2482
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:49,920
agent-based modeling project

2483
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,639
but i i wonder to what extent like

2484
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:53,600
instead of

2485
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:55,600
knowing which trees have fruit for

2486
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,600
example like if i could just

2487
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:59,920
follow a group member right like so i

2488
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:01,520
wonder you know i mean just what you had

2489
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:03,360
said about the social dynamic

2490
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:05,440
is this kind of interchangeable like

2491
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:06,880
just following the group like i mean

2492
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:08,000
we're modeling contagion

2493
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,320
and so forth so following the group is

2494
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:11,920
that like interchangeable

2495
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:15,199
for um you know epistemic knowledge

2496
01:40:15,199 --> 01:40:19,199
really um

2497
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:21,600
so there's there's different things you

2498
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:22,480
can do i mean

2499
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:24,400
one one of the ways you could factor

2500
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:26,080
that in here it's like

2501
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:28,719
where um something that has been worked

2502
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:30,159
out in the active influence communities

2503
01:40:30,159 --> 01:40:32,639
in terms of beyonce queues

2504
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:34,960
basically queues that other specifics

2505
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:35,679
give you

2506
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:39,520
to kind of indicate what context you are

2507
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,440
and then your action model specifying

2508
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,040
for this particular context

2509
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:46,560
what is the appropriate action

2510
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:50,080
so a very simple

2511
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:53,199
thing can be like in uh

2512
01:40:53,199 --> 01:40:54,719
whether you are in a context where

2513
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:56,800
you're following another

2514
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:59,840
specific or not it can be something that

2515
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:02,159
i think bees have their kind of dance

2516
01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:03,040
that they do

2517
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:05,199
to indicate whether other bees should be

2518
01:41:05,199 --> 01:41:06,080
following them

2519
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:08,080
so there's like a kind of way in which

2520
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:10,719
these levels can talk to each other

2521
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:13,280
through signaling basically the

2522
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:14,320
appropriate

2523
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,800
what the context is and then from that

2524
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:18,719
inference about the context you can have

2525
01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:19,600
the whole

2526
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:22,800
action model kind of rolling out on the

2527
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:25,360
lower level

2528
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,320
and i think the following the behavior

2529
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,080
that you described

2530
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:35,280
does have a pretty direct um analogy to

2531
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,840
our innate tendency to

2532
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:43,440
um synchronize objective states

2533
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:47,040
with our specifics

2534
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:50,080
even with not non yeah even with

2535
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:51,520
other animals that's actually pretty

2536
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,920
interesting

2537
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:57,520
something that we that other animals

2538
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:01,440
also seem to be able to do to pick up on

2539
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:06,879
nervousness across species right so

2540
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:10,560
stress markers of stress we seem to be

2541
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:13,520
able to kind of pick up on those

2542
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:18,560
kind of cross cross species

2543
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:21,600
generalized fashion

2544
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:27,760
it's like endless number of we can go

2545
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:29,119
down

2546
01:42:29,119 --> 01:42:30,560
here's here's one more little rabbit

2547
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:32,480
hole looking at this figure

2548
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:34,880
it reminded me of concurrent programming

2549
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:35,920
languages

2550
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:38,320
like golang and the idea of having

2551
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:39,040
nested

2552
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:41,679
processes that were defined by

2553
01:42:41,679 --> 01:42:42,880
interfaces

2554
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:45,280
so we've been talking a lot on the

2555
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:46,320
interfaces

2556
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:49,199
as markov blankets or holograms with

2557
01:42:49,199 --> 01:42:50,639
crisp fields but

2558
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:54,000
interfaces are also programming patterns

2559
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,280
that make nested processes that can be

2560
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,920
effective or tractable or run on

2561
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,760
distributed computation without

2562
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:05,040
halting or spiraling out so uh

2563
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:06,800
in addition to the python potentially

2564
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,080
there could be something like

2565
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:11,199
a concurrent implementation and then it

2566
01:43:11,199 --> 01:43:12,320
relates to this question about

2567
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:13,280
representation

2568
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:15,679
like is the representation a static

2569
01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:17,040
object

2570
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:20,480
is it a dynamic process and uh

2571
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:22,159
i don't know what the formal answer is

2572
01:43:22,159 --> 01:43:24,560
but it reminds me of what we did talk

2573
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:25,840
about with chris fields

2574
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:28,480
with the types as processes and the two

2575
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:29,520
spaces

2576
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:32,080
so maybe by defining these interfaces

2577
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:33,440
with the right

2578
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:35,679
dimensionality or bandwidth or structure

2579
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:38,000
however the screens are defined

2580
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,639
then there will potentially be model

2581
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:41,600
ability

2582
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:44,400
not philosophical clarity on whether oh

2583
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:46,239
is the group is the party conscious or

2584
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:48,080
the person or the part of the brain

2585
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:50,000
it's like the ant question those are

2586
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,360
gonna be potentially

2587
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:54,239
perennial debates but the model ability

2588
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:56,880
of the ant colony evacuation

2589
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,639
is going to be more akin to the model

2590
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:00,560
ability of these other higher level

2591
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:03,600
processes because of how

2592
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:06,239
abstractly but also excessively defined

2593
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:08,400
the interfaces are

2594
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:10,960
yeah i think in a similar way the way i

2595
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:11,600
see

2596
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:13,360
these representations i'm kind of

2597
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:14,719
playing with just thinking of them

2598
01:44:14,719 --> 01:44:15,440
entirely

2599
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:19,440
as implicit and just just descriptions

2600
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:20,159
of

2601
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:23,440
um of something that

2602
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:26,480
implicitly occurs

2603
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:28,320
in the system basically like a kind of

2604
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:29,600
tool essentially

2605
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:33,840
um and if you make it explicit it

2606
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,840
yeah it ends up being amenable to

2607
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,280
modeling

2608
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:39,840
doesn't mean that there's ever this kind

2609
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:42,639
of explicit representation in the system

2610
01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:46,080
actually and all we're doing is making

2611
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:48,080
these things explicit so we

2612
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:51,520
can actually compute things

2613
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:53,199
i'm pretty happy with being agnostic

2614
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:54,800
about whether

2615
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:58,320
there's anything and i pretty

2616
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:00,880
uh i have no doubt in the fight of

2617
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:02,159
representationalism

2618
01:45:02,159 --> 01:45:05,040
versus um like an activism i think

2619
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:06,239
they're

2620
01:45:06,239 --> 01:45:08,719
they're both pretty i mean they both

2621
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:09,360
have

2622
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:12,560
points and i'm pretty happy with the

2623
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:15,360
models being agnostic on this

2624
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:19,199
question because cool models now speak

2625
01:45:19,199 --> 01:45:21,679
for themselves in the end

2626
01:45:21,679 --> 01:45:23,520
cool it's almost like you're putting up

2627
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,040
your code and your model

2628
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:27,280
as in evidence and if they want to

2629
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:28,639
prosecute the case

2630
01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:31,040
if they want to have their debate and

2631
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:32,719
debate whether your evidence

2632
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:34,560
is supporting their notion or this

2633
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,239
notion or some future notion

2634
01:45:36,239 --> 01:45:38,400
it's a second level question and the

2635
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,719
first level is actually what you're just

2636
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:41,760
laying out here

2637
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,920
and how the variables are linked to each

2638
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:45,679
other and then there's alternate

2639
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:48,320
architectures that are possible yeah

2640
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:48,800
every

2641
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:51,040
every model is in that sense um just a

2642
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:52,880
very elaborate hypothesis

2643
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:55,920
and you can just test it

2644
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:59,360
and like doing empirical work

2645
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:05,440
yep and then every architecture has uh

2646
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:08,639
yeah that has a can be compared to each

2647
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:09,199
other

2648
01:46:09,199 --> 01:46:12,320
once you have um

2649
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:14,880
and to do that you need to go explicit

2650
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:18,719
and that's the only part i think where

2651
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:26,480
we're doing being rejected

2652
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:30,080
to make it uh to get a computational

2653
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:30,719
grip

2654
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:34,800
on it's a scientific grip you could say

2655
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:39,600
actually i i have been working on

2656
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:43,440
getting more observational

2657
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:45,840
constraints in these types of needs but

2658
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:46,639
there's such

2659
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:49,840
an amazing

2660
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:53,199
richness of things to explore by just

2661
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:56,400
even just capturing the phenomenology of

2662
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:57,119
our

2663
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:59,280
that we already have accessible for in

2664
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:01,450
the first person

2665
01:47:01,450 --> 01:47:04,480
[Music]

2666
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:07,199
that's often you can already get very

2667
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:07,679
far

2668
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:10,560
by just making sure that whatever your

2669
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:11,920
model is going to be

2670
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:15,199
it has to be able to

2671
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:21,199
recapitulate our lift experience

2672
01:47:21,199 --> 01:47:24,638
that we have directly accessible

2673
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:27,360
it's actually one of the more recent

2674
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,040
paper that i could share is

2675
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:31,199
from generative models to generated

2676
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:32,480
passages

2677
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:36,159
i don't know you are familiar with

2678
01:47:36,159 --> 01:47:41,280
this kind of work by varela

2679
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:47,199
if i can ask one question on this figure

2680
01:47:47,199 --> 01:47:49,040
casper so

2681
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:51,600
you mentioned that models are hypotheses

2682
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:53,280
which might be really interesting to

2683
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:54,639
people because they might think about

2684
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:56,880
the model as generating hypotheses which

2685
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:58,080
it also can do

2686
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:59,600
but actually you're talking about how

2687
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:01,440
the architecture and the way that the

2688
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:02,800
variables are connected

2689
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:05,679
is itself not some authoritative claim

2690
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:06,480
or final

2691
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:08,639
uh description of the system but it's a

2692
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:09,760
hypothesis

2693
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:12,159
so it makes me wonder if somebody says

2694
01:48:12,159 --> 01:48:13,600
well i think that there's you know

2695
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,600
letter um you know insert your favorite

2696
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:17,280
letter here and i want to hook it up to

2697
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:17,760
e

2698
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:20,320
i want e to be influenced by a new

2699
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:21,119
letter

2700
01:48:21,119 --> 01:48:24,159
r or something like that is that

2701
01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:27,280
going to um keep

2702
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:29,760
this nice mathematical tractability are

2703
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:31,199
there certain kinds of wires that if you

2704
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:32,159
cross them

2705
01:48:32,159 --> 01:48:34,880
just the script is going to die is there

2706
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:35,520
certain

2707
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:37,040
pieces where we know that we can build

2708
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:39,280
the legos really well or are there

2709
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:42,000
just how do we know which pieces can be

2710
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,040
tinkered with

2711
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:44,719
and what structural changes could even

2712
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:46,159
be done or is it like all

2713
01:48:46,159 --> 01:48:49,040
all by all

2714
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:54,320
um well one of the constraints

2715
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:58,080
is this basically the way it works

2716
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:00,800
is that you can have only local

2717
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:03,440
interactions

2718
01:49:04,159 --> 01:49:08,639
and that's the markov blanket

2719
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:12,400
so in the end the way it's kind of

2720
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:17,040
kept at least close to biological

2721
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:21,040
plausibility is by assuring that

2722
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:25,520
a certain thing that you only specify um

2723
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:28,880
local interactions between variables

2724
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:32,000
and that's what these errors do

2725
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,280
so one kind of

2726
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:39,119
forbidden thing to do would be to

2727
01:49:39,119 --> 01:49:40,159
connect

2728
01:49:40,159 --> 01:49:42,639
this policy variable directly to the

2729
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:44,639
observations

2730
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:47,040
because then you're breaking the market

2731
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,560
as the policies are

2732
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:51,199
directing in this case the relations

2733
01:49:51,199 --> 01:49:52,800
between hidden states

2734
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:56,000
and the hidden states are generating

2735
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,599
or like based on the hidden states

2736
01:49:57,599 --> 01:49:59,440
you're generating observations

2737
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:03,839
predictions about them um

2738
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,599
so there are certain kind of forbidden

2739
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:08,840
things in these directed basically

2740
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:11,760
graphs that being said

2741
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:16,239
it's pretty universally i mean

2742
01:50:16,239 --> 01:50:17,920
as i said whenever there's an arrow it

2743
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:20,000
actually implies bi-directional

2744
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,639
interaction and you're completely free

2745
01:50:22,639 --> 01:50:24,000
to add a

2746
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,280
higher level state that modulates your e

2747
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:30,639
matrix so the

2748
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:32,320
yeah the sky is the limit so to speak i

2749
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:34,159
mean in the end

2750
01:50:34,159 --> 01:50:38,080
you should be able as long as you keep

2751
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:42,000
this markov blanket structure intact

2752
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:44,000
so you ensure that it's biologically

2753
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,470
possible what you're doing

2754
01:50:46,470 --> 01:50:48,239
[Music]

2755
01:50:48,239 --> 01:50:50,800
then you can do yeah you can make any

2756
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:52,400
number of states connect to each other

2757
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:52,800
and

2758
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:55,199
if there's like redundancy in your model

2759
01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:56,239
that should show up

2760
01:50:56,239 --> 01:50:58,000
because the free energy can be

2761
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,400
decomposed as accuracy

2762
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:04,159
minus sorry complexity minus accuracy

2763
01:51:04,159 --> 01:51:07,679
so any increase any increase in the

2764
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:09,199
number of states in your model

2765
01:51:09,199 --> 01:51:12,719
will result in increasing uh increase in

2766
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:14,400
uncertainty about

2767
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:17,199
the parameters

2768
01:51:18,159 --> 01:51:21,040
and that's the complexity so like

2769
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:22,960
occam's razor is built in

2770
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:26,320
to the way these models work

2771
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:30,239
so yeah in some

2772
01:51:30,239 --> 01:51:32,159
yes you're free to do almost anything

2773
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:33,520
here but

2774
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:35,760
if you look at the the model evidence in

2775
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:37,199
the end should

2776
01:51:37,199 --> 01:51:38,960
we punish you with your major model and

2777
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:42,000
necessarily complex

2778
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,400
thanks for this awesome response we'll

2779
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:46,159
have a question from dave

2780
01:51:46,159 --> 01:51:48,080
and then any closing thoughts and then

2781
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:49,760
that will be it for 19.1

2782
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:52,880
so dave go for it yeah two points

2783
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:56,480
about the point of local interactions

2784
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:57,599
only

2785
01:51:57,599 --> 01:52:00,840
they're kind of at odds with one another

2786
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:02,000
first

2787
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:05,840
is that actually the definition

2788
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:09,599
of locality whatever interacts

2789
01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:10,880
immediately

2790
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:14,840
is by definition local

2791
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:18,800
second in one of the computer

2792
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:22,239
simulations that was put together at the

2793
01:52:22,239 --> 01:52:25,679
fristan lab several years ago the dots

2794
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:27,440
on the screen where he's trying to get

2795
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:27,679
up

2796
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:30,719
i know it's i assume a simple model of

2797
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:33,840
how market microphone blankets work

2798
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:37,360
he found that the distant portions of

2799
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:38,880
the simulation

2800
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:41,360
were more accurately modeled than the

2801
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:43,679
nearby ones

2802
01:52:43,679 --> 01:52:46,400
and in my mathematical illiteracy i cry

2803
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:46,719
out

2804
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:50,639
oh so it's all working holographically

2805
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:53,679
the intermediate entities are

2806
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:59,119
focusing the more distant ones

2807
01:52:59,119 --> 01:53:00,800
yeah so this is really interesting that

2808
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,239
you picked up on this because

2809
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:06,159
and this is why we kind of um

2810
01:53:06,159 --> 01:53:08,639
we start with this markov blanket

2811
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:10,000
criterion

2812
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,040
but then when you start um when you kind

2813
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:14,320
of go into the way

2814
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:16,400
these dynamics work actually it gets

2815
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:18,000
more interesting

2816
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,960
once you're able to predict things that

2817
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:21,840
are

2818
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:25,199
um outside of your system

2819
01:53:25,199 --> 01:53:27,119
and the further away the harder it gets

2820
01:53:27,119 --> 01:53:29,040
usually um but

2821
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:33,040
like you described um in this

2822
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:35,119
so i think you're talking about the

2823
01:53:35,119 --> 01:53:36,639
markov blanket the kind of

2824
01:53:36,639 --> 01:53:41,599
soup the emergence emergency

2825
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:45,840
the emergent life paper

2826
01:53:47,679 --> 01:53:51,599
and in that case

2827
01:53:51,599 --> 01:53:53,920
for some reason it also has to do with

2828
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:56,159
the way you set up the state space

2829
01:53:56,159 --> 01:53:58,559
system

2830
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:02,960
but the way he identified the cro

2831
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:04,320
basically he did it just in terms of

2832
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:06,239
cross-correlation

2833
01:54:06,239 --> 01:54:08,960
between the states of these chemical

2834
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:09,840
particles

2835
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:13,119
and the locations of the state of the

2836
01:54:13,119 --> 01:54:16,080
particles outside

2837
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:18,080
and it was an emergent effect i'm not

2838
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:20,159
sure i think it has to do with the

2839
01:54:20,159 --> 01:54:22,639
particular simulation setup

2840
01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:25,360
but if you if we kind of abstract it a

2841
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:27,040
little bit away from that particular

2842
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:29,280
simulation

2843
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:31,760
when you go to deep temporal models

2844
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:32,560
actually

2845
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:36,159
and what you're trying to do is

2846
01:54:36,159 --> 01:54:39,599
you're trying to you could call it the

2847
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:41,040
hologram i guess in some way you're

2848
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:42,159
trying to create

2849
01:54:42,159 --> 01:54:44,719
an image of what the future looks like

2850
01:54:44,719 --> 01:54:45,920
outside of

2851
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:47,590
the current blanket

2852
01:54:47,590 --> 01:54:49,280
[Music]

2853
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:50,960
and that's why they call these the

2854
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:55,599
temporal models instance semi-markovian

2855
01:54:55,679 --> 01:54:59,199
so lots of these interesting cognitive

2856
01:54:59,199 --> 01:55:01,840
phenomena actually emerge when you start

2857
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:02,239
to

2858
01:55:02,239 --> 01:55:04,719
hack your way out of your blanket so to

2859
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:05,679
speak

2860
01:55:05,679 --> 01:55:09,360
and you're trying to get a grip

2861
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:12,639
on what's happening outside and that can

2862
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:12,880
be

2863
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:14,560
spatially it can be temporary so

2864
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:15,760
temporary will be in the future

2865
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:17,119
especially with the

2866
01:55:17,119 --> 01:55:19,250
places you can't reach

2867
01:55:19,250 --> 01:55:21,440
[Music]

2868
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:22,719
so yeah that's a very interesting

2869
01:55:22,719 --> 01:55:25,360
question i think um

2870
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:28,800
the seminar open aspect it's

2871
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:30,320
something that has been actually

2872
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:32,080
discussed recently

2873
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:36,400
i think it holds an important key to

2874
01:55:37,679 --> 01:55:41,440
the way our cognition works is that

2875
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:44,480
by kind of absorbing

2876
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:47,599
information over time

2877
01:55:47,599 --> 01:55:50,960
and combining with the right priors and

2878
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:53,599
the right so nature and nurture have to

2879
01:55:53,599 --> 01:55:56,480
be like kind of coalescing in a way that

2880
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:59,199
gives you a grip on things that are not

2881
01:55:59,199 --> 01:56:00,239
immediately

2882
01:56:00,239 --> 01:56:03,679
accessible anyway

2883
01:56:03,679 --> 01:56:06,000
so that's a very interesting question

2884
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,599
that i can't directly answer

2885
01:56:07,599 --> 01:56:09,760
because it's um we just know that for

2886
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:11,440
any physical system to

2887
01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:15,520
like a biological system to work

2888
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:19,360
we can only assume local interactions

2889
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:21,679
and then the rest of the story is trying

2890
01:56:21,679 --> 01:56:22,560
to figure out

2891
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:25,440
how far you can get it's just local

2892
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:27,440
interactions

2893
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:29,520
to create those what you call holograms

2894
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:31,160
i guess you could call them lego

2895
01:56:31,160 --> 01:56:32,880
[Music]

2896
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,560
is there a particular literature you're

2897
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:37,679
drawing on can you use that term

2898
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:39,360
i think chris field actually talked

2899
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:41,040
about holograph specifically dave what

2900
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:42,159
were you thinking of

2901
01:56:42,159 --> 01:56:46,080
holograms okay well i got that

2902
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:49,280
from the chapter of mark solms

2903
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:51,119
book that just came out in the last

2904
01:56:51,119 --> 01:56:52,320
number of weeks

2905
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:55,119
uh where he first is talking about

2906
01:56:55,119 --> 01:56:55,679
actually

2907
01:56:55,679 --> 01:56:59,280
visiting uh carl fristen

2908
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:01,679
but he doesn't use the term holographic

2909
01:57:01,679 --> 01:57:03,280
the only place i've seen that

2910
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:05,520
in this kind of context is a some

2911
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:06,719
discussion

2912
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:11,840
of um using interferometry to see around

2913
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:15,159
corners uh this is something that

2914
01:57:15,159 --> 01:57:16,560
presumably

2915
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:19,920
people can't do but instruments can that

2916
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:20,560
the

2917
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:23,840
there's a holographic or holograph like

2918
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:27,520
effect that um

2919
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:29,520
allows both either with sound or with

2920
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:30,610
light to

2921
01:57:30,610 --> 01:57:31,920
[Music]

2922
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:34,719
image objects that can't be seen visibly

2923
01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:35,040
but

2924
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:36,639
you have to have a corner as long as

2925
01:57:36,639 --> 01:57:38,639
there's a corner evidently that

2926
01:57:38,639 --> 01:57:40,800
induces the kind of self-interference

2927
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:42,639
that allows distant

2928
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:45,840
uh perception but

2929
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:48,320
you know more more relevant probably is

2930
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:50,320
the way that con specifics

2931
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:53,920
in flocks and so forth uh convey

2932
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:58,800
information mediated information

2933
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:00,000
sorry i don't have anything more

2934
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,080
specific awesome

2935
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:03,920
awesome points steve thanks for sharing

2936
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:05,119
it um

2937
01:58:05,119 --> 01:58:08,159
it's time and that was an awesome

2938
01:58:08,159 --> 01:58:11,199
point one discussion really appreciate

2939
01:58:11,199 --> 01:58:12,239
having you on here

2940

casper and everyone else who's joining

2941
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:16,000
live so we kind of just close with

2942
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:16,719
little

2943
01:58:16,719 --> 01:58:18,719
you know pause the video or pause time

2944
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:20,400
whatever your affordances

2945
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:22,960
think about these questions see you and

2946
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:24,080
um

2947
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:26,159

topics we'll be back for a follow-up

2954
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:37,920
discussion on the same paper
