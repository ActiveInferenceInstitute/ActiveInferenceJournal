00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,960
hello

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,880
welcome to the active inference live

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,559
stream this is active inference live

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:13,120
stream

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,480
number 19.0 on april first two thousand

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,920
twenty one

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,160
welcome to the active inference lab we

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,480
are a participatory online lab

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,720
that is communicating learning and

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,519
practicing

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,840
applied active inference you can find us

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,640
at our

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,359
links here this is recorded in an

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,200
archived live stream so please provide

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,040
us with feedback so that we can improve

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,239
on our work

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,079
all backgrounds and perspectives are

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,079
welcome and we'll be following

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,120
good video etiquette for live streams as

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,320
outlined in this checklist

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,200
this is the schedule that we've had so

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,879
far for 2021

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,520
and the upcoming two discussions on

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,399
april 6th

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,160
and the 13th will be number 19.1.2 on

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,879
this

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,239
paper that we're going to be discussing

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,480
today so right now

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,920
in 19.0 the goal is to set the context

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,720
and give a little background for 19.1

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,840
and 19.2

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,119
and people who are just learning about

33
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,080
the paper which is deeply felt affect

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,479
the emergence of valence in deep active

35
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,520
inference

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,720
by hesp smith parr allen firsten and

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,799
ramstead in 2021

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,640
and this video is definitely just an

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,280
introduction to the ideas

40
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,040
it's meant to be a two-way on-off ramp

41
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,360
from active inference so exposing the

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,880
active inference community

43
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,159
to ideas outside of active inference and

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,680
people who might be interested in some

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,439
of the bigger ideas connecting them to

46
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,079
the active inference implementations

47
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,479
and we have a bunch of sections planned

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,920
for today in 19

49
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,799
so thanks a lot to stephen and to blue

50
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,280
for

51
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,000
helping with the slides and for coming

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,479
on

53
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,159
today so maybe we can just um

54
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,320
introduce ourselves briefly and then we

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,200
can go

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,439
on to the rest of the slides we have

57
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,560
prepared so

58
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,040
i'm daniel i'm a postdoc in california

59
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,520
and i'll pass this stephen

60
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,760
hello i'm stephen i'm in toronto i'm

61
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
doing a practice-based phd

62
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,440
around social topographies and

63
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,120
community-based development

64
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,160
and i'll pass it over to blue

65
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,720
hi i'm blue knight i am an independent

66
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,720
research consultant based out of new

67
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,800
mexico

68
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,680
cool well i think this was a fun paper

69
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,560
for us to

70
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,400
read and we can just go right into

71
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,840
what were some of the big points of the

72
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,920
paper and the background ideas

73
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,800
before we go through the figure and the

74
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,280
model

75
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,920
which will take up a lot of the time the

76
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,560
paper

77
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,480
is called deeply felt affect the

78
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,400
immersion surveillance and deep active

79
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,360
inference

80
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,680
and it was published in the journal

81
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,879
neural computation

82
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,800
in 2021 and so i'll read the first one

83
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,360
and then

84
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,400
either of you can give a thought on that

85
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,959
in this letter meeting paper we

86
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,120
demonstrate that hierarchical

87
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,280
deep bayesian networks solved using

88
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,159
active inference

89
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,920
afford a principled formulation of

90
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,200
emotional valence

91
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,040
building on both the work mentioned

92
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,280
above as well as prior work on other

93
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,480
emotional phenomena

94
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,840
within the active inference framework

95
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,720
yeah so that's just given us that

96
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,720
insight into this idea of valence so

97
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,159
we'll be speaking about that more but

98
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,200
that's uh

99
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,680
that's that's an important part of this

100
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,280
paper

101
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,280
i'll say the next one our hypothesis

102
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,280
is that emotional valence can be

103
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,640
formalized

104
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,920
as a state of self that is inferred

105
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,400
on the basis of fluctuations in the

106
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,280
estimated

107
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,440
confidence or precision an agent has in

108
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,760
her generative model of the world that

109
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,640
informs

110
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,439
her decisions

111
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,920
cool so we're going to be connecting

112
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,280
some of the decision-making

113
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,920
aspects of agents and inference aspects

114
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,720
of agents

115
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,720
to emotional balance and they're going

116
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,760
to demonstrate it

117
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
so those are the goals and the claims

118
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,200
that they set out in the paper

119
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,720
any thoughts blue or do you want to go

120
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,480
to big questions and maybe introduce a

121
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,640
big question i'll introduce you to the

122
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,439
questions

123
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,120
all right go for it

124
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,279
so the big questions of this paper were

125
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,400
how can we make

126
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,880
more active inference models or agents

127
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,400
that are expressive

128
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,160
powerful realistic and interpretable

129
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,479
what are the implications of this active

130
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,199
inference

131
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,840
formalizes our survival and procreation

132
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,919
in terms of a single imperative

133
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,759
to minimize the divergence between

134
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,919
observed outcomes and phenotypically

135
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:42,639
expected

136
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,360
i.e preferred outcomes under a

137
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,840
generative model that is fine-tuned over

138
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,199
phylogeny and ontogeny

139
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,840
thoughts on this well the first one

140
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,560
this to me is about just developing the

141
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,320
active inference framework

142
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,280
to capture more of the patterns that we

143
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:03,759
see

144
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,960
in nature or in designed systems so how

145
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,680
do we make

146
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,520
systems that plan for multiple time

147
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,680
steps that's deep active inference

148
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,479
how do we make agents that interface

149
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,440
with the environment

150
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,880
so that's sort of a big move overall

151
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,800
and then this is going to be zooming in

152
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,240
on the valence

153
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,960
and some of those affective aspects

154
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,600
that's what

155
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
on the first point and then the second

156
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,759
this is a quote from the paper

157
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,080
and it says something that active

158
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,800
inference

159
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,080
does it formalizes our survival and

160
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,000
procreation not in terms of evolutionary

161
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,680
fitness again you could agree or

162
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,120
disagree with the authors or think it's

163
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,960
consistent with fitness or not

164
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,520
but claiming that the imperative is to

165
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,639
minimize

166
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,360
a specific kind of a divergence and so

167
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,360
what are the implications of that

168
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,880
if you think okay well if that's the

169
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,360
imperative then where's the situation

170
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,720
where we've been acting like there's a

171
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,919
different imperative

172
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,319
and is that consistent or inconsistent

173
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,520
with

174
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,720
um this and then the last quote and then

175
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,319
someone could give a dot

176
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,160
is a quote where they say we conclude

177
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,840
with a discussion of the implications of

178
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,800
this work

179
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,400
such as the relationship between

180
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,720
implicit metacognition and affect

181
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,240
connections to reinforcement learning

182
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,840
and future empirical directions

183
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,440
so what does active inference or this

184
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,520
model say about cognition or

185
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,720
metacognition

186
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,919
and reinforcement learning

187
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,400
yeah if i could add something i think

188
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,160
it's it really opens

189
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,039
up and a lot of the philosophical

190
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,520
questions and starts to give a modeling

191
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,440
interpretation so how the body comes in

192
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,800
how so the emotion starts to tie in to

193
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,039
a way that the body comes in an n-active

194
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,919
inference starts to become modelable

195
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,520
and it starts to also show how

196
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,720
affect is somehow connected

197
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,080
um to all cognition

198
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,599
and all processes so it's not some

199
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,360
weird artifact of shame

200
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,479
which might be more of a freudian trap

201
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,520
but it's actually an integration

202
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,840
of the cybernetic process all the way

203
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,800
through

204
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,639
in some way very nice it's also captured

205
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,240
a little bit on this slide which is

206
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,759
recycled from some

207
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,880
2020 vintage active which is

208
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,080
asking about how active inference

209
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,759
is going to be saying something about

210
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,280
the relationship between agents in the

211
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,160
world

212
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,479
and we're imagining an agent not a

213
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,440
one-step

214
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,840
tic-tac-toe player but we're thinking

215
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,759
about an agent that's imagining through

216
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,800
deep time

217
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,479
and they have imagination or the

218
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,160
capacity to simulate

219
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,479
and then they have affect and they can

220
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,240
also predict their affect and have

221
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,879
precision

222
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,280
and so on so here's sort of the drama

223
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,199
masks for the positive and negative

224
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,879
affect and then there's sort of

225
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,479
different world trajectories that are

226
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,560
being estimated through time

227
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,639
that lead to positive or negative

228
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,919
sentiment

229
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,599
and that gets around some of the sort of

230
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,759
basic considerations like in the paper

231
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,479
they say

232
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,520
well wouldn't the agent as they

233
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,360
meet their demise wouldn't they have

234
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,520
precision over their sensory states

235
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,280
and the answer is like yes but it's not

236
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,039
part of a long-term trajectory that

237
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:17,840
involves

238
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,560
desired preferences so by appealing to

239
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,919
model nesting

240
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,199
some of the sort of single layer

241
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,400
not paradoxes but just scenarios that

242
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,280
models might fall into like always going

243
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,958
with what was known before

244
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,039
never going what was known before these

245
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,159
can be resolved

246
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,559
just with empirical modeling interesting

247
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,880
one reason why it matters and we'll come

248
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,080
back to this

249
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,040
when we quote the authors later is that

250
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,320
these kinds of

251
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,360
richer models lead more closely to

252
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
experimentally tractable and unique

253
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,519
predictions of active inference

254
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,200
because if the only thing the model

255
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,600
predicts is the reaction time

256
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,200
that might fit the distribution better

257
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
than some other model now if it can also

258
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,399
fit the reaction time

259
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,080
and the eeg and also the self-report

260
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,399
it's starting to become a very rich

261
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,360
multi-modal

262
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,000
and multi-measurement way of talking

263
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,120
about behavior

264
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,680
which is what a good instrument should

265
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,480
do

266
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,519
so this is helping us come closer

267
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,160
through these contact points with other

268
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,240
big important areas of research

269
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,480
like reinforcement learning and

270
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,279
autonomous

271
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,519
computer agents and just inference

272
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,360
agents of all kinds especially ones with

273
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,240
action

274
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,080
but then maybe some of these other areas

275
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,440
that we'll bring into

276
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,080
the discussion because if we can have a

277
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,360
scale-free framework

278
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,320
that does apply to cognitive agents and

279
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,160
then we frame it in terms of

280
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,560
the input and output and the actions and

281
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,480
the policy the generative model

282
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,720
all of these terms maybe some of these

283
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,920
other

284
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,360
systems like online teams might be able

285
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,080
to also

286
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,800
be said to have at least computationally

287
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,920
affective charge

288
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,800
or precision or different things like

289
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,240
that so we kind of talked a little bit

290
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,160
about that in our 2020 paper

291
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,760
for online teams any thoughts on sort of

292
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,120
the bigger

293
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,360
topics that this paper is up against

294
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,519
before we jump into the abstract and the

295
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,320
figures and everything

296
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,240
if i could just say one one thing i

297
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,920
think that's very

298
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,120
interesting is that it opens up

299
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,720
um the the realities of trying to bring

300
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,000
in the mind the body and the environment

301
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,680
and there's been this question well how

302
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,360
do you do that and

303
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,600
why didn't we do that before was partly

304
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,279
because we wanted to be able to measure

305
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,120
things and lock things down

306
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,480
and and the question of how do you bring

307
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,240
this whole dynamic in how could you

308
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,120
possibly get a handle on all of that

309
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,160
um well emotion seems to actually make a

310
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,519
lot of sense in terms of

311
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,000
or let's say valence should say valence

312
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,079
more broadly

313
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,560
it makes sense in terms of how it could

314
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,640
be calibrating

315
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,560
the more conscious levels of that

316
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,680
process

317
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,720
so i think that has implications

318
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,760
for scaling psychology and bringing

319
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,360
consciousness back into

320
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,839
psychology and helping to

321
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,680
really move into a ecological

322
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,839
and ecosystem approach to psychology

323
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,680
lou any thoughts or do you want to start

324
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,760
with the first part of the abstract

325
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,839
i'll hold my thoughts i have somebody

326
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,519
but i don't want to ruin the surprise of

327
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,000
the paper so let's start off on abstract

328
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,880
agreed fun times all right um does

329
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,240
anybody want to start with the first

330
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,600
part of the abstract

331
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,639
i'll take it the positive negative

332
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,279
access

333
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,440
of emotional valence has long been

334
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,680
recognized as fundamental to adaptive

335
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,639
behavior

336
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,800
but its origin and underlying function

337
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,000
have largely eluded

338
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
formal theorizing and computational

339
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,040
modeling

340
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,720
using deep active inference a

341
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
hierarchical inference scheme that rests

342
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,959
on inverting a model of how sensory data

343
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,000
are generated

344
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,160
we developed a principal bayesian model

345
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,839
of emotional valence

346
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,079
this formulation asserts that agents in

347
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,360
further valence state

348
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,440
based on the expected precision of their

349
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,480
action model

350
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,880
an internal estimate of overall model

351
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,680
fitness

352
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,519
which the author's term subjective

353
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,959
fitness

354
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,360
this index of subjective fitness can be

355
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,279
estimated within any environment

356
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,880
and exploits the domain general

357
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,920
generality of sorry my screen is in the

358
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,200
way

359
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,040
second order beliefs which are beliefs

360
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,760
about beliefs there

361
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,560
nice so in this first part of the

362
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,360
abstract

363
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,240
kind of priming what this whole research

364
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,800
agenda

365
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,320
is about i'm seeing a few threads

366
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,360
one is about fitting good models

367
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,240
overall model fitness especially with a

368
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,200
subjective

369
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,519
twist so that's another kind of a bonus

370
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,040
that it's actually not just

371
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,120
objective model fitness it's subjective

372
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,320
so it's about

373
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,720
good fitting models with this

374
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,160
recognition that that's like

375
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,200
personalized

376
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,720
okay so that's cool thread then there's

377
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,959
the first words which are about the

378
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,079
positive and negative

379
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,680
aspect of emotional valence which is

380
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,680
despite the richness and the amount of

381
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,959
experiences and

382
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,639
all the diversity of altered states of

383
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,320
consciousness and adjectives

384
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,600
there's also kind of this um approach

385
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,200
versus recede binary

386
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,839
and um this is as they're saying it's

387
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:38,720
fundamental

388
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,920
and we see it in living forms like go

389
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,079
no go signaling and we also see it in

390
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,760
computational agents

391
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,240
and so this is putting a lot of

392
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,920
different kinds of systems

393
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,959
that have very nuanced maybe behavior

394
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,680
in their outputs but at a top level they

395
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,000
act

396
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,959
as if they have a sort of go no-go that

397
00:13:58,959 --> 00:13:59,920
in a way

398
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,240
helps them be adaptive in their own

399
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,959
niche

400
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:03,920
and then the way that they're going to

401
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,920
go about that is actually with a second

402
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,519
level or second order

403
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,160
cybernetics model which is by enabling

404
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,839
belief about belief

405
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,839
maybe some of these gaps between systems

406
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,440
can be bridged

407
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,199
so interesting research questions that

408
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,440
are not always brought out because the

409
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,800
abstract is so reduced and they have to

410
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,000
say what they did do

411
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,199
but for those who are interested in

412
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,680
those questions that's good to know

413
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,680
all right i'll read this one and then

414
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,279
anyone can give a thought

415
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,440
we show how maintaining internal valence

416
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,480
representations

417
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,800
allow the ensuing effective agent to

418
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,279
optimize confidence in active selection

419
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,440
action selection preemptively valence

420
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,600
representations can in turn be optimized

421
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,519
by leveraging the bayes optimal updating

422
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,279
term for subjective fitness which we

423
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:47,680
label

424
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,800
affective charge or ac ac

425
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,040
tracks changes in fitness estimates and

426
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,920
lends a sign

427
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,160
to otherwise unsigned divergences

428
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,480
between predictions and outcomes

429
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,360
that's pretty interesting we simulate

430
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,959
the resulting affect of inference by

431
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,880
subjecting an in-silico

432
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,040
in the computer affective agent to a

433
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,880
teammate's paradigm requiring context

434
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,040
learning followed by context reversal

435
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,600
this formulation of affective inference

436
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,199
offers a principled account

437
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,399
of the link between affect mental action

438
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,399
and implicit metacognition it

439
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,519
characterizes

440
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,000
how a deep biological system can affer

441
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,600
its affective state

442
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,279
and reduce uncertainty about such

443
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,120
inferences through internal action

444
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,040
i.e top-down modulation of priors that

445
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,000
underwrite confidence

446
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,360
so this for me like was a big surprise

447
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,560
of the paper like the

448
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,160
the valence and um the relationship with

449
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,720
valence

450
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,399
and subjective fitness so or precision

451
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,680
accuracy

452
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,279
this was just a really different take

453
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,800
like compared to the last

454
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
paper that we did just like on valence

455
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,199
was very much like positive or negative

456
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,519
in terms of like feeling or emotion

457
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,199
where this is like really positive or

458
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,639
negative just based on

459
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,800
like surprise essentially like what if

460
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,959
my model doesn't match my expectations

461
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,880
like or or the outcomes if my

462
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,720
expectations don't match my outcomes

463
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,440
that is negative valence which that was

464
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,240
a kind of surprising take on this for me

465
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,160
compared to the last valence paper that

466
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,160
we did and the other thing

467
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,360
is really this the way that they've

468
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,000
modeled

469
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,800
this is totally like a perfect example

470
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,399
as they talk about in the discussion

471
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,680
of the bayesian brain and why bayesian

472
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,480
statistics

473
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,800
and updating um like especially when

474
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,680
they talk well

475
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,360
i'll hold i'll hold my thought for them

476
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,600
for that time but but really this was

477
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,880
just an exemplary paper for that for me

478
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,560
nice yeah one one thing that came up for

479
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,079
me there is it talks about

480
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,880
you know representations again and those

481
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,279
so

482
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,279
this idea that internal valence

483
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,040
representation so suddenly we've got a

484
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,880
way to bring

485
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,519
representations back into

486
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,320
um what had become quite a

487
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,279
non-representational

488
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,680
modeling approach and that's really

489
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,119
interesting because it's like normally

490
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,559
you think of representations previously

491
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,919
like the most concrete

492
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,319
is the thought then there's the body and

493
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,679
there was this fuzzy thing called

494
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,520
emotions which somehow was there and

495
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,280
axiology and all this stuff

496
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,000
but now it's like well wait you've got

497
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,799
an internal

498
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,079
valence representation which could

499
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,959
inform the body and the cybernetic

500
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,080
thinking metacognition process so it it

501
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,000
gives a way in for representations but

502
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,120
it's not representations as we

503
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,520
normally maybe approach that term so

504
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,640
that's quite

505
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,840
cool all right third abstract

506
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,720
who would like to read it

507
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,559
okay i'll read this one thus we

508
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,440
demonstrate

509
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,360
the potential of active inference to

510
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,240
provide a formal and

511
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,840
computationally tractable account of

512
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,200
affect

513
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,520
our demonstration of the face validity

514
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,960
and potential utility of this

515
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,360
formulation represents the first step

516
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,039
within a larger research program

517
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,559
next this model can be leveraged to test

518
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:10,919
the

519
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,080
hypothesized role of valence by

520
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,320
fitting the model to behavioral and

521
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,039
neuronal responses

522
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,000
nice so i set up the problem by being

523
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,799
about

524
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,520
using higher order cognition this second

525
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,559
level modeling

526
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,480
to approach some of the interesting

527
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,840
dynamics of

528
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,440
agents like their apparent

529
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,840
affective charge influencing their

530
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,280
behavioral decisions in the present

531
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,320
moment based upon

532
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,480
inference about the future and they're

533
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,240
going to demonstrate a simulation

534
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,919
there's going to be kind of a model

535
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,760
layer and then there's going to be a

536
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,520
simulation that goes down into the t

537
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,960
maze and a mouse and so there's sort of

538
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,520
two

539
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,600
levels of generality that we're going to

540
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,679
go through here

541
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,679
they start the paper with the

542
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,280
qualitative but still

543
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,679
rigorous level of generality which is

544
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,679
just talking about

545
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,440
action in different systems and

546
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
multi-scale biology

547
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,000
and the need to integrate bayesian

548
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,039
approaches

549
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,360
into how we think about evolution and

550
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,160
development

551
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,440
ecology and so on and then they

552
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,640
turn directly to the methods and perform

553
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,200
this

554
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,919
four-step walkthrough that will be

555
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,400
somewhat familiar to those who have seen

556
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,360
model stream one with ryan smith and

557
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,640
christopher white

558
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,320
where they also step through the

559
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,000
construction of this model but

560
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,039
it's something that as we'll probably

561
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,880
see soon it's it's just always worth it

562
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,400
to kind of build up this model

563
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,000
incrementally

564
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,280
then they with this implicit

565
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,480
metacognitive model

566
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,919
at step four of their models elaboration

567
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,200
they discuss a few kinds of

568
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,720
important key terms that are like

569
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,400
bridges between

570
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,880
previous computational psychological

571
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,600
models

572
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,799
and their active inference model

573
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,000
and then they implement a simulation

574
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,559
with a rat in a team ace which we'll

575
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,000
discuss as well

576
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
and then they bring up all these very

577
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,679
interesting questions

578
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,200
towards the discussion section of the

579
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,760
paper some of which we've exerted

580
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,440
and conclude with a discussion on the

581
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,600
future empirical directions

582
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,400
so before we go into the affect and

583
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,120
valence

584
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,159
model simulation implications any

585
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,039
thoughts on the roadmap

586
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:36,720
all right let's go to affect and valence

587
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,960
this is quoting from their

588
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,080
paper so definitely read it to see

589
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,760
everything that they say

590
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,320
but they refer to classical constructs

591
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,679
of valence

592
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,840
so maybe here just representing the

593
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,600
classical valence construct

594
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,400
on a kind of clock chart what would

595
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,159
either of you

596
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,080
think or say about valence or what

597
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,000
motivates the study of valence

598
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,280
this way or overall

599
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,280
so i just had a comment and it's based

600
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,320
on something that

601
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,919
uh the authors had said about

602
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,760
surveillance so here

603
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,320
uh we've got the arousal and like high

604
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,000
and low arousal on one axis

605
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,679
and positive and negative on the other

606
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,320
axis but the authors had mentioned

607
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,919
that uh some people see valence as like

608
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,400
a an array of positive like it's a

609
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,919
positive and negative or two

610
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,000
separate axes of valence and i thought

611
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,440
that that was very interesting

612
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,559
whereas like like it's a it's not a um

613
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,960
you know a binary choice positive and

614
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,760
negative but

615
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,280
there's a range of positive and there's

616
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,280
a range of negative and ambivalence

617
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,600
like contains some degree of both i

618
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,039
thought that that was an interesting

619
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,320
uh take on valence

620
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,679
i've thought about before cool and they

621
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,480
bring up

622
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,799
good scholarship with bringing up a

623
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,919
uni-dimensional

624
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,159
view so that would be like yes there's

625
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,280
like a thermometer

626
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,440
and it's kind of just like it goes up or

627
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,640
down it's a number

628
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,039
that has to be strictly ordered and less

629
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,880
than greater than maybe even linearly

630
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,880
correlated with a hormone or a chemical

631
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,360
or

632
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,360
a neural firing in some region or a

633
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,200
pattern of activity

634
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,919
then maybe there's multiple dimensions

635
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:16,720
maybe

636
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,159
there's um like as here

637
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,159
an arousal and a high to low arousal and

638
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,280
high to low valence positive negative um

639
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,600
maybe it's multi-dimensional so what's

640
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,880
cool about the active inference

641
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,000
framework is

642
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,080
we could test the computational roles

643
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,360
of these kinds of variables and ask okay

644
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,000
this is

645
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,520
fitting the data better but is it um

646
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,360
more parameters is this worth the

647
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,280
trade-off that we're getting here

648
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,640
so we're kind of taking this single

649
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,240
dimensional model and thinking about it

650
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,159
with a family of other models

651
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,080
where we could test the influence of

652
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,679
other factors and see if

653
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,320
such patterns are detectable in the data

654
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,600
or ask what kind of

655
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,320
behavioral settings or groups or

656
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,520
questionnaires or whatever

657
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,559
it might be would elicit um a

658
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,320
differentiation on another

659
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,120
hypothesized axis yeah and just one

660
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,559
thing that goes with that is

661
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,960
it sort of shows you the current ways to

662
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,840
get at this

663
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,080
is kind of through self-reported

664
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,039
emotions

665
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,600
and using this kind of graph and

666
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,960
actually use this

667
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,039
a tool with our community with

668
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,240
disabilities for

669
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,600
um reporting back on their experiences

670
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,159
but you you're essentially still getting

671
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,600
this emotion

672
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,000
um as as a self-report and trying to

673
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,120
track back

674
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,600
um using sort of assumptions about how

675
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,240
that

676
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,120
plots with other self-reported emotions

677
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,000
and

678
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,360
um whereas the the and this is also used

679
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:47,840
a lot

680
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,400
in uh market research for marketing and

681
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,600
advertising this tool

682
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,120
so but actually in this

683
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,279
approach here they've got a way to

684
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,559
access this

685
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,520
without just getting self-reported words

686
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,279
um so this is this this i think

687
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,400
shows how it has you know this this is

688
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,760
an area that's got a lot of

689
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,080
application potentially cool

690
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,120
here is a slide just upon uh

691
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,320
differentiation

692
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,440
in english between affect

693
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,080
and effect so not to split hairs or to

694
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,440
introduce words that they didn't use in

695
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,960
the paper like effect

696
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,799
but what would be the point on this

697
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,960
stephen

698
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,720
well you've you've got just to give the

699
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,000
sense that it is often

700
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,960
confusing those two terms so if we have

701
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,600
the

702
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,000
the person these two people on the left

703
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,120
so you've got um

704
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,320
the person x has experiences and effect

705
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,080
some sort of you know relationship

706
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,240
to person wine it's it's created some

707
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,480
affect now that could be anger

708
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,240
if it was reported later and they said

709
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,640
what was their emotional state

710
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,279
and this affect contributes to a policy

711
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,039
selection

712
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,400
where person x interacts with person y

713
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,960
and pushes them into the pool so you can

714
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,440
see that

715
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,039
okay so that that um the effect

716
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,480
of this is that that person

717
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,400
y ends up in the pool so there's there's

718
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,799
a there's a there's an act and there's a

719
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,480
cause effect type of um linear

720
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,360
type of mechanical action that happens

721
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,240
um and of course

722
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,960
then there can be additional affects on

723
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,480
both the parties

724
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,120
and effect resulting from this

725
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,120
particularly if the person was to uh

726
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,279
you know drown or something depending on

727
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,480
the scenario so

728
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,840
i think it shows that there's a kind of

729
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,039
one's more dynamical and relational and

730
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,880
one is more

731
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,039
objective i suppose you could say and

732
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,760
cause and effect related

733
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,320
sounds good and here is from a previous

734
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,000
um discussion i think number

735
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,799
active 11 where we talked also about

736
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,080
affect

737
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,120
and about trajectories through affect

738
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,159
space so whether or not it's like how

739
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,919
things quote really are

740
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,120
it might be a behavioral index or

741
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,200
summary statistics of of someone's

742
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,480
online activity

743
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,919
even if you're not directly measuring

744
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,679
them or getting their self-report

745
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,520
and there can be trajectories through

746
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,960
this space

747
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,039
now one topic that um a sort of

748
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,679
detail that's a little bit special for

749
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:26,799
active inference that

750
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,440
doesn't get emphasized a ton is that

751
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,159
basically

752
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,679
the certainty in the model is

753
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,400
one and the same thing as having better

754
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,120
affect

755
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,720
better affective charge increasing

756
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,240
certainty and high certainty in the

757
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,120
model

758
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,240
are taking the place in a reward centric

759
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,520
of highest expected for example value

760
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,440
and it's one major difference between um

761
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,840
an active inference approach to thinking

762
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,000
about economics or decision making

763
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,640
versus a sort of just like classical um

764
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,240
maximum likelihood

765
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,600
reward maximization so in

766
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,840
these active inference frameworks

767
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,279
they're not modeling

768
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,720
a happy to sad variable and calling that

769
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
affective charge they're actually

770
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,120
modeling a precision variable

771
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,320
and then saying that when things are

772
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,080
more precise and are getting more

773
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,320
precise there is

774
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,679
low negative affect so it's kind of like

775
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,240
positive and then anxiety like negative

776
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,120
affect

777
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,159
arises as a function of

778
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,279
uncertainty in the model and

779
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,600
um here's just some words and some

780
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,480
thoughts that we had

781
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,520
put on anxiety from a previous one but

782
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,520
any thoughts on this about the sort of

783
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,440
integration of valence and certainty

784
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,880
rather than valence and expected

785
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,679
average what that means or how that's

786
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,120
different than other models that others

787
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,439
have seen

788
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,960
yeah well i think that does have quite

789
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,080
important implications

790
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,320
because it's now prospective it's kind

791
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,720
of what was the

792
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,840
contextual expectation on where things

793
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,279
would go

794
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,520
um as opposed to just it being this kind

795
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,039
of static

796
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,159
expectation on the moment itself

797
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,960
and it's all collapsed down into sort of

798
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,240
some sort of reductive

799
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,320
there's the idea that there's the

800
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,600
person's valence

801
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,720
is dynamic in relation to

802
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,919
um you know their expectation but then

803
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,919
there's also the precision at which that

804
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,360
expectation then

805
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,159
resolved or didn't resolve you know so

806
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,039
you may expect things to go badly

807
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,720
and then things went worse than you

808
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,320
expected or it went better than you

809
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,760
expected but it still might have gone

810
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,640
badly

811
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,640
but it didn't go as bad so it gives you

812
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,840
that

813
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,399
much more um well i don't know i

814
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,840
wouldn't use the word realistic i don't

815
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,080
know what term you'd use for that

816
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,039
no yeah that question cool blue

817
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,320
so i can't remember which paper it was

818
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,440
exactly but it was

819
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,520
talking about um anxiety it was one that

820
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,039
we did on the live stream talking about

821
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,440
anxiety as like a fixation

822
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,240
on the future right and i talked about

823
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,880
depression as a fixation on the past

824
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,399
was it the big five i feel like it was

825
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,919
the big five paper

826
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,640
um but but that is just an interesting

827
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,520
um

828
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,279
and kind of different perspective on

829
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,919
anxiety as as relative to the valence

830
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,960
that's presented here

831
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,799
cool and uh the question of how to map

832
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,440
model parameters to experiences that we

833
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,240
have which are

834
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,039
encultured and which are relating to our

835
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:41,760
individual

836
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,799
kind of qualia that's a big jump too

837
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,399
so we shouldn't just instantly also

838
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,279
paper over the computational

839
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,080
psychiatric uh gap but that's what we're

840
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,679
going to unpack is what does the model

841
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:54,080
really

842
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,240
say and then what is that going to help

843
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,120
us do or rethink

844
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,679
one note is that they wrote that they

845
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:02,240
are

846
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,760
referring to their model distincting it

847
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,600
from just sort of active inference more

848
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,120
broadly as

849
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,919
affective inference because it sort of

850
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:12,640
has that

851
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,720
the active in there but it also has

852
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,399
affect in there

853
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,200
and they're saying there's what makes it

854
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:19,679
different

855
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,799
than just general active inference and

856
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,480
uh one of the one attribute that they

857
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,320
apply here is deep so that's meaning

858
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,919
deep through time

859
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,120
or potentially also using deep uh

860
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,559
learning like deep neural network

861
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,559
approaches we had i think christopher

862
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:37,840
white or someone

863
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,600
it all blurs together but somebody gave

864
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,120
a few senses of deep

865
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,320
active inference and then

866
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,720
they're also modeling affect

867
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,039
and so that's why they call it affective

868
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,880
inference so it's deep affective

869
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,520
inference

870
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,039
so if you know what active inference

871
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,720
kind of is about

872
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,600
they're taking that skeletal framework

873
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,200
and extending it through time

874
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,320
and adding an affective

875
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,760
parameter or um a

876
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,399
set of interacting variables way to

877
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:10,960
think about

878
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,240
and model the kinds of things that

879
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,320
people study affect

880
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,159
in that's what they want to study with

881
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,440
this new development

882
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,679
so that's kind of what i think they're

883
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,360
doing in this paper

884
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,640
and um it's

885
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,320
also a little more general than just

886
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,679
affect because

887
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,279
as they say it can generalize to

888
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,880
potentially other higher level

889
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,840
explanations

890
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,320
for conditional dependencies between

891
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,919
higher level parameters and

892
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,880
how they reflect behavioral outcomes so

893
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,000
that's a pretty

894
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,919
general statement that's very important

895
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,519
though it's saying that

896
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,600
it could be possible to have other

897
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,279
higher hidden states

898
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,399
that cognitive ideas let's say and those

899
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,919
don't have to be just the positive or

900
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:54,960
negative

901
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,919
approach or recede that they model here

902
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,360
it could be something that's a lot more

903
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,000
subtle or

904
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,640
symbolic or categorical rather than this

905
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,600
is more of like

906
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,519
foraging go no go so this is a initial

907
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,720
foray into this kind of deep and hyper

908
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,039
parameter reaching back down

909
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,480
affective in that sense and it's tied to

910
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,360
the affect

911
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,760
rather than to the for example cognitive

912
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,399
work

913
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,080
but it's as they say implicitly

914
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,480
metacognitive and stephen as you said

915
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,399
it's not that affect is late in late

916
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,080
late and then like strikes into the

917
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,640
scene

918
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,559
it's actually that there's this sort of

919
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,880
fundamental cybernetic role

920
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,399
for affect regulation so it's not a red

921
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,200
flag

922
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,840
mode that is explosive or something it's

923
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,559
something that's

924
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,760
intrinsic like metabolism

925
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,519
okay they uh bring up a lot of previous

926
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,360
work and some limitations of the model

927
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,679
so check out the paper more if you want

928
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,559
to learn

929
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,720
about for example if you think well

930
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,240
that's a very narrow

931
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,200
uh model definition of valence they

932
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,399
might bring it up

933
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,799
in their paper so check that out but

934
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,240
let's just get right into

935
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,360
what the model is and

936
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,360
there's going to be sort of two acts

937
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,360
coming up here there's going to be

938
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,519
the model which is just the mathematics

939
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,440
of what they lay out and the formulisms

940
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,399
they lay out

941
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:17,360
and then we're going to go into the

942
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,080
simulation with the mouse or the rat

943
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,880
or the ant or whatever in the t mace so

944
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,559
the first is going to be general

945
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,919
and the second is going to go into a

946
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,200
simulation that they're going to get

947
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,399
results from as well

948
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,600
so we're going to walk through kind of

949
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,039
four clicks in the elaboration

950
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,919
incrementally as they write on an active

951
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:36,880
inference model

952
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,240
okay so fun stuff thanks everyone also

953
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:40,720
for

954
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,600
joining live so here we are in figure

955
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,039
one

956
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,519
who would like to go first maybe blue

957
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,000
you annotated this really well so what

958
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,320
did you see in figure one with model one

959
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,960
and model two

960
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,960
sure so model one is um

961
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,480
the generative model of perception which

962
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,760
we've seen before where s is

963
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,760
hidden state o stands for observations

964
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,960
d is prior belief uh a

965
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,520
is this likelihood mapping or like a

966
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,599
probability distribution

967
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,399
and then tau is time which we've seen

968
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,040
before so

969
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,760
in m1 there's no time this is the first

970
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,480
step of a generative model and it's just

971
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,119
perception so it's it's like sensory

972
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,000
input

973
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,719
and the posterior oven over hidden

974
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,800
states is all that's really taken into

975
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,079
the model of perception and then the

976
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,960
m2 so as the models as we go through

977
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,159
these m1 m2

978
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,440
m3 and m4 in the next few slides

979
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,199
there's an increasing layer of

980
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,440
complexity as we transition from m1 to

981
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,079
m2

982
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,879
to m3 and then m4 with m4 being the most

983
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:53,520
complex

984
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,399
and so in m2 which is the generative

985
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,200
model of

986
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,320
anticipation the idea of perception

987
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,440
is then extended forward and backward

988
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,480
into the past if

989
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,760
you want to go there using a transition

990
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,119
matrix which is this

991
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,000
b sub t for to represent the hidden

992
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,520
state

993
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,680
so it's just an extension of of

994
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,560
perception

995
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,160
essentially and it includes the

996
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,040
anticipation what you expect to happen

997
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,760
as opposed to the just the sensory input

998
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,640
which is just

999
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,960
what's present in m1 so it's

1000
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,040
anticipating hidden states over time

1001
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,240
m2 nice

1002
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,359
awesome good explanation

1003
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,320
and we can look at some of their or

1004
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,240
anything else to add actually or

1005
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,280
ask here stephen on figure one was

1006
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,480
really helpful i mean the only thing i

1007
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:44,960
might

1008
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,960
add is that as you were mentioning that

1009
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,400
is it's almost like

1010
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,040
the the predicted input in that funny

1011
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,599
sort of way

1012
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,760
it's like so we've got what was what's

1013
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,800
the predictions

1014
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,240
of what the sensory input is

1015
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,280
if i could sort of somehow infer that

1016
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,119
and that that's that dynamical so i

1017
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,560
i think this is really helpful though to

1018
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,400
go through it this way yep

1019
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,640
and to give a note on that a lot of

1020
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,599
times when people think

1021
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,839
statistics they think descriptive

1022
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:12,640
statistics

1023
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,000
like we're going to take the big data

1024
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,760
set the big you know image data set and

1025
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,119
we're going to describe it with a

1026
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,640
summary statistic

1027
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,079
and that does map onto this topology

1028
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,240
like observations get mapped through

1029
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,040
likelihood onto the most optimal state

1030
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,920
of the world

1031
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,000
but where generative bayesian modeling

1032
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,200
comes into play

1033
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,839
is that that model that's inferred that

1034
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,200
hidden state what is the real

1035
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,880
temperature or what is the real average

1036
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,400
height of the classroom

1037
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,200
it can also be used to generate and to

1038
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,359
combine with other models to generate

1039
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,920
testable distinctions you can generate

1040
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,640
data

1041
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,720
and then this duality where you can like

1042
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,119
take a little bit or a ton of data

1043
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,400
and then update your prior already using

1044
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,079
the bayesian terminology and then use

1045
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,920
those prior estimates to generate more

1046
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,800
data

1047
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,440
that is like expectation maximization or

1048
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,160
em

1049
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,040
optimization or the parametric empirical

1050
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,480
bayes approach

1051
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,400
so it's not just taking big data and

1052
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,079
crunching it into a regression

1053
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,359
coordinate and saying all right we found

1054
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,720
the most likely one

1055
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,119
it's done this is actually a framework

1056
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,720
that allows us to bounce back and forth

1057
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,720
between summaries of big data

1058
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,040
and the actual large observations

1059
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,880
themselves and then here you can think

1060
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,480
of the prediction is on a single

1061
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,480
observation with a single hidden state

1062
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,000
and here it's like

1063
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,400
getting a vector through time it's then

1064
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,320
you can imagine that it would be

1065
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,400
more dimensions but this is just the

1066
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,320
skeleton so let's keep on

1067
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,320
walking through yep let me interject

1068
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,520
here really quick sorry

1069
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,040
so can you just go back there we go i

1070
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,640
love this what the authors how they

1071
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,200
describe

1072
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,280
perception i thought it was very clear

1073
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,640
they said perception

1074
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,119
corresponds to a process of inferring

1075
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,720
which hidden states

1076
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,160
or posterior expectations

1077
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,480
provide the best explanation for the

1078
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,000
observed outcomes i thought that that

1079
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,760
was very clear

1080
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,040
cool and the soft max is the sigma

1081
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,160
and that's just saying it's like a

1082
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,160
decision-making criterion

1083
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,720
uh function but we can also ask the

1084
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,000
authors more because that's sort of the

1085
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,880
machine learning

1086
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,760
uh term yeah so just one just one very

1087
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,440
quick thing on that as well i like what

1088
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,440
what blues just said there as well is by

1089
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
bringing it on the outcomes

1090
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,079
as opposed to that that outcomes brings

1091
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,280
in action

1092
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,079
so you you you because the out it's it's

1093
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,839
like the perception it's not

1094
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,400
what the data is telling me it's also

1095
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,440
the outcomes

1096
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,160
of what happened in the world with the

1097
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,240
body

1098
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,640
and that that is really quite i don't

1099
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,560
know if that's been so easy to bring in

1100
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,200
before

1101
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,800
um in the language so i thought that's

1102
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,240
quite interesting

1103
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,160
yep and we're going to bring policy in

1104
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,599
in a second but for now

1105
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:48,800
you're right we have the difference

1106
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,800
between the outcomes and the hidden

1107
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,440
states

1108
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,960
is it raining or not that's the hidden

1109
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,040
state and then is my shirt wet or not

1110
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,680
that's the

1111
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,000
you know sensory state but we have why

1112
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,280
is measured wet right

1113
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,440
is my shirt wet yeah exactly but we

1114
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,560
haven't gotten to this

1115
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,920
policy level which is should i go

1116
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,160
outside so table one

1117
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,400
is just describing in a little bit more

1118
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,440
detail

1119
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,560
the p and the q distributions

1120
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,280
that they use um in their figure one for

1121
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,640
this like basic

1122
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,720
level and that uh comports their

1123
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,520
math with just the broader modeling

1124
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,760
bayesian statistics

1125
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,480
letters used although the a b c d are

1126
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,280
sort of

1127
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,760
specific for active so let's go from

1128
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,640
that

1129
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,760
uh m2 model and

1130
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,160
bring in policy so this is m3

1131
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,400
model this is the next click that

1132
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,920
actually gets us to the first thing that

1133
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,400
looks more like a real active inference

1134
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,920
model beyond just a bayesian time series

1135
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,960
approach so maybe blue go for it again

1136
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,160
with what you would say for m3

1137
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,880
so for m3 this is the third step and

1138
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,480
this is the generative model of

1139
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,119
action so here it's inferring in

1140
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,040
phenotype congruent policies

1141
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,760
from all of the terms that we had talked

1142
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,319
about in

1143
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:11,599
m1 m2 and then this brings in policies

1144
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:12,160
which

1145
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,359
that's pi policies and then e sub pi

1146
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,720
is the baseline prior over the policies

1147
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,160
and g sub pi is expected free energy

1148
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,200
c is phenotype congruent preferences

1149
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,359
and then f sub pi is the variational

1150
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:28,640
free energy

1151
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,319
conditioned on a policy so the policies

1152
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:32,720
are

1153
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,760
here already here and we just have these

1154
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,000
uh m2 is the what's perceived over

1155
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,200
hidden states

1156
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,839
uh based on perception m1 so this is

1157
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,280
kind of just adding that

1158
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,400
that ex extra layer including policy

1159
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,240
into the into the action model yep so

1160
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,880
it says here posterior policy beliefs

1161
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,560
are informed by the fit

1162
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,720
between anticipated and preferred

1163
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,599
outcomes

1164
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,680
while at the same time minimizing their

1165
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,359
ambiguity

1166
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,880
so to minimize that so

1167
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,520
nice thanks for this a connection

1168
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,640
between variables

1169
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,760
in this kind of a graph represents them

1170
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,480
having like a statistical dependency so

1171
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,599
we can look at pi

1172
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,760
which is policy and then ask okay so we

1173
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,119
had m2

1174
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,760
which was this time series that we that

1175
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,280
looked kind of like a i don't know like

1176
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,599
a

1177
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,599
rake or something or a horse and then

1178
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,200
paul policy pi gets linked in

1179
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,160
not directly with the thumb on the scale

1180
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,160
influencing the hidden state

1181
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,280
but actually influencing b sub t

1182
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,760
which is the transition matrix through

1183
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,400
time

1184
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,520
of that hidden state so one thing

1185
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,680
because there's no pi onto the hidden

1186
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,839
state you can't have policy at a

1187
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:50,800
snapshot

1188
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,359
like timeless policy all policy is

1189
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,040
intrinsically related to the movement of

1190
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,599
time

1191
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,079
because it's hitting the b matrix not

1192
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,680
because it's not plugging into

1193
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,760
a hidden state directly so you're always

1194
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,599
talking about a temporal model just how

1195
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:04,079
deep

1196
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,440
are you talking and then it also

1197
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,800
conditions the estimate of how the

1198
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,640
hidden state evolves that's what that

1199
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,480
vertical line like given you know a

1200
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,280
given b

1201
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,880
so this is we're going to do the time

1202
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,640
series how how much

1203
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,599
um bitcoin will i have under the policy

1204
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,200
of not acquiring any

1205
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,720
zero easy estimate easy heuristic

1206
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,079
so then those kinds of conditionalized

1207
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,800
estimates of different kinds of things

1208
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,920
can help agents

1209
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,119
act in the world so that's why policy is

1210
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,960
interesting to think about and so

1211
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,400
instead of thinking about how to

1212
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,760
optimize a massively

1213
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,760
complicated scheme for maximizing

1214
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,079
utility with an unknown variability

1215
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,520
this is allowing the agent to model how

1216
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,680
one is embedded in hidden states

1217
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,000
estimate or changing through time

1218
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,480
so that's the pi part and then also this

1219
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,319
is kind of explore exploit

1220
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,880
so minimizing the ambiguity is one

1221
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,319
imperative

1222
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,960
but also you want it to be fitting the

1223
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,079
whole time

1224
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,319
like i want my shoe to fit but i also

1225
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,480
want to figure out where it doesn't fit

1226
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,480
but i need to be walking the whole time

1227
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,240
and so by keeping a bunch of these

1228
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,240
features

1229
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,839
linked in the model the dials

1230
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,440
at least exist to modulate in really

1231
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,599
creative ways like e is this baseline

1232
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:26,720
prior

1233
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,280
and so you could modulate it so that the

1234
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,160
prior

1235
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,640
is relatively unperturbed by sensory

1236
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,440
outcomes

1237
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,119
or you could make it very sensitive to

1238
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,280
specific kinds of sensory outcomes

1239
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,040
so this is again like a modeling

1240
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,319
skeleton

1241
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,079
that potentially could be used to

1242
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,520
evaluate

1243
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,400
how different sorts of behavioral

1244
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,119
phenomena

1245
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,839
like approach and recede or something

1246
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,040
like that or freeze

1247
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,520
whatever it happens to be might be

1248
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,319
linked

1249
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,440
by the organism seeking precision

1250
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,280
on an estimate of how things are going

1251
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,800
to change in the niche given its policy

1252
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,400
so of course there's a lot to say

1253
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,760
because that's kind of an interesting

1254
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,560
area

1255
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,720
but that's just the third level so we're

1256
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,160
integrating policy decision

1257
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,520
into how states are changing through

1258
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,680
time and then policy decision

1259
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,920
is the interaction of several variables

1260
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,920
the baseline prior like the affordances

1261
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,880
the habit

1262
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,000
as some have said it here and then

1263
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,280
c the preferences phenotype congruent is

1264
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:25,920
like

1265
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,960
if if i'm a shoe size 10 i want a shoe

1266
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,319
size 10.

1267
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,359
then if you have a phenotypic preference

1268
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,599
that's different than what your actual

1269
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:39,599
niche or needs are then it will be

1270
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,839
ill-fit so you won't be fit for your

1271
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:42,720
niche

1272
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,040
so then the niche will be filled by

1273
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,240
those that are fit to it

1274
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,800
and then f of pi is similar like it's um

1275
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,880
calculating variational free energy

1276
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,319
which we can definitely ask the authors

1277
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,520
more about

1278
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,280
and see how that is related to

1279
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,359
calculation on a specific policy you

1280
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:02,319
know

1281
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,800
yeah okay any thoughts either of you

1282
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,240
well just one thing i think is quite

1283
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,200
helpful as well

1284
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,480
um is they they call that perceptual

1285
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,280
evidence uh the the variational free

1286
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,119
energy conditioned on a policy

1287
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,760
so it's like um and then that gives you

1288
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,680
the sort of perceptual evidence and then

1289
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,480
the actual

1290
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,359
action model which is kind of like the

1291
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,280
expected

1292
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,640
free energy and that helps sort of

1293
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,839
um show how free energy is coming in at

1294
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:33,200
this kind of

1295
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,760
larger time scale um and i suppose one

1296
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,839
thing just to mention to the viewers

1297
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,880
there is a whole load of nested free

1298
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,079
energy processes going into all of this

1299
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,400
process but at this scale that we're

1300
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,680
talking about

1301
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,920
it's so that we can understand in terms

1302
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,760
of policies

1303
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,200
that we're trying to understand

1304
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,680
sounds good and so yeah

1305
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,280
here you know um anyone who has small

1306
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,119
children knows that their feet grow very

1307
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,560
fast right so when we're talking about

1308
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,440
the action model

1309
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,240
expected free energy it's it's the

1310
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,920
expected free energy because i don't

1311
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,440
like the actual free energy can't really

1312
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,200
be measured in in this situation so

1313
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,800
we're dealing with expectation

1314
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,800
so there's this phenotypic risk

1315
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,240
component on the left side of the

1316
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:22,880
equation

1317
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,359
like how much money am i going to spend

1318
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:26,240
on

1319
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,000
these shoes and minus the the perceptual

1320
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,920
ambiguity like i think

1321
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,200
uh my kid is a size 13 but they might be

1322
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:35,760
a one

1323
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,079
or two how expensive are these shoes do

1324
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,599
i want to buy shoes that fit them right

1325
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,119
now or do i want to buy shoes

1326
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,480
that they can wear two pairs of socks

1327
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,920
with and wear for a little while so

1328
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,480
you're always

1329
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,040
weighing out this this risk and the

1330
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,000
ambiguity that

1331
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,440
that occurs okay in that specific

1332
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,400
example

1333
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,800
the specific policies are like okay i

1334
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,599
could ever

1335
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,160
measure the feet every day and that's my

1336
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,839
sensory outcome the hidden state is the

1337
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,560
true

1338
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,560
size of the foot and then every day my

1339
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,119
policy could be if they're in a new

1340
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,200
shoe size we change that day another

1341
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,319
policy with a different

1342
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:09,520
trade-off structure different

1343
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,359
measurement requirements might be

1344
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,839
every two shoe sizes another one might

1345
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,599
be when the perceived

1346
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,400
ill fitness is too high the squeaky

1347
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,839
wheel gets the grease

1348
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,000
then we have an action-oriented response

1349
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:22,880
policy

1350
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,640
and i'm going to be thinking about all

1351
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,160
the outcomes

1352
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,800
in this model and about the certainty on

1353
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,760
it so

1354
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,680
nice yeah i mean it also relates to that

1355
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,000
when my daughter has a big toe starts to

1356
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,880
get sore

1357
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,880
that's my perceptual evidence it's like

1358
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,160
okay it's like

1359
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,720
that shoe is rubbing a bit now so yeah

1360
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,160
at some point i've got to make a choice

1361
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,760
so that's a good that's a good example

1362
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,319
actually

1363
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,880
it's an error signal that it's ill fit

1364
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,480
into the policy and that's a niche

1365
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,559
modification with a shoe

1366
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,599
um but it's a similar idea so table

1367
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,800
three kind of goes through

1368
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,319
m3 in a little bit more detail

1369
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,359
and that brings us to figure three which

1370
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:02,559
is the fourth

1371
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,559
click of the active inference uh

1372
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,920
kind of chain here and it adds just

1373
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,119
two more letters it's mostly the same as

1374
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,160
figure two

1375
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,880
like the c g and the e which connect at

1376
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,200
pi

1377
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,079
that was my mistake in the 18 2 and i

1378
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:21,520
connected the e to the um

1379
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,400
g instead of the e to the pi um they're

1380
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,040
connected

1381
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,559
at the pi as shown here um the c g and e

1382
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:32,000
are now in m3 with a blue

1383
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,920
box and then m4 one more dependency is

1384
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,119
being clicked in here

1385
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,559
which is gamma which is being clicked to

1386
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:41,200
g

1387
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,599
so gamma is now an input to like a

1388
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:44,640
bigger g

1389
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,680
function so the each the g is

1390
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,240
is a function um which you know you

1391
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,040
could input just

1392
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,880
a number you could input a few depending

1393
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,480
on how you write it so

1394
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,240
this is a slightly more expressive

1395
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,359
g function because it includes this

1396
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:02,480
precision

1397
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,119
variable and gamma and b are kind of

1398
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,800
like one over each other

1399
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,880
the reason why it's kind of like when

1400
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,480
people take logs or do one

1401
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,960
one over or negative this it's just

1402
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,319
sometimes you want to get the most of

1403
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,079
something but it's easier to frame it as

1404
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,440
getting the least of something

1405
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,480
or vice versa um but what this gamma

1406
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,640
represents is the expected precision

1407
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,119
because um this is kind of certainty so

1408
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:29,200
this one is uncertainty

1409
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,079
so what would either you say about this

1410
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:32,640
final

1411
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,280
click to m4 blue or steve so this is so

1412
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,319
this is so fun

1413
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,960
so the gamma is like how much did that

1414
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,400
shoe not fit

1415
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,720
and the beta is like how fast are their

1416
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,720
feet growing right

1417
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,400
so i think that that's the i mean i

1418
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,599
guess beta doesn't take into

1419
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,200
consideration time but it was

1420
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,640
um it was described as a rate um

1421
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,000
it was described as a rate so maybe it

1422
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,960
does include time i'm not sure

1423
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,480
i don't want to go too too far down the

1424
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,599
rabbit hole with the shoes but it's

1425
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,160
almost like

1426
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,720
there's more precise shoes like you'd be

1427
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,160
more precise with the steel toe and then

1428
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,400
you could have the more stretchy

1429
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,640
no no no no one take this too seriously

1430
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,720
it's about what it actually does

1431
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,720
say which is basically the um precision

1432
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,359
which is the expected precision is in

1433
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:20,720
the gamma

1434
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,880
so that the uncertainty can be yeah in

1435
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,760
the b

1436
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,760
and this figure three the reason why

1437
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,680
they even went to this level of

1438
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,720
incrementing it out first off is to

1439
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,880
show us level by level how we're

1440
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,000
building on

1441
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,599
okay it's about a time series that's

1442
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,280
being predicted through time of sensory

1443
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,319
outcomes

1444
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:40,000
that are like generated from an

1445
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,640
underlying time series of hidden states

1446
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,720
vis-a-vis a likelihood mapping and a

1447
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,920
transition matrix

1448
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,680
and that's getting played into by priors

1449
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,040
at that s1

1450
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,720
level at the first state level and then

1451
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,839
there's policy that's the whole

1452
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:55,760
cybernetics control theory and then this

1453
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,599
is the machinery of the decision making

1454
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:58,640
and now we're just adding

1455
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,960
one more level which is the implicit

1456
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,480
metacognition

1457
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,319
so now we're adding this implicit kind

1458
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,160
of always on

1459
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,319
always being integrated into the model

1460
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:09,440
again not a

1461
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,240
disaster mode recovery mode for the

1462
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:12,880
otherwise

1463
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,960
non-affective agent but it's an

1464
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,319
affective agent

1465
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:19,359
whose implicit metacognition its

1466
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:22,480
kind of key regulator here is related to

1467
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:22,800
its

1468
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,680
certitude not the thermometer's tracking

1469
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,720
the average

1470
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,520
of um it's its returns on investment or

1471
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,720
its average estimate

1472
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,520
but its uncertainty in its generative

1473
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,640
model

1474
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,760
so that's what we get to with

1475
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,880
their figure three with a fourth click

1476
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,559
so wait wait i think we need to talk

1477
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,480
about here uh because it's the first

1478
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,839
time that it comes up

1479
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:49,119
is there um affective charge

1480
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,559
here oh yes so in this in this model

1481
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,480
and which also m4 really is the top

1482
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,040
level illustrating like the hierarchical

1483
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,280
um hierarchical nature or the nested

1484
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,040
nature of how this model is

1485
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,160
is normally and then in the effective

1486
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:06,960
charge

1487
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,800
it's it's described here as phenotypic

1488
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,520
phenotypic progress which is the policy

1489
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,880
in the prior minus the policy in the

1490
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,000
posterior

1491
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,119
and then the free the free energy of the

1492
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,680
prior posterior minus the prior wait no

1493
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,480
i said that wrong

1494
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,800
prior minus the posterior there it is

1495
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,520
yep here here it is in table four

1496
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,520
so let's look at what they say so

1497
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,599
expected precision is gamma

1498
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,839
okay looks like a little dart gamma

1499
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:38,640
precision

1500
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,359
you want more precision in an optimistic

1501
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:42,880
world model

1502
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,800
and policy pi okay and it turns out that

1503
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,240
gamma the expected precision is one over

1504
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,280
a gamma distribution that's gonna be the

1505
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,160
beta

1506
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,160
and that's just gonna be a statistical

1507
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,359
distribution that

1508
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,200
plays nicely with statistics just like

1509
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,960
you see like natural log like the gamma

1510
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,640
the normal these are

1511
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,880
tools that statisticians use and so they

1512
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,160
kind of

1513
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,400
work here but we can ask the authors to

1514
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,400
what extent does it have to be this way

1515
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,160
but anyways gamma is the expected

1516
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,440
precision so

1517
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,880
gamma and beta we can kind of think

1518
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,319
about them as like linked because again

1519
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:17,680
they're one over each other

1520
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,520
so wherever you see a gamma or beta it

1521
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,800
could just be replaced with the other

1522
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,760
one

1523
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,200
and affective charge is being um

1524
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,200
defined as yeah the the uh change in the

1525
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,759
policy

1526
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,240
multiplied by the free energy of that

1527
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,480
policy

1528
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,040
so not just if if it's good but

1529
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,240
unchanging

1530
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,119
then this is gonna cancel out so the

1531
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,040
phenotypic progress is low

1532
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,440
if you expect you know the 10 bitcoin

1533
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,800
and you see them

1534
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,520
and you're not changing your policy in

1535
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:51,920
this

1536
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,520
formulation that's why we don't need to

1537
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,960
tie it too closely to a specific

1538
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,559
emotional experiences because those are

1539
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:58,079
going to always be super

1540
00:53:58,079 --> 00:53:59,599
subjective and require a ton more

1541
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,839
specification but we're just kind of

1542
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:05,520
broadly calling this ac variable

1543
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,280
something that's related to both the way

1544
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,800
that the phenotype is changing the

1545
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,240
policy is changing

1546
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,079
and the way that the free energy

1547
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:15,920
estimating of that policy is changing

1548
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,599
but there's something important to note

1549
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,200
in that equation is if the policy

1550
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,079
doesn't change

1551
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:25,839
then the affect of charge is zero

1552
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,640
yes and let's again let's have the

1553
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,000
authors give us

1554
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,680
the authoritative um uh information on

1555
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,440
how to read some of these terms

1556
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,160
but here is what they said about that

1557
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,319
step four

1558
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,319
the fourth level which is again this

1559
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:45,839
gamma precision

1560
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,680
is required to enable the asian to

1561
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,599
estimate its own success which could be

1562
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,440
thought of a minimal form of implicit

1563
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,319
non-reportable metacognition so even to

1564
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:55,119
be able to

1565
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:58,640
semantically express metacognition like

1566
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,400
i am unsure that sentence

1567
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,520
is many levels or another level

1568
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,400
away from just this precision variable

1569
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,920
which is like an in it doesn't have a

1570
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:10,960
self report

1571
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,280
circuit this is just like a model that

1572
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,880
has an error term that it's

1573
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,440
updating at a slightly higher level than

1574
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:22,160
just the likelihood mapping and

1575
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,280
the expected precision term that's gamma

1576
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,160
reflects

1577
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,839
prior confidence in the expected free

1578
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:29,760
energy over policies

1579
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,520
the expected precision term modulates

1580
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,359
the influence of expected free energy

1581
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:34,000
and policy

1582
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,640
selection relative to the fixed form

1583
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,920
policy prior

1584
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,280
e sub pi which is the habits or that the

1585
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,240
prior

1586
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,240
so it's kind of like should i fall back

1587
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,839
to priors

1588
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:49,440
or should i go with what

1589
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,799
the g function lean into what my

1590
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:56,079
g is telling me then

1591
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:59,040
um yeah formulated this way we can think

1592
00:55:59,040 --> 00:55:59,920
of

1593
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,920
of gamma the precision as an internal

1594
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,520
estimate of model fitness subjective

1595
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,799
fitness

1596
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:07,520
so higher precision my internal model is

1597
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,200
doing better

1598
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,200
lower precision my internal model is

1599
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,640
doing relatively worse

1600
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,520
than it could be it represents an

1601
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,720
estimate of confidence

1602
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,920
in m4 that fourth click in the phenotype

1603
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,599
congruent model of actions

1604
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,599
given the inferred hidden states of the

1605
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,119
environment so they kind of

1606
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,440
tessellate it back out there they're

1607
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,160
saying

1608
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,280
it's about those outcomes and about what

1609
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,240
generates them

1610
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,520
and how those change and how our

1611
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,599
policies play into it and

1612
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,520
it's about how certain we are in that

1613
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,960
generative model

1614
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,400
and there's a lot of ways the

1615
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,760
environment can change so if we're

1616
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,839
getting good data from our observation

1617
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:45,599
then we should be reasonably confident

1618
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,520
with staying with what works to some

1619
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,799
extent

1620
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:51,680
but if that should change there should

1621
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,280
be another mode

1622
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,559
that allows us to rebalance

1623
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:00,160
preferences affordances um

1624
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,319
and integrate that in a different way in

1625
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,240
a different allocation

1626
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,040
to our policies

1627
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:10,799
and then to emphasize its relation to

1628
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:12,319
valence in our formulation remember

1629
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:14,000
valence is like feeling good or bad

1630
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,880
positive negative going forward we refer

1631
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:17,680
to gamma

1632
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,680
updates using this term affective charge

1633
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,839
so here's ac affective charges change

1634
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:28,720
in beta aka change and gamma in a just

1635
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,040
another way of saying it it's change in

1636
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,160
precision

1637
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,720
and then you can imagine if if the

1638
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,559
precision goes up it's going to be good

1639
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:39,440
precision going down bad and flip it for

1640
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,280
the one over or however it ends up being

1641
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,000
written

1642
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,319
but that's what it's getting at when the

1643
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:46,720
precision is going up

1644
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,920
as new data are coming in like they're

1645
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,280
you know i'm thinking of a slot machine

1646
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,799
and then it's like oh you won something

1647
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:54,319
and now the second digit is going to

1648
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:55,760
spin

1649
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,240
so there's both an increase in charge

1650
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,839
and then that like kind of restabilizes

1651
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:00,799
and now

1652
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:02,319
it's about whether that changes again or

1653
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,640
whether the second digit is better

1654
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,720
and so that is how affective charge is

1655
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,000
being tracked through time

1656
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,119
with these gamma updates

1657
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:13,359
okay any thoughts or continue 32 well i

1658
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:15,520
think well i think the one thing that

1659
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,720
sort of i find helpful here in this here

1660
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,119
is

1661
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:22,400
it's it's the general overarching active

1662
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,520
inference

1663
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,799
um parameter of uncertainty

1664
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:29,920
is like it's it's they're using the term

1665
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,799
confidence and precision more at these

1666
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,400
higher levels because it's like a

1667
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,920
meta intern is still at some level

1668
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,640
uh an interpretation of uncertainty but

1669
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,880
because it's on policies in that

1670
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,319
confidence and precision

1671
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,280
are at play because you're interpreting

1672
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,079
your ability

1673
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:53,280
to act not just the raw

1674
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,799
sensory sort of mellow so to speak

1675
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,400
right there's a big difference between

1676
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,480
like visual uncertainty it's just

1677
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,839
two shades of grey and they're so

1678
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,200
similar you just don't know what you

1679
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,559
don't even see a difference

1680
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:07,359
versus two strategies two chess moves

1681
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:08,720
that are very different and you're just

1682
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,400
not sure which one to do

1683
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,400
that's a very different situation for

1684
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,520
inference

1685
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,760
because the way that your eye scans on

1686
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,559
the page

1687
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,559
is kind of reversible you get you're

1688
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:19,839
getting to retract your

1689
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:22,000
your choices but with strategy it might

1690
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,040
be very irreversible very non-linear

1691
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,680
um okay here's another example they give

1692
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,280
on 32.

1693
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,040
so this carrying on right below equation

1694
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,200
3.1 which was

1695
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,759
screenshot there so um

1696
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,280
ac can only be non-zero when the

1697
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,799
inferred policies are different from the

1698
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:44,000
expected policies

1699
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,559
so blue that's what you had said so if

1700
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,520
it's sort of

1701
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,599
at the bottom of the bowl from a policy

1702
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,440
perspective thermodynamically

1703
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,000
it's not moving the delta is zero it's

1704
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,520
positive when perceptual

1705
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,440
agents when it is positive when

1706
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,280
perceptual evidence favors an agent's

1707
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,920
action model and negative otherwise

1708
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,400
so it's like are the data coming in

1709
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,440
locally

1710
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,839
good for my model or locally not

1711
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:09,359
congruent with my model

1712
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:11,119
in other words positive and negative ac

1713
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:12,880
corresponds respectively

1714
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,799
to increase and decrease confidence in

1715
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:16,400
one's action model

1716
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,960
so as the data are increasingly good you

1717
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,200
actually like lean into your model

1718
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,079
and prioritize that prediction and then

1719
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:24,799
you kind of

1720
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:26,880
start maybe overfitting and then maybe

1721
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,000
the model has to pull

1722
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,559
back and rely a little bit on something

1723
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:31,119
different

1724
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:34,559
to to re-equilibrate that to stay on

1725
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:37,280
this multi-dimensional front with model

1726
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:37,839
fit

1727
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:41,119
and optimal learning so that's

1728
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,200
one of the ways that active inference is

1729
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,440
rethinking the explore exploit

1730
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,760
is by relying on the generative model

1731
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,839
and then the trade-off with different

1732
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:51,200
ways the generative model can get

1733
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,839
combined with priors you can get

1734
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:55,599
explore and exploit behavior as well as

1735
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:57,119
a lot of other modes and a rapid

1736
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,720
switching that's informed

1737
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,640
by the instantaneous performance of a

1738
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,640
model

1739
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,359
um then they give some examples of

1740
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:08,000
different a prey and a predator animal

1741
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,720
okay and then here's three any yeah any

1742
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,319
thoughts on that before five three

1743
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:15,200
okay five three affective charge lies in

1744
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,480
the mind of the beholder

1745
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,119
so that's cool because it shows that the

1746
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:20,559
authors in this research

1747
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:24,160
line have taken up the

1748
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,359
challenge of ecological psychology or

1749
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:29,920
of action-oriented philosophy or

1750
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,599
whatever it happens to be it's like

1751
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:33,359
this relational insight that these

1752
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:35,440
variables have to be about the beholder

1753
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,920
and their relationship to a situation

1754
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,359
partially for computational

1755
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:41,599
tractability and partially just because

1756
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:42,400
it's kind of

1757
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,160
how these systems seem to be we are

1758
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,839
modeling things that are in the mind of

1759
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:49,599
the beholder so it's always going to be

1760
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:51,760
with the situation and the context and

1761
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,119
we're always going to have to go in

1762
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:56,559
to the specifics um

1763
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:57,839
but we're also going to find the

1764
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,319
patterns that are similar for example we

1765
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:00,799
all

1766
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:02,559
as they say tend to experience a rush of

1767
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,160
satisfaction

1768
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,160
not five hours of satisfaction unless it

1769
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,760
was a long jigsaw

1770
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,440
when we solve a puzzle or understand the

1771
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,680
punchline of a joke or act of inference

1772
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,839
an aha moment our explanation is

1773
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:14,720
straightforward

1774
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,720
in active inference biologically

1775
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,480
plausible forms of cognition

1776
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,920
inevitably involve policy selection

1777
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,400
policy as fundamental so policy is not

1778
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,480
the disaster mode this is as fundamental

1779
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,200
as affect

1780
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,119
whether those policy internal selections

1781
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,119
the selections are internal

1782
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:34,720
citation citation citation or external

1783
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:38,880
period therefore ac is also elicited by

1784
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,160
mental action

1785
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,160
typically in form of top down modulation

1786
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,079
of lower level priors

1787
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,319
i'm getting the lower level pain signal

1788
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:48,079
i shan't not think of it

1789
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:51,520
and then now i'm feeling better

1790
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,880
as that is top down prior is influencing

1791
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,880
the bottom-up signals just to give one

1792
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,000
example

1793
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,680
so this is like bringing a lot of pretty

1794
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,480
interesting areas together

1795
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,920
especially because again it's not just

1796
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,920
about humans as cognitive agents this is

1797
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:06,640
about

1798
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,520
a scale-free formulation for how

1799
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,039
affective charge works in active

1800
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:12,000
inference

1801
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,640
but we can look at the specific example

1802
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:15,599
that they do

1803
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:19,039
provide with the simulation

1804
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,559
so blue

1805
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:28,400
any thoughts here or on figure five as

1806
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,680
far as what they do in the simulation

1807
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,520
um maybe should we go through the

1808
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,960
simulation first do you have that figure

1809
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:35,680
up or no

1810
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,720
yes i think it's is it this one

1811
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:42,079
yeah figure four okay sorry yeah

1812
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,000
yeah i think that yeah that's probably

1813
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,760
better um

1814
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,559
so in this simulation the way that they

1815
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:49,760
set up the teammates

1816
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,039
is um it's a rat or it could be i mean

1817
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:54,880
it's a simulated agent right so it could

1818
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,160
be a router it could be an ant or it

1819
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:56,640
could be

1820
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,520
anything in a maze where on one side of

1821
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,599
the maze is food

1822
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:03,760
or so the mouse is placed in the middle

1823
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:04,880
of the maze and

1824
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,359
on the north end say you have on the

1825
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,520
left side food and on the right side a

1826
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,480
shock

1827
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,280
and on the south end there is an

1828
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,640
informational cue

1829
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,920
about whether the or about which side

1830
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,559
the food is on as opposed to the shock

1831
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:23,599
and so the food location changes over

1832
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:27,200
the trials uh and then the um

1833
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,039
the subject is allowed to move

1834
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:30,480
themselves and so

1835
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,760
typically the subject checks the uh

1836
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,839
queue and then gets the reward so

1837
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,119
there's like some

1838
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:40,400
there's a uh and a reward

1839
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,000
for like you don't get shocked

1840
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,839
accidentally if you first go see which

1841
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:44,640
side

1842
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,520
that the food is on so how the cue is

1843
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,319
associated

1844
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:50,480
how the cue is associated with decision

1845
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,839
making well if

1846
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:54,079
if they know to epistemically forage

1847
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:56,079
like that that's more valuable than

1848
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:57,760
you know accidentally getting shocked

1849
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,440
then they go to do that but i think in

1850
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,520
the trials they changed they kept the

1851
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,280
location of food consistent

1852
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,680
for many trials and then they changed it

1853
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,039
for for many trials

1854
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:09,599
and so that the mouse had to relearn

1855
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:11,039
what to do

1856
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:14,079
yep so let's just imagine the food was

1857
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:15,440
always on the left side

1858
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,039
never changed well as soon as you went

1859
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:18,799
to the left side 10 times you'd be like

1860
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:21,599
i don't even need that q anymore it's

1861
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:23,440
kind of useless info gain it's going to

1862
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,240
be not good

1863
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,319
time spent so i should just go for the

1864
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:27,359
policy of going

1865
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:29,119
right for the food now if it was

1866
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:30,799
switching every time

1867
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:32,400
it would make sense every time if the

1868
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,480
shock was painful to get that cue

1869
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,760
every time so the mouse is able to

1870
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,839
in one way make a binary decision which

1871
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,119
arm to follow

1872
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,440
for the food but also there's this

1873
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,200
higher order decision

1874
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,680
about getting information and actually

1875
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,799
in the active

1876
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,359
infra infrarents the ant paper that i

1877
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:52,559
did with some of these

1878
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:55,359
um co-authors we also used a tea maze

1879
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:56,160
but there was no

1880
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,440
metacognition there was just the

1881
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,760
stigmargy of the colony

1882
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,280
so the teammates is really a

1883
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,280
generalizable framework

1884
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,000
and once you have the code to make the

1885
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,359
teammates

1886
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:09,280
you can just make basically anything

1887
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,559
it's just like

1888
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,960
any other shape maze is just another

1889
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,559
matrix so this is again

1890
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:17,039
it's like an initial foray and the

1891
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,480
places where people see that it's

1892
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,760
lacking like that's where we want to

1893
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:20,240
kind of

1894
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,200
build in the gaps let's get to a little

1895
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:23,680
more

1896
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,960
formal view of how you make

1897
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,079
that active infrarat

1898
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:33,200
that is doing the act of inference on

1899
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,319
this foraging

1900
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:37,119
decision so this is a there's a bunch of

1901
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:37,760
sections

1902
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,359
to this figure and

1903
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:42,640
blue would you say it's better yeah i

1904
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,400
think five is better before seven

1905
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,079
right yeah okay so there is um

1906
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:51,200
a generative model uh

1907
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,119
first off i mean there's a lot of entry

1908
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:54,720
points people should check out the model

1909
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:55,839
and just read it themselves because it

1910
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:56,559
will take

1911
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:58,400
there's a lot of ways to enter into it

1912
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,680
but one thing to notice

1913
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:03,359
is this c the preference over outcomes

1914
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:05,520
if it's not if it's food it has a plus

1915
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,599
four points shock is negative six

1916
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:09,119
these are just numbers you can make it

1917
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:10,960
scaled differently and then if it's not

1918
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,079
a shock or food it's

1919
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:14,799
zero and then also it doesn't have a

1920
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:17,280
preference for going left or right

1921
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,599
so these you can already see are some of

1922
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:21,280
like the little atoms

1923
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,839
that are going to get fed into a bigger

1924
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,039
model

1925
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:27,520
so this bigger model is going to be able

1926
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:28,720
to take

1927
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,520
kind of these variables like how much is

1928
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,599
the relative weighting of

1929
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:36,319
the food versus the um lightning bolt or

1930
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,160
is there an implicit preference for one

1931
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:41,280
side versus another and then here the

1932
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,799
prior d

1933
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:45,200
the priors that they're 50 50 that it's

1934
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,400
on either side

1935
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,240
but again that's actually different than

1936
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,520
a preference

1937
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,680
for left or right branch is different

1938
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:52,960
than a belief

1939
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,880
that it's likely to be on the left or

1940
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,240
right branch

1941
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,280
so we can separate out those two

1942
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,039
variables i wish it were this

1943
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:02,720
temperature that's my preference

1944
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,440
but i'm very accurate that it's not that

1945
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,280
and that's why i'm sad

1946
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,440
so then you can talk about those kinds

1947
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,960
of combinations

1948
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:15,039
of different parts of the model

1949
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:18,238
and uh b so that's d and c b

1950
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:21,279
is the state transitions and so these

1951
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:21,839
are

1952
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:23,679
it's kind of like a second level matrix

1953
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,198
and this is kind of it's it's like a

1954
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:25,759
cube

1955
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:26,960
if you think about it's like a four by

1956
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,960
four by four because there's four

1957
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,479
positions it can be in

1958
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:32,799
the waiting position that's this front

1959
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:33,920
one

1960
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,920
then it can go to left to the right or

1961
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,359
to the bottom

1962
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:39,600
and then there are state transitions

1963
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,040
that are defined

1964
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,359
like if you go from the center to the to

1965
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:44,319
the left branch

1966
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:46,080
that's going to be a defined move in a

1967
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,759
matrix that you can make

1968
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:50,399
then a is the mapping between where

1969
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:51,600
you're at

1970
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,080
and whether you get the cue left or

1971
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:54,960
right

1972
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,040
so that's the info that you'd get on the

1973
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,120
bottom the south branch

1974
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,520
and then the reward or the punishment

1975
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,040
and that's the likelihood mapping

1976
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,120
whether you go to the left or the right

1977
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,880
regardless of whether you got the q or

1978
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,439
not and then e is that baseline prior

1979
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:10,319
over policies

1980
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:13,359
which um is just it's even here they're

1981
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:14,399
all 2.3

1982
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:16,000
we could ask what is the effect of

1983
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,679
different values it might make

1984
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:19,759
you know you could work that through in

1985
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:21,040
your head a little bit

1986
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,238
but it could be different but here

1987
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:27,359
all of the expressivity is in the other

1988
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,679
parts like the preference for the um

1989
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:30,399
reward

1990
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,799
over the shock so one doesn't need to

1991
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:33,839
specify like

1992
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:36,640
yes and i'd rather you know take a left

1993
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,799
turn at this exit while i'm going there

1994
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,399
but that could be specified because

1995
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:41,920
again it's just sort of a

1996
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:45,679
um skeletal model of this scenario

1997
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:47,040
any thoughts on this before we go to

1998
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,719
seven

1999
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:51,040
nice but isn't it it's cool model and

2000
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,198
it's nice how even with only four

2001
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:56,320
locations there's so much richness in

2002
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,440
the behavior

2003
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,719
so shows you don't need the little

2004
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:00,640
scurrying animal

2005
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,560
to simulate the spatial dynamics of the

2006
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,520
maze because then you're going to get

2007
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,239
trapped up

2008
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:07,120
oh is it a narrow chamber or a broad one

2009
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,080
but this helps you

2010
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,640
look more semantically perhaps at the

2011
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,239
way that the agents interact with their

2012
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:13,199
environment

2013
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:16,800
okay so now on seven

2014
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,480
um blue do you want to say the two

2015
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,560
halves of seven

2016
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:23,360
yeah so this uh part of seven this is

2017
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:23,679
the

2018
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:25,280
the generative model that they've

2019
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,760
created for aspect of inference and

2020
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,920
the next slide is going to talk about

2021
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,360
all of the different

2022
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:34,960
uh matrices that go into producing

2023
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,239
this model so that's why i don't know

2024
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:40,080
maybe it's this one maybe this is better

2025
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:40,719
first

2026
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:44,480
go forward um so the uh here the

2027
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,960
the different matrices that go into the

2028
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,640
the larger model in figure seven

2029
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:52,080
include the prior expectations d2

2030
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,560
for any initial states so that's this uh

2031
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,159
top left and then the second one which

2032
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:58,320
is down here on the bottom

2033
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,320
is the affect of prior which is the

2034
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,800
likelihood matrix reflecting some degree

2035
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,640
of uncertainty in the predictions which

2036
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,120
was

2037
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,080
also shown in figure 5 multiplied by

2038
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,400
that beta

2039
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,880
and sets the expectation on expected

2040
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:13,679
sets the

2041
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:16,000
expected precision so which varies

2042
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:16,880
between

2043
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,640
negative point five which would be a

2044
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,480
negative um

2045
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,800
a valence and then uh two which is

2046
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,640
positive valence

2047
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,640
uh and then this contextual prior is

2048
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,000
this matrix

2049
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,120
aac a to the c

2050
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,800
for the likelihood mapping from the

2051
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,960
context states to the lower level

2052
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,440
uh reflecting the fact that the agent is

2053
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,960
always certain which context they

2054
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,800
observed after the trial is over so they

2055
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,400
either got the food or the shock and

2056
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,199
they know that

2057
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:45,920
right and then this last one is the

2058
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,440
state transitions

2059
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:50,719
b b2 b to the two um

2060
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:52,239
and this is state transitions at the

2061
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:54,080
second level reflecting

2062
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,800
a couple of assumptions that both the

2063
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:57,520
affective

2064
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,560
and contextual straight states vary but

2065
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,239
have some stability across

2066
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:05,920
trials 0.2 to 0.3 probability of change

2067
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,800
and that the agent has a positivity bias

2068
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:09,120
in

2069
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,560
the sense that they are more likely to

2070
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,719
switch from a negative to a positive

2071
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:15,199
state than vice versa

2072
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:18,560
thank you blue so what's happening in

2073
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:22,320
seven is we're adding um another level

2074
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:25,440
so here we see that beta and gamma

2075
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,560
being connected to the whole cge policy

2076
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,920
and then that rake formation

2077
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,320
and now we're going to tie in this

2078
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,480
implicit metacognitive layer with

2079
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,080
another hidden state

2080
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,840
so that introduces this parentheses

2081
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,440
notation where

2082
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,520
if there's a parenthesis it means which

2083
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,480
level

2084
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:47,440
of the nested markov decision process it

2085
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:48,159
is

2086
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:51,600
so that the s that we knew and loved

2087
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,040
that was giving rise to the sensory

2088
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,280
outcomes is now s one

2089
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,600
and that's the first level of the model

2090
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,560
and then

2091
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:02,400
the s that is given rise

2092
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,440
to the precision is

2093
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:09,280
s2 the hidden state so that is now

2094
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,360
what is being called the implicit

2095
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,280
metacognitive component

2096
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:16,560
which is the second level of the model s

2097
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,600
upper score two which has its own prior

2098
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:20,159
d

2099
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:22,960
upper two just like this has a d upper

2100
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:23,280
one

2101
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,960
it's actually not shown here but it is

2102
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,600
there um

2103
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,040
there are uh the same

2104
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,120
markov decision process structure is

2105
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,320
being recapitulated

2106
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,239
but there's a different interpretation

2107
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:38,800
because the hidden states at one level

2108
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,560
are now the observations linked through

2109
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,360
an a at the next level

2110
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,199
so here's the observations like what

2111
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:46,719
square am i on

2112
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:48,560
the sensory outcome am i and then a

2113
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,000
hidden state what kind of square am i

2114
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,199
on and then that's getting mapped to

2115
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:55,920
am i happy or what that's the whole

2116
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,520
question of this paper is what does this

2117
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,239
actual

2118
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:01,440
second state yep stephen oh yep

2119
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,719
now yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna have to

2120
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:04,960
head out sorry thank you peace thanks a

2121
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,199
lot yeah thank you bye

2122
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:09,040
so then you get all these kind of

2123
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,960
interesting uh

2124
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,800
different kinds of matrices at the

2125
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,719
second level like

2126
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:17,440
given that i went left and the food was

2127
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:17,920
left

2128
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,000
then will i find out about that and so

2129
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,159
you need a few matrices to kind of close

2130
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:24,239
the doors and make the model run

2131
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:25,600
but that's a little bit on the

2132
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,880
implementation details and we'll

2133
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:27,520
probably learn

2134
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,640
from the authors and in 10 we kind of

2135
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,320
just have a summary

2136
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,679
this is i think a great figure because

2137
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:38,560
it shows how multiple time scales of

2138
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,960
nested processes are linked

2139
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,360
from the inheritance of prior phenotypes

2140
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,080
like how big

2141
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,080
is that foot and also development

2142
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:49,120
learning like how fast does it change

2143
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:52,800
get linked in through multiple levels

2144
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,080
that are getting nested closer and

2145
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,239
closer to action and perception

2146
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:58,719
in the loop and then rippling back out

2147
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:00,640
so pretty nice overarching

2148
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,199
figure any thoughts on this or continue

2149
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:05,199
on blue

2150
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:07,199
this just really like like like you said

2151
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:08,800
it's a nice figure a good summary and

2152
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,159
just reflects like the deep

2153
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:13,040
temporal like nature of this model that

2154
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:13,679
they've

2155
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:16,800
built next let's uh go through the

2156
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,640
results of the simulation and then just

2157
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,679
deal with a few

2158
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,080
little further implications and then

2159
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,280
that will be a nice

2160
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:26,560
19. so in figure 6 they

2161
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:30,080
simulate out that scenario that we just

2162
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,840
talked through a few times with the maze

2163
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,280
for 32 trials

2164
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,199
with food located on the left side so

2165
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:36,640
this was just testing

2166
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,760
that it will converge to expecting the

2167
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:40,640
left side

2168
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,159
this was kind of like a little sanity

2169
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:43,840
check for their model

2170
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:47,199
but also it shows that we're doing this

2171
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:50,560
in the in the broader spm toolkit

2172
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,040
and so that means that a lot of these

2173
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:53,840
things

2174
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:57,199
like the um ability to visualize and

2175
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:58,960
easily run these models

2176
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,480
and check that they're complete and

2177
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,880
debug them and run them at scale

2178
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,920
a lot of these things that tie up a lot

2179
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:06,880
of innovating

2180
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,960
innovative modeling efforts a lot of

2181
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,280
those are simplified somewhat and

2182
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,920
again we'll ask the authors about this

2183
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,440
um

2184
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,440
so they simulated in figure 6 just to

2185
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,280
show that they could do different

2186
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,280
policies from the exploratory policy

2187
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,800
in the first 12 and then switching over

2188
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,560
to just the go left

2189
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:27,679
policy okay figure eight

2190
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:31,199
anything to say blue

2191
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,280
no okay yep so figure eight they're kind

2192
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:35,760
of just

2193
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:39,120
giving a few trajectories of what can

2194
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:39,679
happen

2195
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:41,760
so it's it's characterizing the model in

2196
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,199
a little bit of a playful way but i

2197
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:43,840
think it's

2198
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,920
fair and as we'll see it's it's at least

2199
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,560
computationally warranted

2200
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:52,719
so here we have initially anxious

2201
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:55,520
the state is negative for the first

2202
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:56,719
eight time steps

2203
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:59,120
whereas getting the q and the left side

2204
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,120
and then it develops confidence

2205
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,440
and then the green line here in eight is

2206
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,159
where

2207
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:08,560
the um the situation changes

2208
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,719
so then there's a few time steps where

2209
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:12,000
it still hasn't

2210
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,640
caught on before it gets shocked and

2211
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:15,280
then

2212
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,800
it gets anxious again and it gets

2213
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,480
renewed confidence

2214
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,840
so this is capturing a few of the

2215
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,520
just like with the ants how we showed

2216
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,679
how it could switch arms

2217
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:28,080
here they're showing not just that it

2218
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,320
that that it can switch arms from

2219
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:33,840
q and left left and stuck then the shock

2220
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,640
unsticks it it's like whoa i was very

2221
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:37,040
sure

2222
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,199
that going left was the right decision i

2223
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,560
got shocked

2224
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,360
now i need to go take the q and not just

2225
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,120
one time i'm going to get the cue

2226
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,000
multiple times

2227
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,760
okay i think that i have renewed

2228
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,320
confidence in this direction

2229
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:53,600
so it's really nice model behavior

2230
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,320
yeah what do you think blue so they did

2231
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:56,800
um

2232
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,560
actually there's one thing and so it's

2233
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,159
not showing here maybe it's gonna show

2234
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:01,920
in figure nine but maybe they

2235
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,320
um maybe they i don't know if they

2236
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,600
showed it in the figure or maybe

2237
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,400
we'll just let the authors talk about it

2238
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,600
yeah

2239
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:13,199
so about the model that lacked the the

2240
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:15,679
last level the metacognition about like

2241
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:16,239
so

2242
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:18,480
in one of the models they took that that

2243
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:21,120
highest level of integration away

2244
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,840
um to see if the mouse would similarly

2245
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,600
adapt so here they changed the position

2246
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,360
of the food right in this in the top

2247
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:28,640
right figure

2248
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,080
so they changed the position of food it

2249
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,120
was always on the left always on the

2250
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,320
left always on the left the mouse

2251
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,920
adapted it didn't even go look for the

2252
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:34,400
cue

2253
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:38,840
and then in the the model without that

2254
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,719
metacognition the model thought the

2255
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:42,800
metacognition didn't adapt to going to

2256
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,159
look for the queue like they just like

2257
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:46,000
stayed stuck in the middle like not sure

2258
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:46,800
do i

2259
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,000
i don't know if i should go up or go

2260
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,920
down i thought that that was really like

2261
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,600
funny so so this is what happened with

2262
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,199
the metacognition initially anxious

2263
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:54,480
developed confidence

2264
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,840
anxious again and then renewed

2265
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,080
confidence but in the model that left

2266
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:58,640
that

2267
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,040
uh that integration that metacognition

2268
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:02,640
it didn't it just like stayed stuck in

2269
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:03,600
the middle i thought that that was a

2270
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:04,480
very like

2271
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,800
cool anomalous effect and like a really

2272
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,239
neat control like

2273
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:11,600
trial for for this um test nice

2274
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,600
and it actually relates again to this

2275
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:16,000
idea that affect or anxiety is

2276
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,239
in the loop and it's something that's a

2277
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:19,520
continuous variable

2278
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:23,040
and in uh you know healthy settings we

2279
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:23,920
could say

2280
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:27,360
maybe anxiety is actually warranted here

2281
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,040
there was a shock in a strategy that was

2282
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,080
pre there's nothing wrong with a

2283
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,360
strategy that works

2284
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:32,640
and there's nothing wrong with switching

2285
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,640
strategies when it doesn't work

2286
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,040
but there is some variable whether we

2287
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,640
associate it with suffering

2288
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,480
again that's a second question but there

2289
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,560
is some feeling

2290
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:45,199
or some computational need for the

2291
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:46,719
system to actually

2292
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:50,000
pull back and re-weight how it

2293
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,400
uses its prior evidence versus how it

2294
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,560
deals with incoming evidence

2295
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,679
so i think this is a really nice example

2296
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:00,000
of just the categorical the discrete

2297
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,360
kinds of behavior

2298
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:02,960
that are very different from low

2299
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,679
precision and

2300
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:08,400
negative valence and then a kind of

2301
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,520
phase transition

2302
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:12,480
rapidly into a stable phase into

2303
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,000
negative and back again

2304
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,080
and integrating it with decision making

2305
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,280
with as they say

2306
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,520
early on the imperative is that

2307
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,960
reduction of uncertainty with the

2308
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:22,159
generative model

2309
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:25,199
not maximize reward not minimize

2310
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:25,920
suffering

2311
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,960
either but actually to optimize

2312
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,159
its precision aka reduce its uncertainty

2313
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:35,520
about a generative model of

2314
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,360
the states of the world including its

2315
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,600
own action so it's just really

2316
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,719
nice work some of the reasons why

2317
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:45,199
active inference is so cool actually and

2318
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:46,639
then figure 9

2319
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:49,760
they simulate 64 trials oh i think this

2320
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,440
is what you were speaking to

2321
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,840
an affective agent plotted in orange and

2322
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,400
an agent without higher level contextual

2323
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:59,760
and affective states plotted in gray

2324
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,199
so there's it's um i mean one could look

2325
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:05,280
at figure 9 a little more closely to see

2326
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,400
the difference

2327
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,800
but yes the expectations in like just

2328
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,080
looking at the top one

2329
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,480
the expected food location they both

2330
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,239
converge to left

2331
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:16,080
and the per the orange goes a little bit

2332
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,840
higher so it learns a little faster it's

2333
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,360
like yeah i'm doing really well on this

2334
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:19,920
test

2335
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:22,320
this is an easy course then the green

2336
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,600
line happens

2337
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,600
and the gray one slowly updates it's

2338
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,600
like hey i've been right for you know 20

2339
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,040
and i was only wrong twice

2340
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,880
so i'm at 90 percent what's the issue

2341
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,000
and the orange one's like whoa

2342
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:32,880
something's wrong

2343
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,639
because i'm getting error signals when i

2344
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:36,639
wasn't so and the green line here

2345
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:38,480
represents the food changing right like

2346
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:39,840
that's the context switch i just wanted

2347
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,360
to contextualize yes

2348
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,600
yes the context reversal so it was on

2349
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,440
the left and now it's on the right aka i

2350
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:46,800
got a shock

2351
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,159
and so then also look at this the

2352
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:50,480
affective charge the orange one

2353
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,840
anxiety drop

2354
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,199
uh blissful ignorance anxiety drop and

2355
01:21:57,199 --> 01:21:58,320
then the gray one

2356
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,080
doesn't have affect so we don't see it

2357
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,600
there but then

2358
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,239
um yeah or the gray ones uh affective

2359
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:05,520
charge is actually a little bit all over

2360
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,440
the place but we can ask them what that

2361
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:10,719
uh means and uh so yeah

2362
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:13,840
pretty it's it is super interesting

2363
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:17,280
because like learning you know

2364
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,440
even organic chemistry is an emotional

2365
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,480
learning process

2366
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:23,760
so how actually affect and policy and

2367
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,679
mental effort and all these things come

2368
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:27,679
together it's kind of cool

2369
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:29,600
i wonder if this is like just like to

2370
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:30,719
take it to the like

2371
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:33,840
meta level like is it like um

2372
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,920
you know self-reflection right like what

2373
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,920
at what level of integration is that

2374
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,360
right like so you do the action you

2375
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,480
select the policy and i

2376
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,320
think that my doing team mazes don't

2377
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,600
self-reflect but like

2378
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,280
when you integrate at that level there's

2379
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,800
agents that do humans that do

2380
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,239
self-reflection and then humans that

2381
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:50,080
just kind of don't think about it right

2382
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,760
and so what what is the better

2383
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:53,120
adaptation there it

2384
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:54,800
just it provides evidence for that i

2385
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:57,840
think yep and similarly it's like

2386
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,480
you know i want to be doing the right

2387
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,199
thing

2388
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:03,360
but then will that preclude you from

2389
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,800
having a thought that where

2390
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,880
that's actually being um that

2391
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,800
expectation is being violated especially

2392
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,239
if there's sensory evidence that that's

2393
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:11,440
the case

2394
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:14,400
those are really interesting situations

2395
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,159
right so like psychopathology like are

2396
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:17,199
they just missing

2397
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:19,920
some higher level integration like for

2398
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:20,560
to

2399
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:23,840
lacking that affect you know

2400
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:28,239
well ask the authors nice so then

2401
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:30,719
um just the additional info section of

2402
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:32,320
the paper as we kind of close out

2403
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,800
in the last little few slides here there

2404
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,480
are four appendices

2405
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,400
and the code is available on casper

2406
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,800
hesp's github

2407
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,880
and so you can see just from the top

2408
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,320
lines of the main

2409
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:47,199
matlab script yeah it's in matlab it

2410
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:49,920
uses markov decision processes

2411
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,080
and it involves active inference and

2412
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,920
learning using variational base the

2413
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,520
factorized version

2414
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,800
in the spm toolkit using matlab so check

2415
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,040
out the model streams and

2416
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:03,199
let us know how it goes to work with the

2417
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:05,280
code

2418
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,920
we kind of just had one or two more

2419
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:08,719
random

2420
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:11,760
areas to cover a few directions that

2421
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:12,880
this takes us in

2422
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,040
which we've discussed a little bit one

2423
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,400
of them is more advanced

2424
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,080
simulations so can we have two

2425
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,520
dimensions of affect or could we have

2426
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,360
another summary variable that

2427
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:24,080
represents some other feature of systems

2428
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:24,639
could we

2429
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:26,719
bring it more into alignment with

2430
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:28,800
computational psychiatry and

2431
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:32,639
translational research and could we

2432
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:36,080
embody robots that implement these kinds

2433
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:36,400
of

2434
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,520
algorithms how would that change some

2435
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:40,800
type of

2436
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,360
situational like physical robot or even

2437
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,360
a software robot if it had these kinds

2438
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:46,400
of

2439
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,120
estimators internally and then we're

2440
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,960
always just thinking about

2441
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,480
where does active inference come into

2442
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:55,199
play which is easy for this paper

2443
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:57,920
because that's the whole model but um

2444
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:58,480
where

2445
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,719
where are the next empirical steps which

2446
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:03,120
they mentioned in 5.7 a little bit

2447
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,120
and how does this relate to this realism

2448
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,880
versus instrumentalism question we're

2449
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,400
always getting at like

2450
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:11,440
is this what the systems are or is this

2451
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:14,400
how we're gonna model the systems or are

2452
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:15,760
those one in the same

2453
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,960
thing um

2454
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,280
any broad ideas and questions before

2455
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,360
this little freudian

2456
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:26,719
interlude yeah okay so thanks dave for

2457
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:27,840
pointing out um

2458
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:31,040
a lot of the recent work of mark solms

2459
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,719
specifically this new project for a

2460
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:34,480
scientific psychology

2461
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,960
general scheme which the link's given

2462
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,800
down below but it's um

2463
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,679
pretty interesting work that has to do

2464
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:42,239
with

2465
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:44,000
integrating recent developments in

2466
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,800
neuroscience with some

2467
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,239
freudian and uh ideas and beyond

2468
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:53,520
and i guess i just like ideas that

2469
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,280
aren't named after people because then

2470
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,040
it gets pretty much like oh who's doing

2471
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,560
darwinian evolution

2472
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,800
what does it really mean to be freudian

2473
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,440
it gets a little bit

2474
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,719
historiographical instead of about the

2475
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:05,440
ideas

2476
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:08,719
but the mappings that are made

2477
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:11,520
are clear and stand on their own and and

2478
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,199
put the sort of history

2479
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:16,239
hopefully um to the side

2480
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:18,000
when we see that there are commonalities

2481
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
across very disparate models

2482
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,760
and here we see a familiar structure

2483
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,360
which is kind of like that markov

2484
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:24,159
blanket

2485
01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:25,679
separating the internal and the external

2486
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:27,520
states but

2487
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,120
the letters are a little bit different

2488
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,199
and so there's an abbreviations table

2489
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:31,920
given in

2490
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,120
this paper and also

2491
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,600
for many years fristen and carhara

2492
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:38,159
harris

2493
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:41,600
and others have been writing papers

2494
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:44,480
that are about different freudian

2495
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,520
concepts

2496
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:48,400
and relating it to free energy and drive

2497
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:48,880
and

2498
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:52,560
a lot of other points of contact with

2499
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,320
different psychological threads it's

2500
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:55,679
just not uh

2501
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:58,880
an area i'm super familiar with with the

2502
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,520
literature and the debates around but

2503
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,120
it's an area that's obviously important

2504
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,760
to many and influences a lot of areas

2505
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,040
and it's just interesting to see how

2506
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:12,560
these developments play into the

2507
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:16,480
absolutely still open for evolution

2508
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:20,800
field of psychology psychiatry

2509
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,239
so that was uh pretty much what we

2510
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:24,880
wanted to

2511
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:29,120
cover in 19 so that was pretty fun and a

2512
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,480
little little sprint to get

2513
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,480
the paper finished because it was

2514
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,960
somewhat of a long paper but

2515
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:37,920
it's really worth it so blue any final

2516
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:38,880
thoughts or what

2517
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,120
what are you taking moving forward or

2518
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:42,239
what do you hope that we

2519
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:46,159
discuss in the 0.1.2

2520
01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:47,440
i don't know i'm looking to really

2521
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,520
discussing uh the bayesian brain

2522
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,159
integration or or like correlation here

2523
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:53,760
i really think that the

2524
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:57,679
you know ability to update your

2525
01:27:57,679 --> 01:28:01,120
beliefs based on what your previous um

2526
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,120
experiences is like this is like the

2527
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:04,159
perfect

2528
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:06,800
like case study for this kind of

2529
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,480
philosophy and i know like the bayesian

2530
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,639
brain catches some slack sometimes and

2531
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:13,199
bayesian statistics catch a lot of slack

2532
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:14,880
but in reality like we

2533
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,360
aren't going to go to the shock side of

2534
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,040
the box if we know that the food is

2535
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:19,520
always in

2536
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,440
the left side of the box like so having

2537
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,040
that that update so i'm looking forward

2538
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,000
to just see what

2539
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,280
what people have to say about the

2540
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:27,600
bayesian brain aspect of this paper if

2541
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:28,000
anything

2542
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,600
we get that far if we can make it all

2543
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,520
the way through the model right

2544
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,920
nice yeah i agree i was also curious

2545
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,600
about okay well what if we could just

2546
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:36,400
associate

2547
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,800
a like you know like click share

2548
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:39,679
whatever

2549
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:42,480
on social media and then maybe you don't

2550
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:43,600
even need the shock

2551
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,040
or maybe you could add that or something

2552
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:47,120
but with that matrix

2553
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:49,440
could there be upvote downvote systems

2554
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,360
where maybe the data already exists

2555
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:52,800
and then the positions that somebody

2556
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,400
could be in would be like

2557
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,719
i have not seen it or i have seen it

2558
01:28:56,719 --> 01:28:57,760
something like that they're moving

2559
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:58,239
around

2560
01:28:58,239 --> 01:29:01,280
pages seeing or not seeing things and

2561
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,880
that's influencing

2562
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,639
their beliefs about the world and their

2563
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,159
beliefs about themselves and

2564
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:09,040
how how accurate am i if this is what

2565
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:10,080
the info i'm getting

2566
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:13,280
is and then that's

2567
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,560
without even going into the

2568
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,480
instrumentalism realism at least it's

2569
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,239
something that

2570
01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:20,239
it feels like to be searching for

2571
01:29:20,239 --> 01:29:21,679
information or a question that can be

2572
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:22,639
useful

2573
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:25,120
so it's pretty cool stuff thanks a lot

2574
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,280
blue and thanks also stephen for joining

2575
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:28,880
for 19.0

2576
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:32,080
we'll uh see everyone for 19.1 and two

2577
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:36,800
thank you
