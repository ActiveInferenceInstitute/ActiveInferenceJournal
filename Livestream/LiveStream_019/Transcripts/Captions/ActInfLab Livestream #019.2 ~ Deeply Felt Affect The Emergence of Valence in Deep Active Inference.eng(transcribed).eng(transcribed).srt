00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:15,280
hello

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,520
and welcome to the active inference lab

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,760
this is active inference live stream

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,279
number 19.2 on april 13th

5
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,080
2021 so welcome everyone and thank you

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,599
for joining

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,640
we are the active inference lab we are a

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,360
participatory online lab that is

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,160
communicating

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,680
learning and practicing active inference

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,239
you can find us at the links that are

12
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,760
listed here

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,680
this is recorded in an archived live

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,280
stream so please provide us with

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,559
feedback so that we can

16
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,920
be improving on our work all backgrounds

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,079
and perspectives are welcome here

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,320
and we'll be following good video

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,719
etiquette for live streams

20
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,640
today we're in the follow-up discussion

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,840
19.2

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,399
um our third discussion following on the

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,520
dot zero

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,159
contextualizing video and the dot one

25
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,040
first discussion

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,280
last week with casper and everyone else

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,880
and so today in 19.2

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,640
we're going to be continuing this

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,479
discussion on deeply felt

30
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,080
affect hearing some slides from casper

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,520
bringing up some of these questions that

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,200
we're having about implications

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,640
and other topics so really the goal is

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,439
just to

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,479
learn and discuss and we'll be going

36
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,920
through whatever we need to

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,600
and next week and beyond we'll be

38
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,920
discussing different papers

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,840
so let's just do a quick round of

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,960
introduction

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,000
and then we can see and

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,240
hear what casper has brought to to

43
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,119
share with us today so i'll start i'm

and i'll transfer to alex

54
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,879
thanks i'm alex i'm researcher in

55
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,599

management school in moscow russia

57
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,440

60
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,480
based out of new mexico and i will pass

61
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:30,959
it to

62
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,319
dean hi i'm dean

i'm up here in calgary canada retired

64
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,720
trying to keep up with all this active

65
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,840
important stuff

66
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,040
and i'll pass it to stephen hello i'm

67
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,640
stephen i'm in toronto

68
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,280
i'm just working on a practice-based phd

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,959
i do a lot a lot of work with

70
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,120
participatory theater

71
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,480
and social topographies for exploring

72
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,239
community development

73
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,959
and i'll pass it over to i think it's

74
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,760
now casper is that right

75
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,519
yes so my name is kasper hasp

76
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,280
i'm a phd student at the university of

77
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,560
amsterdam

78
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,680
focusing on the emergence of

79
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,959
social cognition in

80
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,720
development and evolution um

81
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,159
and today i'll be will be continuing uh

82
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,760
daniel said from last time so i'll be

83
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,680
mostly assuming that you're already

84
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,640
listening to that live stream as well

85
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,040
but

86
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,120
just for for everybody's sanity

87
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,599
i'll give a short intro on what we've

88
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,879
been discussing

89
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,920
so far and just

90
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,200
to describe the context of this

91
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,238
research um

92
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,680
i was i was when i started this

93
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,400
particular

94
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,319
topic deeply felt effect for this paper

95
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,959
i was in the process of setting up um

96
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,760
the topic of my phd research

97
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,400
and focusing on social cognition but

98
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,680
then in doing that

99
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,080
um i realized that we were seriously

100
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,879
lacking

101
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,280
um there were serious gaps in the

102
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,439
literature on how we actually connect

103
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,880
from our bodily existence um to

104
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,160
like abstract social world and our

105
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,120
expectations about our social world

106
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,000
shape the way we feel physically and how

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,400
that

108
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
recursively shapes the way we think

109
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
about our social environment

110
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,000
um and that's where i actually got into

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,479
this

112
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,120
kind of well you could call it a rabbit

113
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,160
hole

114
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,600
of affects and emotions um

115
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,880
because i think that affect and

116
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,759
is basically the kind of through

117
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,280
emotions is what links

118
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,479
um the social world the abstract social

119
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,440
relations that we

120
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,040
are you know experts at innately you

121
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,120
could say even to a large extent

122
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,440
if you look at the efficiency with which

123
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,680
children in elementary school

124
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,240
kind of track each other's popularity

125
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,759
and whether they're part of the group or

126
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,360
not in this kind of

127
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,639
um i mean of course it's um

128
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,240
we're not making i know like this

129
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,960
dichotomy of nature and nurture it's an

130
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,240
emergent system

131
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,080
it's like there's an interaction going

132
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,759
on um

133
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,199
it's you can say that we're you know

134
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,039
one of the things we teach each other to

135
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,560
do um

136
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,560
and that's where our system is kind of

137
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,680
prepared to do

138
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,120
in a large uh to large degree is to

139
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,720
track

140
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,320
events happening in our social

141
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,759
environment and

142
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,520
from an evolutionary perspective that's

143
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,960
a very logical thing

144
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,400
to do because for hundreds of thousands

145
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:50,960
of years

146
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,560
you could say our each of our yeah

147
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,680
our survival would be

148
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,800
entirely dependent on our capacity to be

149
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,680
part of the group

150
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,400
so to speak um our capacity to function

151
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,240
in a group context

152
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,680
not just on the individual level but

153
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,520
also on the group level so

154
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,880
our ability to survive as

155
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,800
a species dependent on our capacity to

156
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,080
coordinate and distribute tasks

157
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,199
and specialize in different directions

158
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,720
so uh in the very same way

159
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,039
shaping and basically forming a body at

160
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,039
a higher level of organization

161
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,080
and just like the cells in our body are

162
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,280
differentiated in different directions

163
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,840
we as humans have to differentiate

164
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,479
ourselves

165
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,919
to form one large functioning body

166
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,000
and you think like what does this have

167
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,599
to do with the paper well

168
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,680
um essentially

169
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,720
the idea is that um the affective

170
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,120
states as we talked about them last time

171
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,639
in terms of kind of subjective fitness

172
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,520
we focus largely on the affective states

173
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:05,919
of

174
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,120
a single agent doing some tasks in like

175
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,440
a

176
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,120
teammates but today we'll kind of move

177
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,919
towards

178
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,520
a steps beyond that and in particular

179
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,639
the way in which tracking

180
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,120
the effective states of others in in the

181
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,319
body let's speak

182
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,440
in the unit of organization as a group

183
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,479
and how that's tracking can allow

184
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,680
you to to find your place in the body

185
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,639
just in a completely analogous to the

186
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,360
way

187
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,400
in which cells track each other's stress

188
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,000
signals

189
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,120
in the body so the pain

190
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,960
um basically the empath our capacity to

191
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,759
empathize with others would be very

192
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,520
similar to the way in which

193
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,039
cells respond to each other's

194
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,039
stress signals uh yeah stephen

195
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,919
i'll just be curious to know in your

196
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,599
sort of journey

197
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,639
often affect is tied to sensory feelings

198
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,240
you know at the kind of

199
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,960
personal level and so so that it becomes

200
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,919
a kind of a

201
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,280
a macro social sort of measure

202
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,960
was that something that you already had

203
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,720
in mind or is that something that sort

204
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,440
of

205
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,960
evolved as you were exploring this

206
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,360
these questions yeah i was essentially

207
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,640
um interested in that connection between

208
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,240
the very strong uh like experiential

209
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,120
aspect

210
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,080
of effect like when you feel embarrassed

211
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,200
you're literally

212
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,240
getting uh you can get a

213
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,680
red face basically so it's like a

214
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,550
very much an embodied aspect of that

215
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,920
[Music]

216
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,080
and somehow you're able to connect that

217
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,399
to let's say what other people

218
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,360
how um yeah your beliefs about how other

219
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,279
people are perceiving you

220
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,880
right so um that connection between

221
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,360
the bodily states and those abstract um

222
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,120
beliefs about the social environment

223
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,000
is something that yeah has kind of

224
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,760
driven this

225
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,480
and this effort and scotland yeah

226
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,120
one thing that's fascinating to me is

227
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,160
that

228
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,600
the notion that there might be multiple

229
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,399
levels of that harmonic coupling

230
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,519
right and multiple pathways so that the

231
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,959
dynamics of it

232
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,360
it's certainly you know it everything

233
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,040
every relationship and interaction is

234
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,000
describable

235
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,040
potentially as a binary and then

236
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,279
then you can elaborate on it right and

237
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,080
so there's

238
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,320
is all sorts of nested affordances

239
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,360
that have direct and indirect qualities

240
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,480
to informing

241
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,240
those interactions and so that

242
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,440
picking apart and disambiguating the

243
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,040
general relationship is fascinating

244
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,920
right so that and the and it feels like

245
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,240
just

246
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,480
anticipating the surprises that active

247
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,040
inference continuously brings us

248
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,920
that there's going to be a i guess i

249
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,440
would not just say a scale

250
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,680
independence but also a local

251
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,959
independence

252
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,600
to some aspects of it so what i mean by

253
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,399
that is they'll be

254
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,040
analytical interoperability i would

255
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,440
expect

256
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,200
more broadly than we might get with

257
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
other analytical framings

258
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,399
simply by nature of the manner in which

259
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,320
active inference approaches the

260
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,040
questions

261
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,680
of relationship so if you know what i

262
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,279
guess i'm saying in that is

263
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,839
i think it may be possible this is my

264
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,440
years as a lawyer

265
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,120
it may be possible to insert rhetorical

266
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,920
artificial or let me use the word

267
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,640
synthetic instead

268
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,640
um linkages in there and that's

269
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,079
something i'd be very interested in

270
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,320
understanding what your thoughts are and

271
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,839
how we can you know we

272
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,959
assert them into being right and we and

273
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,880
so describing them if it's efficacious

274
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,079
to describe them in a certain

275
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,680
way then they become adopted

276
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,839
those things don't exist in nature until

277
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,680
we describe them

278
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,360
so we have an opportunity now to

279
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,519
describe and disambiguate these things

280
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,560
in a way

281
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,959
that i'll use the it's like tempering

282
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:29,760
with bach

283
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,600
and the well-tempered clavier we get to

284
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
decide on the notes

285
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,560
or like when they decided on 360 degrees

286
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,440
in a circle because it divides well

287
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,839
i think that was the reason the

288
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,600
phoenicians or whoever did that

289
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,240
um so here we get to just maybe get to

290
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,320
decide without doing an injustice to

291
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,680
reality

292
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,680
on how to parse the linkages anyway

293
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,440
it's it's exciting because i love the

294
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,000
way you you introduce that possibility

295
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
of starting to pick apart those things

296
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,760
and call and name them

297
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,160
in a way that starts to do like david

298
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,240
boehm stuff where every reality is first

299
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,800
a thought

300
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,320
and here we're having the thoughts so

301
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
thank you for inviting us into that

302
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,720
space it's fantastic

303
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,079
thank you thanks for joining yeah um

304
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,079
we'll get more into that in this second

305
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,079
but i agree like it's kind of

306
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,000
refers back to what i talked about last

307
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,440
time in terms of

308
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,079
compositionality or the kind of lego box

309
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:26,959
in a sense that

310
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,200
um yeah these abstract relationships

311
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,880
can be applied on different levels of

312
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,240
organization

313
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,050
and that gives you a freedom

314
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,760
[Music]

315
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,040
in a sense that if you're able

316
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,920
to capture this relationships on and the

317
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,519
way they talk to each

318
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,040
other on the different levels of

319
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,200
description that's

320
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,040
yeah that's really essential i think

321
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,200
also blue was

322
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,399
putting up her hands so so

323
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,720
i'm anxious to see how this model

324
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,440
unfolds

325
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,399
in tracking others i think that that's a

326
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,880
a great way to

327
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,560
add an extra layer but i wanted to kind

328
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,240
of ask first

329
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,360
about uh the model as we discussed it

330
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,079
last week

331
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,279
it's just something i've been thinking

332
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,440
about we

333
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,800
talked about how um surprise is

334
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,760
is related to like negative uh affects

335
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,320
right

336
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,839
so like you know whenever your

337
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,760
prediction doesn't track that that's

338
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,240
the the negative affects or or that's

339
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,680
the as opposed to

340
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,160
the positive uh valence and so i just

341
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,040
was wondering like do we ever

342
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,440
do it leave room for pleasant surprises

343
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,800
like you know if i don't go food

344
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,440
shopping

345
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,040
i don't expect there to be a chocolate

346
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,720
cake in my fridge but i come home and i

347
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,160
find a chocolate cake i'm like this is

348
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,199
awesome

349
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,000
so is there like a room for that or or

350
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,639
is it like

351
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,360
incongruent or how do you resolve that

352
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:51,839
yeah

353
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,320
in fact it's a necessity that comes out

354
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,959
of the fact

355
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,040
that we talked about last time that the

356
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,160
effective charge

357
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,920
only emerges when there's a difference

358
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,000
between the prior and the posterior

359
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,399
so like uh you can be pleasant you can

360
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,839
be positively surprised

361
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,440
your predictions can be better than

362
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,920
expected uh essentially so

363
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,399
or the let's say reality can be closer

364
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,240
to your preferences than you thought it

365
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,360
was

366
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,720
um or like further away

367
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,000
let's say um so pleasant surprise is

368
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,800
when you get

369
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,399
a nice present from from your loved ones

370
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,040
or something

371
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,800
but then basically there's like a kind

372
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,000
of um

373
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,959
surprise in the sense that there's a

374
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,480
certain preference being met

375
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,600
that you hadn't anticipated um yeah it's

376
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,000
like

377
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
thanks thanks for the gift card oh wow

378
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,800
it's so much it's like another surprise

379
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,959
after you've renormalized it to the fact

380
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,320
that you were receiving a gift

381
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,240
you made an expectation oh maybe you'll

382
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,360
be 20

383
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,079
and then it's more

384
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,720
i mean there's that aspect and then

385
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,240
there's um

386
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,320
also purely on the information

387
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,240
processing level so to speak

388
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,800
when you're listening to music um or

389
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,839
some kind of

390
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,839
um something that's aesthetically

391
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,040
pleasing

392
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,519
there's often these kind of

393
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,399
stimulation have some patterns that have

394
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,519
inherent predictability

395
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,199
so like they're you could say there's

396
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,320
can be surprisingly easy to resolve

397
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,519
um so it usually starts with setting up

398
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,320
some tension

399
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,399
and then suddenly resolving that you can

400
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,240
see that in many art forms

401
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,199
in storytelling and jokes telling jokes

402
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,399
you basically have to

403
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,399
create the tension and then suddenly the

404
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,120
punchline resolves that tension

405
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,120
and that's exactly the unsurprising or

406
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,160
sorry the surprising part

407
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,600
of that reduction in the free energy

408
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,399
essentially

409
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,480
listen but yeah that's a very good

410
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,160
question i mean i think that's a very

411
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,360
common

412
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,600
misunderstanding also um

413
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,560
that's

414
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,199
yeah an understandable misunderstanding

415
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,320
but that's because

416
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,759
once you get to these hierarchical

417
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,560
models things are often kind of

418
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,079
uh get much more nuanced

419
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,480
and you can't just say like surprise is

420
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,639
always bad

421
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,160
and it is surprised with respect to

422
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,120
a particular generative model that

423
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,880
specifies

424
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,839
your ideal world so to speak

425
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,320
that's that's what creates this negative

426
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,480
effect but then once you on the meta

427
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,720
level start to create expectations about

428
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,680
how close you are to this ideal

429
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,920
then once you get surprised on those

430
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,720
expectations

431
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,040
it can be negative or positive

432
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,880
essentially

433
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,600
anyway so that's a long winded answer to

434
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,199
your question

435
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,000
let's have um a question from dave and

436
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,359
then maybe casper

437
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,959
will go through anything you want to

438
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,039
present because we could definitely just

439
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,199
keep on peppering with questions i

440
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,039
totally feel it so dave and then

441
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,559
continue on you're muted dave

442
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,919
continue apropos of blues uh

443
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,319
question some of the older researchers

444
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,200
on affect notably sylvan tompkins

445
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,080
and yak pong sepp go into a lot of

446
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,400
detail on the differentiation of the

447
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,200
emotions and sensations and affects and

448
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,640
drives and so on

449
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,039
one of the things that tompkins did a

450
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:41,840
lot on

451
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,840
was the speed of change very

452
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,480
specifically uh

453
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,240
a a rapid change in a sensation may have

454
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:50,480
a

455
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,880
very different uh effect from a slow

456
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,520
change also that's reflected in the face

457
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,760
in the in what he considered inborn

458
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,440
facial expressions underneath all the

459
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,120
layers of acculturation

460
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,400
a rapid smile is some drum is

461
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,640
sometimes directly contradictory to a

462
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,840
slow

463
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,440
smile one a fast smile means oh you

464
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,280
idiot a slow smile means

465
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,120
oh you got it too

466
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,600
a very good question i mean there's uh

467
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,640
indeed

468
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,960
the temporal dynamics they come into

469
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,760
play

470
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,799
are really um really important as well

471
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,080
um and especially

472
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,559
because these nested levels they tend to

473
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,440
the higher levels tend to be slower

474
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,960
so for feedback to trickle down

475
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,919
let's say you need some time um so then

476
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,120
if it's a slower kind of moving change

477
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,320
then your top down let's say priors can

478
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,760
already adapt a little bit

479
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,440
before the next step happens

480
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,640
um i mean that's what you see

481
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,840
in for example in music where

482
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,039
to really make something give to

483
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,360
have an impact on the listener you need

484
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,559
to have some kind of

485
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,600
temporal slowness to the piece where

486
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,720
there's like an intro

487
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,600
and like different stages to really kind

488
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,440
of prepare your expectations

489
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,960
so to speak um or

490
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,720
actually the joke example is also a good

491
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,320
one like some people are bad at telling

492
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,000
jokes they tell the punchline too early

493
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,960
whereas like

494
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,640
don't give the tension time to kind of

495
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,679
emerge basically um yes sarah actually

496
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,280
just made a comment in the chat

497
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,840
um about how this model might be

498
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,200
associated with humor

499
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,360
and then can we think about humor in

500
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,120
terms of surprise only or

501
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,720
how do we think about these complex

502
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,200
layers of emotion like catharsis

503
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,640
surprise at different layers of the

504
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,679
model like you had mentioned

505
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,880
yeah i think humor of course

506
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,760
many different levels um there's this

507
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,559
really simple

508
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,640
jokes right it's like one question and

509
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,200
then and surprising answer

510
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,280
i i sometimes in lectures i use this

511
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,480
example like

512
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,559
how do you call somebody without a body

513
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,600
and without a nose

514
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,840
nobody knows

515
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,320
it's like a really silly one but it's

516
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,240
kind of nice as an illustration because

517
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,880
you can think

518
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,919
basically the free energy is uh

519
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,360
accuracy um sorry it's a

520
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,480
complexity minus accuracy right so and

521
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,760
when you get a question like that and

522
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,520
you get two concepts

523
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,600
without the body and god knows and you

524
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,039
try to find one

525
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,080
unifying concept and doesn't work

526
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,360
and then you get the answer and the

527
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,440
answer is both true false is accurate

528
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,600
and it's like a reduction in complexity

529
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,960
so you get like a double

530
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,559
bonus in this case um

531
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,720
but that's an easy one because the more

532
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,559
interesting types of humor i guess

533
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,080
emerge when you have like

534
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,440
complex storylines and there are certain

535
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,240
i don't know like satire and all these

536
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,480
kinds of things so that's that's where

537
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,880
it's not as easy to describe but i think

538
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,559
it's also possible if you had some kind

539
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,679
of

540
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,440
generative model of the social

541
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,760
environment and then certain things

542
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,840
are kind of inappropriate and then

543
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,440
certain things are so inappropriate that

544
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,200
they become funny or something like that

545
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,600
like uh yeah there's every country has

546
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,880
those comedians i think that they're

547
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,240
able to

548
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,760
to walk that thin line of uh

549
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,919
extremity and so there was another

550
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,200
question i think

551
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,120
um can we do one more question oh yeah

552
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,760
yeah yeah scott scott you want to go for

553
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,960
it

554
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,600
the question so much is just on on that

555
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,960
on the

556
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,000
measurement of the subtleties

557
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,039
of the free energy there

558
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,840
are books on rhetoric and i'm trying to

559
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,280
find the title here

560
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,320
but it specifically lists dozens

561
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,159
hundreds of techniques of rhetoric

562
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,240
like the juxtaposition of words in a

563
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,080
sentence does one come before the other

564
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,039
as priming

565
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,840
or whatever a conceptual linking of

566
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,120
multiple sentences

567
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,000
paragraph structuring use of foreign

568
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,799
languages

569
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,640
french tends to indicate certain thing

570
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,880
of style german tends to indicate

571
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,240
accuracy whatever

572
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,240
and so those notions of metrics

573
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,559
from there are things that can be

574
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,240
observed so they can be measured

575
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,559
so the metrics from the humanities let's

576
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,919
call it linguistic

577
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,360
psychology they are positioned

578
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,960
and ready to dive in to inform

579
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,840
those variables in that space right and

580
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,720
so that

581
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,120
is the next interoperability is not

582
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,120
going to be technical interoperability

583
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,240
we got plenty of that

584
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,880
it's going to keep going but what we

585
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,679
have is this deluge of interactions as a

586
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,480
result the

587
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,559
true exponential increase in interaction

588
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,520
volumes because of

589
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,760
fifth order effective moore's law and

590
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,120
what we need

591
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,520
is meaning now to be interoperable

592
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,919
and that's where we get to the drive

593
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:14,720
here of the

594
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,799
shared framings of rhetoric

595
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,200
right and so one other point a hundred

596
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,000
thousand years ago

597
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,400
we were one village in the horn of east

598
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,440
africa

599
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,840
we radiated out around the world we came

600
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,120
up with different food

601
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,960
different language different politics

602
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,240
different gods

603
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,559
etc and now the internet brought us

604
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,520
together for show-and-tell

605
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,919
everyone's got everyone's work and

606
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,520
active inference on each other whether

607
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,880
we know it or not

608
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,320
and if we name it as such it gives us a

609
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,159
sandbox to play in

610
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,640
at massive scales and i so i love the

611
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,080
way you're

612
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,640
naturally and i think appropriately and

613
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,360
not by analogy but by direct application

614
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,559
the concepts

615
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,760
bringing in our behaviors that are

616
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,880
beyond what are seen as base of maslow's

617
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,640
hierarchy and needs basically it's

618
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,640
beautiful you're doing beautiful work so

619
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,520
thank you for

620
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,240
inviting us into the space it's great

621
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,720
thanks

622
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,240
actually that comes back in a sec

623
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,279
kind of needs hierarchy of needs or

624
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,480
yeah how to deal with that so that's

625
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,760
i i i just see one more question

626
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,559
we can uh until we find a break time we

627
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,760
can uh yeah

628
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,320
are you yeah well mine isn't really a

629
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,760
question

630
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,039
in this i'm curious whether or not

631
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,360
i have a question later but what i

632
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,039
wanted to find out was

633
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,520
when you discuss implications whether or

634
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,679
not my question gets answered before i

635
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,360
have to ask it

636
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,039
because i think from an effective

637
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,799
standpoint that's the part that's going

638
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,679
to get

639
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,760
really interesting so i just wanted to

640
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,200
put that out there

641
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,480
because i actually do have it written

642
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,559
down because it's a long one but i want

643
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,159
to ask it yet i want to see whether or

644
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:00,880
not

645
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,640
in the implications that you're going to

646
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,799
share with us whether or not

647
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,919
my expectations align with what you

648
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:08,400
think

649
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,559
we want to kind of find out more about

650
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,000
oh see then yeah and i'll try my best to

651
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,400
i mean it's impossible to be exhausted

652
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,279
but uh

653
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,880
i will try our best yeah um actually

654
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,360
about the book the rhetoric of style

655
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,039
yeah

656
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,919
i there's actually interesting another

657
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:30,720
example

658
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,440
this is like um the art of uh movie

659
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,400
directing

660
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,200
like choosing the shots and which shots

661
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,080
are like

662
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,320
kind of cognitively fluent so to speak

663
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,159
and if you're creating a horror movie

664
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,400
you like the exact opposite of that

665
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,880
and the certain ways you can create

666
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,919
anxiety

667
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,760
or like different kinds of emotions

668
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,120
based on how you

669
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,960
how you move the camera around and which

670
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,480
parts you do and don't show

671
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,840
those kind of

672
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,960
and one one reason to just this book in

673
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,039
particular just

674
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,720
advise that anyone take a look at this

675
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,159
if they're looking at this it has

676
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,279
hundreds of different eye examples each

677
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,720
one's one page it's like

678
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,960
sentence construction sentence basics

679
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,240
etymological things

680
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,919
tropes blah blah blah it just goes on

681
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,600
it's like a checklist but it's this

682
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,720
thick

683
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,600
and so this is the things to measure for

684
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,640
influencing

685
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,480
other groups and so this is i really

686
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,000
this is gene faunstock

687
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,960
f-a-h-n-e-s-t-o-c-k i really thought

688
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,679
this one was a really helpful one from a

689
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,279
checklist and systems approach because

690
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,880
we're really doing processes here

691
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,400
trying to anticipate those processes

692
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,320
that we can make into alcohol so

693
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,440
good stuff um

694
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,240
uh what was the title rhetoric or style

695
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,039
someone's describing that

696
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,760
rhetorical style the uses of language in

697
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,799
persuasion

698
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,840
by jeanne faunstock f-a-h-n-e-s-t-o-c-k

699
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,679
and in fact one of the things just we're

700
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:00,960
doing in our program

701
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,559
is we're trying to come up we're not

702
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,840
trying to come up with coming up with

703
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,840
metrics for business operating legal

704
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,400
technical and social variables

705
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,120
so we take technically feasible systems

706
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,559
like what we're talking about

707
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,799
generally here ai and others and then

708
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,960
test them for bolts reasonability

709
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,840
and the way we get there is just by

710
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,159
rhetoric

711
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,559
because we it's storytelling it's folk

712
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,080
ways you know they're just folk ways for

713
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,960
the future

714
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,399
and that's why the active inference

715
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,159
gives us that framing it basically says

716
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,799
you tell us what your things are in your

717
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:31,440
minds

718
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,200
you group and we'll take them and

719
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,720
synthesize them and feed them back to

720
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,159
you and then you get to decide whether

721
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,760
you like them or not

722
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,600
and so it's just really an interactive

723
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,559
element so really

724
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,880
thanks ella you're really interesting uh

725
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,840
points yeah

726
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,799
um all right so let's and let me try and

727
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,200
get to the um

728
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,919
the actual slides that i was gonna share

729
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,279
but i'm sure we can

730
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,770
find many of these uh slides

731
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,960
[Music]

732
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,559
um let's see how can i share my screen

733
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,159
on the bottom left the middle button

734
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,200
yeah yeah and then i'll resize it so

735
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,760
it can look however it looks on your

736
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,559
everybody's

737
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,159
computer i'll make it look normal so no

738
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,799
worries about that

739
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,959
okay um looks good

740
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,679
yeah okay so just to kind of recap a

741
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,200
little bit but i mean we already

742
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,960
already did that but last time we're

743
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,399
talking about this

744
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,320
nested set of um inferences essentially

745
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,600
that

746
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,399
happens or appears to happen actually

747
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:35,760
i'm pretty much uh

748
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,799
to kind of hint at the instrumentalist

749
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,080
discussion i i

750
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,159
i'm pretty much fine with completely

751
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,600
being completely

752
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,559
and so that i don't i don't mind if it's

753
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,080
um

754
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,640
as i said yeah i i like to always say

755
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,399
that all models are wrong but some are

756
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:52,880
useful

757
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,120
so i think this is a very useful way

758
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,320
looking at it so it's instrumental

759
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,960
whether it's true in a realist sense i

760
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,480
i don't really care that much i guess in

761
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,950
the end but

762
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,360
[Music]

763
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,399
mostly because i just don't have i

764
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,960
i don't think there's a way to make that

765
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,840
[Music]

766
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,678
claim um

767
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,320
and there's no way to prove it i mean

768
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,919
there's a way you can believe in it or

769
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:26,640
something but

770
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,039
um and you can say that you require some

771
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,600
amount of evidence to believe in it

772
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,200
but as long as it

773
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,200
works i i guess um for most

774
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,520
applications that i'm interested in or

775
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,320
maybe all

776
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,399
applications doesn't really matter

777
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,840
whether it's

778
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,600
yeah what's what the philosopher thinks

779
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,440
about whether it's real or not

780
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,480
as long as it works um

781
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,200
so that's my um i don't that's why i

782
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,799
always say i don't have a dog in that

783
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,840
fight um but

784
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,960
yeah just to recap um

785
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,600
a little bit too last time we talked a

786
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,960
lot about valence

787
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,279
but there's also other types or

788
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,880
dimensions of affect

789
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,720
and some of them are like uh there

790
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,960
you are like three fundamental

791
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,760
dimensions

792
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,039
like arousal being like kind of your

793
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,880
your activity um level your current

794
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,320
amount of um resources that your

795
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,080
your body is expanding and for

796
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,039
the current um task at hand or current

797
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,640
context

798
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,640
and power control so the perception of

799
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,200
whether

800
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,559
out of agency you can say whether you

801
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:44,960
are

802
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,640
in control of the situation or not

803
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,720
it's not exactly the same as valence in

804
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,000
a sense last time we talked a lot about

805
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,159
[Music]

806
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,360
control as well but you can have a

807
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,880
highly

808
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,160
positive experience let's say if you're

809
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,200
[Music]

810
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,480
able to if your trusts that you're

811
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,480
that your needs are being met even

812
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,919
though you don't have

813
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,440
control over them yourself um so there's

814
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,760
these different dimensions that to some

815
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,519
extent can

816
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,150
can correlate with each other

817
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,960
[Music]

818
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,200
and but don't always and you have

819
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,880
another one is something like approach

820
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,760
and avoidance

821
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,039
which is often related to valence but

822
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,640
you can think of cases like um anger

823
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,880
where you have an uh or aggression you

824
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,399
have an approach reaction

825
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,519
but you're angry um you're so you have

826
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,799
negative valence

827
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:45,360
high arousal um and an approach response

828
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,279
so there's these different dimensions

829
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,919
that sometimes correlate but not always

830
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,159
and there are ways to

831
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,279
let's say in very simplistic organisms

832
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,919
there's yeah the dimensionalities very

833
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,519
much reduced

834
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,840
and

835
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,960
when you're let's say a baby and you

836
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,039
start out with very simplistic

837
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:11,120
dimensions you feel content or you feel

838
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,000
discomfort and as you get older you

839
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,640
start to get

840
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,720
more of this this dimensionality starts

841
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,440
to um

842
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,440
become more nuanced so to speak and it's

843
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,679
hard to say and then

844
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,679
the way um

845
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,880
i'm relating this to to take this one

846
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,200
step

847
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,640
further um is to

848
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,159
think about what this means

849
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,240
for um when we have internal generative

850
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,519
models

851
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,480
what's that what those generated models

852
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,240
and what kind of influence they have

853
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,720
on your effective state your current

854
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,760
affective state

855
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,640
um and that's where it gets an

856
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,000
interesting application

857
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
in psychiatry because

858
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,840
as we all know there is a dark side

859
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,399
to our imagination and that is that

860
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,760
imagination induced induced effect

861
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,120
plays role in all kinds of mental

862
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,519
conditions and also just on everyday

863
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,600
life and

864
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,760
so these are the extreme extremities of

865
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,120
course the psychiatric

866
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,200
diagnostic condition categories but

867
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,679
everybody i think to some extent has

868
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,480
experienced

869
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,360
at least a few of these types of

870
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,200
effects inducing thoughts

871
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,000
and basically i would i can just run you

872
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,440
quickly through them but

873
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,320
imagination of imagined threats and

874
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,559
flashbacks to some

875
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,679
bad experiences in ptsd cravings so

876
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:52,000
that's

877
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,120
like imagining obtaining of

878
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,919
drugs that you have that you're attached

879
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:58,960
to

880
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,590
but can be also other types of addiction

881
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,120
[Music]

882
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,799
ocd is obsessive disorder is a really

883
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:11,199
really strong example people basically

884
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,320
kind of you could say they're the

885
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,320
effective responses that they

886
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,320
get when they have certain thoughts

887
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,599
are reinforcing the thoughts

888
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,079
so they are afraid of breaking their own

889
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:26,639
rules

890
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,199
and they they get this kind of dread of

891
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,159
breaking

892
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,800
them so there's like a cycle and this

893
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,359
kind of

894
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,560
cycle is very self-reinforcing

895
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,839
cycles of uh affective states

896
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,839
and that then guide the way your

897
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,159
imagination

898
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,560
works and then that triggers more

899
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,839
effective

900
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,639
responses in depression and reaction i

901
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,359
mean you can go

902
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,000
on i think almost i haven't really found

903
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,399
any

904
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,598
um disorder in psychiatric um

905
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,599
like the dsm that doesn't really

906
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,440
fall into this except for perhaps

907
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,359
they're really more like

908
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,720
um physical um problems but those are

909
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,320
often psychosomatic so

910
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,400
and there's also a connection there um

911
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,599
anyway so just

912
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,640
for as a very abstract analogy we can

913
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,680
construct a generative model to give

914
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,560
this some flavor and can be of some

915
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,079
social environment let's say you

916
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,520
start in uh you have four locations um

917
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,040
you can make this as complex as you want

918
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,960
but just to give you to give

919
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,720
for the sake of the simulation that i'm

920
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,800
gonna be showing

921
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,119
you can start neutral and so some safe

922
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,000
space

923
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,480
there is a place that's safe relatively

924
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,119
safe

925
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,960
but you get only a small reward and

926
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,640
there is a place that's a little bit

927
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,599
risky but you can get the high reward

928
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,000
and why is it risky well because it has

929
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,040
the probability

930
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,440
of transitioning to this absorbing

931
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,119
painful state

932
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,440
you can think of this as like um

933
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,680
asking somebody out on a date you have

934
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,599
the risk of getting rejected

935
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,079
or um as a hunter um hunting like a big

936
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,079
big prey can be dangerous can get hurt

937
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,200
and can also

938
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,280
do something safer but you get a smaller

939
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,560
reward so there's like

940
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,480
many types of situations in the world

941
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,400
where this

942
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,599
kind of discount structure comes back

943
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,800
where the higher higher rewards are

944
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,480
often associated with potential and

945
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,240
adverse events the problem with this

946
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:40,800
type of

947
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,000
state space is that it very quickly uh

948
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,079
explodes when you want to search into

949
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,359
the future and the events as they unfold

950
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,359
and it's something we call combinatorial

951
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,359
explosion but let's say you want to plan

952
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:54,000
ahead

953
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,160
and for a few time steps in this case

954
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,599
four time steps you want to

955
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,880
anticipate what's going to happen um

956
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,079
very quickly it's gonna it's yeah the

957
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,599
number of possibilities

958
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,720
just becomes

959
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,160
yeah hard to track and um

960
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,640
the types of generative models that i've

961
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,760
been

962
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,160
working on and carl frisson recently uh

963
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,000
with a paper with me and

964
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,599
thomas barr and danny jar hofner

965
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,720
um developed a new

966
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,560
yeah i was basically sophisticated

967
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,000
inference something i mentioned the last

968
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,440
time as well

969
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,599
um a way to do this kind of research

970
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:34,880
without having the whole

971
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,200
thing become computationally uh

972
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,800
intractable

973
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,280
and um yeah i'm not really going into

974
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,760
the technical details here

975
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,119
but essentially the core ideas that use

976
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,000
instead of having the whole policy space

977
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,920
which is multiplicative so you have

978
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,400
in this case the policy space if for

979
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,280
each transition you have three options

980
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,760
here you have four so you get something

981
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,599
to the order of

982
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,960
four to the power four and

983
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,440
a little bit less in this case but this

984
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,240
is just for

985
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,359
for um uh four

986
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,760
sorry four to the power three um for

987
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,119
just for three time steps

988
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,359
and of course in reality we often

989
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:18,400
anticipate

990
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,440
um more

991
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,560
steps into the future just yeah

992
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,000
without even thinking about it

993
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,720
explicitly

994
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,280
so there needs to be a way to do this in

995
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,480
a way yeah that

996
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,760
basic that you prevent just overloading

997
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,560
the system

998
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,240
um with anticipating

999
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,359
too many possible outcomes

1000
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,800
and what is interesting is that you can

1001
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,359
design

1002
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:51,119
a model in which the way you explore the

1003
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:51,839
future

1004
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,360
is guided by your effective states

1005
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,880
[Music]

1006
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,119
and this what i did for this simulation

1007
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,079
where you have

1008
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,280
this exploration of the future

1009
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,359
is itself an action model in a sense

1010
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,790
that you're

1011
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,160
[Music]

1012
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,640
experimenting internally with potential

1013
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,920
features

1014
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,680
and the way you uh trend yeah basically

1015
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,400
travel through

1016
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,720
the decision tree is guided by this

1017
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,400
action model and because it's an action

1018
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,000
model it's guided by your effective

1019
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,640
state

1020
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,599
and because it's the way i've linked

1021
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,359
that in my research is by adding

1022
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,640
having this action model precision um

1023
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,240
that we talked about in terms of the

1024
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,240
valence states

1025
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,400
um so what you get

1026
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,640
as an interesting example what i

1027
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,760
simulated here or so

1028
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,640
and model that can do overthinking can

1029
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,320
basically is something that

1030
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,520
you may have come across in the

1031
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,240
um when you discuss cascade effective

1032
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,000
inference a long time ago

1033
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,280
because then essentially this model uh

1034
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,040
action model precision is guiding the

1035
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,599
way the three searches

1036
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,800
is performed but then

1037
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,599
at some point this agent starts to

1038
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:08,319
imagine

1039
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:12,400
a little bit yeah some negative events

1040
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,839
and starts to um

1041
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,000
basically the precision starts to drop

1042
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,839
of that the way they explore in the

1043
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:20,319
future

1044
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,960
and they start start to become more

1045
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,520
likely

1046
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,119
to imagine negative outcomes

1047
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,960
because when the precision on their

1048
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,800
action was high

1049
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,960
they basically had a confident kind of

1050
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,720
course of action in mind and where they

1051
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,920
would go

1052
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,880
and would automatically down regulate

1053
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,560
unlikely negative

1054
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,960
events but once this precision started

1055
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,160
dropping this

1056
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,880
agent start basically imagining

1057
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,920
these negative outcomes and that's made

1058
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,119
the precision drop

1059
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,760
even more and then this agent yeah you

1060
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,560
can see

1061
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,480
i kind of calculated in terms of the

1062
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,680
fraction of imagined

1063
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,760
events that were negative negative

1064
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,520
outcomes

1065
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,040
call it like threat perception or

1066
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,800
something and

1067
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,880
and it's just an illustration of how you

1068
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,200
could simulate a process something like

1069
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,520
what we could call rumination um

1070
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,000
or at least like yeah a negative

1071
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,040
consequences

1072
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,640
produced by overthinking the situation

1073
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,720
and that's interesting because it means

1074
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,760
that you're actually

1075
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,280
can also model too much and

1076
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,040
you would think in machine learning that

1077
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,119
the longer you run your

1078
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,160
your model the better it gets but once

1079
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,599
you get this kind of recursive

1080
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:38,240
relationship

1081
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,880
you can actually get a kind of breakdown

1082
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,060
in

1083
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,440
[Music]

1084
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,839
in the way the future is imagined or

1085
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,200
anticipated

1086
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,310
you bring this one step further

1087
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,839
[Music]

1088
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,240
you can also actually i have a picture

1089
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,839
here as well

1090
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:03,119
um this one

1091
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,839
so this is where um something that looks

1092
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,040
a little bit like

1093
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,280
muscles um hierarchy can come into play

1094
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,920
um even especially when you start to

1095
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,560
make this with an

1096
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,760
extra layers but here i just

1097
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,000
[Music]

1098
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,680
connected this sophisticate affective

1099
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,550
inference

1100
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:26,160
[Music]

1101
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,960
to higher level states that in this case

1102
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,000
that describe

1103
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,440
exhaustion hunger and valence state

1104
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,800
um and the point is

1105
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,400
and that's something i also highlighted

1106
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,240
last time it didn't show the model

1107
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,599
itself

1108
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,880
that and the more hungry you are

1109
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,880
the more strongly you're driven by

1110
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,720
preferences for fruits

1111
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,040
the more exhausted you are the more

1112
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,920
strongly you are

1113
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,319
yeah driven to prevent expanding energy

1114
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,280
and valence is then a kind of summary of

1115
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,880
how well you're able

1116
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,000
to manage all these different

1117
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,720
kinds of preferences and here i just

1118
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,280
show an

1119
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,560
example simulation where you have these

1120
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,520
three different

1121
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,160
higher level states and they're kind of

1122
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:16,560
yeah

1123
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,920
valence er sorry exhausts the exhaustion

1124
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,040
and hunger are kind of

1125
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,599
competing in a sense because the agent

1126
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:24,880
needs to

1127
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,200
um to get foods they need to expend

1128
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,710
energy

1129
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:31,920
[Music]

1130
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,960
but yeah while they're at home resting

1131
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,400
their hunger increases the energy

1132
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,960
levels yeah the exhaustion decreases so

1133
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,640
there's this kind of

1134
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,760
cycle cyclical behavior

1135
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,240
where yeah if you follow it's kind of

1136
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,670
interesting you see that

1137
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,440
[Music]

1138
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,920
there is hungary in this case a very

1139
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,079
strong driver of negative affect so you

1140
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,119
see that whenever anger is high

1141
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,720
telling states is low um and the best

1142
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,800
situations yeah are

1143
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,800
in this kind of cases where you see that

1144
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,240
both of them are

1145
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,599
low at the same time so they're

1146
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,410
basically

1147
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:17,040
[Music]

1148
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,560
not hungry and not exhausted either

1149
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,920
i mean there's different kinds of

1150
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,599
balances you can implement here and this

1151
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:24,079
is

1152
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,319
in that sense just an illustration but

1153
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,119
you can already think of ways in which

1154
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,720
this also relates to

1155
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,560
things like depression for example

1156
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,640
where these uh people with depression

1157
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,599
would uh often report

1158
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,920
or have that had experienced depression

1159
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,839
and would report that they

1160
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,119
um have a lack of interest a reduced

1161
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,560
appetite

1162
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,680
because if you're really exhausted that

1163
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,680
means that you have a strong preference

1164
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,079
against expanding energy

1165
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,440
and that means that you can't anticipate

1166
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,359
the pleasure of eating anymore

1167
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,359
and you can't even experience it because

1168
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,119
you have this extreme

1169
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,720
and exhaustion or in this case the

1170
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,800
express yeah the depression states

1171
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,839
would be associated with

1172
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:19,839
experience of lack of energy

1173
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,760
i mean this is like a

1174
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,880
an example of

1175
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,160
how different kinds of

1176
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,480
phenomena that we know from psychiatric

1177
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,440
conditions

1178
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,920
actually emerge once you start to

1179
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,760
construct these types of models

1180
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,599
in detail let's see if i can

1181
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,520
so there's this aspect

1182
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,200
so this is kind of on the on an

1183
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,040
individual level and as i said i wanted

1184
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:49,359
to

1185
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,599
share with you how this works when you

1186
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:52,640
start to think about

1187
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,240
multiple um unless there are

1188
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,280
any questions um

1189
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,200
i'll just continue you can hit um hide

1190
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,000
on that stop sharing thing to move it

1191
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,079
and then i think let's have dean

1192
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,400
and then steven so dean go for it

1193
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:15,839
well

1194
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,920
my question fits perfectly with what you

1195
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,440
just talked about so

1196
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,880
essentially uh comparing a t-search to a

1197
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,000
tree search

1198
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,800
which i think of as natural order and

1199
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,960
your your slide about combinational

1200
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,760
explosion my question was in simple

1201
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,000
likelihood mapping the binary is what it

1202
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
is the explorer action

1203
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,599
is limited answering what is good and

1204
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:39,520
what is bad on some version of valence

1205
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,760
continuum

1206
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,400
past that one wonders about what happens

1207
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,520
when trade-offs become trade-ins

1208
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,280
this would add a layer of complexity by

1209
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,440
keeping what is good what is bad

1210
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,319
and what if to the mix in the teammates

1211
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,000
example there would be a third option

1212
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,800
trap door with optioning as function

1213
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,240
being the key that their door would

1214
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,680
contain say

1215
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,800
four times reward and two times pain so

1216
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,240
not enough to cause permanent

1217
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,440
consequence

1218
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,520
but still exponential relative to the

1219
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,119
acute outcome

1220
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,880
there'd be no cue to this option only

1221
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,119
the barrier that is either charged or

1222
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,880
not is transparent

1223
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,720
you can see the reward you can see the

1224
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,000
lightning bolt

1225
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,079
signal signaling that the barrier could

1226
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:23,200
be charged

1227
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,240
based on what if which extends the

1228
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,319
epistemic and specific

1229
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,880
of the simplified likelihood mapping to

1230
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,200
now include distribution

1231
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,720
which is third possibility and

1232
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,880
perception sensing which is the

1233
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,400
potential shock just as part of a 4x

1234
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:40,960
result

1235
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,359
do you think effective charge remains

1236
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,800
continuous

1237
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,880
in terms of the path to renewed

1238
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,640
confidence

1239
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,839
i know that's a really long thing but

1240
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:52,240
essentially

1241
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,000
i thought this was the direction you

1242
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,359
might go with this work

1243
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,880
and as it turned out way to go because

1244
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,880
this is exactly the kind of question

1245
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,319
when you have a learner

1246
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,640
who's thrown into a novel context they

1247
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,680
don't tend to only have a binary choice

1248
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,880
so how do we model for it because

1249
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,599
we want this to apply in real situations

1250
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,119
so

1251
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,400
clap clap that's perfect thanks

1252
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,200
i mean um the continuous versus discrete

1253
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,160
state space

1254
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,359
problem is pretty universal yeah

1255
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,960
um i think the way our minds

1256
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,800
tend to deal with it is by course

1257
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,640
grinding it's first in

1258
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,640
like categories and then later on when

1259
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,800
you're locally in the situation you end

1260
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,200
up

1261
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,559
sorting out the details on the

1262
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,319
continuous level

1263
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:46,000
exactly um so yeah that's i didn't

1264
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,640
i kind of ignored the continuous state

1265
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,760
space

1266
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,400
story here and just for the sake of the

1267
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,440
simulation

1268
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,880
but what's nice is when you start to

1269
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,119
look at the parameters actually you get

1270
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,880
do get the continuous play or like the

1271
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,640
sorry the way the variables

1272
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,960
vary over the course of simulation you

1273
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,960
get the continuous part back

1274
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,040
so cool and also dean in that i i

1275
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,000
i saw like you're approaching a t-turn

1276
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,960
it's a discreet

1277
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,800
choice in the moment but when you pull

1278
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,079
back and when you include

1279
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,119
what if it almost uh makes

1280
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,640
continuous through the generative model

1281
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,680
of the learner

1282
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,920
in this case it makes that situation go

1283
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,200
from discrete to continuous

1284
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,880
and also when you're learning you could

1285
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,559
rest or you could eat

1286
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,040
and so it's actually like our affect as

1287
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:35,680
learners

1288
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,240
as we're optimally foraging it really

1289
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,680
does need to be considered in an

1290
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,720
embodied sense because

1291
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,240
at any point you know when reading

1292
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,400
casper's paper we all could have thought

1293
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,119
wow

1294
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,200
we're a little tired and then that

1295
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,040
changes that's a binary decision but

1296
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,240
it's part of multiple

1297
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,200
overlapping continuums so yeah it's

1298
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:53,920
reflect

1299
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,880
reconcile recovery cool so thanks for

1300
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,800
the question dean um stephen

1301
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,240
go for the question and then um anyone

1302
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,640
else and then if not casper

1303
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,280
yeah i'd just like to get your thoughts

1304
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,000
on how

1305
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,280
context comes in i see we think about

1306
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,280
scaling and it's very tempting to sort

1307
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,520
of all this can scale in many ways but

1308
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,839
this almost speaks to this idea of like

1309
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:18,559
they talk about trans contextuality i we

1310
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,319
need to think about different

1311
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,000
ways that we're in the environment and i

1312
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,680
think that the way that

1313
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,400
also ties in with the psychiatric

1314
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,680
challenges is

1315
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,720
that like you say the affect

1316
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,760
um starts to run away from itself so

1317
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,480
that

1318
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,920
unlike someone who maybe doesn't have

1319
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,559
that disorder and can recalibrate or

1320
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:39,359
re-attune

1321
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,760
to the new environment someone with the

1322
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,800
disorder

1323
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,319
it's sort of like you say it runs away

1324
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:46,160
from itself but i'd be interested

1325
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,440
because one of the things with this work

1326
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,520
is it it puts the environment

1327
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,160
into the potential treatment regime and

1328
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,520
it doesn't just make it all about the

1329
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,040
mind and the body

1330
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,319
so just context and and how that

1331
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:02,079
that that has an impact

1332
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,119
um yeah so

1333
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,760
in these types of models in this case i

1334
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,400
[Music]

1335
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,720
simplified it but as we remember from

1336
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,000
the last time

1337
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,240
this d high level d would also include

1338
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,800
contextual states and then those

1339
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,119
contextual states can be inferred based

1340
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,400
on other things like

1341
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,440
external cues and

1342
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,960
so for example me observing myself

1343
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,559
um sitting at the dining table

1344
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:38,030
and smelling foods could trigger

1345
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:39,440
[Music]

1346
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,880
a kind of hunger

1347
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,599
state and then that increases my

1348
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:46,880
appetite

1349
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,720
basically or like increase my preference

1350
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,880
for eating food so there's

1351
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,520
there is actually yeah there is space to

1352
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,319
include

1353
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,599
um just things like

1354
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,640
where the context determines

1355
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,839
the way your preferences are structured

1356
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:04,720
and

1357
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,559
or at least influences the way they're

1358
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:07,920
structured

1359
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,280
so and this has then interesting

1360
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,839
implications for things like

1361
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:15,119
ptsd where people would get flashbacks

1362
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:15,680
when they're

1363
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,200
in a certain context that they

1364
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,440
associated with this experience

1365
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,440
for example or addiction as well it's

1366
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,440
like um

1367
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,680
people on the first line of treatment in

1368
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,200
strong addictions

1369
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,880
as just take people out of their

1370
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,359
contexts so that these cravings aren't

1371
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:31,840
triggered

1372
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,160
[Music]

1373
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,559
so and i think when you say trans

1374
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:38,319
contextuality

1375
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:41,200
that's a really interesting word i guess

1376
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,000
what you mean

1377
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,280
is that you have a different version of

1378
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:45,680
you

1379
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,960
for every different context in a sense

1380
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,200
yeah and it's also it's it's that that

1381
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,000
that that

1382
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,520
piece i mean they're talking about that

1383
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,079
a lot now with um

1384
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,200
developing um gregory bateson's work

1385
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,240
in terms of looking

1386
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,920
at multiple contexts

1387
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,000
and warm data they're talking about warm

1388
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,920
data so data it's not just

1389
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,680
dead data but is alive in a way the sort

1390
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,720
of stuff we talk about has

1391
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,200
affective content and trans

1392
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,720
contextuality means if you want to

1393
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,240
understand different contexts

1394
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,559
and not just deal with them separately

1395
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,160
and interrelate them then there needs to

1396
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,839
be some way that they're

1397
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:28,720
the living component of context is

1398
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:29,280
somehow

1399
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,319
held alive um yeah

1400
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:34,480
yeah that comes actually maybe that's a

1401
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,920
nice segue unless there are other

1402
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,079
questions there's a nice segue to the

1403
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:42,000
um culture part because

1404
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,200
great yep go for it yeah okay

1405
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:50,000
um because

1406
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,970
the most stable part of our context

1407
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:55,119
[Music]

1408
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:58,720
besides uh basic physical variables like

1409
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,160
temperature

1410
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,720
etc but our body temperature for example

1411
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,000
but

1412
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,079
once you move beyond that and one of the

1413
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,200
most stable

1414
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,720
components is other people in our

1415
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,559
environment um and

1416
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:19,280
how we how we coordinate with them um

1417
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,400
and it comes back to

1418
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,839
also uh some of the points that uh

1419
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:29,440
were made on the rhetoric uh story

1420
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,680
but just on the i guess i kind of like

1421
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,920
to start bottom up so i just start with

1422
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,559
the way um the

1423
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:41,680
yeah the affected states translate um so

1424
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,040
shared affects

1425
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,960
and and cultured emotions so in this

1426
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,319
case um

1427
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,920
i i construct a few gerund models

1428
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,480
um i can have the ones that are

1429
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,640
associated with competition

1430
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,200
or with cooperation and there are

1431
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,400
different kinds of models

1432
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,760
and there would be um if i believe

1433
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,960
somebody is an opponent

1434
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,880
then i have a certain expectation about

1435
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,640
what they prefer

1436
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,440
if they're antagonistic they so in the

1437
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,760
sense that they prefer

1438
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,200
they like to observe that i don't

1439
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,559
i don't get any reward for example

1440
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,119
or they may be just competing in the

1441
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,559
sense that they

1442
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,799
just want to maximize their own gain and

1443
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,480
different kinds of

1444
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,400
generative models i can have for the way

1445
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,240
other agents behave so that would be

1446
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,200
like the

1447
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,839
the antagonistic and competitive

1448
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:35,599
versions

1449
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:39,119
and then there's like corporation

1450
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:42,400
um can also have different flavors you

1451
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,440
can have agents who genuinely

1452
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,960
have preferences for

1453
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,400
maximizing your gain as well or you can

1454
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:52,640
have

1455
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,839
agents who only cooperate when it just

1456
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:58,079
because it happens to maximize their

1457
00:55:58,079 --> 00:55:59,030
gain

1458
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:01,200
[Music]

1459
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,880
these kinds of preference vectors is

1460
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,640
basically what you can infer

1461
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,480
based on how people behave and what kind

1462
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,240
of situations stay

1463
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,599
on um something like an altruist

1464
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,960
altruism versus egoism access

1465
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,599
you could think of it like that but and

1466
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:19,599
then beyond egoism there's something

1467
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,680
like

1468
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:25,839
um machiavellian no it's something like

1469
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:27,760
you want the other person to have less

1470
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,640
so that's something

1471
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,240
i guess even beyond egoism and anyway

1472
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,480
there's different kinds of uh generative

1473
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,160
models that you can

1474
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,559
apply to make sense of the behavior of

1475
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:39,359
others

1476
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:42,000
um and just want to share with you a

1477
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,799
generative

1478
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,839
like a dynamic model that i made quite a

1479
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:48,960
long time ago before actually

1480
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,119
i got into active inference

1481
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:56,319
modeling per se and then it took a while

1482
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,119
to get it out

1483
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:01,599
published but this is work from 2000

1484
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,280
2015. um

1485
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,520
and it was a pretty big challenge to get

1486
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,720
it published because people

1487
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,040
yeah it's like dynamical modeling is not

1488
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,960
very easy to

1489
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,400
sell to just psychologists who are used

1490
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,440
to their

1491
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,799
t-tests and everything but this model

1492
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:21,760
was about

1493
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,599
child play or actually play can be any

1494
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:27,680
interaction between agents actually it

1495
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,520
was child play was more like

1496
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,960
the immediate application but

1497
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,640
what is happening here is that every

1498
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,359
agent generates

1499
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:40,880
a decision and just the binary decision

1500
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,319
in this case um zero and one as

1501
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:46,160
was mentioned before you can often

1502
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,040
reduce it back to binaries um

1503
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,119
and in this case it's about playing so

1504
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,000
are they playing together yes or no

1505
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
if the agent tries to play with the

1506
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,520
other agent

1507
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,920
then only if both of them are trying to

1508
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:00,799
do that

1509
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:03,680
they have the emergent play outcome is

1510
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,520
playing together

1511
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,720
so there's a kind of conditionality

1512
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,720
embedded in their environment if one of

1513
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,079
them tries to play together and the

1514
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:13,760
other one doesn't then they

1515
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,799
then you get a zero outcome and since

1516
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:20,400
they both end up being low

1517
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,599
this kind of um

1518
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,720
builds in this dynamical model

1519
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,839
context i built different um

1520
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:33,040
self influences off on the cell this is

1521
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,079
based on a

1522
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,480
emotion theory by nico ryder i don't

1523
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,000
know i mean

1524
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,520
he's kind of famous in the netherlands

1525
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,680
but

1526
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,040
emotional theorists but then kind of

1527
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,079
revamped

1528
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:48,160
for dynamical system theory and the

1529
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,520
basic idea is that you have these

1530
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,640
concerns so

1531
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:54,319
that was also referred to in this muscle

1532
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:58,160
pyramid um and they these concerns

1533
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,359
and tend to drive behavior

1534
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:03,359
but they also tend to drive or tend to

1535
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:05,119
generate appraisals in terms of whether

1536
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:06,079
your concerns

1537
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:09,040
are are being met and that can trigger

1538
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,799
emotional expressions

1539
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:14,319
which then influence the other

1540
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:17,920
person in the environment and vice versa

1541
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,359
of course

1542
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,839
so that was something from previous work

1543
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:22,559
um

1544
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,680
but then yeah started to use this to

1545
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,559
generate

1546
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,680
um i mean

1547
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,200
yeah translate it to activate

1548
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,359
essentially um

1549
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:35,119
it's pretty easy to do so you can do

1550
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:36,720
this with almost any almost any

1551
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,640
dynamical model so

1552
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,319
if you're interested in active inference

1553
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,160
but you already are familiar with some

1554
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,440
other dynamical models

1555
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,119
usually it's a pretty straightforward

1556
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:46,559
translation

1557
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,319
it just means that you're reinterpreting

1558
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:51,280
certain parts of the mess

1559
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,599
sometimes means that you're reorganizing

1560
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:54,720
certain equations

1561
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:58,880
but often the core notions underlying

1562
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,599
model because i mean most yeah the

1563
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:04,240
models are always

1564
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,359
all i mean usually they're fought well

1565
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:10,240
through quite carefully by scientists so

1566
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:10,559
i

1567
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,400
tend to think of every model as a

1568
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,640
potential and

1569
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,480
yeah that has something of value that

1570
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,319
can be translated into the new

1571
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:22,960
into this interpretive framework

1572
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,200
and here it's about what kind of

1573
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,040
preferences the agents have

1574
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:31,359
and this is the lower level so i make it

1575
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:31,839
fix

1576
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:34,000
their preferences for being alone being

1577
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,760
together and then

1578
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,280
a kind of this is parameter here would

1579
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,480
be something like a

1580
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,520
symmetry bias so this is a preference

1581
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,960
against

1582
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,400
doing something else than the other

1583
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,799
person

1584
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,000
it's it's more of a hypothesis as i said

1585
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,599
before every model is a

1586
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,520
parameterization is a hypothesis it can

1587
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,119
be tested whether there's such a

1588
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:59,520
symmetry bias

1589
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,160
in practice there does seem to be such a

1590
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,200
thing

1591
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,839
anyway just not to overwhelm you with

1592
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:07,760
numbers but

1593
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,520
we can then make this hierarchical and

1594
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,770
let it play out over

1595
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:13,839
[Music]

1596
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:17,440
over time steps and then

1597
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,000
this agent starts to be able to manage

1598
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,280
their concerns

1599
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,319
over time so some agents might like to

1600
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:25,599
play together

1601
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,720
a lot more than others so then you get

1602
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,799
something like a baseline

1603
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:34,960
um concern for autonomy or

1604
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,880
playing alone versus a concern for

1605
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,839
um togetherness or belonging or

1606
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:43,280
something like that

1607
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,119
and those would be i think in every

1608
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,040
person are kind of competing

1609
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,559
so the idea here is that you're

1610
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:50,839
gathering evidence for each of these

1611
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:54,240
states and they are

1612
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,680
yeah they are driving your preferences

1613
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,359
but when you start to feel too lonely

1614
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:03,359
then you might be willing to sacrifice

1615
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:05,280
autonomy and

1616
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,200
when you start to um and vice versa

1617
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,240
when you need and feel

1618
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,400
you need more autonomy might be willing

1619
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,920
to um

1620
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,680
to play alone i mean this is a basic

1621
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,319
concept it can be applied to any kind of

1622
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:23,039
balance

1623
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:25,910
being act between preferences

1624
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:28,240
[Music]

1625
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,920
and you can also apply it actually i

1626
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,640
anticipate another slide here

1627
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,960
anyway i i've applied the same concept

1628
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:35,680
to model

1629
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,799
things like trust so trust games

1630
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:42,000
where you're trying to

1631
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,880
get a sense are we in a context where

1632
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,880
we're working together or are we in a

1633
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,359
context where we are

1634
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:52,559
against each other and it's actually the

1635
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,799
same types of moles

1636
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:57,680
but then with one additional twist is

1637
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,359
that now you're also inferring

1638
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:02,640
um yeah the

1639
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,960
the preferences of the other agent in a

1640
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,119
sense um

1641
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:10,400
with the same models applied so there's

1642
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:14,240
one i in addition to this there's one

1643
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,599
final thing i wanted to

1644
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,599
share let's see how much time oh we have

1645
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:18,960
quite some time business

1646
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,480
um i just wanted to

1647
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,160
share with you a few slides from

1648
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,920
to finish this from a talk i gave with

1649
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,200
maxwell ramstadt

1650
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:37,520
in canadian neuroscience spotlight was

1651
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,240
near in september somewhere in september

1652
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,599
um

1653
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:43,359
just to go a little bit more in depth on

1654
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,920
what you do when you

1655
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,760
have this type of model that

1656
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,839
characterizes some

1657
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:50,800
psychiatric

1658
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,119
[Music]

1659
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:56,160
condition or could characterize it

1660
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,400
so there's always a different kinds of

1661
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,319
domains of the state space

1662
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:02,960
and and we start with something we kind

1663
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:03,760
of

1664
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,079
presuppose a functioning uh

1665
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,400
or at least the potential to function or

1666
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,480
the model um

1667
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,000
and that's the kind of starting point

1668
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,079
but then you look at okay in what ways

1669
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:17,520
can it break down

1670
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,200
and what types of combinations of

1671
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,240
parameters result in different kinds of

1672
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:25,599
what we call computational phenotypes

1673
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,520
that could be associated with affective

1674
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,880
disorders

1675
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,000
in this case and what's nice there is

1676
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,680
that

1677
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,599
you can now start to do computational

1678
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,599
phenotype together kind of map

1679
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:40,799
of different

1680
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:43,440
different kinds of problems that can

1681
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,640
emerge

1682
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:48,079
and this map doesn't need to be

1683
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:51,839
strictly categorical in the sense that

1684
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:53,680
the parameter space can be largely

1685
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:56,960
continuous so you can get clustering

1686
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,559
but it doesn't have to be absolute you

1687
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,480
can code mobility you kind of get it for

1688
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,520
free because

1689
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,839
there's like this kind of coupling and

1690
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:09,680
you can get yeah basically

1691
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,559
combine it with things like rdoc i don't

1692
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:13,680
know if you're familiar with that but

1693
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,400
it's

1694
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,440
kind of um alternative to the dsm

1695
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,520
which is a category as mostly a

1696
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,400
categorical approach

1697
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,480
our dog tries to focus more also in the

1698
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,559
underlying

1699
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:32,000
mechanisms that generate these different

1700
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:36,079
phenotypes and in that sense

1701
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:38,079
this type of computational phenotyping

1702
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:40,240
could be the underlying

1703
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:44,000
statistical tool that could guide um

1704
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,280
different kinds of investigations of

1705
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,760
not just affective disorders in the

1706
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:50,960
basic

1707
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,359
level but also social emotional

1708
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:54,270
functioning

1709

[Music]

1710
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:58,319
because of course as we started out in

1711
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:00,400
the beginning those are intricately

1712
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,880
linked to each other and

1713
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,280
that's where the context becomes

1714
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,599
important

1715
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:13,200
and the way this is the final slide that

1716
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,280
i want to share

1717
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,559
is that we can now use these types of

1718
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:19,280
tools

1719
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,480
let's say we can fit them to individuals

1720
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,400
and based on what a wide variety

1721
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,720
of data can be self reports can be

1722
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:32,000
objective measures

1723
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,000
be also things like

1724
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,920
even the more traditional measures could

1725
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,559
be used to kind of initialize the model

1726
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:42,319
and there's different kind of different

1727
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:44,240
approaches you can take there

1728
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,520
and the basic point is that now you can

1729
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:47,839
have

1730
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:51,200
an um if you want to have a model

1731
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,520
of the model right it's it's a it's a

1732
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,680
metamodel it's a model of the model that

1733
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:56,880
tends to describe

1734
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,359
the way a person generates their

1735
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:01,440
behaviors and their faults

1736
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,839
and the way their feelings evolve over

1737
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:05,440
time

1738
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,400
once you have that you can use that to

1739
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,520
employ

1740
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,720
to basically forecast their weather

1741
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,640
conditions so to speak

1742
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,960
and those can be context dependent they

1743
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:17,760
can be

1744
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,720
too kind of tied back to a question that

1745
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:21,200
was

1746
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:28,079
posed on trans contextuality

1747
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:30,240
we know that the chances of rain are

1748
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,319
dependent on certain contextual factors

1749
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:34,480
factors that don't really yeah that

1750
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,920
depends on

1751
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,599
high level dynamics

1752
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:43,280
on the scale that are not local yeah

1753
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,540
it's not local

1754
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:46,240
[Music]

1755
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:49,039
in the same way what's happening down

1756
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:50,079
inside your

1757
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:52,320
body or let's say your heart rate can be

1758
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:53,839
[Music]

1759
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:56,799
contextualized by what's happening in

1760
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:59,759
the rest of the system

1761
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:01,920
and in the end what's the kind of dream

1762
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,440
for this

1763
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,400
psychiatric application effectively of

1764
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,640
an effective inference

1765
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,039
would be that therapists and

1766
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:12,240
psychiatrists etc

1767
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,720
don't have like a static thing like a

1768
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,280
book

1769
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,719
like dsm that just puts people into

1770
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:21,600
boxes but instead they have this dynamic

1771
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,080
tool

1772
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:26,158
that um updates itself

1773
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:28,960
by through feedback with the clients

1774
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:29,279
then

1775
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:31,920
release that to help the therapists and

1776
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:32,960
then

1777
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:36,080
the therapists can also improve

1778
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,399
that tool so in that sense you get a

1779
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:40,399
triad um

1780
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:42,799
where the and this can be applied not

1781
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:43,520
just to

1782
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,238
therapist client relationships but also

1783
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:47,679
can be applied to

1784
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:52,158
let's say help clients

1785
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:54,479
within their home environment to relate

1786
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:55,198
to their

1787
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:58,799
um yeah their loved ones

1788
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:01,839
their school and or their

1789
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:05,600
yeah their work environment

1790
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,880
this would be a

1791
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,799
personalized treatment prediction tool

1792
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:14,719
and treatment monitoring so there's a

1793
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:15,580
different

1796
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:21,600
here a lot on

1797
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,759
psychiatric applications because i think

1798
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,520
personally that's

1799
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,640
one of them yeah one that i find

1800
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,799
the most fascinating there's loads of

1801
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:31,839
other applications

1802
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:34,350
you can think of these types of

commercial purposes

1806
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:40,719
if you think about entertainment

1807
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:43,229
industry how to generate

um to entertain somebody

1811
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,040
i mean there's so many so many steps

1812
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,320
that you can take i

1813
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,880
just uh focused on the psychiatric side

1814
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,280
that i am

1815
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,960
yeah that's pretty much it for now but

1816
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,480
i'm further we can find some uh yep

01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:09,610
nice rabbit holes too

01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,159
let me see how i can stop sharing yes

1820
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:19,760
yeah awesome thank you casper super

1821
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,080
great to have you just kind of help us

1822
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,480
revisit the paper and also some of your

1823
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,400
past work and some of this other work

1824
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,320
and it really just struck me that you're

1825
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,560
talking about moving beyond the dsm

1826
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,199
into dynamic systems modeling the other

1827
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:34,239
dsm

1828
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:37,120
so it's a little acronym overlap but it

1829
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,400
just shows how when we

1830
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,440
have general principles it helps us

1831
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,719
descend

1832
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:44,480
into the nuance and the context the

1833
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,480
subtlety of a clinical relationship

1834
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,920
an entertainment relationship the

1835
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,920
educational relationship

1836
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,080
and actually do full justice to the

1837
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,520
complexity of

1838
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,480
the embodied situation rather than

1839
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,600
thinking that we're going to just have

1840
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,679
some sort of miso level theory

1841
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:01,840
that ends up actually falling in between

1842
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:02,719
sometimes

1843
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:04,480
general dynamical systems theory or

1844
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,640
complexity theory and then on the

1845
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,880
actual specifics so it was awesome to

1846
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,480
hear about these cases

1847
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:13,440
so we have um stephen and then scott and

1848
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:16,799
then anyone else who raises their hand

1849
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,280
yeah thanks this is really exciting with

1850
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,719
i've been i've been reading some of the

1851
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:22,800
work around the um

1852
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,120
the dynamical sort of options for

1853
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,800
psychiatry that you've been doing and i

1854
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:27,440
think

1855
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,440
one thing i notice is you talk about the

1856
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:30,800
self the other and an

1857
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,239
outcome and like the outcome it seems

1858
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:34,800
that

1859
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,320
as people are getting immersed in the

1860
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:39,120
outcome it gives a way to dissolve this

1861
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,320
self other

1862
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:43,199
dilemma which is in a way that the trap

1863
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:45,760
of modern psychology and psychiatry is

1864
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,440
you name someone the self because you

1865
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,960
can analyze the self

1866
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,320
and the other because you can name and

1867
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,679
analyze the other and then everything

1868
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:53,120
else just goes from there and the model

1869
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,000
is just like

1870
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,960
is it is dominant but never spoken about

1871
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,040
whereas here the model center stage but

1872
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,000
if you

1873
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,679
start to make it about the outcome and

1874
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:03,600
the context

1875
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,159
now suddenly the self and the other can

1876
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:07,199
start to take

1877
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,920
a more dissolved space you know and that

1878
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:10,480
and the

1879
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,640
positive psychology and the client can

1880
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,880
start to have more agency

1881
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,600
in their own life so i just yeah i'd be

1882
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,520
interested in just how you saw that

1883
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:23,840
relationship to self other an outcome

1884
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,920
yeah i mean

1885
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,600
in the in the interaction the

1886
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,520
distinction kind of dissolves to some

1887
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,159
extent

1888
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:37,760
in the sense that they are

1889
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:40,560
co-creating each other's models so to

1890
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,199
speak

1891
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:44,080
um and they end up having like a shared

1892
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,199
reality

1893
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:49,040
to a certain degree um

1894
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,719
and what makes this reality

1895
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:55,199
real or when like shared expectations is

1896
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:56,800
the fact that

1897
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,400
they have them uh together um

1898
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,400
and many of things in society are

1899
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,520
actually function

1900
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:06,159
only because other because we all to

1901
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:08,640
some extent believe in them like

1902
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,360
money is a very clear example like the

1903
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,199
only value money has is that

1904
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:18,000
other people believe it has value

1905
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,840
and again i mean self other i guess you

1906
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:22,560
can't really

1907
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,600
escape it in the end um

1908
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,719
i don't think we need to because

1909
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:30,480
if it's just a matter of the level of

1910
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,880
description i guess and just like the

1911
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,080
cells

1912
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,280
of the body are clear units but at the

1913
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,640
same time

1914
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,960
they are part of one hole and

1915
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,199
yeah this is like the gestalt basically

1916
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:46,960
this tall psychology kind of comes back

1917
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,480
to haunt you in a sense

1918
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,520
and there's the

1919
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,440
emergent hole that's other than the sum

1920
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:56,159
of the sparks

1921
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,800
i don't really mind talking about the

1922
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,640
units as long but i think what you

1923
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:01,920
describe is really important that you

1924
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,960
keep in mind that there is like

1925
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,679
it's just one level yeah in the end a

1926
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:10,239
reduction

1927
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,120
i think there was another is it's a

1928
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,340
follow-up question

1929
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:15,679
[Music]

1930
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,360
yeah well i think that makes sense i

1931
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,040
think just like you were saying if

1932
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:23,120
if the outcome is being measured

1933
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,679
does that change the way that we think

1934
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:26,320
about

1935
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,000
like if we start looking at the space

1936
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,719
the environment the outcome the context

1937
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:32,480
i mean are we in a whole different

1938
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,040
paradigm for treating

1939
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,640
disorders that's a really interesting

1940
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,679
one because

1941
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:41,040
i mean i know some really interesting

1942
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,520
research on the way in which

1943
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,640
psychiatric categories have influenced

1944
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:50,800
cognition and behavior across cultures

1945
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,640
basically people believing they have a

1946
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:53,920
depression

1947
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,280
or they have depression and then they

1948
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,679
can't get out of it because they

1949
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:00,800
ended up believing that that's their

1950
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,640
disease like a kind of discreet thing

1951
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,600
that they just stuck in

1952
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,840
so that's a really interesting example

1953
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,880
where

1954
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,360
in that sense are kind of like mind wear

1955
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,719
and they program

1956
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:17,199
and they kind of specify the way you

1957
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:20,159
structure your world

1958
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,480
and what i like about this kind of

1959
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,320
individualized modeling is that you can

1960
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,159
move away from those categories you

1961
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:30,080
don't even have to

1962
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,120
tell a person that they have a

1963
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:36,719
clinical diagnosis you can tell

1964
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:38,960
how you know how to help them because

1965
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,960
they have individualized predictions

1966
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,199
for treatment but you don't have to tell

1967
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:44,320
them like oh

1968
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,000
we're putting you in this bin

1969
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,239
[Music]

1970
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:49,760
there's somebody yeah that's like it

1971
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,520
becomes like a spectrum and there's

1972
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:52,960
different

1973
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:58,080
attractors in that state space

1974
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:01,760
but we don't need to

1975
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,880
make these strict dichotomies anymore i

1976
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,480
mean maybe for the insurance that's the

1977
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:06,880
only

1978
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,360
limit it's like the insurance companies

1979
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,040
want to know do we have to pay for this

1980
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,199
or not

1981
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:15,679
it it's so true that the implicit story

1982
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:16,880
of diagnosis

1983
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,560
is you know you got two kinds of people

1984
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,640
the diagnosed and the undiagnosed and if

1985
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,000
you have three of these five symptoms

1986
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,120
you're in this box

1987
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,960
and it almost made me laugh at this last

1988
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,400
point about insurance

1989
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:29,360
how about uh pay per affective charge

1990
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:29,679
let's

1991
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:32,239
uh continuously tune that dial if they

1992
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:34,400
just need like you know a little bit

1993
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,159
pay a little bit or something there's a

1994
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:37,920
whole level of nuance

1995
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,199
that's when we're thinking about this

1996
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:43,360
in a in a big way so thanks for that

1997
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,400
answer um

1998
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:49,839
scott go ahead casper then scott

1999
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,760
it was something i also i was trying to

2000
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,679
i gave a talk in my psychology

2001
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,239
department or like the brain cognition

2002
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,360
meeting in my

2003
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:02,880
university whereas basically saying that

2004
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,800
in principle if we can alternate this we

2005
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,880
can treat everybody

2006
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,640
and to the extent that they're

2007
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,400
interested in like

2008
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,159
improving aspects of their life i think

2009
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:13,440
everybody has some things they would

2010
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,120
like to improve so there's like

2011
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:18,239
don't even need to just limit it

2012
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:20,560
to like the kind of model where you just

2013
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,560
wait until things go horribly wrong and

2014
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,800
then you start to try

2015
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,960
to help like preventive treatments

2016
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,600
that are not based on the sky and this

2017
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:35,280
kind of disease model essentially

2018
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,800
anyway and those prodromes might be um

2019
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,960
revealed through these inferred

2020
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,960
parameters like uncertainty

2021
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,679
so before the real situation begins it's

2022
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:46,159
really

2023
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:50,159
a good point so scott dave and blue

2024
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:53,360
so fantastic there are so many things

2025
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,440
so many threads here let me pull a

2026
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,040
couple together and it's

2027
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,010
on this

2028
01:17:59,010 --> 01:18:00,880
[Music]

2029
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:04,480
space of social and internalized

2030
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:07,760
norms and folkways so dsm

2031
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:10,000
iv used to list the cultural phenomenon

2032
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,120
that weren't considered

2033
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,320
disorders like tarantella or you know

2034
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:14,640
the

2035
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,880
or the different things that you know

2036
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,400
they were cultural not considered

2037
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,199
disorders

2038
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:21,120
but that always seemed to be very um

2039
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,400
imperialistic

2040
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,320
uh the way they did that but it's kind

2041
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:25,679
of interesting when you start to move

2042
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:26,000
into

2043
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,679
the um you mentioned

2044
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:31,600
insurance companies and what they will

2045
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,440
pay for the naming

2046
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,719
of disorders is is

2047
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:38,719
many of them are just call disorders

2048
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:40,080
because they don't let you

2049
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,800
function as an industrial worker you

2050
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,080
know what i mean there's all sorts of

2051
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,120
context

2052
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,600
outside that dictates whether a disorder

2053
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,719
is a disorder

2054
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:51,280
and so i love that notion you're talking

2055
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,880
about about the clustering

2056
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:55,679
and the predictive elements there's an

2057
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:56,880
um

2058
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,280
people in public health non-mental

2059
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:00,400
health physical

2060
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,800
disease health talk about forty percent

2061
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,560
four zero forty percent of the

2062
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,480
global health effort for any emerging

2063
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:09,840
pandemic is repeated from one to another

2064
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:13,040
so imagine the cost savings and resource

2065
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:13,920
savings

2066
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,920
if you start to do predictive mental

2067
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,679
health like people have been talking

2068
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:20,080
about the covet is causing the ptsd

2069
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,239
generation so you can have these

2070
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:24,239
clusters of

2071
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:26,400
things that need to be dealt with on

2072
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,400
scales of billions of people

2073
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,920
and that idea about merging treatment

2074
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,960
into norms so really not talking about

2075
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,000
treatment you're just talking about

2076
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,840
a continuity of existential support

2077
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,320
in in society that's that really is

2078
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:42,960
fascinating

2079
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,000
here's the question so it's kind of an

2080
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:46,719
interesting

2081
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:48,640
there was an article on soft paternalism

2082
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,400
a number of years ago and the economist

2083
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,320
that idea that for instance if i have a

2084
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:53,840
gambling problem i can register with the

2085
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,480
state of missouri to not let me into the

2086
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,640
gambling ships that go up and down the

2087
01:19:58,640 --> 01:19:59,600
mississippi

2088
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,120
when i have a moment of clarity i can

2089
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,719
say don't let me on the ships

2090
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:04,080
and then i'm registered there and then

2091
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,000
they won't let me on the ships when i'm

2092
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,400
feeling the urge to go gamble so there's

2093
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,440
this kind of

2094
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:12,560
inviting that externality in one of the

2095
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:13,520
things i wanted to

2096
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,600
ask you about is your thoughts your gut

2097
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,480
thoughts on sovereignty and so i

2098
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,239
define a sovereign as something that

2099
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:22,159
doesn't need to ask for permission or

2100
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:23,920
forgiveness

2101
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:26,480
and it's always an external teleology

2102
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,000
it's always a projection out whether

2103
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,639
it's a deity or royalty or a country or

2104
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:31,520
a company

2105
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,920
we project it out so we can self bind to

2106
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,600
it okay that's my assertion

2107
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,320
okay so i'm looking it's that

2108
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,320
sovereignty has to have an abstraction

2109
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,760
of its subjects

2110
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,760
because that's the notion of so we

2111
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:44,880
project out

2112
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:47,840
it to be abstracting us so we can deal

2113
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,679
with the big problems

2114
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:52,080
and then the anomalies we take care with

2115
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,120
of with a mass

2116
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:56,320
customization of localizing it

2117
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:00,080
right so it feels like your clinical

2118
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:02,960
notion about psychological states could

2119
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:05,040
be employed for political purposes and

2120
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,560
i'm talking about in a positive way

2121
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,880
not in a bad manipulation but a good

2122
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,360
intentional manipulation

2123
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:14,320
of affective states that are positive

2124
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:17,120
for civic engagement

2125
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,679
and then you basically use the same

2126
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:20,800
notions as

2127
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,639
psychological disorders but you start

2128
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:24,480
correcting for let's call them political

2129
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,639
disorders

2130
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:29,120
right because it's just normative states

2131
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:29,679
right

2132
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:31,520
so that that's what i'm curious about is

2133
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,360
have you done any thinking about

2134
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,239
how to project cultural states from a

2135
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:37,199
group

2136
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:39,199
like like projecting it on the screen

2137
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:41,120
and then everyone watches it and says

2138
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,000
huh that's us up there let's go move

2139
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,960
towards that now

2140
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,440
sort of a question it's a really

2141
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:50,480
interesting question

2142
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,880
um i have a student that works on like

2143
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:55,120
communicative

2144
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,920
cultural dynamics assimilating the way

2145
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:58,960
in which beliefs

2146
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:02,560
kind of in a kind of minimalistic way

2147
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:04,480
that can be seen as

2148
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:08,000
um yeah modeled quite similarly to

2149
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,080
viral spread of um but then

2150
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,480
they're from the perspective of the

2151
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,600
beliefs

2152
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,280
that are spreading it's kind of like

2153
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,120
every time it's trying to be

2154
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,040
it's somebody tries to transmit it to

2155
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,800
the next person

2156
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,440
the question is how well does it fit

2157
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:25,920
with

2158
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:29,199
the next minds and only then

2159
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:32,719
only if their fit is close enough

2160
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:37,199
it can be it can reproduce essentially

2161
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:39,120
so then your question is kind of like

2162
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,960
one level beyond that where you're like

2163
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,280
we're trying to predict which message

2164
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,400
will fit

2165
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,679
to which group of people and then that

2166
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:49,520
can be taken in very equal

2167
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:52,159
directions but you can also kind of use

2168
01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:53,520
it maybe to break

2169
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:56,800
um uh political bubbles

2170
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,960
and it leads to extremism something like

2171
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,960
that so there's different kinds of

2172
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:03,440
because in the end it's a tool um that's

2173
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:04,239
right

2174
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:06,560
and one note on that political side

2175
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,159
because something people bring up is

2176
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:09,760
we're not simply talking about the

2177
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,159
communications or just the rhetoric

2178
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:13,120
display

2179
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,639
it's actually about doing a systems

2180
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:16,639
identification and potentially finding

2181
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:17,760
latent areas

2182
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:20,000
of agreement that are just two terms

2183
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,280
being used by two communities for

2184
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:21,920
example

2185
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:24,239
so yeah but very important and

2186
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:25,280
interesting

2187
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:28,080
topics i was just wondering uh sorry you

2188
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,520
talked about sovereignty

2189
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,840
so i was wondering how you view that

2190
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:32,800
connecting to

2191
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,560
sovereign because the way i see

2192
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,960
sovereignty is just like

2193
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:40,239
uh server and body is like something

2194
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:41,280
that has

2195
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:44,080
complete power over a certain domain and

2196
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,520
then

2197
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,360
talking about people within that domain

2198
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,960
so they are completely

2199
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,360
under the sovereignty of that governing

2200
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,080
body

2201
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,719
right the way the way the link happens

2202
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:56,400
is my assertion is that

2203
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,440
all sovereigns are projections

2204
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,800
so they are they're they gods um

2205
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,800
i don't say we invented god because i'm

2206
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,400
an atheist but it might be a blasphemy

2207
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,320
to other people so we invented deities

2208
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,440
because there's different things you

2209
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,760
know so it's like

2210
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:15,040
we invented royalty we invented

2211
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,800
countries we invented companies name

2212
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,080
another sovereign they're the things

2213
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,199
that don't ask for permission or

2214
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:20,159
forgiveness

2215
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:23,760
we invented them so that we can organize

2216
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,440
at larger levels now we didn't say it

2217
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:27,280
explicitly but that's

2218
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,600
why we did it and so all of them are

2219
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:30,480
projections

2220
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:33,520
so they're all stories from us now they

2221
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,679
take on a separate life

2222
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:39,120
sort of but they can never be identified

2223
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,239
that's the thing about sovereigns

2224
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:42,080
there's always a metaphysical element

2225
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,159
they can never be identical to the

2226
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:45,120
subjects

2227
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,719
that's why you that's why when a

2228
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:49,040
sovereign dies in office it's a it's a

2229
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:50,000
real

2230
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,040
difficulty for the sovereignty

2231
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,760
when a human who represents a sovereign

2232
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:56,719
dies

2233
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:58,880
because it has to be separated out you

2234
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,480
have a state funeral but then the body

2235
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:01,600
has to be separated

2236
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,920
from the body politic right it's hobbs

2237
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:05,520
it's a leviathan thing

2238
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,280
leviathan can't be composed of the

2239
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:08,960
individual parts it takes on a separate

2240
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:10,159
nature

2241
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:11,760
and anyway so that's why this is so

2242
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,679
interesting that projection

2243
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:17,120
and that act of collective projection

2244
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,440
is totally where we are right now think

2245
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:20,560
about all the problems

2246
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,800
climate change global resources water

2247
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,400
resources finance

2248
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,000
things that can't be done by nation

2249
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,480
states we need new sovereign levels

2250
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,560
active inference is going to be the way

2251
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,080
that we synthesize them

2252
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,920
it will be whether we call it active

2253
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,920
inference or not because it's all we've

2254
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:36,639
ever done

2255
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:38,960
as biological then living and social

2256
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,000
organisms

2257
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,600
and it's a way of framing it and so it's

2258
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,760
a way of now to me

2259
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,000
it's a new teleology we can project

2260
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:46,880
forward just like you're saying

2261
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,600
predicting on

2262
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,520
psychology i think we can predict

2263
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,760
politics and social states

2264
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,600
because we can use predictive analytics

2265
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,360
of clustering it's the same thing

2266
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,199
you take a bunch of americans another

2267
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:59,520
student who was modeling the elections

2268
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:03,120
american elections uh with the same

2269
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:06,239
um but i i like what you said about

2270
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:08,159
it's kind of subjective it's like the

2271
01:26:08,159 --> 01:26:09,920
attribution of power

2272
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,199
um but then it's like a totally

2273
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:14,000
imaginary

2274
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,239
thing just like we attribute power to

2275
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:17,199
money

2276
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:20,239
yeah yeah i mean money is is de-risking

2277
01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:21,280
consolidator

2278
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:23,360
you know it is one form of money wixel

2279
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:24,480
and smith and hume they all have

2280
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:25,920
different ideas about money

2281
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,120
but one way you can look at it is a

2282
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:29,440
de-risking consolidator so it takes all

2283
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,040
risk and makes it into one risk which is

2284
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:32,800
how can i get more money

2285
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,000
and if that's the case it's an

2286
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,080
interaction de-risking tool

2287
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,400
right actually this could give us a way

2288
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:39,120
to discuss

2289
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,679
um to bring it also to the earlier point

2290
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:42,960
of instrumentalism

2291
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:45,360
and realism because the fact that money

2292
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,520
has instrumental value doesn't make it

2293
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:48,080
real

2294
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,520
i mean that's right that's like kind of

2295
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:50,960
interesting question that i don't have

2296
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,080
an answer to i mean

2297
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,239
i guess in practice it's real because

2298
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:56,880
people believe yeah it's like a queen

2299
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:59,280
singing and one thing one thing i just

2300
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,719
suggest you look at uh somebody just

2301
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:02,239
surprised me a couple of months ago

2302
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:04,320
about christopher alexander's work in

2303
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,960
architecture if you haven't run into

2304
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,320
that check it out

2305
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,000
because what he does is basically looks

2306
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,159
at patterns in architecture through deep

2307
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:12,880
time and

2308
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:16,159
and through space and the idea is that

2309
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:19,040
existing practices are captured in

2310
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,040
patterns of practice

2311
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:23,120
and if you want to look at a solution

2312
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,040
for an earlier for a problem

2313
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,520
look at patterns of practice from other

2314
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:28,960
situations and bring them

2315
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,840
into the situation here similarly it

2316
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,840
feels like we can in your work it's

2317
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:34,800
revealing

2318
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:37,840
that we can look at patterns of practice

2319
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:40,239
and then take them as predictive models

2320
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:41,920
and so that's what chris alexander does

2321
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:43,199
that in architecture

2322
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:45,040
and it's very straightforward there

2323
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,639
because it's physical instantiations

2324
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:47,840
like an archaeology

2325
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:50,000
of the mind of architecture in a way or

2326
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,239
the archaeology of the problem space

2327
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:53,840
anyway something to look at it might be

2328
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,360
uh fruitful thanks

2329
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:58,480
thank you scott so we have um dave

2330
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,080
blue and then a question from the chat

2331
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:02,800
so go ahead dave

2332
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:07,280
yeah um if you could uh

2333
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:10,639
turn toward the realistic side of

2334
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:12,840
your experience with with these

2335
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,000
questions

2336
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,679
do you kaspar have the feeling that

2337
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:20,800
people's real models

2338
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:24,080
are of the same structure

2339
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:27,120
as these transpersonal

2340
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:30,159
models or person to environment or

2341
01:28:30,159 --> 01:28:31,760
organism to environment

2342
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:35,280
folks in this field seem to kind of uh

2343
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:38,080
assume that oh yeah it is all turtles

2344
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:39,679
all the way down or it's blankets all

2345
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:40,480
the way down

2346
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,320
and i don't know that i'm convinced that

2347
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:45,040
which what's your intuition

2348
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:50,080
interesting question um

2349
01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:53,679
i think that it's kind of similar to the

2350
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:54,960
way

2351
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:57,840
um

2352
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:01,440
you can't last time we talked about

2353
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,920
dimensionality and you can project from

2354
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:04,560
3d

2355
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:08,159
into 2d space but like understanding a

2356
01:29:08,159 --> 01:29:10,000
3d space while you're in a 2d

2357
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,320
space it's kind of impossible

2358
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,080
essentially in the end

2359
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:16,320
and it's a little bit similar like

2360
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:17,199
looking down

2361
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:19,360
on the hierarchy i think it's much

2362
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,800
easier makes things

2363
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,679
feel much realer more real because

2364
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:25,120
essentially they can

2365
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:28,159
they're within your

2366
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:32,560
yeah your mind can grasp them um

2367
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,360
and when you move upwards you're sort of

2368
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:36,480
the transpersonal

2369
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:41,040
part i think it's um

2370
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:44,000
our minds don't have yeah the capacity

2371
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:44,719
to

2372
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:48,239
fully grasp something like that

2373
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:50,840
we can so it doesn't have the same

2374
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:53,840
experiential

2375
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,430
yeah i would just say

2376
01:29:57,430 --> 01:29:58,639
[Music]

2377
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:01,760
detail maybe um

2378
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,520
so yeah i think you're getting at an

2379
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:04,800
interesting point where there seems to

2380
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,080
be a difference between

2381
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:09,760
the way what experientially

2382
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:12,960
feels real and what

2383
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,120
in it from an interme instrumentalist

2384
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,000
perspective

2385
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,840
and there doesn't seem to be much of a

2386
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:21,280
difference if you can move through

2387
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:23,310
the trans-personal level

2388
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:24,560
[Music]

2389
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:28,400
just like as i said i think

2390
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:31,440
in principle humans can form

2391
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:34,560
but higher levels of organization

2392
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:38,000
can form bodies together and

2393
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,440
every human is this unit

2394
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:44,800
in this body just like every cell

2395
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:48,000
is and every organ in the end um

2396
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,040
has its own local experience so to speak

2397
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:54,239
its own local data

2398
01:30:54,239 --> 01:30:57,840
maybe that is being integrated

2399
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:00,840
to inform their states and their

2400
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:02,800
decisions

2401
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,880
but then there's the global pattern and

2402
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,560
that's the local elements never have

2403
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,800
direct access to it

2404
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:14,159
and i think that's something that

2405
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:18,320
gets at this point as you're describing

2406
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:22,239
um but yeah i guess i don't

2407
01:31:22,239 --> 01:31:23,679
have the real answer just but i

2408
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:25,040
understand experientially what you're

2409
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:25,520
saying

2410
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:28,159
in the sense that definitely there are

2411
01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:30,960
things that feel real

2412
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,560
there are things that don't exist but

2413
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,560
feel real that's also

2414
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:37,440
that there are ways in which trans

2415
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:38,080
personal

2416
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:41,760
concepts can start to trigger

2417
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:44,080
hallucinations in people for example and

2418
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,180
there's all kinds of

2419

[Music]

2420
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:50,480
hedge cases and does it answer your

2421
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:51,440
question i think it's a really

2422
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:52,800
interesting one i don't have a good

2423
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:53,840
answer

2424
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:57,199
it does yeah i think it is an elephant

2425
01:31:57,199 --> 01:31:58,400
in the room

2426
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:01,440
perhaps um yeah and if i could just run

2427
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:02,480
off on a tangent

2428
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:06,000
on that um the relation between inner

2429
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,040
in the sense of what's inside a

2430
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:12,080
fristonian blanket and inner in the

2431
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:14,239
sense of what's going on in various

2432
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:16,719
parts of the nervous system or the

2433
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:20,000
organism i tend to come at this by

2434
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:20,639
thinking that

2435
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:24,000
what the the physiological uh

2436
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,760
the anatomical correlates of what we've

2437
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:28,000
been focusing on for the last

2438
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,120
two weeks are largely going on

2439
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:34,560
in the midbrain the brain

2440
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:37,760
stem some of the lower structures in the

2441
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,440
cortex

2442
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:42,800
but the modeling goes on

2443
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:46,560
in the neocortex so the inside is

2444
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:47,040
actually

2445
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:51,040
executed outside in the portion of the

2446
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:53,199
nervous system that's really good at

2447
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:54,800
doing algorithms

2448
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:58,080
and pattern matching and reinvestment

2449
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:00,639
of pattern transformations but the

2450
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:02,239
purpose of doing the whole thing

2451
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:05,280
is largely especially in a

2452
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:08,719
small child or a non-human mammal

2453
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:12,159
outside the cortex so that probably

2454
01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:15,280
blows the whole thing

2455
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,440
in principle yeah from the models that i

2456
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,960
built it usually doesn't really matter

2457
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,480
where the data comes from

2458
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:23,600
like uh can be inter internal signals

2459
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:24,719
external

2460
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:27,040
it's more important what the inference

2461
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:28,560
is about

2462
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:32,159
so like um extraoception

2463
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:35,280
is is perception about external

2464
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:38,400
states of the world an imperception

2465
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,560
about

2466
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:43,360
internal states of the system but i can

2467
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:44,480
have

2468
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:47,360
extra external signals that may give me

2469
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,679
information about my internal states and

2470
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:52,320
vice versa

2471
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:56,320
so this distinction is pretty important

2472
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:59,040
but yeah that doesn't entirely resolve

2473
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,280
the issue

2474
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:02,800
just i like the fact that the models are

2475
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:05,679
kind of agnostic about

2476
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:09,440
where exactly the information comes from

2477
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:12,960
cool a lot to say on this um blue

2478
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,239
and then a question from the chat and

2479
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:16,320
then anyone else in the chat or here who

2480
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:19,520
wants to ask

2481
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:22,800
so i loved the diagnosis or the

2482
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,560
elimination of diagnosis

2483
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:28,560
and clustering instead of of diagnosing

2484
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:30,320
people except like when it comes to

2485
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:31,679
insurance and so

2486
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:34,320
casper i'm going to charge you with

2487
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:35,600
obliterating this

2488
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:38,159
in the minds of of insurance companies

2489
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:39,679
also because i think that there's this

2490
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:42,159
fundamental thing that happens

2491
01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:45,280
and i mean maybe i'm wrong but if i am

2492
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:48,400
you know if i display some behavior of

2493
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:51,360
you know someone with adhd and i display

2494
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:52,560
a lot of those behaviors

2495
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,800
so if i display some of this behavior

2496
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:55,920
but then i go

2497
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:58,480
see a psychiatrist and i'm diagnosed

2498
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:00,000
with adhd

2499
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,920
i think that there's a large degree

2500
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:03,119
especially in younger

2501
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:04,880
children like as they're coming into

2502
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:06,800
themselves and dealing with identity

2503
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:09,440
crises teenagers and so forth

2504
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,280
i think that there's a large degree of

2505
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:12,719
of excusing or

2506
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:15,520
perpetuating my behavior because i have

2507
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:16,639
a diagnosis

2508
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:19,119
right so so if i'm diagnosed with

2509
01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:21,920
something like adhd like maybe that will

2510
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:23,679
you know give me i'll give myself

2511
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:25,440
permission or excuse

2512
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:28,960
or or i'll cluster more strongly

2513
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,880
into the group of people that have that

2514
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:32,480
those kinds of behaviors

2515
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:34,320
because i have a diagnosis i think that

2516
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:36,080
this is very plausible

2517
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:39,920
what do you think yeah that's also what

2518
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,040
i was trying to

2519
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:44,159
get it in a sense that people tend

2520
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:48,480
to yeah use use these internal

2521
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,480
representations to structure their

2522
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:53,440
experience and then to

2523
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:56,560
respond yeah to generate their responses

2524
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:59,040
and then these boxes become

2525
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:01,119
self-fulfilling prophecies essentially

2526
01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:04,400
um to a certain extent

2527
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,800
then there's that side but there's also

2528
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:10,239
then there's another side to it is that

2529
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:11,920
there are also positive reports that

2530
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:15,600
people when they can

2531
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:20,960
attribute the effects to something

2532
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:23,679
it makes them feel less anxious so they

2533
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:24,719
can kind of explain

2534
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:26,110
the way

2535
01:36:26,110 --> 01:36:28,239
[Music]

2536
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:30,960
and yeah i don't know what's yeah it has

2537
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:31,760
downsides

2538
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:35,440
and upsides i guess yep

2539
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:38,639
a very sensitive and interesting thing

2540
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:40,159
but it reminds me of the 12

2541
01:36:40,159 --> 01:36:42,320
steps and the first step is to

2542
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,480
acknowledge the kind of person that

2543
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:46,159
one is obviously we're not going to go

2544
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:47,520
into this and it's for others to

2545
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:48,400
investigate

2546
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:49,920
but it's a trade-off between having a

2547
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,520
narrative certainty

2548
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:54,480
a diagnostic confidence versus the

2549
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:55,280
alternative

2550
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:57,760
and so there's our teammates in meaning

2551
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:59,600
or a narrative space

2552
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,480
which one of these bifurcation paths

2553
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:03,679
narratively

2554
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:06,080
will we then have the lower levels of

2555
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:07,119
our model like

2556
01:37:07,119 --> 01:37:08,800
whether we exercise or not or whether we

2557
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,639
have a job or not those kinds of things

2558
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:12,320
come into play

2559
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,400
um i just want to ask the question from

2560
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,239
the chat and then um

2561
01:37:16,239 --> 01:37:18,320
dean and stephen and scott so in the

2562
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:19,600
chat someone wrote

2563
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:22,239
can free energy principle based models

2564
01:37:22,239 --> 01:37:24,080
reach a level in the future to be able

2565
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:25,520
to precisely predict

2566
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:28,159
when emotion or valence happens and more

2567
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:29,119
importantly when

2568
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:31,119
in the temporal dynamics of that cycle

2569
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:33,040
does thought subside

2570
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:34,719
so how is our experience of thought

2571
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:36,560
related to some of these simulations

2572
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:38,960
with uh you know the countervailing

2573
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:40,639
affect of chart or countervailing you

2574
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:41,040
know

2575
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:43,840
hidden states where does our experience

2576
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:49,440
of thought come into play

2577
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:52,639
i mean um it's to some extent

2578
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:56,239
already being done in the sense that um

2579
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:59,360
there's applications of in amsterdam

2580
01:37:59,360 --> 01:37:59,840
they have

2581
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:02,080
uh they're trying they have been

2582
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:03,679
treating ocd

2583
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:06,639
with the brain stimulation and they

2584
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:08,239
identify the locus

2585
01:38:08,239 --> 01:38:11,920
of the intervention using

2586
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:16,639
fmri and fmri is driven by dcm

2587
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:18,239
which is driven by free energy

2588
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:20,320
minimization right so we're already

2589
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:22,080
doing that to some degree

2590
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:25,440
identifying the kind of

2591
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:29,520
recurrent self-destructive

2592
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:32,719
loops of behavior in in the brain

2593
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:34,159
essentially

2594
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:38,800
so internal behavior of the system

2595
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:41,199
and then identifying ways to break break

2596
01:38:41,199 --> 01:38:42,880
those loops

2597
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:45,199
so they they implant they just try to

2598
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:46,840
find the kind of

2599
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:48,719
[Music]

2600
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:51,920
note at which the loop is um

2601
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:53,920
through which the loop is circulating

2602
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:56,400
and then they break yeah they

2603
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,960
disturb that note once in a while and

2604
01:38:58,960 --> 01:38:59,520
that

2605
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:03,280
actually leads to an improvement

2606
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,520
in function it's kind of funny because

2607
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:06,800
when they remove it

2608
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:09,600
and loops tend to return pretty quickly

2609
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,280
again so

2610
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:14,719
seems not to be an it's it's kind of

2611
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:16,239
it's not a pool treatment it's more like

2612
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:16,639
a

2613
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:20,320
prevention it gets more interesting if

2614
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:21,760
you had like real time way

2615
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:25,440
of getting into that then you don't

2616
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:28,400
yeah you would need not just like um an

2617
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:29,199
electrodes

2618
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:32,400
in there but like a whole

2619
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,719
a whole array of electrodes that are

2620
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:37,440
like tracking

2621
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:39,520
and it's a little bit scary but in

2622
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:41,600
principle you could have like a

2623
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:45,600
whole weather tracking

2624
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:48,560
system inside and then um if there's a

2625
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:49,679
hurricane emerging

2626
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:52,480
and blocking the i mean they tried to do

2627
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:54,239
that already for people with epilepsy

2628
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:56,400
and

2629
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,800
i guess then we all become like a cyborg

2630
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,239
or something if you start to go that

2631
01:40:02,239 --> 01:40:05,360
and that's what maybe not

2632
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,440
i mean what i guess i find more

2633
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,440
interesting or like more

2634
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:12,960
appealing is um

2635
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:15,920
if we start to become more aware of how

2636
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:17,040
these feelings

2637
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:19,199
are

2638
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,080
generated by our relation with the

2639
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:25,040
external world so

2640
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:27,100
there's this use case of um

2641
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:28,320
[Music]

2642
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:31,840
tracking um warehouse workers

2643
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:34,400
that i've been uh seeking to apply some

2644
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:35,360
of my work to

2645
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:36,719
[Music]

2646
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:38,800
where you could track their affective

2647
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,320
states over the course of the day

2648
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,760
and every person has a different

2649
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:44,320
chronotype every person has different

2650
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:46,239
times of day when they feel most

2651
01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:48,320
energetic and it depends also on how

2652
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:51,040
well they've slept recently et cetera

2653
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:53,360
and so if you had some intelligent

2654
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:54,880
warehousing system

2655
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:56,880
then you could base you could distribute

2656
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:57,920
tasks

2657
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:01,040
and the schedule of the warehouse

2658
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:04,159
could be adjusted to suit

2659
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:06,700
the preferences and to maximize

2660
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:08,080
[Music]

2661
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:11,600
well-being of the

2662
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,719
the workers and potentially in the

2663
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:15,280
process

2664
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:16,960
also increase productivity so that's

2665
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:19,199
like kind of capitalistic

2666
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:22,320
potentially if we could construct things

2667
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:23,280
like that

2668
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:25,840
and we could use our our modeling of

2669
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,679
these effective dynamics over the course

2670
01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:28,239
of

2671
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:30,239
day by day for each individual we could

2672
01:41:30,239 --> 01:41:33,839
use them to

2673
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:36,480
care for people to make them to prevent

2674
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:37,410
burnouts

2675
01:41:37,410 --> 01:41:39,440
[Music]

2676
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:43,600
and potentially make that appealing for

2677
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:46,159
people who are just driven by money by

2678
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:47,440
profit unfortunately they're

2679
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:50,800
always in the end just most

2680
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,400
companies are just driven by profit so

2681
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:54,480
to make that realistic and scalable you

2682
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:55,040
need to

2683
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:57,679
show that also is good for the for the

2684
01:41:57,679 --> 01:41:59,199
business

2685
01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:01,840
um anyway so that's like some more parts

2686
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:02,239
i have

2687
01:42:02,239 --> 01:42:05,600
in reaction to that question um there

2688
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:07,600
was a sub component what was the second

2689
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:09,440
part could you read that again

2690
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:12,000
um uh more importantly where in this

2691
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,440
temporal dynamical cycle

2692
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:17,360
does thought subside

2693
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:22,320
that's a very nice question

2694
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:27,520
i wish i knew let's keep let's keep

2695
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:29,119
clicking on it

2696
01:42:29,119 --> 01:42:31,440
i guess there are certain parts of our

2697
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:32,960
system that are able to

2698
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:35,520
disable are kind of contributing to our

2699
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,360
verbalization

2700
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:40,159
and the way i feel thought at least the

2701
01:42:40,159 --> 01:42:42,000
kinds of introspective thoughts

2702
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:46,320
that uh it's verbal um

2703
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:49,360
tends to be a kind of

2704
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:53,840
internal internalized social

2705
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:57,280
skill essentially you first need to

2706
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,960
learn

2707
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:02,000
about how to speak with others and then

2708
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,520
as a child i guess when you're really

2709
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:05,360
young at some point you start to be able

2710
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:07,520
to

2711
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:10,719
have these dynamics run internally

2712
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:12,880
and my suspicion is i think there are

2713
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,400
some research actually confirming this

2714
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:16,480
to some extent but

2715
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,159
in order to create the verbal thoughts

2716
01:43:18,159 --> 01:43:19,840
you need to access different

2717
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:23,040
pathways you just

2718
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:26,960
attenuate the actual motor execution

2719
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:30,400
um that's how they tend to think about

2720
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:31,840
it in the literature

2721
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,440
um and then there's imagery thought

2722
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:39,119
which is yeah in a sense

2723
01:43:39,119 --> 01:43:41,679
even more amazing maybe because that's

2724
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:43,920
not something you can

2725
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,719
i mean verbal uh that's an actual action

2726
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:47,679
that you do

2727
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:49,199
so it's kind of easier to imagine how

2728
01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:51,280
you could have this action evolve

2729
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:54,400
like unfold internally but

2730
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:57,840
imagery is not something that you

2731
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,199
actually

2732
01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:04,000
do in life it's just something you can

2733
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:07,840
somehow

2734
01:44:08,239 --> 01:44:11,919
you control your own internal

2735
01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:15,360
[Music]

2736
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,920
pathways that you normally you would use

2737
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,480
for

2738
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:22,239
for having a visual sensation

2739
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:25,199
your mental actions can somehow control

2740
01:44:25,199 --> 01:44:26,320
your visual

2741
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:29,520
processing pathways which i i have a

2742
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:30,480
hard time

2743
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:33,600
imagining how exactly that i mean

2744
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,920
i can build a model of that i think but

2745
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:38,239
yeah how it works in

2746
01:44:38,239 --> 01:44:40,480
like biologically i find it quite hard

2747
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:40,700
to

2748
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:43,280
[Music]

2749
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:45,040
well that's that's the instrumentalist

2750
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:46,960
tango we can build a few model

2751
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:48,719
architectures we could think about some

2752
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:50,560
differentiating experiments we could

2753
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:52,239
imagine some informative

2754
01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:55,199
observations go from there continue the

2755
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:56,320
discussion from there

2756
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:59,440
so um in our last little bit let's go

2757
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:00,000
with

2758
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,679
dean scott stephen

2759
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:06,159
thanks uh real quick um you talked about

2760
01:45:06,159 --> 01:45:07,760
personalized stuff and

2761
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:10,000
the loop seems to come back on politics

2762
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,679
because i remember a couple weeks ago

2763
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:13,040
the first thing i think i said to you

2764
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:15,119
after high was we can't

2765
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:16,800
unlearn this once we start using these

2766
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:19,840
diagnostic tools we can't unsee it

2767
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:22,719
um so there's a lot of politics involved

2768
01:45:22,719 --> 01:45:24,960
and people have this ability

2769
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:28,480
to to see things one thing i

2770
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:30,320
want one reference i wanted to mention

2771
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:32,000
and be especially

2772
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,440
i think helpful to scott if he hasn't

2773
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:35,679
already read it about this personalized

2774
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:37,280
versus political

2775
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:39,360
is an author by the name of paul khan

2776
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:41,040
paul w khan

2777
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:43,760
and his book is called origins of order

2778
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:44,560
and what it does

2779
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:46,639
is it tries to bring those two ends of

2780
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:48,159
that continuum

2781
01:45:48,159 --> 01:45:51,360
into some sort of a not like there's no

2782
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:52,960
balance between the two but there's kind

2783
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:54,480
of a back and forth

2784
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:57,679
and it's very looking at rules but not

2785
01:45:57,679 --> 01:45:58,000
just

2786
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,280
on a legal level but on the on

2787
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:03,840
on much bigger scales so it kind of fits

2788
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:04,960
nicely with

2789
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:07,280
what blue said about the diagnostics

2790
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:08,800
what we've touched on a couple times

2791
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:11,119
about the instrumental stuff

2792
01:46:11,119 --> 01:46:13,440
but i still think that if you try to

2793
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:15,360
apply a lot of this stuff to

2794
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:17,360
which is what i did before it would i

2795
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:19,040
used very rudimentary

2796
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:21,520
ways of expressing this but i gave young

2797
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:23,360
learners these tools

2798
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:25,760
and boy was it political the results of

2799
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:26,800
that because

2800
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:29,360
they could just see things and start

2801
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:30,480
doing things and there was a whole lot

2802
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:31,440
of people that went

2803
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:33,920
hey whoa whoa whoa they're getting way

2804
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:35,600
too much power from this

2805
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:37,199
but anyway that's just an aside i just

2806
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:39,280
wanted to share the reference because i

2807
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:41,280
think it really ties in nicely with

2808
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:42,960
some of the stuff that scott was talking

2809
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:44,800
about earlier and obviously

2810
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,320
i don't think the political part of it

2811
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:47,760
goes away no matter how much we want to

2812
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:48,239
be

2813
01:46:48,239 --> 01:46:51,599
agnostic thanks

2814
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,199
i mean yeah in a political context in a

2815
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:55,679
sense

2816
01:46:55,679 --> 01:46:58,800
what we're trying to determine is what

2817
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:00,560
what is the generative model that

2818
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:03,119
governs the body

2819
01:47:03,119 --> 01:47:06,560
so like this conflict

2820
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:09,760
and tension and tension resolution

2821
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:13,280
and it's kind of like the price we

2822
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:16,719
have paid for being able to

2823
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:20,239
to organize it's it's the body politic

2824
01:47:20,239 --> 01:47:22,480
the leviathan as brought up earlier will

2825
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:24,639
we turn left will we turn right will we

2826
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:27,840
look forward will we look backwards

2827
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:30,480
there's a lot to this multi-level

2828
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:32,480
political approach

2829
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:36,719
so scott and then stephen yeah thanks

2830
01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:39,920
so the it it is a big um it's like

2831
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:41,920
moving a slime mold

2832
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:44,880
but you know from outside the um a

2833
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,400
couple of things that jumped in in the

2834
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:47,440
last bit um

2835
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:49,119
and and where i'm going with this is the

2836
01:47:49,119 --> 01:47:51,520
notion of a capitalist enclosure of

2837
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:52,880
consciousness

2838
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:55,679
with the categories of abstraction so

2839
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:57,679
the painter kandinsky

2840
01:47:57,679 --> 01:47:59,840
and i've said this before it just

2841
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:00,960
praised on my mind

2842
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:02,560
painter kandinsky said that violent

2843
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:04,239
societies yield abstract

2844
01:48:04,239 --> 01:48:07,280
art and one of the things i've always

2845
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:08,159
wondered about is

2846
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:10,719
is the reverse also true is abstraction

2847
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:12,960
a form of violence

2848
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:14,880
and so here one of the things that i was

2849
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:16,159
thinking about in the last couple of

2850
01:48:16,159 --> 01:48:19,679
comments was symbolic synesthesia

2851
01:48:19,679 --> 01:48:21,600
right we don't really have a perceptual

2852
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:23,520
synesthesia but we take symbols and we

2853
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:25,360
substitute them in for things

2854
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:27,600
so like if i drank tequila when i had a

2855
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,199
bad experience with something else a bad

2856
01:48:29,199 --> 01:48:31,119
tequila experience with something else

2857
01:48:31,119 --> 01:48:32,560
then i'll remember the bad tequila

2858
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,159
experience as associated with that other

2859
01:48:34,159 --> 01:48:35,280
thing

2860
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:36,639
not that i ever had a bad tequila

2861
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:37,840
experience i'm just saying if it never

2862
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:38,639
happened

2863
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:41,280
so that abstraction you know we had it

2864
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:43,280
kind of becomes our prior whatever

2865
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:46,159
and it goes back to that notion of the

2866
01:48:46,159 --> 01:48:48,080
the humor element too the abstractions

2867
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:49,520
are taking us to a place and then

2868
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:51,920
revealing the reveal comes right

2869
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:54,320
and so one of the things i was wondering

2870
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:55,679
about on the capitalist

2871
01:48:55,679 --> 01:48:58,560
side we don't want surprise we don't

2872
01:48:58,560 --> 01:48:59,040
want

2873
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:01,360
punch lines for jokes because that's

2874
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:03,520
risk

2875
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:05,440
right now now you don't have innovation

2876
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:06,880
then that's the problem is

2877
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:09,119
there's this tension between innovation

2878
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:10,159
and stasis

2879
01:49:10,159 --> 01:49:12,239
right and so they want innovation but

2880
01:49:12,239 --> 01:49:13,199
they don't want somebody else to

2881
01:49:13,199 --> 01:49:14,400
innovate and take the risk but then they

2882
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:15,520
want the benefit

2883
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:16,800
but anyway so from a capitalist

2884
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,560
enclosure perspective

2885
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:20,320
one of the things i'm wondering is does

2886
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:21,920
active inference and this is the

2887
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:22,639
question

2888
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:24,320
does active inference we we're all

2889
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:25,840
taking care of each other's active

2890
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:27,599
inference exhaust

2891
01:49:27,599 --> 01:49:28,800
right we're all taking the where

2892
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:30,239
everyone's doing active inference on

2893
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:31,760
each other and we're all the

2894
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:33,520
externalities for everyone else and so

2895
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:35,280
we're all having to internalize everyone

2896
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:36,000
else's

2897
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,360
discovery pathway in a sense right we do

2898
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:42,400
we're loading on each other so that

2899
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:43,119
space

2900
01:49:43,119 --> 01:49:46,239
of exhaust management is a commons in a

2901
01:49:46,239 --> 01:49:47,840
way we're co-managing

2902
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:50,960
risk so when i talk about money

2903
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:54,320
as a universal risk consolidator

2904
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:58,719
might the metrics of value in markets

2905
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:01,440
give us insights not entire insights

2906
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:02,480
because markets don't tell you

2907
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:03,840
everything not everything is measurable

2908
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:04,800
that way

2909
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,920
but give its insights into preferences

2910
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:10,000
in a way that starts to give us the

2911
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,199
insight into that

2912
01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:13,760
co-management of the active inference

2913
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:14,480
exhaust

2914
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:17,199
essentially so it's really treating

2915
01:50:17,199 --> 01:50:19,119
commons not as a fisheries commons like

2916
01:50:19,119 --> 01:50:20,800
with an asset commons but as a risk

2917
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:21,760
commons

2918
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:23,840
and it's basically consciousness as a

2919
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:25,360
commons

2920
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:28,159
so the imagine that the mind exists in

2921
01:50:28,159 --> 01:50:29,920
language rather than the brain

2922
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:32,320
the brains are tuned into the shared

2923
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:33,920
mind

2924
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:36,400
and now we got to manage that share mind

2925
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:38,159
so we get nonsense in there something

2926
01:50:38,159 --> 01:50:38,800
that's wrong

2927
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:41,040
science or bad politics or not

2928
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:43,360
functional economics or whatever

2929
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:44,560
and we want to get rid of that because

2930
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,639
it's spoiling the commons

2931
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:48,800
so just that was what came to me that

2932
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:50,560
this idea the sovereign

2933
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:53,440
feels like how we synthesize an

2934
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:55,679
externality to say whoa whoa whoa

2935
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:57,119
we got to get this right because we got

2936
01:50:57,119 --> 01:50:58,800
some big scale stuff we got to do like

2937
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:00,639
ants and bees can do without memos we

2938
01:51:00,639 --> 01:51:02,320
gotta we have memos so we got to write

2939
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:03,119
the memos

2940
01:51:03,119 --> 01:51:05,760
so what do the memos say and that's why

2941
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:07,440
you get to dsm and stuff like that and

2942
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:08,560
what they're saying is just like

2943
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:09,840
foucault said

2944
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:12,480
pastoral control is what drives people

2945
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:14,719
together with certain behavior

2946
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:16,960
right and so it's that same thing are we

2947
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:18,159
being driven

2948
01:51:18,159 --> 01:51:20,320
you know is it is are we being driven to

2949
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,360
be industrial

2950
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:23,440
workers or now we're being driven to

2951
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:26,080
something else and how do we manage that

2952
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:28,719
that commons of our infants active

2953
01:51:28,719 --> 01:51:29,280
inference

2954
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:32,159
commons to aspire to what we want to be

2955
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:36,159
now there's a question sorry

2956
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:39,920
i mean it kind of makes me think about

2957
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:42,639
the way in which um

2958
01:51:42,639 --> 01:51:45,119
the major religions have mostly emerged

2959
01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:45,840
as soon as

2960
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:48,239
um at least during the same amount of

2961
01:51:48,239 --> 01:51:48,880
time that

2962
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:50,480
they ended up being able to write it

2963
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:52,239
down basically so it's like a pro

2964
01:51:52,239 --> 01:51:53,920
it was a recursive relation of course

2965
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:55,520
but you

2966
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:57,770
basically need a culture um

2967
01:51:57,770 --> 01:52:00,159
[Music]

2968
01:52:00,159 --> 01:52:03,040
for that level of unity there's two

2969
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:04,639
directions you can go and i guess it's

2970
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:06,239
probably both ways but on the one hand

2971
01:52:06,239 --> 01:52:08,080
you need to be organized enough to

2972
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:10,080
have a culture that you're able to write

2973
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:11,599
things down

2974
01:52:11,599 --> 01:52:13,520
and once you're able to do so you can

2975
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:15,360
basically you can kind of hard code

2976
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:19,119
the structures and you end up

2977
01:52:19,119 --> 01:52:22,239
having a competitive advantage over

2978
01:52:22,239 --> 01:52:23,280
other

2979
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:25,760
potential models essentially so maybe

2980
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:26,639
the mind

2981
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:29,599
and culture are emerging phenomenon of

2982
01:52:29,599 --> 01:52:31,199
complexity

2983
01:52:31,199 --> 01:52:33,679
right maybe complexity causes the mind

2984
01:52:33,679 --> 01:52:34,639
because

2985
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:37,280
we need we need to when we say we need

2986
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:38,800
to do something

2987
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:40,400
we often think it's in response to

2988
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,239
something but maybe that thing itself is

2989
01:52:42,239 --> 01:52:43,119
another

2990
01:52:43,119 --> 01:52:45,840
instantiation of complexity itself and

2991
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:47,520
so maybe what we're doing

2992
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:50,480
is merely red queening the whole thing

2993
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:52,239
right just keeping up we think we're

2994
01:52:52,239 --> 01:52:53,840
actually innovating and doing things but

2995
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:55,599
really what's happening is

2996
01:52:55,599 --> 01:52:57,679
with increasing exponential increase in

2997
01:52:57,679 --> 01:52:59,199
interaction volume and this and this is

2998
01:52:59,199 --> 01:52:59,679
not as

2999
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:02,239
this is what i actually believe in

3000
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:03,440
pursuing

3001
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:05,920
if there's a raw increase since the big

3002
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:06,480
bang

3003
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:09,440
in exponential increase in interaction

3004
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:10,320
volume

3005
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:13,599
maybe all we do is just keep up

3006
01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:16,560
and keep um dealing with that

3007
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:18,080
externality

3008
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:20,159
as living organisms in order to maintain

3009
01:53:20,159 --> 01:53:21,599
neg entropy states

3010
01:53:21,599 --> 01:53:23,520
maybe we just have to keep rushing into

3011
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:25,040
higher levels of order

3012
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:27,679
organization in order just to not

3013
01:53:27,679 --> 01:53:28,880
dissipate

3014
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:32,000
anyway thank you scott

3015
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,239
there's also opposite ways thinking

3016
01:53:34,239 --> 01:53:36,000
about like um

3017
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,360
where these organized structures are

3018
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:40,080
like the best

3019
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:42,880
way to dissipate energy so there's like

3020
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:44,560
a kind of

3021
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:48,159
just like the convective bubbles in uh

3022
01:53:48,159 --> 01:53:51,360
in some kind of uh

3023
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:56,480
heated um volume of the water or fluid

3024
01:53:56,480 --> 01:54:00,080
and the substructure basically helps

3025
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:03,599
the system to dissipate the energy um

3026
01:54:03,599 --> 01:54:05,280
so there are certain it's like

3027
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:06,960
interesting two ways of looking

3028
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:09,840
it's the same thing in a sense it's that

3029
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:10,800
structural

3030
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:12,880
dissipation of risk is what you have in

3031
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:14,880
law and that's that's all it is

3032
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:16,639
it's just it's a time machine that

3033
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:17,920
predicts the future

3034
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:19,520
everyone can look at the prediction in a

3035
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:22,080
contract or law it's enforceable and

3036
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,280
they can rely on it

3037
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:24,880
and so it saves resources so it's

3038
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:27,280
exactly what you're saying

3039
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:29,040
thank you um stephen if you want to make

3040
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:30,560
a really quick last comment because

3041
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:31,760
we're out of time and then we'll close

3042
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:32,639
out

3043
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:35,599
yeah thanks um i was just going to say i

3044
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:37,119
mean sort of ties in this idea of

3045
01:54:37,119 --> 01:54:38,000
abstraction

3046
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:41,599
and the um is i do a lot of work with

3047
01:54:41,599 --> 01:54:42,880
action methods

3048
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:45,040
and ways of working in space and i think

3049
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:46,719
it ties into this question i think it

3050
01:54:46,719 --> 01:54:48,480
might also tie into next week's

3051
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:50,880
talk is there's certain things that we

3052
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:52,560
can realistically

3053
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:55,840
get a handle on if we can take a

3054
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:56,880
perspective on it

3055
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:58,920
so for instance you talked about

3056
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:00,159
exteriorception

3057
01:55:00,159 --> 01:55:02,880
that sometimes it gives you information

3058
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:04,639
you take a perspective on to reflect on

3059
01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:06,080
your internal states

3060
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:07,520
and maybe you look at your internal

3061
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:11,199
states but i think there is this danger

3062
01:55:11,199 --> 01:55:14,400
that this abstraction starts to take

3063
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:15,520
over

3064
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:19,679
because there's a whole load of levels

3065
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:21,840
particularly you know when it's the

3066
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:23,599
embodi which we can't see and that's

3067
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:24,159
okay

3068
01:55:24,159 --> 01:55:25,679
you know these these blankets are

3069
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:27,599
blankets can go down

3070
01:55:27,599 --> 01:55:30,800
and um it's beyond our

3071
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:34,400
perception to take a a thought on

3072
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:35,840
and the reason that i think that can be

3073
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:37,599
interesting is um

3074
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:39,920
is because in in action methods and

3075
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:40,960
psychodrama

3076
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:43,360
and these types of action approaches

3077
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:44,960
rather than the freudian approaches

3078
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:46,320
which basically

3079
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:50,000
took over is okay you can't take all

3080
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:50,800
these percep

3081
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:52,960
perspectives and analyze it in the way

3082
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:54,800
that we've got in this habit of doing

3083
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:57,599
but these other ways of knowing

3084
01:55:57,599 --> 01:55:58,840
embodying

3085
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:01,760
exploring i think that that

3086
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:03,760
also is another direction which often

3087
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:06,080
has not thought about so i just think

3088
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:07,760
that um

3089
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:10,719
as we go into this what you're saying

3090
01:56:10,719 --> 01:56:11,960
and the way that we think about

3091
01:56:11,960 --> 01:56:13,840
instrumentalization

3092
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:16,119
is that you know we might need to

3093
01:56:16,119 --> 01:56:18,560
instrumentalize

3094
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:20,800
using the the sort of the the more

3095
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:23,199
embodied

3096
01:56:23,199 --> 01:56:26,880
effective methods and processes

3097
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:29,520
as well as this kind of other approaches

3098
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:30,400
because i think that

3099
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:33,119
we will hit the limits of an analysis

3100
01:56:33,119 --> 01:56:34,320
and i think that might be something that

3101
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:36,159
this conversation sort of

3102
01:56:36,159 --> 01:56:37,360
talked about so anyway i just thought

3103
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:38,639
i'd put that there if you've got any

3104
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:39,920
thoughts on that and i'll

3105
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:42,960
thanks a lot for a great presentation

3106
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:44,560
yeah i mean i think you make a very good

3107
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:46,000
point and that's

3108
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,320
uh and thanks for the compliment and i

3109
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:49,920
mean there's the

3110
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:52,400
the connection or the integration across

3111
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:52,960
levels

3112
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:56,880
let's say that's important for your

3113
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:59,760
well-being then what you describe is a

3114
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:00,159
very

3115
01:57:00,159 --> 01:57:04,480
logical pathway to improve

3116
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:07,760
people's mental state in the end as well

3117
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:10,159
when they're more connected with their

3118
01:57:10,159 --> 01:57:10,800
embodied

3119
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:13,360
existence instead of living in that

3120
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:14,480
abstract space

3121
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:18,320
um i mean i think i have

3122
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:22,159
as a scientist i have a probably

3123
01:57:22,159 --> 01:57:24,960
increased risk of going down that path

3124
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:26,719
because you're always thinking

3125
01:57:26,719 --> 01:57:30,480
about things so yeah

3126
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:33,840
um i totally agree that that's probably

3127
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:34,320
many

3128
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:36,320
treatments actually i mean that's why

3129
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:38,320
meditation is such a

3130
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:43,199
appears to be socially effective as well

3131
01:57:43,599 --> 01:57:45,199
anyway thanks for the thoughts yeah very

3132
01:57:45,199 --> 01:57:47,440
good point yeah thanks so much everyone

3133
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:49,599
for participating and casper it's

3134
01:57:49,599 --> 01:57:51,280
you're not always thinking sometimes

3135
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:53,199
you're coming on and hanging out with us

3136
01:57:53,199 --> 01:57:54,080
i guess but

3137
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:55,920
maybe thinking during that too but

3138
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:57,280
really um

3139
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:59,920
fun discussion we hope to have all of

3140
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:00,639
you on

3141
01:58:00,639 --> 01:58:02,320
again whether it's a paper you've

3142
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:04,480
authored or not so thanks a lot

3143
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:10,159
and uh yeah until next time
