00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,660
we're in active inference live stream

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:37,200
number 50.1 on October 20th 2022.

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,239
we're discussing the paper interception

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,239
as modeling allostasis as control

this is a recorded in an archived live

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,399
stream so please provide feedback so we

14
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,719
can improve our work

15
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,699
all backgrounds and perspectives are

16
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,039
welcome and will be following video

etiquette for live streams

18
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,659
head over to

19
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:07,680
activeinference.org to learn more about

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,240
how to get involved with different

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,340
learning groups and projects like the

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,720
live streams and otherwise

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,180
we're here in live stream number 50.1

24
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,400
with our second discussion of the paper

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,820
interception as modeling allostasis as

26
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,900
control

27
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,460
previously we had number 50.0 where Dean

28
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,619
and I provided some background and

29
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,360
context and now we're really

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,979
appreciative that we'll have some

31
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,680
authors joining for the dot one and two

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,420
to unpack and explore some ideas

33
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,900
and uh today it'll be great to hear from

34
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,180
multiple authors see a little

35
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,720
presentation and dive into the middle of

36
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,119
things the thick of things as we do in

37
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,259
the dot one

38
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,720
and so we'll begin with introductions

39
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,320
then we will have a presentation and

40
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,720
then discussion so we'll begin with

41
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,680
introductions with non-authors first and

42
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,199
they can feel free to introduce say hi

43
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,239
and anything that they're excited to

44
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,540
explore today so I'm Daniel I'm a

45
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,000
researcher in California

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,360
and I'm looking forward to understanding

47
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,020
some of the formalisms in the model and

48
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,420
how they connect to active inference and

49
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,620
Bayesian mechanics and I'll pass to Dave

50
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,800
hi I'm Dave I'm

51
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
a um

52
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,319
discourse curator a student of Jacques

53
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,840
punks it and Mark soles I live in the

54
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,080
mile high academic city of Baguio 200

55
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,760
kilometers north of Manila Dean

56
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,640
thanks Dave I'm Dean I'm at Calgary

57
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,900
um

58
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,780
what's interesting to me is that

59
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,300
on a metaphorical level this started out

60
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,239
me in a in an open field and I got into

61
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,540
a forest and that Forest got denser and

62
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,980
dents and by the time we got to section

63
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,680
four of this paper I started reading it

64
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,239
over and over again which is a fantastic

65
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,920
sign because if I have to read something

66
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,440
many many times to really get my head

67
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,599
around it that

68
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,940
that's good because I don't question

69
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,640
things unless I don't get them that

70
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,800
doesn't mean that that it wasn't spelled

71
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,959
out correctly it just means that you got

72
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,640
my attention so

73
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,019
um I'm not sure which author to pass it

74
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,480
to First maybe Eli you'd like to

75
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,400
say hi

76
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,959
hello everyone

77
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,879
um I'm Eli I'm the first author on this

78
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,840
paper

79
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,500
so

80
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,959
um a bit before the live stream started

81
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,900
Jordan was mentioning that this work

82
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,180
comes out of what we were sort of

83
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,220
studying together in our lab at an

84
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,959
energetics working group

85
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,180
brain energetics reading group before

86
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,400
the pandemic really hit us

87
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,680
and so when I was

88
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,440
confined

89
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,360
you know I effectively started reading

90
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,920
and rereading you know everything that

91
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,920
we had gone through and trying to come

92
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,780
up with some way

93
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,620
to think about allostasis because

94
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,839
in our group and in our previous

95
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,060
Publications as a group The

96
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,919
interdisciplinary act affective science

97
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,160
lab we've referenced allostasis a lot

98
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,800
and every time I would ask you know how

99
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,240
can we give a mathematical or

100
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,460
computational characterization

101
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,820
of allostasis I would basically be told

102
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,020
well

103
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,880
you know we thought Peter Sterling had

104
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,660
one

105
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,040
and then I would go look at Peter

106
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,320
Sterling and

107
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,120
he's the originator of the concept of

108
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,800
allostasis by the way so there's

109
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,380
numerous works by him on the subject

110
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,979
probably the longest form

111
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,280
let's say

112
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,720
non-expert treatment would probably be

113
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,960
his book what is health

114
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,120
hey

115
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,600
and when I would look at

116
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,820
Sterling's work I would sort of spot a

117
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,280
contradiction or a contradiction in

118
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,240
terms

119
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,000
one of on one side

120
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,520
he's specifically charting the variation

121
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,160
in physiological parameters and

122
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,479
regulation

123
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:24,360
over time where time can be the course

124
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,620
of a lifetime in the course of

125
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,840
development or even just the course of a

126
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,639
single day

127
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,340
and yet on the other hand if you ask him

128
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,960
well how is this done he would

129
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,060
effectively

130
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,000
um say this is done by reinforcement

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,060
learning via the dopaminergic systems in

132
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,139
the brain

133
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:45,060
now the dopaminergic systems in the

134
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,840
brain don't track a shifting signal over

135
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,139
time they just maximize reward

136
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,080
and so actually in my view at least as a

137
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,639
computationalist they were more

138
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,360
homeostatic than allostatic

139
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,400
and from that contradiction and what

140
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,680
followed on from it really came

141
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,139
this whole paper

142
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:08,100
foreign

143
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,940
but to re-emphasize I would say and

144
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,460
before we jump into you know slides

145
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,620
material inside the paper

146
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,419
I think it's really worth emphasizing

147
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,600
just based on watching the 50.0 live

148
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,639
stream that

149
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,840
our group are more let's say biologists

150
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,080
and physiologists in orientation than

151
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,880
physicists

152
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,100
so Bayesian the paper on Bayesian

153
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,440
mechanics came out while we were writing

154
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,520
this

155
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,240
and I don't think we really managed to

156
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,100
integrate the two sets of material yet

157
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,240
together

158
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,520
or together yet

159
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,139
that's not to say they can't or

160
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,660
shouldn't be integrated it's to say

161
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,699
we don't actually have

162
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,319
so to speak we don't always have the

163
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,440
physics and dynamical systems expertise

164
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,479
of someone like Thomas Parr or Maxwell

165
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,300
ramstead let alone Karl Kristen on the

166
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,220
other hand

167
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,880
we have very concrete Notions of what

168
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,520
biology and Physiology we need to fit to

169
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,960
as really the bulk of this paper you

170
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,819
know the reason it's not just a short

171
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:23,699
section for with some math

172
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:25,500
is because we have to fit to the

173
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,419
physiology and Anatomy that we know

174
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,599
about

175
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,840
thank you Jordan feel free to intro and

176
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,340
then Eli off to you for some

177
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,340
presentation for sure so so I'm a

178
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,440
postdoc in the lab here so I think maybe

179
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,880
I'll just give some context of where

180
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,319
we're both working too and how we've got

181
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,580
here so

182
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,380
for me I've had a bit of a weird path to

183
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,479
get to this point in that I did my PHD

184
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,160
in social psychology and moral

185
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,360
psychology

186
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,900
um

187
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,080
it's then uh sort of trans got really

188
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,520
really interested in predictive

189
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,020
processing perspectives and active

190
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,580
inference and then really wanted to dig

191
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,080
into that and find someone who's working

192
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,380
on it around here in Boston uh so I'm

193
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,240
working with Lisa Feldman Barrett and

194
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,919
Karen quickly who co-direct the

195
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,780
interdisciplinary affective Sciences lab

196
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,400
here

197
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,960
um and like you guys saying the

198
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,960
perspective that we have is really more

199
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,819
of a biologically grounded one or more

200
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,400
of one that's based in um in physiology

201
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,340
and Neuroscience So Lisa and Carol joke

202
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,020
that Lisa sort of handles everything

203
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,699
from the neck up and Karen handles

204
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:28,620
everything from the neck down so

205
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,960
together they form a whole person

206
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,560
um

207
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,200
and what what I was really lucky to do

208
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,760
was I stumbled into

209
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,360
um

210
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,339
an existing collaboration that did going

211
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:40,799
on for about a decade here

212
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,200
um which we call the psychology

213
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,000
engineering Neuroscience group or the

214
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,020
pen group

215
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,160
where there's been an ongoing

216
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,160
collaboration with uh professors in the

217
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,019
electrical engineering department

218
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,880
probably most importantly Dana Brooks

219
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,260
has really helped to run it a lot that

220
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,959
Dennis abdogmas and Jennifer D have both

221
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,760
also been like really really involved in

222
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,600
this

223
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,200
um

224
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,000
and so what they would do is they'd meet

225
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,040
every week and they would sort of pull

226
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,100
through on active interest papers

227
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,500
processing papers uh information Theory

228
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,000
they'd sort of catch all of us

229
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,360
neuroscientists up to speed on

230
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,380
understanding engineering and we try to

231
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,060
bring them up to speed on on a sort of

232
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,800
biological understanding of Neuroscience

233
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
too so

234
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,760
what um

235
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,680
what we've been really interested in

236
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,899
doing is

237
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,820
thinking about some of the abstractions

238
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,399
that had come up in the act of inference

239
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,500
literature and thinking about how to

240
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,320
ground those biological processes

241
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,420
um and how to really make this tractable

242
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,620
at an empirical biological level and so

243
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,180
the interest that I've had in brain

244
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,860
energetics has been

245
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,160
um a way to apply some of that traction

246
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,720
onto um

247
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,700
my original interest which is sort of

248
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,279
moral and social norms so I've done a

249
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,899
bit of work on um

250
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,060
thinking about how we can think about

251
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,760
information or energetic costs of

252
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,420
information processing as a way of um

253
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,880
how individuals exercise control over a

254
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,440
social environment by conforming to

255
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,480
expectations within it

256
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,360
and then at the same time I've been

257
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,680
interested in going into the other end

258
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,080
and thinking about um some of the

259
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,060
details of brain metabolism and brain

260
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,740
glucose metabolism that are associated

261
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,380
with the Bold fmri signal so that we can

262
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,120
really Dig Down Deeper into the

263
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,740
metabolism that's underlying the neural

264
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,459
Imaging their image in literature

265
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,200
um but in the process of basically

266
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,120
performing this or forming this

267
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,040
energetics reading group where we've

268
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,600
been digging into all of those topics to

269
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,120
try to understand the brain biology

270
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,560
Eli and I really ended up working

271
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,480
together in this paper to try to apply

272
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,120
some of that energetics

273
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,820
um and biological work

274
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,920
um again with a ton of help from Karen

275
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,779
and Lisa who really know the details of

276
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,279
of the neuroscience and the actual

277
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,680
physiology I think Karen especially that

278
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,959
Eli would probably say has been like

279
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,959
really really really critical for for

280
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,459
understanding these physiological

281
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:06,600
systems

282
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,320
um

283
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,380
but basically yeah how we can

284
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,060
have some of the parameters and

285
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,440
assumptions of these active inference

286
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,640
models

287
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,399
grounded in real biological terms that

288
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,260
we can start to look to the empirical

289
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,120
literature the biological biological

290
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,160
literature and sort of gain some more

291
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,779
inspiration from that rather than just

292
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,120
living living entirely at an abstract

293
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,360
level

294
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,560
cool and with that I'll hand it over to

295
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,820
Eli

296
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,100
excellent all right

297
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,500
I've unshared feel free to go for it

298
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,860
thanks for that context

299
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,720
and just of note

300
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,399
um it did

301
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,040
um this paper does bring in some

302
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,959
topics that we haven't discussed on any

303
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,019
of the preceding 50 papers

304
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:55,019
uh many of which were also motivators of

305
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:56,880
what you

306
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,880
set out to explore so I'll just crop in

307
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,700
resize and so on and Eli please go for

308
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,959
it

309
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,519
all right

310
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,420
um

311
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,779
so before I really get into the material

312
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,519
of the paper I think it might be useful

313
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,160
to follow on from what Jordan said in

314
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,200
order to additionally motivate sort of

315
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,180
our turn towards biology and Physiology

316
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,200
here

317
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,779
which is that most of the time inactive

318
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,519
inference modeling

319
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,680
note that I say modeling or an active

320
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,019
interns physics so to speak

321
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,560
you need a term in your expected free

322
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,560
energy or in your joint density

323
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,600
that is sorry the generative joint

324
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,060
density not the recognition one which

325
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,040
you would call often I've heard it

326
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,160
called the prior preferences

327
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,240
essentially a probability density over

328
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,959
sensory outcomes that describes what

329
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,820
it's hard to avoid anthropomorphic

330
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,700
language here but oh well what you want

331
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,740
to observe

332
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,360
now in real biological systems that you

333
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,120
know as we sort of can hear from Peter

334
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,980
Sterling

335
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,820
or numerous other authors that cannot be

336
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,740
fixed

337
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,160
the that is you know prior preferences

338
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,040
can't be fixed it's I do I prefer

339
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,079
different observations when I'm about to

340
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:27,260
go to sleep versus when I am waking up

341
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,060
and the assumption that usually gets

342
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,599
baked into

343
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:35,160
principles like say the free energy

344
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,019
principle

345
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:39,720
is that

346
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,519
actually let me moderate that a little

347
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,260
bit based on conversations with some

348
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,300
free energy principle folks

349
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,639
if you have a non-path based a

350
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,320
state-based formulation of the free

351
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,019
energy principle then you will typically

352
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,360
assume something called ergoticity

353
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,220
and you'll note that we have an appendix

354
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,440
about ergoticity I saw that you

355
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,360
discussed it last week in the point zero

356
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,000
episode thank you for catching on to

357
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,279
that and thank you to anyone in the

358
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,779
audience and the listenership who caught

359
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,519
on to that

360
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,459
the ergodicity Assumption essentially

361
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:14,880
allows you to exchange uncertainty about

362
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,420
time or over time for uncertainty in the

363
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,260
moment

364
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,480
so you can just say there's a gaussian

365
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,760
prior preference density

366
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,339
it has this much Precision or this much

367
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,680
variance depending on which

368
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,600
uh which way you prefer to put your

369
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,399
division sign

370
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,320
and then

371
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,779
it's the same for all time

372
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:38,700
now if you're doing a paths-based

373
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,220
formulation

374
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,060
then

375
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,060
you lose the tie between the free energy

376
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,480
principle and

377
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,040
conventional physiological Notions of

378
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,019
homeostasis

379
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,000
because now after all can't the set

380
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,760
point be anything or everything

381
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,260
you need to know something about

382
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,380
physiology Anatomy to tie it back

383
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,060
and so that's really the motivation

384
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,880
we're coming from in this paper is what

385
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,360
if you have to acquire or learn prior

386
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,839
preferences throughout development

387
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:16,760
how little can you bake in

388
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:24,480
and so we start by sort of reviewing in

389
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,139
the paper and in these slides the sort

390
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,019
of perspectives that we study from study

391
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:33,060
the nervous system study the brain

392
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,940
one of them is predictive processing I

393
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,380
think that's probably going to be the

394
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,620
important one for this audience and in

395
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,740
predictive processing we talk about

396
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,480
the perceptual systems of the brain

397
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,820
really the sensory systems

398
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,220
as performing approximate Bayesian

399
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,720
inference

400
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,820
so then you'll have top-down prediction

401
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,699
signals bottom-up prediction error

402
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:59,220
signals

403
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,079
and there's this notion of active

404
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:02,519
inference

405
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,620
which says that we essentially treat

406
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,660
motor outputs

407
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,500
as parameters to the recognition model

408
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,540
in one of its in one of the earliest

409
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,279
formulations before there was any

410
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,320
expected free energy

411
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,800
But ultimately it still says in any new

412
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,320
or recent formulation we have some

413
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,120
notion of prediction error

414
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,180
between densities and this is an

415
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,120
information theoretic quantity

416
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,459
so really we're talking about a

417
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:35,100
Divergence or an entropy or a cross

418
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,420
entropy

419
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,699
we want to minimize that and we're not

420
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,620
only going to minimize that by changing

421
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,320
the top-down predictions that flow

422
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,199
through say the sensory cortex we're

423
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:47,820
also going to change these extra

424
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:52,560
parameters that correspond to motor

425
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,160
motor predictions motor commands motor

426
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,139
references depending on the terminology

427
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:01,560
you want to use to refer to them

428
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,179
so then in our lab where we are sort of

429
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:08,459
biologists of emotion

430
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,699
we often study interception

431
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:15,059
and that's really it's given a fairly

432
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,640
vague definition on the slide here

433
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,740
because there's a lot of debate among

434
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,799
neuroanatomists about sort of where

435
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:24,179
interception ends and x-star reception

436
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,359
begins which exact modalities should be

437
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,700
classified Which Way or Another

438
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,919
but really interception is still a

439
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,900
set of or category of sensory modalities

440
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,080
and when I say sensory modalities I am

441
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,539
mentioning that specifically because the

442
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:48,120
literature on interceptive active

443
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,860
inference

444
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:55,280
then tends to take what we might call

445
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,940
the earliest form of active inference

446
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,980
it takes the road of the earliest form

447
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,679
of active inference saying I have a

448
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:06,600
generative density I have a recognition

449
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,039
density

450
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,500
action becomes effectively a parameter

451
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,440
to fit the recognition density to the

452
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,960
generative density

453
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,440
and there isn't really a notion of

454
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,640
an internal generative model that

455
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,220
is separate that separates belief and

456
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,020
desire

457
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,640
so in a lot of the literature on

458
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,299
interceptive active inference

459
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:36,059
you'll find references to having very

460
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:38,160
precise priors

461
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,539
or even you know innate priors about

462
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:44,280
interceptive parameters

463
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,520
and you'll see this notion that

464
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,679
you use active inference in the

465
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,080
interceptive domain more than you use it

466
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,059
in the somatic domain

467
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:56,160
because you're trying to fit your

468
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,220
internal physiology to a notion of

469
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,500
apriori set points that are determined

470
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,039
by evolution

471
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,299
do you think you could give an example

472
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,700
of that Eli and what sort of set points

473
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,140
people might think

474
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,600
all right

475
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,720
let's see I've seen

476
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,900
carbon dioxide levels in the blood

477
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,020
mentioned glucose levels

478
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,760
um core body temperature is really the

479
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,000
one that I tend to go back to because it

480
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,280
really does remain constant most of the

481
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,480
time

482
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,179
it can vary but really that's an

483
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:40,640
inextremis type of situation

484
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,020
so if you think about core body

485
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,720
temperature

486
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,780
there's a circuit and I believe you know

487
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,280
Jordan correct me if I'm wrong but this

488
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,980
is the NTS again isn't it

489
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,220
the nucleus factors

490
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,320
yeah okay yeah

491
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,120
um essentially in the brain stem there's

492
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,780
a circuit that codes the

493
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,200
typical set point for core body

494
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,640
temperature

495
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,500
and from an active inference perspective

496
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,380
you could say that is a fixed likelihood

497
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,360
it can't be parameter re-parameterized

498
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,000
by some prediction flowing from higher

499
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,960
up

500
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,780
or rather most of the time it is not

501
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,880
re-parameterized

502
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,039
so that flows down as a prediction and

503
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,960
then every temperature sensor in the

504
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,799
body

505
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,020
can compare actual temperature to

506
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,940
desired temperature

507
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,500
calculate a Precision weighted

508
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,480
prediction error between them

509
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,000
send those errors back up

510
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,340
and then the brain can say aha I need to

511
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,400
find a way to minimize these errors

512
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,400
and doing so will effectively

513
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,860
keep you in an environment where you can

514
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,299
maintain your core body temperature

515
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:55,740
around

516
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,980
you know I think it's 98.6 Fahrenheit is

517
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,200
the stereotype

518
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,860
it varies for individuals

519
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,260
now the reason my next slide was about

520
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,059
allostasis

521
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,520
is because

522
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,360
while there are bubbly parameters like

523
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,580
core temperature

524
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,520
that usually behave according to a set

525
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,460
point

526
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,419
really physiologically most parameters

527
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,960
do not have a set point

528
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,220
they move the regulated levels move all

529
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,539
the time

530
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:38,880
so that includes heart rate

531
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,539
blood pressure blood sugar

532
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:46,340
blood oxygen levels

533
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,220
various hormone levels in the endocrine

534
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,500
systems

535
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,059
inflammation levels

536
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:56,340
shift over time

537
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,039
and I mentioned inflammation because

538
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,960
you know from the body's perspective

539
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,480
there is you know inflammation is not

540
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,480
something with a set point of zero

541
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,260
inflammation is sometimes appropriate

542
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,059
and actually if you want to think you

543
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:13,799
know what is the situation in which

544
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:17,100
adapting all of these core parameters

545
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,980
is physiologically adaptive

546
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,480
then

547
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,200
I think

548
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,900
heavy exercise and sickness

549
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,760
are probably the two largest examples

550
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,220
so for heavy exercise we could talk

551
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,179
about

552
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:38,520
say arousal levels

553
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,159
and that refers to the balance of

554
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,500
Cooperative activity in the branches of

555
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,320
the autonomic nervous system

556
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,240
but essentially if you're going to go

557
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,919
for a run

558
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,080
say from a predator or after some food

559
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,480
in your girl fashioned you know Evo

560
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,940
psych ancestral environment

561
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,580
you're going to need to decrease the

562
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,940
activity in some organ systems increase

563
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,360
the activity in other organ systems

564
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,720
and adjust physiological

565
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,059
parameters to be regulated to the new

566
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,600
levels

567
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,460
so this is a pretty well observed fact

568
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,720
of physiology

569
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,360
you know informally

570
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,360
Peter Sterling I would say having

571
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,640
invented allostasis as an observation

572
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,260
that gets made

573
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,659
he then

574
00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:37,980
editorializes a little bit about it and

575
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,980
says it should replace

576
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,440
homeostasis as a mode of Regulation

577
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,900
so rather than having set points you

578
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,960
should be comparing to something like a

579
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,299
set trajectory

580
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,640
and in the ideal case when you're

581
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,919
theorizing you should assume that there

582
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,539
is no

583
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:01,260
Global set point of any parameter

584
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,480
and of course as we mentioned before in

585
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,960
extremists this is true if you get ill

586
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,780
your body does actually override that

587
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,760
circuit in the brain stem

588
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,940
to raise the core temperature that's why

589
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,280
you'll get chills you're at the same

590
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,360
temperature

591
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,760
but the regulated level has been shifted

592
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,059
up

593
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:25,080
there's there's also an interesting

594
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,000
point to make if you go back for one sec

595
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,240
you like to just that um in the way that

596
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,039
the sort of language of science evolves

597
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,419
here too and it's worth pointing out

598
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:35,280
because some people might be listening

599
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,780
and might be thinking

600
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,360
you know well homeostasis doesn't have

601
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,100
to include set points either you can

602
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,200
have sort of higher gold ocean uponio

603
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,020
stasis you can have um you know sort of

604
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,820
multiple levels of control involved in

605
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,620
that and some people have made the same

606
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,500
criticism of allostasis as an ocean so

607
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,659
there's a paper by Carpenter

608
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,659
by Carpenter that that does exactly this

609
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:01,919
right so

610
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,840
it's

611
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,600
but the problem is is that even if

612
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,179
that's like that's technically true and

613
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:10,380
people who really know what they're

614
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,880
doing and are using a concept of

615
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,159
homeostasis in that way might already

616
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,260
understand that you don't necessarily

617
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,240
need set points

618
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,120
but the the reality is is that the way

619
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,100
homeostasis tends to get used in the way

620
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,820
that it tends to be understood is it's

621
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,799
come to have some of this association

622
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,299
with set points or with a simple

623
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:32,279
thermostat model as opposed to something

624
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,679
broader that includes multiple levels of

625
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:37,020
control and so

626
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:41,039
some people who might be some people

627
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,720
might be curmudgeoni and want to say

628
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,760
that homeostasis already includes all of

629
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,500
these Notions so we should just reclaim

630
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,260
the term homeostasis for that

631
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,779
I think we're more of the perspective

632
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,820
that we're willing to just give that up

633
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,679
and it might be time to just start using

634
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,299
a different term to remind people of

635
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:59,340
those other associations so

636
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,679
we're we're seeding ground a little bit

637
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,559
when we're using the term allostasis

638
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,820
to just not have to fight with people

639
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,918
about what homeostasis really means

640
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,440
yes so Jordan is completely correct

641
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,700
there but I would actually even

642
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,580
recommend that you know everyone

643
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,600
listening if you can go find the paper

644
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,039
homeostasis a plea for a unified

645
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:29,580
approach by rhs Carpenter it's in our

646
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,100
citations and you should be able to type

647
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,159
the name into Google Scholar go look at

648
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:36,179
it

649
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,460
because it'll really explain where our

650
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,679
paper is coming from

651
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:43,020
as a short summary of what's relevant

652
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,740
what Carpenter says in his paper is that

653
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,860
back in the good old days they taught

654
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,059
control theory and controls engineering

655
00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:56,880
to physiologists and that included

656
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,520
you know research physiologists and also

657
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,140
clinicians

658
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,240
and by back in the day he really means

659
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,960
back in like the 1940s to the 1960s

660
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,500
before another new approach took over

661
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,880
and she says hey if you're an educated

662
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,620
mathematically mature and fluent

663
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:20,279
controls engineer then you don't need

664
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:23,159
you know then these awkward names

665
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:25,980
are all really just different ways of

666
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,140
cutting the same cake

667
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,480
you know it's all a control system it's

668
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,240
a hierarchical control system this is

669
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,460
very evident he says in the anatomy and

670
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,799
physiology that you'll look at

671
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,659
he's even writing for a physiology

672
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,659
education Journal

673
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:44,340
and then he effectively starts

674
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,960
complaining that you know everyone's

675
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,020
sort of straw manned homeostasis down to

676
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,220
this thermostat model

677
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,140
and he has to complain like this in 2004

678
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,919
because indeed everyone really has sort

679
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:01,200
of associated the word homeostasis with

680
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,100
this thermostat model Global set points

681
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,620
things like body temperature rather than

682
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,080
blood glucose

683
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,960
and as a result

684
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,919
there's

685
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,179
as a result much of the actual control

686
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:19,740
theory got

687
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,260
simplified away

688
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,100
so even as someone who is housed in a

689
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,080
computer science department took a class

690
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,320
on reinforcement learning and can work

691
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,500
the equations of optimal control theory

692
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,080
I was not introduced to the concept of a

693
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,700
reference signal

694
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,299
as a Time varying function

695
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:45,779
until Carpenter

696
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:48,059
and that was actually pretty revelatory

697
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:52,200
for me that rather than having an error

698
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,520
function

699
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,020
who's

700
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,140
you know minimum whose Global minimum

701
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,659
is fixed for all time

702
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:02,640
you can have an error function that

703
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,500
measures the difference between your

704
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,240
actual trajectory

705
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,059
and a desired trajectory you can do

706
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,940
trajectory tracking control when you

707
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,820
have the mathematics

708
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,120
so we could say for our paper for our

709
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,480
purposes if homeostasis refers to this

710
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,899
thermiostat thermostat Style

711
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:27,480
Point tracking control

712
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,659
then allostasis refers to trajectory

713
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:33,620
tracking control

714
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:39,659
so moving on a little bit and getting

715
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:41,520
back on the main track

716
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,640
from our perspectives informed by

717
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,039
physiology and Anatomy

718
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,000
and a little bit of evodivo

719
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,559
interception and allostasis have Pro

720
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,700
have both

721
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,159
pretty well demonstrated themselves to

722
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,120
be

723
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,460
really Central to how the nervous system

724
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,279
is actually structured

725
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:05,480
and seemingly largely concerned with

726
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,880
the metabolism and deficient functioning

727
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,039
of the viscera

728
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,960
so for anyone who wants you know

729
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,140
citations for this I think it's

730
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:20,159
uh Jordan it would be Barrett and who

731
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,320
2015.

732
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,940
oh uh Barrett and Simmons 2015. yes

733
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,140
Neuroscience paper yeah nature reviews

734
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,600
Neuroscience

735
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,520
interceptive predictions in the brain

736
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,980
there's a more recent review written by

737
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,039
Karen Quigley our other senior author

738
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:43,020
on interception came out in 2021

739
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,880
and so you can really go check for

740
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,700
yourself and I would advise it just how

741
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,980
Central in terreception and visceral

742
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,480
regulation

743
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,380
are empirically to the nervous system

744
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,360
you could possibly design a nervous

745
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,919
system for a robot that worked

746
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:01,799
differently but the ones that evolved

747
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:06,720
are ubiquitously centered on keeping the

748
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,000
internal milia of the body efficient

749
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,919
so

750
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,480
um yes

751
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,539
um Dan tickles yeah do you mind if I

752
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:20,700
decided a quick question here of course

753
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,460
yeah because uh the the two authors here

754
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,919
maybe can just confirm that my parachute

755
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,140
is packed properly that's what I'm

756
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,940
basically wanting to

757
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,240
to be comfortable with so just stepping

758
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,799
back for a second

759
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,720
in that slide that you would just head

760
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,940
up there

761
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,500
the warp and the weft here the kind of

762
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,899
the weave that you guys were working on

763
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:45,960
on this paper was the allostasis and the

764
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,419
enteroception those were your focal

765
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:51,659
points right and then you've you've

766
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,240
spent quite a bit in sort of prepping us

767
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,179
for the difference between the discrete

768
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:00,419
time aspect of what you're looking at

769
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:03,240
and the global capture rate because you

770
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,960
say we can't we can't get fixed and just

771
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,940
the one saying I want to make sure my my

772
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,640
shoot is packed properly and then you're

773
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,140
talking about biology and physiology so

774
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,500
just on that on that great big am I

775
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,179
going to go Splat or am I going to be

776
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:24,779
able to land this relatively softly can

777
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:27,360
you can you maybe just

778
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,179
tell me whether or not that is in fact

779
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:33,899
is it a comparison is it an intersection

780
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:37,080
are these things running in parallel how

781
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,880
much of this is risk management versus

782
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,039
how much of this is strategic

783
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,440
I would think of it more as

784
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,460
an intersection okay and when we're

785
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,080
specifically referring to quantities

786
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,659
like the global capture rate

787
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:56,940
those are intended to be strategic

788
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,299
rather than risk management or epistemic

789
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:01,320
value

790
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,360
okay

791
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,000
so specifically there

792
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,919
there's a whole book on this let's say

793
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,980
it um Vigor the neuro economics of

794
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,279
movement control by Reza shadmir

795
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:17,059
and it Chronicles in very long form

796
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:20,279
extensively the empirical evidence

797
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,320
that

798
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,460
real organisms will time average their

799
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,620
reward rate

800
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,899
so in order to move from an episodic

801
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:33,960
setting to a continual

802
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,380
control set you know to a continual

803
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,940
lifelong setting

804
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,340
you need some notion of indefinite time

805
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,380
control

806
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,700
obviously you're not going to live until

807
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,519
T you know T reaches Infinity

808
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,940
but in the limit you do need to have a

809
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,860
coherent control problem

810
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,080
at least for modeling purposes because

811
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,220
you can't

812
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,880
fix the end of say a bird's life

813
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,260
in the lab on a laptop okay

814
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,480
and there's two ways conventionally to

815
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,359
do that one is this notion of

816
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,000
God and put the global capture rate

817
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,280
so the time average

818
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,918
the sum of all benefits minus the sum of

819
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:19,379
all costs divided by the total amount of

820
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:20,520
time

821
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:25,399
and the other is exponential discounting

822
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:28,639
now for engineering purposes

823
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,320
exponential discounting makes the math

824
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,040
and the computations much more tractable

825
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,320
and so in the early 2000s they

826
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,179
essentially found that the real you know

827
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,739
real brains

828
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:43,679
like basal ganglia you know and

829
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,839
dopaminergic firing

830
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:50,159
are best fitted by time averaging

831
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,139
and then on the computational side

832
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:54,000
everyone ignored that and did

833
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,260
exponential discounting

834
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,119
and so really when we talk about

835
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:01,859
something like a global capture rate

836
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:04,619
we're just saying we're going with the

837
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:07,980
biological evidence and writing down a

838
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,800
model that accounts best for the

839
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,599
empirical bindings

840
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,400
you know if you want to quote unquote

841
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,619
try this at home you are perfectly

842
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:18,359
welcome to go ahead and switch to

843
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:20,400
exponential discounting

844
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,400
it's fine or the machine Learning

845
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,960
Community is starting to come out with

846
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,119
papers on time averaging

847
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,760
you know lately the past couple of years

848
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,520
and that's one more quick question then

849
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,099
of course yeah thank you for that for

850
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:40,859
that explanation so if we're if we're

851
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:43,440
raising the the question around

852
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,380
tractability that assumes that there's

853
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,420
some sort of slipperiness or some

854
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,599
fluidity piece to this this thing that

855
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,440
we're looking at what what is that what

856
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,240
is that thing

857
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,180
that's fluid that's slippery that's

858
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,119
causing us to not normally be able to

859
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,760
model is that a feature or is that a

860
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,119
flaw

861
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,440
I would say the slipperiness is the

862
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,359
slippery that is the slip between map

863
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:14,099
and territory

864
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:15,119
okay

865
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,859
so when talking about real brains

866
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:23,040
we know that we observe time averaging

867
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,980
in the territory

868
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,859
what we don't know how to do is write an

869
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:31,339
algorithm

870
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,500
that provably produces correct time

871
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,940
averaging

872
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,220
and works in practice in engineering

873
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,140
okay

874
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,540
so let's even say rather than map and

875
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,700
territory because the scientist has a

876
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,380
map as well

877
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,560
let's say the slippage is between

878
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,720
empirical science and engineering

879
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,380
and when we write out our model we are

880
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,060
really trying to address the empirical

881
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,060
science and we don't mind if engineers

882
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,800
you know want to make their little

883
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,599
slippage and

884
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,579
use something that just makes the

885
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:10,859
algorithmics easier

886
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:13,079
that's fine

887
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,760
you know and in fact that is what the

888
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,680
Deep active inference Community does

889
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,040
okay so heading back a little more

890
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,099
towards active inference

891
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:30,119
when we read all of this stuff this is

892
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:32,640
sort of a bit of a Bible for our lab

893
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,579
Sterling and Laughlin

894
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:38,700
so Simon Laughlin was involved in some

895
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,380
of the earliest Publications on

896
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,440
predictive coding in the fly retina

897
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,220
Peter Sterling is the originator of the

898
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,740
concept of allostasis

899
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,960
and what we actually notice

900
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,359
as mentioned a bit earlier is this sort

901
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,760
of slippage another slippage or

902
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,040
contradiction

903
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,359
so they say when you get a reward some

904
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,000
dopamine is released

905
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,460
this invokes a reinforcement learning

906
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,560
principal algorithm

907
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,660
you know let's be careful with neural

908
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,280
circuits that we're not studying in

909
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,859
detail for the moment

910
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:21,420
that is Let's Be Careful how strong a

911
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,900
statement we make about their function

912
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,000
and then most of the empirical evidence

913
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,740
they review in the book is about the

914
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,779
Energy Efficiency of sensory firing

915
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,560
so we're really trying to say we want to

916
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,660
move from

917
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,960
something grounded in minimizing a

918
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,400
prediction error

919
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,099
variational inference

920
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:49,740
to something grounded

921
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,980
ideally with an optimality principle in

922
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,280
control

923
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,420
so then there are some arguments for

924
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,060
neuroscientists

925
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,220
which are more or less intended to

926
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,780
convince the Ewing neuroscientist that

927
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,780
people studying interception and people

928
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,839
studying motor neuroscience

929
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,420
need to work together on studying the

930
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,680
viscera

931
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,260
you can't study the viscera and ignore

932
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,660
the motor branch of the visceral nervous

933
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,800
system

934
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,140
and the functions of that motor branch

935
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,020
now regarding you know our statement of

936
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,720
you can't just minimize prediction error

937
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,579
one might ask what about active

938
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:40,619
inference

939
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:42,440
and

940
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,119
there we have to start being careful

941
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,579
with the term active inference

942
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:50,640
because you know as I have had it

943
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,160
personally explained to me at length

944
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,780
there are at least the two different

945
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:58,619
kinds of active inference

946
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:01,380
there's this very old

947
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,099
um I think it was Adams 2013.

948
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:06,839
you know motor active inference

949
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:08,940
predictions not commands active

950
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,619
inference in the motor

951
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,920
you know in the motor system

952
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,200
and then there's this notion of decision

953
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,060
active inference

954
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,839
where you have an expected free energy

955
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:23,820
explicit prior preferences and so on and

956
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,500
so on

957
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,420
and if you talk to the active inference

958
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,740
community

959
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,200
you know read the papers that they can

960
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,540
write for their own community

961
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,520
I would particularly recommend you know

962
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,200
the international workshop on active

963
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,359
inference which I believe is going to be

964
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,000
a conference next year

965
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,280
they have three years of very good

966
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,700
papers where many authors sketch out the

967
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,700
explicit connections between

968
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,420
active inference control as inference

969
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,560
optimal control

970
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,160
Etc

971
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,740
so really when we bang on saying you

972
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,660
know don't use active inference to

973
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,339
reduce motor function to sensory

974
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:06,720
function

975
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,720
we're talking to some psychologists and

976
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,460
philosophers

977
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,140
who have been

978
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,720
let's say quite enthusiastic about

979
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,760
predictive processing

980
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,000
but a bit eliminativist about some of

981
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,859
the mathematical constructs that are

982
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:26,660
actually used in active inference

983
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,400
so then for our psychologist audience

984
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,920
we have once again the argument that we

985
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,720
are basically

986
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,079
showing that you can and should do

987
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,780
a fully probabilistic notion of optimal

988
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,160
control

989
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,099
in order to sort out what is going on

990
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:50,099
with allostatic regulation

991
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:52,260
and we're going to take some inspiration

992
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:56,960
from motor neuroanatomy in doing it

993
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,800
so

994
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,619
looking at a simple model system

995
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:07,020
and this is getting into figures from

996
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,880
the paper

997
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,820
we have our Barrel reflex afferent

998
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,980
response curve

999
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,700
you have a carroted baroreceptor it's in

1000
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,859
the Carotid artery in the neck

1001
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:22,800
it measures blood pressure

1002
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,619
projects to a circuit in the

1003
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:29,700
uh NTS in the brain stem

1004
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,420
and we bring this up here because the

1005
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:36,060
barrel receptor is often used as a model

1006
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,280
in terraceptor

1007
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,500
when I talked to Karen and asked for

1008
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,260
model systems of interception

1009
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,240
she actually said you know well let's

1010
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,359
think about the power receptor first

1011
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:51,839
and again with contradiction

1012
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,300
what we actually find looking at the

1013
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,300
anatomy is that the baroreceptor the

1014
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,339
Carotid Barrel receptor

1015
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:01,980
is the sensory branch of a low-level

1016
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,740
control circuit

1017
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:09,140
so the NTS will then have

1018
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,319
not I believe the middle inflection

1019
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:14,460
point

1020
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,800
is coded in the NTS here and doesn't

1021
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,440
really change much but what does happen

1022
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,720
is that you can get top down commands

1023
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,119
flowing into the MTS

1024
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:26,339
and then changing the gain of this

1025
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:27,780
circuit

1026
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:31,260
so the slope of the Curve

1027
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,200
and if you widen that slope

1028
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,440
so that the curve is shallower

1029
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,119
than your preserving responsiveness

1030
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,900
you're staying you're widening the

1031
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:49,079
approximately linear portion of the

1032
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:50,099
Curve

1033
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:52,440
while allowing for the blood pressure to

1034
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,160
rise and fall

1035
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:58,079
and so again we see for the interception

1036
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,160
people

1037
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,160
that you really need to think about you

1038
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,420
know what is the role of this

1039
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,660
Interceptor in control

1040
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,960
of the body and of the viscera

1041
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,599
you can't just look at it and say it's a

1042
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:14,819
sensor well okay it's a sensor where

1043
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,520
does IT project to

1044
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,819
um enteroceptive cortex no no not

1045
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:23,640
necessarily like you know the error the

1046
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,380
prediction error signals that reach

1047
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,619
interceptive cortex

1048
00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:30,119
to say you know I can't pump enough

1049
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:32,400
blood or something like that

1050
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,680
might actually have already been

1051
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,900
processed by

1052
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,760
what I believe in the motor active

1053
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,560
inference literature is called a reflex

1054
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,819
arc

1055
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:44,220
so there might already be a reflect a

1056
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,400
reflex controller that has operated on

1057
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,319
that signal by the time it reaches the

1058
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:52,700
higher portions of the brain

1059
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,980
so in our paper we set out some

1060
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:59,160
vocabulary for people to use if they

1061
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,300
want to

1062
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,220
don't have to

1063
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,980
capacity curve in particular we're going

1064
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,240
to tie it to the notion of the

1065
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,000
cumulative distribution function later

1066
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,300
on

1067
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,760
there's some physiology terminology for

1068
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,400
people who want to learn it

1069
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,200
and then we note the same thing that

1070
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,900
Carpenter does

1071
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,480
Carpenter and a number of other papers

1072
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,160
which is that

1073
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,619
this is a massively hierarchical control

1074
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:31,160
system

1075
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:37,500
lots of regulated substances let's say

1076
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,140
or regulated variables are going to have

1077
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:43,740
multiple controllers influencing them

1078
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,140
so for instance

1079
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,720
blood nutrient levels not just glucose

1080
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,359
but I believe like salt

1081
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,119
fat water

1082
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:58,560
are regulated by pairs of hormones

1083
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,540
sometimes there will be multiple pairs

1084
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,960
of hormones per nutrient that has to be

1085
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,700
in the blood

1086
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,700
and this isn't a convex trade-off so

1087
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,520
that's not antagonistic competitive

1088
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,260
regulation

1089
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:16,140
they can appear to compete sometimes

1090
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:20,400
but actually it's Cooperative regulation

1091
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,800
based on the fact that so to speak

1092
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,980
chemical species can't encode negative

1093
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,180
numbers

1094
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,819
the way a digital signal can

1095
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:31,319
so when you do things with chemical

1096
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:34,500
signals having these pairs turns out to

1097
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,599
be the way to

1098
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:39,720
Monitor and control the dynamic range

1099
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,660
with the greatest sensitivity

1100
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,579
like

1101
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:46,980
so then using this example of glucagon

1102
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,480
and insulin

1103
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,200
we can see that sort of normal glycemia

1104
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,500
is really more of a range

1105
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,359
and it's a range where you're going to

1106
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:01,500
have approximately linear response of

1107
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,560
insulin activity

1108
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,740
and you're going to have saturated out

1109
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,720
or really you're going to have

1110
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,460
thresholded out

1111
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,859
glucagon activity

1112
00:47:13,859 --> 00:47:16,560
so at a normal level of blood sugar

1113
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,440
glucagon does not have to retrieve

1114
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,060
additional blood sugar from the

1115
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,980
intestines or the liver

1116
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,740
it doesn't have to call for burning fat

1117
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,420
Reserves

1118
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,119
you essentially you've eaten enough for

1119
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:32,060
the day you're fine

1120
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:36,359
insulin is responsive in a highly

1121
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:37,980
responsive mode where it can give a

1122
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,680
linear response to a linear change

1123
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:44,720
in order to compensate for noise

1124
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,780
so now we can actually get towards you

1125
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,760
know now that we have a controls way to

1126
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,920
think about physiology

1127
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,280
we can get more towards these Notions of

1128
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,500
active inference

1129
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,420
and here we're going to go back to some

1130
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,940
of the sources

1131
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:06,240
on that gave us motor active inference

1132
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,160
one way to think about motor active

1133
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,359
inference

1134
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:10,859
is

1135
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:13,380
the brain sense of prediction

1136
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,420
the reflex arc in the spinal cord

1137
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:19,020
attempts to minimize prediction error

1138
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:22,500
by comparing the prediction with the

1139
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,480
value read off of a proprioceptor

1140
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,300
so again one way to think about that

1141
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:33,260
is having a few extra ways to minimize

1142
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:37,680
prediction error really entropy

1143
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,079
another way to think about that

1144
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,060
is to think of having a very Elementary

1145
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:47,520
control system at the reflex arc level

1146
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,599
and then the brain prescribes the

1147
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:53,280
reference length that is the reference

1148
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,740
signal for that controller

1149
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,660
and it just tries to minimize the

1150
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,280
difference between what it gets off a

1151
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,160
proprioceptor what it reads the actual

1152
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,680
muscle length and tension

1153
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,680
and the reference signal

1154
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,079
and this is actually a very I I'd almost

1155
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:13,500
call it a fun circuit to study

1156
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,500
because of just how well documented it

1157
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,339
is

1158
00:49:17,339 --> 00:49:20,819
that there's something very much like

1159
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:22,920
I would almost say like a Precision

1160
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,180
weighted PID controller in there

1161
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,119
you know if you're a math person then a

1162
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:32,819
muscle is kind of like a spring

1163
00:49:32,819 --> 00:49:35,339
spring can be you know the Dynamics for

1164
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,540
a spring

1165
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:39,119
metal spring stretch it and crunch it

1166
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,880
you know it can be linearized around

1167
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,680
certain points

1168
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,839
and you so you can just about write down

1169
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,420
an LTI PID controller

1170
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,819
for a must for an individual muscle

1171
00:49:50,819 --> 00:49:53,420
spindle

1172
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,160
and you'll get two parameters coming

1173
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,200
down from the brain one of which says

1174
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,819
the reference length

1175
00:49:59,819 --> 00:50:01,800
and the other of which says you know

1176
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,319
what's the sensitivity or gain against

1177
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:08,339
perturbation that you should exercise

1178
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:11,339
and this is actually how your voluntary

1179
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:14,040
movements are engaged

1180
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,079
so really

1181
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,960
all of this stuff about references that

1182
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,780
we're talking about here

1183
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:23,040
is just putting forward to the

1184
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,480
hypothesis

1185
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,180
that maybe visceral motor control works

1186
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:30,180
on the same computational and anatomical

1187
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,740
principles

1188
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:36,140
as voluntary somatomotor control

1189
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:39,540
of course instead of the commands coming

1190
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:43,079
down from say somatomotor cortex

1191
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:46,500
they might be coming from ganglia in the

1192
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,500
autonomic nervous system

1193
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,720
with the higher level central nervous

1194
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,740
system

1195
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:55,619
basically just prescribing rough levels

1196
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:59,760
of activity activation or deactivation

1197
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,619
for the two different sides of the

1198
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:03,780
autonomic nervous system

1199
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,880
which then again in this opponent

1200
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,359
fashion semi-opponent fully Cooperative

1201
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,160
fashion

1202
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,500
allow us to avoid encoding digital

1203
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,079
negative numbers and thereby give you

1204
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,200
very finely balanced control over the

1205
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,040
internal milia

1206
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:26,400
so we eventually get to our figure

1207
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,619
which essentially says

1208
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:32,119
if I know what resource supplies

1209
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:35,780
metabolic resource supplies

1210
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:38,760
nutrients oxygen carbon dioxide that

1211
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,040
sort of thing

1212
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,700
I'm going to have in the future

1213
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:48,180
then my goal is going to be

1214
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:51,839
let's not say to maximize uncertainty

1215
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,359
nor to minimize uncertainty but really

1216
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:58,578
to maximize resilience or freedom

1217
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:03,359
stay in the linear portion of a

1218
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:06,359
cumulative distribution function

1219
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:08,520
where you can be responsive to any

1220
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,700
remaining to any remaining or upcoming

1221
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,800
perturbation

1222
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,559
and so we draw here that you can have

1223
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,020
this capacity estimator

1224
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:21,119
close the loop

1225
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,660
and start directing motor actions via

1226
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:27,059
active inference

1227
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:30,680
in order to follow this preference for

1228
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,660
resilience against perturbation of the

1229
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:36,119
internal milia

1230
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:39,420
which is then tied to interceptive State

1231
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,160
estimation

1232
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,800
your other state estimators your actual

1233
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,880
sensory service services

1234
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:51,980
and this whole wiring diagram

1235
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,480
and maybe one thing just to add too

1236
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,180
right just to underscore a point is that

1237
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:59,520
would I think if you go back one slide

1238
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,740
here

1239
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:05,160
and so how this relates to the

1240
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,900
the sort of adaptive range of the

1241
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,640
settling Point too and what I think is

1242
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,319
really interesting about this right is

1243
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:11,339
that

1244
00:53:11,339 --> 00:53:13,500
you're not defining

1245
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,119
like when we started out talking about

1246
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:16,920
how you might traditionally think about

1247
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,319
set points for homeostasis in like a

1248
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:21,740
very traditional thermostat model right

1249
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,780
what you're talking about here is that

1250
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,300
there's actually

1251
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:26,640
[Music]

1252
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,660
um

1253
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:31,260
if the overall goal of the brain if the

1254
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:33,000
brain is essentially there to help

1255
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,300
regulate and adapt to sort of entire

1256
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,500
biological system of the body to

1257
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,700
circumstances outside of it that are

1258
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,960
constantly going to be changing

1259
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,579
different challenges that it's going to

1260
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:46,440
have to be responsive to

1261
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,200
then you don't necessarily have a set

1262
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,079
point but you have a range

1263
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,480
um where you can where

1264
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,400
where the physiology can be most

1265
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,579
adaptable to those perturbations and

1266
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:01,020
challenges right

1267
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,579
and so

1268
00:54:02,579 --> 00:54:05,339
even just I think to simplify a

1269
00:54:05,339 --> 00:54:07,500
sort of I think that that idea is really

1270
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,760
at the core of what we're trying to talk

1271
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:11,400
about radio like that you essentially

1272
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,460
want to have um

1273
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,980
arrange where the physiology can be

1274
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:20,220
adaptive and yeah you would imagine that

1275
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:23,160
if the physiology is if if some of these

1276
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,200
parameters are pushed way way way far

1277
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,140
outside of the center of that sigmoid

1278
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,819
then you're going to have a problem in

1279
00:54:29,819 --> 00:54:33,540
that they will not be able to adapt

1280
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,700
um to changes you're you're not going to

1281
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,500
be able to be at that linear point of

1282
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,380
Maximum adaptability if you're down here

1283
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,599
near the threshold

1284
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:45,119
and you get you know some random white

1285
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:46,980
noise that pushes you over that

1286
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,500
threshold

1287
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,700
obviously there isn't a discrete

1288
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,680
catastrophic failure

1289
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,559
but also obviously you can no longer

1290
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:57,960
mount a proportional response

1291
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:58,980
yeah

1292
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:01,380
your body is made of you know physical

1293
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:03,780
instruments which have

1294
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:08,599
a limited range of responsiveness

1295
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:12,599
yeah and so our notion of allostasis is

1296
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:13,800
to say

1297
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,400
when you can

1298
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,859
widen the range of responsiveness

1299
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:22,260
rather than narrowing it

1300
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,119
or rather widen the range of

1301
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:27,240
responsiveness when possible while

1302
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,940
narrowing the set of states or the

1303
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,680
distribution of states that you actually

1304
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,980
fall into yeah

1305
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,960
yeah and so you look like doing somewhat

1306
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,119
opposite things

1307
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,980
and and so would it be the case too

1308
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:43,559
right that you could have um

1309
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:46,200
there's different ways that you can have

1310
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,079
these systems become sort of maladaptive

1311
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:52,319
if that if that's if that linear

1312
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,599
if that sigmoid becomes steeper and

1313
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:56,280
steeper and steeper where you basically

1314
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,700
have it's just a very very narrow range

1315
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,440
where you can actually have an Adaptive

1316
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,780
response that can be one potential

1317
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,300
problem another potential problem can be

1318
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,819
when the sort of Baseline level like

1319
00:56:08,819 --> 00:56:11,280
you're saying is pushed far outside of

1320
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,960
that threshold

1321
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,240
then also you're going to require a lot

1322
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,400
more work and a lot more controls or a

1323
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,040
lot more control of that system needed

1324
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,800
to really push it far outside of that

1325
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:26,099
range to actually adapt to push it back

1326
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:28,740
really to push it back again yeah

1327
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:31,319
which could could cause other problems

1328
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:33,180
Downstream as well right but but the

1329
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:37,079
point is just that you um

1330
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:39,660
the the sort of range that you want this

1331
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:41,760
system to settle into is a range where

1332
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,040
it can be adaptive to changes

1333
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,559
and prepare for for fluctuating sorts of

1334
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,240
circumstances right

1335
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,520
yeah so

1336
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:54,660
I think a good intuition to leave with

1337
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,819
since we are get drawing towards the end

1338
00:56:56,819 --> 00:56:58,440
of the hour

1339
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,059
is that

1340
00:57:00,059 --> 00:57:02,420
if you were to try to minimize

1341
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,980
interceptive uncertainty

1342
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,380
then what you might do is just stay home

1343
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:08,700
all the time

1344
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,920
your heart rate will never vary too much

1345
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,359
up and down

1346
00:57:12,359 --> 00:57:14,099
and we're living in the modern world

1347
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:15,480
where you don't have to run away from

1348
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,660
Tigers so you know why deal with the

1349
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:21,599
uncertainty of going out and exercising

1350
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:23,760
or the perturbation of going out and

1351
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,619
exercising

1352
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:27,839
and what our notion of allostasis here

1353
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,059
might tell you in reply

1354
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:32,040
is to say

1355
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:35,400
when you go out and exercise the curve

1356
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,900
gets wider

1357
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:39,480
and so the Adaptive range where you can

1358
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,480
mount a proportional response

1359
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,400
gets wider

1360
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,920
so go out and exercise because it

1361
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,619
actually increases your resilience to

1362
00:57:49,619 --> 00:57:51,599
physiology to Future physiological

1363
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,760
challenge

1364
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,680
so it's still within the active

1365
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,800
inference set of intuitions but we're

1366
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,619
really baking in this assumption that

1367
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:04,160
you should preemptively prepare yourself

1368
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,380
against possible challenge

1369
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:09,720
rather than

1370
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,359
effective rather than acting to avoid

1371
00:58:12,359 --> 00:58:14,220
possible challenge

1372
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,140
we've moved the handling of challenge

1373
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:19,098
into the body

1374
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:22,260
uh Dean go ahead

1375
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,300
as you get to those extremes of those

1376
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,160
crisis moments we talk about a little

1377
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,460
bit about this in the dot zero how does

1378
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:32,220
the interplay or the instructional

1379
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,980
proportion change

1380
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:38,460
between something that's interactive and

1381
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:42,619
and range seeking to

1382
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:46,140
range re-entering I'm I'm curious if

1383
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:49,500
that if the formalisms change as as

1384
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:52,559
those extremes are are reached because

1385
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:54,420
as you said things things don't always

1386
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,520
become

1387
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,020
catastrophic you're irreversibly

1388
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:00,359
catastrophically

1389
00:59:00,359 --> 00:59:01,619
um

1390
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:04,619
stat so what could you like based on

1391
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:07,380
what you guys have obviously looked at

1392
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,599
what what's your sense about how that

1393
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:11,520
how that relationship between

1394
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,579
interaction and instruction shifts as we

1395
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:17,700
get to those really hard limits

1396
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,160
uh Jordan you're often a little better

1397
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,079
on physiology than me do you want to

1398
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:23,460
take this or

1399
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:26,220
oh no I'm not sure I think you might

1400
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:28,640
have it

1401
00:59:30,299 --> 00:59:31,500
um

1402
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,760
so

1403
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:35,540
let's see

1404
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,240
I'm honestly not so great of physiology

1405
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,979
because I rely on Karen for it

1406
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,299
I would almost say that there's a map

1407
00:59:45,299 --> 00:59:48,020
territory failure here

1408
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:52,140
where we were trying to model so to

1409
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:54,660
speak normal function

1410
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,400
under

1411
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,440
normal function with that intuition

1412
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,799
about resilience against challenge okay

1413
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:04,440
and there's several possible responses

1414
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,140
to an extreme circumstance

1415
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:09,480
you know one is that some high up

1416
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,400
control mechanism

1417
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,160
can start overriding these these

1418
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,900
operating points

1419
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,640
pushing them away from where they

1420
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,799
normally are and then that allows you to

1421
01:00:19,799 --> 01:00:21,000
deal with

1422
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,579
extreme circumstances by no longer

1423
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:25,920
treating them as errors at all

1424
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,260
so say if you're sick

1425
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:30,660
your core body temperature is modulated

1426
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:35,520
upwards that puts you in a fever state

1427
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,640
this is expensive metabolically and it

1428
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,099
feels bad compared to

1429
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:44,339
how you normally function but it should

1430
01:00:44,339 --> 01:00:46,740
cook the germs

1431
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:48,960
and then when the extreme State you know

1432
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,339
when that emergency is over

1433
01:00:52,339 --> 01:00:56,940
supposedly hopefully usually you'll be

1434
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:59,880
able to go back to normal function

1435
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,160
there are of course exceptions such as

1436
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:07,379
say long covet right

1437
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,559
just just to make sure though do you see

1438
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:15,119
a change in the amount of of literally

1439
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,359
commands and the amount of back and

1440
01:01:18,359 --> 01:01:24,259
forth as as you approach those limits

1441
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:29,940
do you think they kind of just realize

1442
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:31,619
that they're they're getting closer and

1443
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:33,540
closer to uh

1444
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:36,119
a fall off point

1445
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:37,740
I think that's actually an open and

1446
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:40,559
empirical question okay so one of the

1447
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,380
reasons that we like went as far as

1448
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:45,359
writing a full mathematical model in

1449
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:47,040
this paper

1450
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:50,819
is because they're often

1451
01:01:50,819 --> 01:01:53,220
there isn't that much

1452
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:55,980
empirical neurocomputational work on

1453
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:59,339
interception at all so if you ask very

1454
01:01:59,339 --> 01:02:02,099
basic questions like

1455
01:02:02,099 --> 01:02:05,819
is interception predictably coded below

1456
01:02:05,819 --> 01:02:07,380
the neck

1457
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:10,880
that's still an open question

1458
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:13,380
it could be that peripheral and

1459
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:16,799
pterosceptors are just transducing a

1460
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:19,079
stimulus signal

1461
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:21,660
and then it's only predictably encoded

1462
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:24,140
when it hits the brain we don't know yet

1463
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:28,640
so we'd rather have some

1464
01:02:33,299 --> 01:02:39,020
briefly lost Eli we've lost him but okay

1465
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:45,180
while Eli's rejoining okay very

1466
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,040
interesting

1467
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,660
a different path

1468
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:51,420
through the same material

1469
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:53,280
Dave if your question is for Eli we can

1470
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,200
wait a few seconds

1471
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,180
not necessarily

1472
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:00,780
um I have just a a a a side comment you

1473
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:02,339
don't necessarily have to respond to

1474
01:03:02,339 --> 01:03:04,619
this the discussion reminds me of two

1475
01:03:04,619 --> 01:03:06,660
different fallacies one is the dark room

1476
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:09,000
fallacy you know if you want to minimize

1477
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,220
it's a kind of a parody of active

1478
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,380
inference if you don't want to be if you

1479
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:14,940
don't want to be surprised then just

1480
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:16,380
stay in a dark room where nothing

1481
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,960
changes which has been dismissed pretty

1482
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,119
thoroughly by active insurance

1483
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:25,619
activists right also there was a a

1484
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:28,559
fallacy kind of a social darwiness

1485
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,500
tinged

1486
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,359
interpretation of the the observation

1487
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:37,619
that every species has a fixed number of

1488
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:40,740
heartbeats and therefore valuable people

1489
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:42,720
members of parliament and clergyman

1490
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,900
stood not work because you're eating up

1491
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,240
your lifetime right which of course

1492
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,180
doesn't isn't true because your heart

1493
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:53,880
beats more slowly so it's stretched out

1494
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,520
more if you're in good shape right um

1495
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,740
but more more relevant

1496
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:01,380
um the steepness of the reflex curve I I

1497
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:04,020
sometimes feel that folks working in

1498
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:05,760
active inference

1499
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:10,079
cover may be too much with the notion of

1500
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,420
precision that's this is one quantity

1501
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:17,460
and it looks like the that slope in the

1502
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,500
uh blood pressure curve but that might

1503
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:23,220
is that something that would tend to be

1504
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:26,420
covered by the term precision and if so

1505
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:29,099
should that be a proportion a more

1506
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:31,200
differentiated way rather than just

1507
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,540
being a single number that applies in

1508
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:36,299
lots and lots of areas of control and

1509
01:04:36,299 --> 01:04:37,799
perception

1510
01:04:37,799 --> 01:04:41,099
that's interesting so

1511
01:04:41,099 --> 01:04:43,380
so normally the Precision right is

1512
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,359
normally applied to the predictions so

1513
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:47,460
there's a there's an idea of

1514
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,020
the Precision of the predictions being

1515
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:51,480
applied and in this case I think

1516
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:55,700
the idea is more of um

1517
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:00,920
so it it comes back to where the uh

1518
01:05:01,799 --> 01:05:03,359
you might be talking about prior

1519
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:05,339
preferences being targeted in active

1520
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:07,559
inference models

1521
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:10,680
um and I think the slope the the

1522
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,420
response curve there is instead trying

1523
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:15,900
to Target that use of Prior preferences

1524
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:17,520
right so

1525
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,920
it's trying to Target specifically where

1526
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,740
is um

1527
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:24,240
where is the system trying to be

1528
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,240
navigated it's it's been

1529
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,680
yeah when people talk about prior

1530
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:30,119
preferences they've talked about it

1531
01:05:30,119 --> 01:05:32,880
sometimes in terms of uh

1532
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,420
the system having a sort of strong prior

1533
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:40,319
strong precise priors being encoded

1534
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:41,099
um

1535
01:05:41,099 --> 01:05:44,460
like a priori prior is being encoded uh

1536
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:46,559
to be targeted

1537
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:50,760
and in this case I think it's um

1538
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,740
we're trying to give an account of where

1539
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,240
some of those priors can come from and

1540
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,799
how these systems and how sort of

1541
01:05:55,799 --> 01:05:57,299
opponent processes

1542
01:05:57,299 --> 01:06:00,240
can or opponent uh chemicals can help

1543
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:04,260
regulate the physiology

1544
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,040
um

1545
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,780
and we're trying to get a more natural

1546
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:08,220
approach of where those can come about

1547
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:10,440
from so

1548
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,000
but

1549
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,260
I think um

1550
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:19,500
if it is replaced I'm just trying to

1551
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,240
think to talk aloud to Think Through the

1552
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,700
question so

1553
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:26,400
if it is replacing basically a prior

1554
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,839
preference

1555
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:30,240
and um

1556
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,520
if normally that prior preference would

1557
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:35,400
be handled by uh

1558
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,920
a sort of precision account of it

1559
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,099
then to some extent the um

1560
01:06:41,099 --> 01:06:43,559
the steepness of that curve is trying to

1561
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:46,140
tackle uh it's somewhat of a replacement

1562
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:49,319
of the Precision but

1563
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:51,440
um

1564
01:06:54,839 --> 01:06:58,460
but yeah it's uh

1565
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,819
it's it's giving a different

1566
01:07:01,819 --> 01:07:05,700
way of um

1567
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:07,859
yeah maybe it is a replacement for the

1568
01:07:07,859 --> 01:07:09,359
position in that case

1569
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,280
Eli's back so maybe you I can try to

1570
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,200
answer your question Eli do you want to

1571
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,619
complete your presentation

1572
01:07:16,619 --> 01:07:19,200
um sure but if just to answer the

1573
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,940
question if we're talking about the gain

1574
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:23,760
on one of these signoid curves

1575
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,940
then

1576
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:28,380
yeah that's sort of a replacement for

1577
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:30,119
the Precision but it's really thinking

1578
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:31,740
about

1579
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:34,079
it's thinking about it the all the other

1580
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:35,819
way around

1581
01:07:35,819 --> 01:07:39,119
so a variance quantifies your tolerance

1582
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:40,980
for error

1583
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:44,460
a Precision or a gain quantifies

1584
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:47,720
response to error

1585
01:07:49,619 --> 01:07:51,420
yes

1586
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:53,579
yeah so when you're talking about purely

1587
01:07:53,579 --> 01:07:55,079
sensory

1588
01:07:55,079 --> 01:07:58,980
these extra receptive signals

1589
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:01,200
the ones that aren't prescribing

1590
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:04,200
references to you in any way

1591
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,780
then of course you know you want to save

1592
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:08,339
the neural response which is

1593
01:08:08,339 --> 01:08:10,260
metabolically expensive

1594
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:13,940
for precise signals

1595
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,698
if you're talking about an internal

1596
01:08:17,698 --> 01:08:21,060
you know physiological curve

1597
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:23,279
say reaction to a change in blood

1598
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:24,719
pressure

1599
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:28,259
then you want to try and

1600
01:08:28,259 --> 01:08:31,380
make the gain shallower you want to

1601
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:34,580
tolerate variance

1602
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,339
sorry about

1603
01:08:38,339 --> 01:08:39,779
um getting

1604
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:41,939
my

1605
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:44,580
my home modem I think just restarted

1606
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:47,399
itself for no apparent reason we call

1607
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:50,040
that a sleep wake cycle

1608
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,679
yeah

1609
01:08:52,679 --> 01:08:54,359
um how about it did some sleep phase

1610
01:08:54,359 --> 01:08:56,580
gradient updates

1611
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:59,160
but it's simpler it's refreshed

1612
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,979
um it's ready for you to complete the

1613
01:09:01,979 --> 01:09:04,679
presentation and then we'll

1614
01:09:04,679 --> 01:09:07,500
return very um interesting though

1615
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,040
so

1616
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,238
okay

1617
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:17,299
um

1618
01:09:17,299 --> 01:09:22,799
see share screen here we are all right

1619
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:24,000
continue

1620
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,179
yeah so now we start getting into

1621
01:09:27,179 --> 01:09:29,819
really what scant

1622
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:31,738
um visual material is available for

1623
01:09:31,738 --> 01:09:33,238
section four

1624
01:09:33,238 --> 01:09:35,100
which I think we'll have to go over in

1625
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:38,399
detail in a more q a format a little bit

1626
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:40,020
but

1627
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:43,259
so if we then want to talk about how do

1628
01:09:43,259 --> 01:09:46,679
we integrate decision active inference

1629
01:09:46,679 --> 01:09:50,040
into this allostatic View

1630
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:54,179
then we can say decision making is this

1631
01:09:54,179 --> 01:09:57,380
notion of optimal control control

1632
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:00,000
subject to a set of expectations about

1633
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,600
the future

1634
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,160
so we'll have to write an objective

1635
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,580
function

1636
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:11,400
and then we'll have our wiring diagram

1637
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,780
back

1638
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:15,900
and we'll note that motor references

1639
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:18,360
issued top down

1640
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:23,040
are now conditioned upon or subject to

1641
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:26,540
predictions about the future

1642
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:32,880
then part of how we're going to get into

1643
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,860
what this objective function is actually

1644
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:37,880
made up out of

1645
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:42,300
is to First Take the intuition

1646
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:45,120
that if we start from neural circuits

1647
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,040
that can only do predictive processing

1648
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,960
as we know it

1649
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,679
then one thing we can do with them

1650
01:10:52,679 --> 01:10:57,480
is you know simulate some Ensemble or

1651
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:59,219
population

1652
01:10:59,219 --> 01:11:01,860
of potential

1653
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:03,900
state trajectories or really State

1654
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:06,360
action trajectories

1655
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,980
starting from some initial state

1656
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:12,480
then you know given an objective

1657
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,219
function

1658
01:11:14,219 --> 01:11:18,120
we can estimate the time average

1659
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:21,739
given our ensemble

1660
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:26,400
we can turn that into feedback control

1661
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,400
getting the stability in control theory

1662
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,560
the closed loop stability derived from

1663
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,239
using feedback

1664
01:11:33,239 --> 01:11:36,960
by then having a recognition model

1665
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,239
and then we can say ah

1666
01:11:39,239 --> 01:11:43,320
I'm going to update my entire ensemble

1667
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,360
or population

1668
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,060
of simulations

1669
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,340
by taking them from the recognition

1670
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:51,480
model

1671
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:54,840
which is conditional upon observed

1672
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:58,159
sensory outcomes

1673
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:04,620
and then having predictions from the

1674
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:07,020
recognition density

1675
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:09,300
which we're superscripting here with

1676
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:12,480
superscript you know parentheses too

1677
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,540
in comparison to superscript parentheses

1678
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:18,500
one here

1679
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:23,640
we can then penalize a notion of

1680
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,320
distance

1681
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,600
so really we can penalize the

1682
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,540
quote-unquote size of the update

1683
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:34,440
in information theoretic terms

1684
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:37,739
and if you've seen a free energy or an

1685
01:12:37,739 --> 01:12:39,780
expected free energy written out term by

1686
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:40,880
term before

1687
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,440
you should have seen one of these it's a

1688
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,400
KL Divergence

1689
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,000
but what that gives us is feedback

1690
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,219
stabilized control

1691
01:12:53,219 --> 01:12:57,199
using probability models

1692
01:12:57,659 --> 01:12:59,520
and that actually gets to more or less

1693
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,440
the end of the slides per se

1694
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:08,460
so as a few summary points

1695
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:11,100
are computational model

1696
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:14,760
gives us a useful notion of affordance

1697
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,920
competition

1698
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:20,640
basically run up run a bunch of forward

1699
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,100
simulations

1700
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:26,219
pick the ones that are going to have

1701
01:13:26,219 --> 01:13:29,760
good expected values over time averaging

1702
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,860
to actually enact

1703
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:35,420
as motor references

1704
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,040
the

1705
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:40,920
sigmoidal curves

1706
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,199
after we've taken their derivatives to

1707
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:46,080
convert them to probability densities

1708
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,780
you know then taking the logarithm of

1709
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:51,600
those to convert to log densities

1710
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,760
which is much more typical for you know

1711
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,739
active inference like a log prior

1712
01:13:55,739 --> 01:13:57,600
preference

1713
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,699
those actually provide a notion of

1714
01:13:59,699 --> 01:14:02,159
common currency

1715
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:06,420
foreign because now we've normalized you

1716
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:08,340
know all notion of probability Mass to

1717
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:09,840
one

1718
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,320
so a density over one variable and a

1719
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,420
density over the other variable have the

1720
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:16,739
same units

1721
01:14:16,739 --> 01:14:19,980
we don't need any more notion of a

1722
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:24,440
reward currency in this model

1723
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:28,320
then there's some encouragement

1724
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,900
for the anatomists and physiologists to

1725
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,100
say hey

1726
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:35,280
let's go look at autonomic and visceral

1727
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,440
motor regulation

1728
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,800
and see if we can understand it

1729
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,739
in terms of these motor control circuits

1730
01:14:43,739 --> 01:14:46,519
at the low level

1731
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,640
and that just brings us to you know some

1732
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:54,140
very overall conclusions

1733
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,600
ideally our work should be placed in

1734
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,820
dialogue with you know active inference

1735
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:03,679
as control work by other authors

1736
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:08,100
and of course acknowledgments you can

1737
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,320
really see here how much work went into

1738
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:13,560
this on behalf of absolutely everyone in

1739
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,920
the team

1740
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:21,080
and references

1741
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:25,860
so I'll stop sharing and we can shift to

1742
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:28,560
a more interactive format

1743
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:29,719
awesome

1744
01:15:29,719 --> 01:15:32,760
well thanks for

1745
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:34,620
sharing that and so where was that

1746
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:39,199
previously shared in what context

1747
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:42,780
um just in the context of our lab group

1748
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:44,159
all right cool

1749
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:45,780
so we're going to slide the College of

1750
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:48,600
Engineering Group we were talking yeah

1751
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,760
yeah so the slides are really made for

1752
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:51,920
this like

1753
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,960
biologists psychology with a few

1754
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,860
engineers group

1755
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:59,580
cool

1756
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:02,820
okay well many

1757
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:06,120
many ways many paths to go

1758
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:10,440
just to kind of highlight a few pieces

1759
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,239
under this

1760
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:15,480
broad umbrella of physiology one

1761
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,880
important point you raised

1762
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:20,400
um was how much

1763
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,199
homeostasis

1764
01:16:22,199 --> 01:16:23,640
same

1765
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,440
stasis

1766
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,980
is in effect versus a mechanism of

1767
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:33,000
actually is that stabilization sometimes

1768
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,460
empirically of stasis

1769
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:38,040
and even homeostasis

1770
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:43,380
is that under Lane by a drive to a set

1771
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:46,920
point as it has been simplified or

1772
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:49,860
understood as in that simple thermometer

1773
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:53,940
model and then to what extent do we

1774
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:58,440
bring in allostasis hormesis arousal

1775
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:01,440
and different physiological phenomena

1776
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:04,020
and consider these all part of just the

1777
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:06,960
dynamic and multimodal homeostatic

1778
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,560
engagements of complex bodies

1779
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,600
versus

1780
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,340
um

1781
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:18,000
discard the old and with the new and how

1782
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
much to lump and split physiology when

1783
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,460
even at the single cellular life form

1784
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:24,780
level

1785
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:26,640
they're engaging

1786
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,679
from a computational or control or

1787
01:17:28,679 --> 01:17:31,140
information theoretic perspective in

1788
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:33,900
processes that are analogous to some of

1789
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:36,199
these

1790
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:38,760
that's one point that we can explore

1791
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:42,360
another area to explore is

1792
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:45,360
on that theme of what are these systems

1793
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,860
doing

1794
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:49,800
and how do we model it the map territory

1795
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,060
or the

1796
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:55,260
um engineering basic research question

1797
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:57,120
we could talk about a given

1798
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,600
physiological process body temperature

1799
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,699
stabilization or the baroreceptor the

1800
01:18:02,699 --> 01:18:05,100
glucose and so on

1801
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:08,520
is there the minimization of a

1802
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:09,420
difference

1803
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:12,120
for example between preferred and

1804
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,500
observed

1805
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:16,940
is there a maximization of reward

1806
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:21,060
According to some reward function

1807
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:25,320
is there a maximization of precision

1808
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,300
Precision on what

1809
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:30,360
is there a maximization of responsivity

1810
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:33,780
which corresponds in the sigmoidal curve

1811
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:37,260
family to the linearized region

1812
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:39,780
are there cases where all four of these

1813
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:41,040
things are going to be happening

1814
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,260
indistinguishably

1815
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:46,500
is there a case where some of these

1816
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:48,840
phenomena are occurring at the detriment

1817
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:51,060
of others

1818
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,400
can we differentiate models and actually

1819
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:56,520
make unique predictions explanations and

1820
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,440
control systems

1821
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:02,340
if we move our emphasis from one of

1822
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:06,780
these lenses to another lens

1823
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:08,900
and how should we think about different

1824
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:12,920
physiological systems ranging from the

1825
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,780
implicit and very

1826
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:19,080
ancient mechanisms

1827
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:22,199
to those which consciously may even feel

1828
01:19:22,199 --> 01:19:24,120
like for example error minimization

1829
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:26,219
reward maximization precision

1830
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:30,840
maximization responsivity maximization

1831
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,219
so I'll

1832
01:19:32,219 --> 01:19:35,460
pause there and either authors may make

1833
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:37,380
some remarks or anyone May raise a

1834
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:39,980
question or thought

1835
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:58,440
Eli I just wanted to ask you maybe just

1836
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,360
to direct within this because you talked

1837
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:02,280
at the end about a

1838
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:05,699
that this gets us away from

1839
01:20:05,699 --> 01:20:09,480
having to have a reward currency

1840
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:13,500
oh yeah and maybe I'd be interested if

1841
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,179
you can elaborate on that a little bit

1842
01:20:15,179 --> 01:20:16,500
so

1843
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:19,080
just um what would the typical role of a

1844
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,360
reward currency would be and how does

1845
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,940
this sort of how does the the framework

1846
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:27,179
that you're proposing change that right

1847
01:20:27,179 --> 01:20:30,420
yeah so really I'd back off and say you

1848
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:32,159
know what changes this is the active

1849
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:36,719
inference point of view right so quote

1850
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:38,760
unquote typically if you're doing

1851
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:40,860
something like

1852
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:43,739
um if you're someone like Yale Neve or

1853
01:20:43,739 --> 01:20:47,219
Sam gershman then you think about reward

1854
01:20:47,219 --> 01:20:50,520
as in a reinforcement learning terms as

1855
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:55,800
something that the brain has to maximize

1856
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:58,500
and then you would say all right well I

1857
01:20:58,500 --> 01:20:59,400
want

1858
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:02,100
the uncertainty of my beliefs to be

1859
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:05,699
minimized while I maximize reward

1860
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:07,920
so those are then two separate modular

1861
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,679
computations that have almost opposite

1862
01:21:10,679 --> 01:21:13,020
goals one of them is to minimize

1863
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:15,960
uncertainty right now and the other is

1864
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:19,080
to maximize reward over the long term

1865
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,659
and incomes you know active inference

1866
01:21:21,659 --> 01:21:25,440
and really says no no if you phrase this

1867
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:28,380
as a variational optimization problem

1868
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:30,780
then you can get a unified objective for

1869
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:32,100
this

1870
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:35,100
where you know the common currency is so

1871
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:37,520
to speak

1872
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,080
um evidence

1873
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,940
really you know evidence that you're

1874
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:43,739
following the correct trajectory

1875
01:21:43,739 --> 01:21:45,600
evidence that you're executing a

1876
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,820
behavior correct trade

1877
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:51,179
and evidence series you know in terms of

1878
01:21:51,179 --> 01:21:54,840
I guess we would call them gnats or bits

1879
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,780
are the units and information Theory so

1880
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,340
if you're using

1881
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:01,980
you know e as the basis of your

1882
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:03,320
logarithm

1883
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:06,719
then it's not if you're using a log 2

1884
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:10,400
base it's bits

1885
01:22:12,179 --> 01:22:13,980
my dogs are getting picked up for their

1886
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:16,580
walks so

1887
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:21,179
yes this is a very interesting

1888
01:22:21,179 --> 01:22:23,640
complementary perspective

1889
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:27,120
where we'll get reward maximization over

1890
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,560
time

1891
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,420
when we

1892
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:33,719
increase our Precision now everybody

1893
01:22:33,719 --> 01:22:35,699
agrees on that and is it going to be the

1894
01:22:35,699 --> 01:22:37,800
cart before the horse or the horse

1895
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,540
before the car and which one's the horse

1896
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:41,699
and which one's the cart

1897
01:22:41,699 --> 01:22:45,239
and framing the unified objective

1898
01:22:45,239 --> 01:22:49,260
function in information theoretic terms

1899
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:53,880
as a surprisal bounding heuristic as has

1900
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:56,100
been done in Bayesian evidence lower

1901
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:58,760
bounds for a long time by Framing

1902
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:03,120
surprise minimization bounding as the

1903
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,540
unified objective function and currency

1904
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:09,260
then there is the realized

1905
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:12,960
maintenance of homeostasis or however we

1906
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,940
want to call that

1907
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:17,340
without needing a traditionally

1908
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:18,920
structured

1909
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:22,020
maximization of reward as defined by a

1910
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:24,239
reward or time discounted reward

1911
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:26,880
function

1912
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,760
and it's also very uh interesting like

1913
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,980
we're not trying to accumulate body

1914
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:33,300
temperature we're not trying to

1915
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,460
accumulate glucose

1916
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:38,699
if we were playing a game where simply

1917
01:23:38,699 --> 01:23:41,159
more points were better

1918
01:23:41,159 --> 01:23:44,719
like some social and sub-social games

1919
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:49,440
then a unilateral optimization via

1920
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,140
maximization Paradigm makes a lot of

1921
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:53,100
sense

1922
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:54,920
but for the kind of physiological

1923
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:57,719
infinite games that we play

1924
01:23:57,719 --> 01:23:59,460
as you highlighted with the infinite

1925
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:01,679
Horizon

1926
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:04,860
then it may make more sense

1927
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:09,179
to have a bounded responsibility

1928
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:13,140
and an emphasis on controllability

1929
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:15,540
under inherited priors that those

1930
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:17,580
controllable ranges are the survivable

1931
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:19,500
ranges otherwise how could one have

1932
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,719
existed for Generations

1933
01:24:21,719 --> 01:24:24,659
rather than try to

1934
01:24:24,659 --> 01:24:27,920
Stack Up glucose

1935
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:33,120
yeah so I think

1936
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,040
it's always really interesting to go

1937
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,440
back and read Peter Sterling in this

1938
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,699
light

1939
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:41,159
because

1940
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:43,460
you know beyond just the formal

1941
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:45,840
physiological material

1942
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:47,880
there are these stories that he can tell

1943
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:49,920
of for instance people living in

1944
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,500
long-term stressful situations

1945
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:54,540
and they develop what we would Now call

1946
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:58,159
the diseases of civilization

1947
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:01,500
which you know you Sterling sort of

1948
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:06,000
implies are the diseases of homeostasis

1949
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,580
living too much the same too much of the

1950
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:10,820
time

1951
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:14,040
and indeed speaking of you know not

1952
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:17,580
wanting to stack up glucose

1953
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:19,739
this is that you know this is an actual

1954
01:25:19,739 --> 01:25:21,900
disease that happens to people that is

1955
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:24,360
called diabetes

1956
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:27,239
it is considered a pathology and so

1957
01:25:27,239 --> 01:25:28,500
there's

1958
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,900
almost an interesting you know Misfit

1959
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:33,480
between that intuitive notion of reward

1960
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:34,920
or at least

1961
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:36,900
let's sneer slightly and say that

1962
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:39,360
economic notion of reward

1963
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,940
which has to be a form of accumulative

1964
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:45,239
wealth in a common currency

1965
01:25:45,239 --> 01:25:48,120
versus physiology in which too much of a

1966
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:50,420
good thing is actually a bad thing again

1967
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:53,640
right and and that actually comes back

1968
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:57,600
to if you there's a part of what this is

1969
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,880
contributing then right in one ways is a

1970
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:03,300
sort of shift in metaphor right or it's

1971
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:06,600
I think that point about a

1972
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:09,420
an economic conception and value and of

1973
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:10,380
reward

1974
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:12,120
is

1975
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:14,159
it's useful to have a Counterpoint to

1976
01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:16,860
that because as Eli is saying

1977
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:19,260
there is no upper limit to economic

1978
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:21,600
reward there's a benefit to accumulating

1979
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,659
it you think about sort of accumulating

1980
01:26:24,659 --> 01:26:27,300
Capital to spend it

1981
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:28,500
um

1982
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,780
in this case right what what we're

1983
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:33,239
focusing on is

1984
01:26:33,239 --> 01:26:35,340
how to

1985
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:38,760
basically keep balanced and adaptable

1986
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:41,639
so that future challenges can be

1987
01:26:41,639 --> 01:26:43,199
actually encountered and dealt with and

1988
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:45,600
that sometimes means packing light not

1989
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,820
keeping so much glucose on hand so that

1990
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:50,219
you can very like deal with the reward

1991
01:26:50,219 --> 01:26:52,080
or deal with changing circumstances and

1992
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,460
adapt to them

1993
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:56,340
but you can't um

1994
01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:58,560
it's actually it's maybe yeah it's it's

1995
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,719
maybe been a pretty serious problem to

1996
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:02,040
have this

1997
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,560
completely abstracted notion of value

1998
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,540
that

1999
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:07,500
um

2000
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:10,860
is endlessly accumulatable and doesn't

2001
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:12,780
actually

2002
01:27:12,780 --> 01:27:14,400
doesn't interface with any of the

2003
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:17,219
biological realities of um

2004
01:27:17,219 --> 01:27:19,320
of what systems are actually doing right

2005
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:23,400
there's yeah it's it's it's so it's so

2006
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:26,219
abstract that it's um

2007
01:27:26,219 --> 01:27:28,440
it's it's gonna have a really hard time

2008
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:30,840
interfacing with Biology

2009
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:33,120
yeah before we go to the question let's

2010
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,940
say let's sum that up by saying bank

2011
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:38,460
accounts are unbounded and they're

2012
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:41,159
useful because they're unbounded

2013
01:27:41,159 --> 01:27:43,139
you know the account like an economist

2014
01:27:43,139 --> 01:27:46,020
can conceive of trillions of dollars in

2015
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:47,340
assets

2016
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:52,380
in a way that my body cannot

2017
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:54,780
bodies are bounded

2018
01:27:54,780 --> 01:27:56,520
if you you know they are physically

2019
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,560
bounded they are made of a finite amount

2020
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,600
of matter at once

2021
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:02,699
if you try to put too much more into

2022
01:28:02,699 --> 01:28:07,040
them something bad will happen

2023
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,480
naturally after setting this up on that

2024
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:11,460
channel discussion I've got to duck off

2025
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:13,139
a little bit early but I'm going to try

2026
01:28:13,139 --> 01:28:15,000
to be back for 50.2 next week and I'm

2027
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,080
really interested to see where this

2028
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:17,580
conversation goes so I'll catch up on

2029
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:19,739
the hubs thank you

2030
01:28:19,739 --> 01:28:21,840
um all right thanks

2031
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,300
if nobody Minds I'd like to ask Dave his

2032
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,980
question first just because I was about

2033
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:29,100
to when I got kicked off

2034
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:31,080
yep go for it Dave

2035
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:34,560
or um is that one that I said

2036
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,260
um yeah I know which one that was

2037
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:38,760
um if you have a new question it's fine

2038
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:43,040
I oh yeah that's probably better um

2039
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:45,679
her two

2040
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:49,320
pieces of civilization there is the

2041
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:52,500
rumor and maybe this was just a fallacy

2042
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,600
or a misunderstanding that people who

2043
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:57,000
managed to stay in London during the

2044
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,699
blitz under conditions that you would

2045
01:28:59,699 --> 01:29:01,920
expect would produce massive amount of

2046
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,420
psycho

2047
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:06,840
um psychosomatic disease hysteria

2048
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,540
conversion syndromes that it didn't

2049
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:12,840
happen people were just preposterously

2050
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:15,300
sane because they didn't have time to be

2051
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:18,060
sick they didn't have time to be crazy

2052
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:21,679
did that really happen

2053
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:24,840
did the sense of mission override what

2054
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:29,100
otherwise would have been General stress

2055
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:34,040
syndrome causing breakdowns

2056
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,239
um does someone know the detailed

2057
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:38,100
history of the London Blitz in World War

2058
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:41,219
II because I really don't it's a great

2059
01:29:41,219 --> 01:29:45,239
uh not English dot 1.5

2060
01:29:45,239 --> 01:29:49,159
um Journey for us to explore but to to

2061
01:29:49,159 --> 01:29:51,540
speak to it generally

2062
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:54,780
it's an interesting question as well to

2063
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:58,739
what extent by comforting and

2064
01:29:58,739 --> 01:30:00,300
regularizing

2065
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:04,760
we even work against that and let alone

2066
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:08,040
neglect other trade-offs and incur

2067
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:10,080
externalities

2068
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:12,500
um Dean

2069
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:16,980
Eli this has been fantastic I so here's

2070
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:18,420
here's my thing

2071
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:21,120
um and I maybe in the in the in the dot

2072
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:24,420
two we'll we'll get into the I I

2073
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:26,100
mentioned at the end of the dot zero I

2074
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:27,420
was I was hoping you really had some

2075
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:29,820
really velvet gloves to walk me through

2076
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:32,639
the 4.4 because

2077
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:34,920
and especially after the context you've

2078
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:36,960
been able to provide us today around the

2079
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:38,110
idea that

2080
01:30:38,110 --> 01:30:38,460
[Music]

2081
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:39,300
um

2082
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:41,159
you know engineers and psychologists

2083
01:30:41,159 --> 01:30:43,080
came into a room now I don't know if

2084
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:45,480
that once you got into that room it

2085
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:46,980
became an intersection with red light

2086
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:49,199
green light and you guys kind of played

2087
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:51,239
a Red Rover come on over thing or

2088
01:30:51,239 --> 01:30:54,840
weather and you know it so well well

2089
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,639
here's the thing because I actually did

2090
01:30:56,639 --> 01:31:00,179
work with CFOs and engineers and and so

2091
01:31:00,179 --> 01:31:04,020
what you discover is there's a bit of an

2092
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:06,840
isomorphist I want to be able to diagram

2093
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:10,380
this out for you view that that tends to

2094
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:12,300
be biased for engineers and then there's

2095
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,760
the spatially enveloped view of the

2096
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:16,920
psychologist right like they're in their

2097
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:19,620
phenomenological space and what you've

2098
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:20,520
done

2099
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:23,580
is you've tried to say what what when

2100
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:26,940
those two worlds come together I don't

2101
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:28,500
know if it's a collision I don't know if

2102
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:30,540
it's a cooperation it's a variety of

2103
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:33,120
things right it's complicated we'll just

2104
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,880
leave it there but my my question is

2105
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:40,980
this as I got to 4.4 it felt like if I

2106
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:43,380
was skiing I went from a beautiful

2107
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:47,040
powder field to some sparsely

2108
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:50,100
um distance trees to Tighter and Tighter

2109
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:52,380
and finally I was like I don't know how

2110
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:54,060
I can keep going because there doesn't

2111
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:57,360
seem to be any more gaps here it's just

2112
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:59,159
getting too tight for me and the

2113
01:31:59,159 --> 01:32:01,260
reconciliation like when you're skiing

2114
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:03,840
as a metaphor is you're not looking at

2115
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:04,980
the trees

2116
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:07,620
you're looking at the at the non thing

2117
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:09,060
it's the non-objects it's a

2118
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:10,340
Reconciliation

2119
01:32:10,340 --> 01:32:12,719
and when we're talking about dodgeball

2120
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:14,699
as your metaphor or whether we're

2121
01:32:14,699 --> 01:32:15,980
talking about

2122
01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:19,260
glucagon control these to me what you

2123
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:22,500
were describing up until that point was

2124
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:25,320
essentially you were saying for us to

2125
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:27,840
know what's going on we're going to look

2126
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,000
at the risk management we're going to

2127
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,440
look at the coordination we're going to

2128
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:32,580
look at those things that are

2129
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:35,639
essentially backwards facing we can say

2130
01:32:35,639 --> 01:32:38,460
that in order for the process to carry

2131
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:41,219
forward continue there has to be some

2132
01:32:41,219 --> 01:32:45,659
addressing of those factors and then

2133
01:32:45,659 --> 01:32:47,699
there has to be the reconciliation just

2134
01:32:47,699 --> 01:32:49,500
like when the engineers and the

2135
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:51,540
psychologists are proximal to one

2136
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:53,580
another it's an entanglement and and

2137
01:32:53,580 --> 01:32:56,400
it's not a the engineers get to tell the

2138
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,080
psychologists what to do any more than

2139
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:59,760
the psychologists get to tell the

2140
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:02,820
engineers what to do right so

2141
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:04,080
if

2142
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:07,199
if the behavioral piece if the idea of

2143
01:33:07,199 --> 01:33:10,380
the biology and the physiology is if I

2144
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:14,219
do this now in real terms

2145
01:33:14,219 --> 01:33:16,920
I have to look at that and you guys had

2146
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:20,460
an L4 different time frames

2147
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:24,179
right I can manage that you spoke

2148
01:33:24,179 --> 01:33:28,199
clearly to that I I I read that and it

2149
01:33:28,199 --> 01:33:30,780
was clear to me I was I I got it I can

2150
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:32,639
coordinate that

2151
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:35,580
and again that was very very clear and

2152
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:36,360
then

2153
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:38,580
I got to 4.4

2154
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:42,360
and I simply lost the thread because

2155
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,280
what I was looking for was the

2156
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:47,100
reconciliation I will align this next

2157
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:51,000
move with the range recapitulator that's

2158
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,080
what I was expecting next and then so I

2159
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:57,540
went okay so where is the strategy

2160
01:33:57,540 --> 01:33:59,940
because that's there when when

2161
01:33:59,940 --> 01:34:01,980
psychologists and engineers get into a

2162
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:04,440
room they don't just abandon their

2163
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:07,440
strategy it comes with them it follows

2164
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:09,420
them into that space and carries them to

2165
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:13,080
that question of I reconcile

2166
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:16,560
an advantage and all of the above until

2167
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,540
I choose this Choice while always

2168
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:21,300
keeping all the above so you guys talked

2169
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:23,639
about that in other parts of it you said

2170
01:34:23,639 --> 01:34:25,920
we can't just abandon it

2171
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,960
but I couldn't understand how the

2172
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:29,540
formalism

2173
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:31,260
reconciled it

2174
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:33,239
so I'm sorry that's such a long-winded

2175
01:34:33,239 --> 01:34:35,520
question but picture paper oh it's

2176
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:38,880
awesome to spend six hours of my life

2177
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,639
going these guys have got to be much

2178
01:34:41,639 --> 01:34:43,020
closer to answering this because I've

2179
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:44,880
never been able to answer it but then I

2180
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:47,460
got lost and I just felt like oh man

2181
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:50,420
what am I missing

2182
01:34:51,239 --> 01:34:53,420
okay so

2183
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:56,040
I'm gonna disappoint you slightly and

2184
01:34:56,040 --> 01:35:01,159
say you know what you're missing is that

2185
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:04,980
I think what's missing from our writing

2186
01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:07,440
is really being clear that we're working

2187
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:10,199
under a very unusual

2188
01:35:10,199 --> 01:35:12,960
set of constraints in how we formulated

2189
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:14,639
this model

2190
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:18,239
so specifically unlike say

2191
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:21,840
Sam gershman Oriel leave

2192
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:25,380
or unlike the literature on deep active

2193
01:35:25,380 --> 01:35:28,260
inference in computers

2194
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:30,900
we're assuming that you essentially

2195
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:33,739
don't need

2196
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:36,780
an extra set of computational

2197
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:41,000
ingredients for reinforcement learning

2198
01:35:41,219 --> 01:35:43,880
so we're saying assuming that you can do

2199
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:46,620
only the

2200
01:35:46,620 --> 01:35:49,199
computational operations known to be

2201
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:51,900
involved in predictive processing

2202
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:54,719
what can you come up with that will

2203
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:57,360
handle a control problem

2204
01:35:57,360 --> 01:36:00,540
and the answer is this very specific

2205
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:03,179
thing with these nastily involved

2206
01:36:03,179 --> 01:36:04,920
derivations

2207
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:08,600
called path integral control

2208
01:36:08,820 --> 01:36:10,560
and you'll notice that when I was going

2209
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:13,260
over those slides I basically said let's

2210
01:36:13,260 --> 01:36:15,480
just say you can simulate

2211
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:18,239
you know possible futures

2212
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:21,420
like Possible episode length courses you

2213
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:23,159
know courses of future

2214
01:36:23,159 --> 01:36:25,380
activity

2215
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:28,679
and you can evaluate them in terms of

2216
01:36:28,679 --> 01:36:31,199
your objective function

2217
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:35,460
and then you can update them by means of

2218
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:37,380
a recognition model

2219
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:39,600
or by integrating prediction errors and

2220
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:42,719
using predictive coding

2221
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:45,300
then how do we build a formalism out of

2222
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:48,900
just those

2223
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:51,960
and the upside is that this does let us

2224
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:54,600
look at the controls literature and say

2225
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:55,800
all right

2226
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:58,639
this is actually

2227
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:03,540
optimal feedback stabilized control

2228
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:05,340
we can look at some of the bounded

2229
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:07,440
rationality literature

2230
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:10,980
in cognitive science and Neuroscience

2231
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:14,699
and say our objective function is a free

2232
01:37:14,699 --> 01:37:16,199
energy

2233
01:37:16,199 --> 01:37:17,880
that is

2234
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:20,340
if you have to penalize how much you

2235
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:22,679
change neural firing

2236
01:37:22,679 --> 01:37:24,659
over time

2237
01:37:24,659 --> 01:37:26,760
or how much you change your mind and

2238
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:30,199
update your beliefs over time

2239
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:33,120
because you only have so much metabolic

2240
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:34,920
power in your head

2241
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:39,679
then we include a penalty term for that

2242
01:37:39,780 --> 01:37:42,000
and we can say this can all just be done

2243
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,400
by you know embodied simulation and

2244
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:47,219
referent configuration motor control

2245
01:37:47,219 --> 01:37:48,900
does that mean this is how the brain

2246
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:52,519
actually does things of course not

2247
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:55,020
you know it does mean that if you want

2248
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:57,060
to do your modeling with

2249
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:58,440
I think

2250
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:01,560
um Andy Clark tends to quote you know

2251
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:04,679
Quine and say if you want to do if you

2252
01:38:04,679 --> 01:38:07,800
have a taste for Desert landscapes

2253
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:10,620
then we've given you a computational

2254
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:11,880
model

2255
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:15,659
that is basically just sanded rocks

2256
01:38:15,659 --> 01:38:18,239
and as such yes it's something of a

2257
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:21,320
hostile environment

2258
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,639
you know walk without Rhythm you won't

2259
01:38:23,639 --> 01:38:26,659
detract the worm

2260
01:38:28,199 --> 01:38:31,699
in the planes of active

2261
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,219
yeah if you want to live behind the

2262
01:38:35,219 --> 01:38:37,620
shield wall where we have

2263
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:38,219
um

2264
01:38:38,219 --> 01:38:41,159
TD estimated value functions good for

2265
01:38:41,159 --> 01:38:42,239
you

2266
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:45,780
in the stretched sigmoid with broad

2267
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:49,139
variability so stretched that it is flat

2268
01:38:49,139 --> 01:38:51,420
and plain like but still highly

2269
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:54,719
controllable within large bounds

2270
01:38:54,719 --> 01:38:57,239
that's where we're oscillating

2271
01:38:57,239 --> 01:38:59,100
yep

2272
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:03,060
very interesting it'll be I think great

2273
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:07,679
in our lab to pick up a few points from

2274
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:10,219
am I the one cutting out again

2275
01:39:10,219 --> 01:39:14,580
I still see you yeah

2276
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:17,340
it's okay yeah you're back all right you

2277
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:20,040
flickered a bit okay

2278
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:23,460
um in the last minutes we can

2279
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:26,219
talk about some ideas from earlier in

2280
01:39:26,219 --> 01:39:28,679
the paper look at any of the figures and

2281
01:39:28,679 --> 01:39:31,560
then in the dot two that'll be awesome

2282
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:35,400
to really approach the formalism and

2283
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:40,739
help Dean on that ski Journey

2284
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,620
um

2285
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:46,380
what would be something to go to in

2286
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:49,580
these last minutes

2287
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:55,380
yes Dean and just and Eli maybe I'll be

2288
01:39:55,380 --> 01:39:57,239
able to get a chance to elaborate with

2289
01:39:57,239 --> 01:39:59,340
this bit more of Jordan in the next one

2290
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:03,420
but I'm curious you you you took pains

2291
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:05,820
and great at Great Lengths to say look

2292
01:40:05,820 --> 01:40:09,540
this doesn't map directly onto all the

2293
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:13,560
complexities that we know exist but what

2294
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:15,179
because you said to start at this in

2295
01:40:15,179 --> 01:40:19,080
2019 you had a bit of time on your hands

2296
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:22,260
and then and then did kind of alluded

2297
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:24,260
this at the beginning

2298
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:27,120
were there discoveries that you made

2299
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:30,179
that you didn't anticipate

2300
01:40:30,179 --> 01:40:34,219
because you you were very also very um

2301
01:40:34,219 --> 01:40:37,800
respectful in who you acknowledged as

2302
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:40,500
sort of laying the the groundwork here

2303
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:43,380
you had a bit of stability to work off

2304
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:48,500
of but did you did you find yourself

2305
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:51,060
introduced being introduced to things

2306
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:55,800
that weren't there prior to you guys

2307
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,840
coalescing around this and do you think

2308
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:00,420
it continues to evolve or does it just

2309
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:03,679
stay on a theoretical level

2310
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:05,340
[Music]

2311
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:06,600
um

2312
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:10,920
so actually I'd say for me personally

2313
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:13,920
the big unanticipated Discovery was just

2314
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,960
how little we know

2315
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:18,719
about interceptive neuroanatomy and

2316
01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:20,760
neurophysiology

2317
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:23,940
and I mean in the periphery so

2318
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:26,159
you know our lab with Lisa and Karen

2319
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:28,920
Lisa handles the stuff above the neck

2320
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:30,900
and so we've got you know Barrett and

2321
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:33,060
Simmons 2015 there's a number of other

2322
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:36,060
good papers saying essentially you look

2323
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:37,920
at the brain architecture and it looks

2324
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:40,920
like the at least in cortex

2325
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:43,020
you know the interceptive and visceral

2326
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:46,560
motor cortices are fairly Central to the

2327
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:49,679
architecture and then you ask okay so

2328
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:52,679
what kinds of signals are coming in from

2329
01:41:52,679 --> 01:41:54,239
the periphery

2330
01:41:54,239 --> 01:41:56,340
to then be subjected to predictive

2331
01:41:56,340 --> 01:41:57,719
processing

2332
01:41:57,719 --> 01:42:00,480
in cortex

2333
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:02,760
and you basically get told well in

2334
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:06,560
terreceptive signals obviously

2335
01:42:07,139 --> 01:42:09,659
so there was that moment when I was

2336
01:42:09,659 --> 01:42:12,659
working with Karen and realized oh okay

2337
01:42:12,659 --> 01:42:14,100
so

2338
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:15,900
it looks like there's actually this

2339
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:18,540
close analogy that we could hypothesize

2340
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:20,340
between

2341
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:25,139
the known function of a somatomotor

2342
01:42:25,139 --> 01:42:26,900
circuit

2343
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:31,099
for voluntary motor control

2344
01:42:31,260 --> 01:42:35,280
and this way of handling Barrel reflex

2345
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:36,500
function

2346
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:39,179
and it looks like for the barrel reflex

2347
01:42:39,179 --> 01:42:42,060
you know you can voluntarily change the

2348
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:45,060
gain or the tolerance those being

2349
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:47,460
inverses of each other

2350
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:50,639
changing the operating point you know

2351
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:52,800
voluntarily doesn't seem to happen but

2352
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:54,960
it does seem to shift

2353
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:57,480
and it does begin to look as though ah

2354
01:42:57,480 --> 01:43:00,659
we can just we can stop just saying

2355
01:43:00,659 --> 01:43:04,260
you know there are interceptive signals

2356
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:07,440
we don't know anything about them right

2357
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:09,540
and instead ask how could we break down

2358
01:43:09,540 --> 01:43:13,440
the autonomic nervous system and the

2359
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:17,280
interceptive periphery into these

2360
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:20,460
you know control circuits where there's

2361
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:22,920
a reference that flows from above

2362
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:26,400
or is possibly built in as a prior and

2363
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,619
then a sensor and then a motor neuron or

2364
01:43:28,619 --> 01:43:31,280
an effector

2365
01:43:32,659 --> 01:43:35,760
that again total

2366
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:38,639
speculating one could imagine that Loop

2367
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:41,659
could be ultra local

2368
01:43:41,659 --> 01:43:44,580
or even get cellular electrical

2369
01:43:44,580 --> 01:43:48,480
Junctions so as local as could be to

2370
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,699
close the motor control Loop and then

2371
01:43:50,699 --> 01:43:53,159
there would be potentially a more meso

2372
01:43:53,159 --> 01:43:56,699
scale purely within the periphery

2373
01:43:56,699 --> 01:43:58,760
um maybe some sort of motor coordination

2374
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:02,699
or vasoconstriction type actions that

2375
01:44:02,699 --> 01:44:06,300
are being enacted through local neural

2376
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:10,679
networks and other systems and then when

2377
01:44:10,679 --> 01:44:12,780
you gotta make the call to the central

2378
01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:14,400
nervous system

2379
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:17,639
and engage at that level

2380
01:44:17,639 --> 01:44:21,060
it's the highest capacity of like

2381
01:44:21,060 --> 01:44:25,260
Intermodal memory computation all these

2382
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:29,100
other complex phenomena which then can

2383
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:31,980
be seen to have their rightful place

2384
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:36,659
maybe even in a specific brain region

2385
01:44:36,659 --> 01:44:40,260
but the entire integrated dodgeball

2386
01:44:40,260 --> 01:44:42,360
performance

2387
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:45,239
is not going to be located to a brain

2388
01:44:45,239 --> 01:44:46,860
region any more than it would be located

2389
01:44:46,860 --> 01:44:49,199
to a fingertip

2390
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:52,619
because it all needs to be coordinated

2391
01:44:52,619 --> 01:44:55,860
and not every call can be local

2392
01:44:55,860 --> 01:44:59,100
and not every call can be global so

2393
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:02,280
finding out how bodies as territories

2394
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:07,040
and our models as Maps

2395
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:10,619
wire things up

2396
01:45:10,619 --> 01:45:13,199
is going to make models that are more

2397
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:15,179
interpretable

2398
01:45:15,179 --> 01:45:18,119
better aligned with empirical data

2399
01:45:18,119 --> 01:45:20,159
making more useful predictions and

2400
01:45:20,159 --> 01:45:21,659
explanations

2401
01:45:21,659 --> 01:45:25,320
it's very interesting angle

2402
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:28,619
and I would say just to piggyback a

2403
01:45:28,619 --> 01:45:31,199
little you know as a modeling Paradigm I

2404
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:32,699
think this is one of the real strengths

2405
01:45:32,699 --> 01:45:34,380
of active inference

2406
01:45:34,380 --> 01:45:36,300
is that once you're dealing with these

2407
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:38,040
probability densities and log

2408
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:40,619
probability densities

2409
01:45:40,619 --> 01:45:42,900
you are

2410
01:45:42,900 --> 01:45:45,119
able to start sketching out these

2411
01:45:45,119 --> 01:45:47,760
hierarchical structures

2412
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:49,199
and that doesn't mean that every

2413
01:45:49,199 --> 01:45:51,300
hierarchical active inference model is

2414
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:52,920
automatically a map of the nervous

2415
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:55,980
system but it does mean that you have a

2416
01:45:55,980 --> 01:45:57,540
language that is at least minimally

2417
01:45:57,540 --> 01:46:00,600
capable of expressing what we so

2418
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:02,520
abundantly find in the empirical

2419
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:05,060
evidence

2420
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:08,219
yeah one part of the

2421
01:46:08,219 --> 01:46:12,179
paper that was very interesting what we

2422
01:46:12,179 --> 01:46:14,820
in reading it remarked how

2423
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:16,800
although most papers are written in

2424
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:21,540
words this one was very word forward

2425
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:25,440
each section had a

2426
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:27,179
preamble

2427
01:46:27,179 --> 01:46:29,880
content summary

2428
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:32,400
sandwiching technique as did the paper

2429
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:36,540
at a higher scale the nomenclature was

2430
01:46:36,540 --> 01:46:39,780
up front and clear and then the

2431
01:46:39,780 --> 01:46:43,500
relationship between the cumulative

2432
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:47,100
distributions and the classical PDF type

2433
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:49,260
probability densities

2434
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:53,719
was made clear but this

2435
01:46:53,719 --> 01:46:56,880
exactly connects

2436
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:00,780
something that has a um

2437
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:03,239
in the generic case

2438
01:47:03,239 --> 01:47:05,540
a guaranteed inflection point

2439
01:47:05,540 --> 01:47:08,100
interpretable thresholded values this is

2440
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:09,840
why sigmoid functions are used as

2441
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:12,420
activation functions in artificial

2442
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:13,920
neural networks

2443
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:16,500
with

2444
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:21,000
a uh optimizable laplacian approximation

2445
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,540
like

2446
01:47:23,540 --> 01:47:26,699
inverted quadratic form

2447
01:47:26,699 --> 01:47:29,780
that is able to be used as a log

2448
01:47:29,780 --> 01:47:33,060
probability and so really like

2449
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:35,580
especially with figure 9

2450
01:47:35,580 --> 01:47:39,659
showing the stepwise relationship

2451
01:47:39,659 --> 01:47:41,760
opens the door to like hey if you've

2452
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:44,880
seen a sigmoid somewhere

2453
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:47,520
now you can think about that as like a

2454
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:50,940
PDF hiding a PDF bell curve

2455
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:53,340
and then where you have seen a gaussian

2456
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:55,500
or bell curve or a laplacian

2457
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:57,060
approximation

2458
01:47:57,060 --> 01:48:00,060
you can go the other direction and think

2459
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:03,000
about that in terms of a sigmoidal

2460
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,040
response action

2461
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:09,600
and so they're rarely connected so

2462
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,739
clearly

2463
01:48:10,739 --> 01:48:13,320
though those with familiarity it's

2464
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:15,659
almost the water that they swim in and

2465
01:48:15,659 --> 01:48:17,159
those without familiarity wouldn't see

2466
01:48:17,159 --> 01:48:18,300
the connection

2467
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:20,760
and the The Challenge and the

2468
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:22,560
opportunity is like to stick in the

2469
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:23,400
middle

2470
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:25,139
and stay

2471
01:48:25,139 --> 01:48:28,260
in the connection space

2472
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:30,480
to raise attention to some of these

2473
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:32,580
relationships which again otherwise you

2474
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:33,900
could have a whole subfield of

2475
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:36,179
physiology working on the sigmoid

2476
01:48:36,179 --> 01:48:39,360
response curve and a whole subfield of

2477
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:41,280
hierarchical predictive processing

2478
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:44,820
models working in the PDF space or log

2479
01:48:44,820 --> 01:48:46,320
PDF space

2480
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:50,760
and it's just a derivative and a log or

2481
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:54,780
an exponentiation and a derivation away

2482
01:48:54,780 --> 01:48:58,560
from those two Fields being formally

2483
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:00,900
connected not just as like a speculative

2484
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:02,699
review paper someone could or should do

2485
01:49:02,699 --> 01:49:05,400
this but like it's done we just didn't

2486
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:07,638
know

2487
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:11,580
tools so I think regarding the writing I

2488
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:13,440
really have to have credit to Lisa and

2489
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:15,900
Karen for a lot of things where

2490
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:18,060
you know speaking of more speaking of

2491
01:49:18,060 --> 01:49:20,760
dialectical processes you know we have a

2492
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:22,560
very simple writing dialectic on these

2493
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:25,679
papers which is Junior author knows math

2494
01:49:25,679 --> 01:49:27,739
senior authors

2495
01:49:27,739 --> 01:49:30,420
did not specialize in math in their

2496
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:33,000
undergrad or master's degree or key or

2497
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,179
even PhD however good they are with it

2498
01:49:36,179 --> 01:49:37,619
now

2499
01:49:37,619 --> 01:49:40,260
and the result ends up being you know

2500
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:42,119
you're always told to go back and

2501
01:49:42,119 --> 01:49:45,719
explain every single step and of course

2502
01:49:45,719 --> 01:49:49,139
Jordan you know who was here before was

2503
01:49:49,139 --> 01:49:50,580
helping a lot with the writing and the

2504
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:53,400
structuring and the sign posting

2505
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:55,199
and then

2506
01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:57,540
I think the ins the actual Insight that

2507
01:49:57,540 --> 01:49:59,580
you can take one of these sigmoids and

2508
01:49:59,580 --> 01:50:01,739
turn it into a PDF

2509
01:50:01,739 --> 01:50:03,780
I think came after

2510
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:07,199
hammering our heads on some of the

2511
01:50:07,199 --> 01:50:08,639
embodied predictive processing

2512
01:50:08,639 --> 01:50:11,699
literature a bunch of times

2513
01:50:11,699 --> 01:50:13,699
foreign

2514
01:50:13,699 --> 01:50:16,260
it is one of those things that is

2515
01:50:16,260 --> 01:50:19,460
literally embodied

2516
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:21,659
Dean

2517
01:50:21,659 --> 01:50:25,560
yeah I just wanted to get this in I I

2518
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:27,360
What attracted me to the paper in the

2519
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:30,780
first place was was that the Alice case

2520
01:50:30,780 --> 01:50:33,540
descending and the interception what

2521
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:36,179
kept me going back to it was

2522
01:50:36,179 --> 01:50:36,840
um

2523
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:38,820
and we talked about this in the dot zero

2524
01:50:38,820 --> 01:50:40,040
was

2525
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:43,580
wayfinder that rule uh perfect

2526
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:48,179
perspective swaps versus away

2527
01:50:48,179 --> 01:50:50,520
binder when I first started reading this

2528
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:55,460
paper I I saw the metamorphosis from

2529
01:50:55,460 --> 01:51:00,060
identifying a way to find things and now

2530
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:02,219
after having this conversation with you

2531
01:51:02,219 --> 01:51:05,340
today and and Jordan and of course the

2532
01:51:05,340 --> 01:51:09,060
usual suspects it it it's it's clearer

2533
01:51:09,060 --> 01:51:12,300
to me that this paper is trying to play

2534
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:15,260
that role of being

2535
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:17,420
wayfinder

2536
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:22,800
perspective identifier as opposed to we

2537
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:27,300
found the way or this is this is our way

2538
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:30,840
to solve all the world's ills which it

2539
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:32,639
of course I don't think it was ever your

2540
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:35,639
intention but when you pull things that

2541
01:51:35,639 --> 01:51:37,800
are seemingly quite far apart like

2542
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:41,420
allostasis and interception

2543
01:51:41,420 --> 01:51:45,000
I get excited but I I don't as you

2544
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,920
pointed out pump the brake steam don't

2545
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:48,480
get too excited here I mean we're doing

2546
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:54,300
the best we can so on that level uh

2547
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:56,460
my amygdala is still functioning

2548
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:58,880
correctly

2549
01:51:59,639 --> 01:52:01,980
in our closing Thoughts with a driving

2550
01:52:01,980 --> 01:52:03,659
example

2551
01:52:03,659 --> 01:52:06,780
are we accumulating speed or minimizing

2552
01:52:06,780 --> 01:52:10,020
the amount of time or our speed limits

2553
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:13,619
even set as exteriorized

2554
01:52:13,619 --> 01:52:17,159
right norms and stigmergic marks on the

2555
01:52:17,159 --> 01:52:18,119
niche

2556
01:52:18,119 --> 01:52:21,780
such that a variety of cars from a

2557
01:52:21,780 --> 01:52:25,500
sports car to a 18-wheeler can be within

2558
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:28,260
a zone of optimal controllability taking

2559
01:52:28,260 --> 01:52:30,659
into account the presence of crosswalks

2560
01:52:30,659 --> 01:52:34,920
and so on and so alongside as we think

2561
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:36,719
about what we want to explore in the dot

2562
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:40,920
two alongside diving into formalisms

2563
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:43,520
trying to do some

2564
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:47,000
excavation and interception

2565
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,679
on how and where

2566
01:52:49,679 --> 01:52:52,980
the economic optimization as

2567
01:52:52,980 --> 01:52:55,320
maximization

2568
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:59,280
is implicitly used

2569
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:02,940
and where some of these other Notions

2570
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:06,420
that were being raised

2571
01:53:06,420 --> 01:53:10,080
without needing to be polemical or

2572
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:14,340
replace value maximization

2573
01:53:14,340 --> 01:53:17,760
but where we can see

2574
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:19,880
these other

2575
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:23,100
survivability Criterion

2576
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:25,440
as potentially different decompositions

2577
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:27,840
of unified objective functions that are

2578
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:29,460
informational and so on

2579
01:53:29,460 --> 01:53:30,840
I think that's going to be quite

2580
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:32,699
far-ranging

2581
01:53:32,699 --> 01:53:34,860
because there's more situations I would

2582
01:53:34,860 --> 01:53:37,320
venture where we would rather have

2583
01:53:37,320 --> 01:53:42,060
controllability and expectation bounding

2584
01:53:42,060 --> 01:53:43,619
and meeting

2585
01:53:43,619 --> 01:53:46,920
rather than Point stacking

2586
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:52,040
so final comments you like

2587
01:53:52,739 --> 01:53:55,159
yeah so I just really want to close by

2588
01:53:55,159 --> 01:53:58,800
re-emphasizing that

2589
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:02,580
we don't you know we're not

2590
01:54:02,580 --> 01:54:05,340
I think I have this joke on my Twitter

2591
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:08,820
profile abolish the value function and

2592
01:54:08,820 --> 01:54:10,500
that's really just a pun for the people

2593
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:13,800
who can get it but you know we're not

2594
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:16,739
trying to tell people contrary to their

2595
01:54:16,739 --> 01:54:18,659
subjective experience oh you don't

2596
01:54:18,659 --> 01:54:19,860
really have

2597
01:54:19,860 --> 01:54:23,639
you know value in your brain there's

2598
01:54:23,639 --> 01:54:25,739
actually just you know trying to track

2599
01:54:25,739 --> 01:54:28,020
your reference trajectory

2600
01:54:28,020 --> 01:54:31,500
so in the 0.2 we can talk about you know

2601
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:35,179
which specific kinds of feedback control

2602
01:54:35,179 --> 01:54:38,340
what kinds of feedback mechanisms are

2603
01:54:38,340 --> 01:54:41,460
really being spoken of in this paper

2604
01:54:41,460 --> 01:54:45,920
and I think as

2605
01:54:46,020 --> 01:54:48,420
you know preview it's negative both

2606
01:54:48,420 --> 01:54:49,980
negative in the sense of avoiding

2607
01:54:49,980 --> 01:54:52,020
negative reinforcement and in the sense

2608
01:54:52,020 --> 01:54:55,560
of trying to flatten out a response

2609
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:58,080
function and be able to proportionally

2610
01:54:58,080 --> 01:54:59,880
respond

2611
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:02,880
so you know with the benefit of

2612
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:04,139
hindsight

2613
01:55:04,139 --> 01:55:06,060
this paper is going to have a pretty

2614
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:10,520
limited you know domain of application

2615
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:13,739
but it's helpful in that it gives us a

2616
01:55:13,739 --> 01:55:15,960
language to turn around to the ex to the

2617
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:19,260
empiricists and say this is what we want

2618
01:55:19,260 --> 01:55:22,400
to actually look for

2619
01:55:25,199 --> 01:55:27,659
any closing comments otherwise that's a

2620
01:55:27,659 --> 01:55:29,960
great note

2621
01:55:30,060 --> 01:55:33,119
well Eli and Jordan as well thanks for

2622
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:36,060
coming out and for engaging in dot

2623
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:39,960
Winery and we'll see you next week

2624
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:44,179
thanks guys see you next week
