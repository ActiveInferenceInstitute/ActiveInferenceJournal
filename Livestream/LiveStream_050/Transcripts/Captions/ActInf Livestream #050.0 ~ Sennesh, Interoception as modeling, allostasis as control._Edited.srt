00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:28,294
DANIEL FRIEDMAN: All right.

2
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:29,229
Welcome to

3
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:31,531
active live stream number 50.0.

4
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:35,101
It is October 17th, 2022,

5
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,437
and we are starting the series

6
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:38,671
on “Interoception 

7
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:41,041
as modeling, Allostasis as control.”

8
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:43,343
Welcome to the Active Inference

9
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:44,411
Institute.

10
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,546
We're a participatory online institute

11
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,747
that is communicating,

12
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,082
learning and practicing

13
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,151
applied active inference.

14
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,052
This is recorded

15
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,186
and an archived livestream,

16
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,021
so please provide us with feedback

17
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:57,023
so we can improve our work.

18
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:57,857
All backgrounds

19
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:59,192
and perspectives are welcome

20
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:00,627
and we'll be following

21
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:03,363
video etiquette for livestreams.

22
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:05,432
Today in 50.0.

23
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,300
We're starting this series

24
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,269
discussing the paper “Interoception

25
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,538
as modeling, Allostasis as control”

26
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,506
The authors are Eli

27
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,275
Sennesh, Jordan Theriault, 

28
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,877
Dana Brooks,  Jan-Willem van de

29
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:18,578
 Meent, 

30
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,779
Lisa Feldman Barrett,

31
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,781
and Karen S Quigley.

32
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:22,582
It is a paper

33
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,216
published

34
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,485
in the journal Biological Psychology

35
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:28,288
in January of 2022.

36
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,423
And this is just an introduction

37
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:34,294
and context video as Dean here and I

38
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:35,862
work through this

39
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:38,364
paper and discuss some related topics.

40
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:39,966
We're going to

41
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:42,302
go over some big questions.

42
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,170
Basic aims and abstract

43
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,772
roadmap of the paper.

44
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,941
Then go into the paper,

45
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,375
touch on a few key points

46
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,277
and images and themes.

47
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,012
And then primarily

48
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:53,513
look forward

49
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:54,414
to discussing it

50
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:55,849
with any authors

51
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,649
or anyone else

52
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:59,018
who'd like to join in the coming weeks.

53
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:00,153
All right.

54
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,454
So I'm Daniel.

55
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,423
I'm a researcher in California,

56
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:06,092
and the paper was selected

57
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,862
by decentralized upvote.

58
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,931
It was fun to read

59
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,933
and it brings some new topics

60
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,035
into our regime of attention.

61
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,904
So I'm looking forward to this

62
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,240
and I'll pass to Dean.

63
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,574
>>>DEAN: Actually, I'm. I'm Dean.

64
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,910
I'm here in Calgary.

65
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,411
I think what's interesting about

66
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,045
any paper

67
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:29,415
that calls to seemingly discrete

68
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,619
things and put some proximal and

69
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:33,620
gets them entangling

70
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:36,589
and then pulls them apart again

71
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,224
and tries to look at

72
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,492
sort of what

73
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,194
happens when things get combined

74
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:41,628
is always

75
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:42,795
something that I'm always

76
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:43,596
interested in that

77
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,465
in fact it is the title of this

78
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:45,899
and the fact

79
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,367
that they were bringing out a Stacy's

80
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,068
intersection together.

81
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,004
And what does that mean?

82
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,272
Was the reason why

83
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,240
I spent a lot of time on this.

84
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,475
And really,

85
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:56,609
I'm quite interested in hearing

86
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,211
what the authors have to say

87
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,280
now that they put this idea to

88
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:04,050
to work.

89
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,517
All right.

90
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:08,221
How would you describe the big question?

91
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,223
Well, I mean,

92
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:11,491
I think the focus here is on

93
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:12,725
on what happens

94
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,160
and what we can say about

95
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,261
control requires

96
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,329
necessary to carry out

97
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,665
physiological tasks, varying

98
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,801
degrees of complexity.

99
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,871
I've never been really sure

100
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,606
how the specificity

101
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:29,275
of different outcomes and behaviors

102
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,177
looks in aggregate,

103
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,279
but I think one of the things that

104
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,347
we can say is

105
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,115
if there is a predictive component

106
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,384
and there's a feedback component,

107
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,386
and they're focusing on two particular

108
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,521
types of that,

109
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,557
it's interesting, perhaps

110
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,692
what kind of generalities

111
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,061
we can walk away with

112
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:49,262
never,

113
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:49,762
you know, sort of

114
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,031
not getting lost in the weeds

115
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,066
of, well, this happened here

116
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,300
and then that happened there.

117
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,935
But just on that general level,

118
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,337
what what sorts of things,

119
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,806
when those two things are put together,

120
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,841
should we say has

121
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,977
a certain pattern or commonality?

122
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,146
Nice. I agree.

123
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:09,082
I would put it in the category

124
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,016
of asking

125
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,952
how a given system, independent

126
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,755
or modality independent phenomena

127
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,257
like our status,

128
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,759
which is anticipatory changes

129
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,427
in physiology,

130
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,763
connects with a domain or a use case

131
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,298
like interception.

132
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,366
And it does

133
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,634
seem like a lot of the models

134
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,703
that we've explored have been visual

135
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:33,273
or conceptual or symbolic,

136
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,376
and the intercept of modality

137
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,078
has popped up again and again

138
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,013
in discussions.

139
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,949
And so this is a cool opportunity to

140
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,853
look at some formalism for intersection.

141
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:51,090
Okay, here's the paper

142
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,825
as described earlier,

143
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,127
just a few of the highlights

144
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:54,894
that were written

145
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:58,097
by the authors on the publication page.

146
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,366
Interception enables

147
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:00,867
the brain

148
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,435
to anticipate the body's

149
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,671
upcoming metabolic needs.

150
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:05,972
Interception provides

151
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,206
performance metrics

152
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,342
for visceral motor regulation.

153
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:10,743
We connect

154
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:11,477
control theory

155
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,045
with decision

156
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,113
making and motor control of the body.

157
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,016
We model our static control

158
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,584
as optimal control

159
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,621
with the time varying reference signal.

160
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,724
They talk about some

161
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,193
limitations of previous models

162
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,963
and some unique aspects of what

163
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,398
their model does

164
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,767
and the way that they formulate

165
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:38,504
the APC model.

166
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,839
Anything to add?

167
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:41,040
Well,

168
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,509
I think their answer is straightforward.

169
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:44,777
Okay. On claims.

170
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:49,382
So Dean and I were looking into.

171
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:50,383
Just.

172
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,353
Thinking of ourselves

173
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:54,687
in terms of claims

174
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,823
adjusters, appraisers, examiners

175
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:57,924
and investigators

176
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,260
as we

177
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,863
pulled out a whole handful

178
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,699
of really important and salient

179
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,803
within the arguments of this

180
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,439
relatively long

181
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,842
and technically scaffolded paper

182
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:19,312
and pulling out a bunch of claims

183
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,348
that are written that connect the dots

184
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,318
and set some of the relevant

185
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,287
interpretations for the formalism.

186
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,858
Do you want to highlight any of them or.

187
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,093
It's fine to just have them

188
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:34,994
for anyone who wants to.

189
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:35,528
Yeah, I'm not going to

190
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,864
I'm not going to read of this.

191
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,600
But I will say this here.

192
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,701
There is a

193
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:42,602
I think a parallel

194
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:45,004
trying to be drawn here between

195
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:48,941
predictive or predictive processing.

196
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,510
I'm not saying

197
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,677
that predictive processing,

198
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,379
but processing as a

199
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:56,516
as a predictive device and feelings

200
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,986
and control and feedback.

201
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,854
And so I think

202
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,289
there are a lot of claims

203
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,158
that can be made.

204
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,194
But that's a really, really nuanced and

205
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:11,230
also a very, very complex

206
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,100
space to play in.

207
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,536
And so I can understand why

208
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,172
there's lots and lots of claims.

209
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,575
Again, whether or not or how far

210
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,610
those claims can hold

211
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,412
before they break down

212
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,547
will be an interesting

213
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:31,384
thing to talk to with the authors.

214
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,085
Yeah, well said.

215
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,154
It's a very intertwined area.

216
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,255
Maybe that's what you're

217
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:37,657
pointing towards when you say

218
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,992
complex braiding.

219
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,694
Yeah, I. Mean, a lot of hair.

220
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,130
So it's it's tricky for me.

221
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,465
All right.

222
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,366
Abstract.

223
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,035
Okay.

224
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,370
I'll read the first three.

225
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,839
The brain regulates the body

226
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,941
by anticipating its needs and attempting

227
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,676
to meet them before they arise.

228
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,512
A process called Alices

229
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,147
Alice Stages requires

230
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,049
a model of the changing sensory

231
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,350
conditions within the body,

232
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,586
a process called interception.

233
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:07,320
In this paper,

234
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,021
we examined how interception

235
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:09,722
may provide

236
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,124
performance feedback for Alice stresses.

237
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,260
We suggest

238
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,561
studying ALICE status

239
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,363
in terms of control theory,

240
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:18,331
reviewing control

241
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,533
theories, applications to related issues

242
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,368
in physiology, motor control and

243
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:23,503
decision making.

244
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,572
We synthesize these by relating them

245
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:27,874
to the important properties of ALICE

246
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:31,010
static regulation as a control problem.

247
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,212
We then sketch a novel formalism

248
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:33,813
for how the brain

249
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:34,580
might performing

250
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,949
a static control of the viscera

251
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,353
by analogy to scales or motor control,

252
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,555
including a mathematical view

253
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,423
of intercept, acts

254
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,192
as a performance feedback

255
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,527
for Alice thesis.

256
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,895
Finally, we suggest ways

257
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,898
to test implications of our hypothesis.

258
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,402
Onto the roadmap.

259
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:59,405
The paper starts with introduction.

260
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:00,740
The function

261
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,442
of the brain in the body

262
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:06,078
and then introduces some of the key

263
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,615
pillars or foundations of their

264
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,585
synthesis and interpretation,

265
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,554
which is intersection

266
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,389
control theory as an approach

267
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,291
for unifying physiology,

268
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,493
motor control, decision making.

269
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,995
And Alice stresses as a trajectory

270
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,798
tracking stochastic optimal control.

271
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,368
The fifth section is a discussion

272
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,938
and then there's an appendix B and C

273
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,974
and in their words, four sections

274
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:35,541
in this paper

275
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,542
connected to the reception

276
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:37,810
to ALICE Status.

277
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,178
Section two establishes

278
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,880
how interception enables the brain

279
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,581
to estimate

280
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,716
the physiological efficiency of the body

281
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:44,984
in the present moment,

282
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,419
which is precisely what it needs

283
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,888
to know to evaluate and refine action.

284
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,991
Section three Introduces Control Theory.

285
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,125
Section four applies

286
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,061
the principles of Control Theory

287
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,296
to derive a novel format model

288
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:57,930
of how the brain

289
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,798
might estimate

290
00:09:58,798 --> 00:09:59,699
the desirability

291
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,634
of physiological trajectories

292
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:02,768
and make prospective

293
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,403
regulatory decisions.

294
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,672
Finally, Section five synthesizes

295
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,040
the previous three sections

296
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,209
to explore the direct implications

297
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,011
of the proposed formalism.

298
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,112
Appendix eight provides

299
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,013
a glossary of terms,

300
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:14,947
but this is moved up

301
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,682
and it's no longer an appendix.

302
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,451
So there's no appendix de.

303
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,785
Appendix B one provides

304
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:20,953
mathematical details

305
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,922
related to Section three, and Appendix

306
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,057
C one provides mathematical details

307
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,928
related to Section four.

308
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,697
The keywords were

309
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,132
interception

310
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,301
analysis and predictive processing.

311
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:36,969
We're going to talk

312
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,438
a lot about interception and our status

313
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,807
somewhat in this thought zero,

314
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,143
but certainly in the coming discussions

315
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,178
and for predictive processing

316
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:50,116
a good recent stream is live

317
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,818
stream number 43 with Maria.

318
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:54,954
Okay.

319
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,522
Also just for reference,

320
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:57,657
will pause on these

321
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,191
just long enough for you

322
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,260
to screenshot them if you want.

323
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,263
There's a nomenclature table

324
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,432
with the definition of many words.

325
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,201
So here's the first nomenclature terms

326
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:13,472
one through 25,

327
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:14,840
and then here's the second

328
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,977
half of the normal feature, 26 to 49

329
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,150
sorted alphabetically.

330
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,419
Anything to add on the nomenclature

331
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,487
other than to say that

332
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,489
it's good that they provided it

333
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,023
and it will be

334
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,659
used in the coming sections?

335
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,062
Well, I think it's interesting

336
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,064
that you pointed out that the they

337
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,499
they pulled the definitions forward.

338
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:44,036
And then you look at the formulas.

339
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,838
And so I think from the standpoint

340
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:46,806
of what they want,

341
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:50,342
they want a message around this

342
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,978
is braiding

343
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,448
requires us to at least

344
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:59,285
get a common sense around

345
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,887
what things mean before we start

346
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,858
trying to pull apart what they equal.

347
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:09,261
So yeah, I kind of kind of like that.

348
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:10,930
Well said.

349
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:11,831
All right.

350
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:12,932
Section one,

351
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:13,566
introduction

352
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,235
the functions of the brain in the body.

353
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,203
Okay.

354
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,106
There's an evocative beginning

355
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:23,109
to this paper.

356
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,044
Playing a simple game of dodgeball,

357
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,612
then requires your brain

358
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:27,913
to continually coordinate

359
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,349
the systems of your body.

360
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,185
And this motif of dodgeball

361
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:36,388
is going to be returning again.

362
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:40,493
And on the left is a hugging face

363
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,828
implement tation of a stable

364
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,663
diffusion algorithm.

365
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,266
The prompt of the image was dodgeball,

366
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,334
playful ants,

367
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:51,570
active inference, free energy principle.

368
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,672
And while we were making the slides,

369
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,408
we were engaged in active inference

370
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,410
with some of these image generating

371
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,480
affordances and allowing that to

372
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,652
do what?

373
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:06,986
Well, I think

374
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,354
it's really interesting that this

375
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,289
what the what the generator said

376
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,158
this would be the result

377
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,693
of a coordinated

378
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,197
what's the word I'm looking for

379
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,933
entanglement of these are these prompts

380
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,469
to generate how can you think about what

381
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,537
what strategy

382
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,338
each one of those

383
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,808
silhouettes is now employed?

384
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,142
And I think that

385
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:31,977
there is an implied sense

386
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,013
that there's a strategy going on

387
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:34,547
as well.

388
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,950
So, again, when you bring some of these

389
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,619
really interesting things together,

390
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,455
I guess it depends on how deep

391
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:43,989
you want to go,

392
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:44,924
how much you want

393
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,193
to dimensionalize the space.

394
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,495
So what is that right there?

395
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,130
Yeah, this is the same prompt.

396
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,464
This was just another one.

397
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,434
This one's a little more photorealistic,

398
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:56,802
a little bit more like

399
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,772
elusive, you know?

400
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,640
Are they playing dodgeball?

401
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,341
Yeah.

402
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,979
Or are they adjusting for.

403
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:07,713
All right,

404
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:08,948
next keyword,

405
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,015
you can go for it

406
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:10,583
if you just

407
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,851
people can read the definition here,

408
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,285
but just give your own take.

409
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,321
What is interception?

410
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,523
Well, I think the thought that

411
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,390
at the end of the day,

412
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,558
there's there's a certain

413
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:20,326
amount of

414
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,260
signaling

415
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,394
signaling going on

416
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,230
that we become aware of.

417
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,764
Sometimes young people

418
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,733
or all people might

419
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:28,868
sort of categorize them all

420
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,370
under the umbrella of feelings.

421
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,338
And

422
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,174
I've got this from tots on target

423
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,842
just because I always worked

424
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,577
in that kind of space of

425
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,980
how do we keep this as simple as we can?

426
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,883
And so when you get these signals,

427
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,984
these sensory signals

428
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,086
originate from within the body,

429
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,622
these are the feelings you get.

430
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:50,289
And

431
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,725
whether or not you connect

432
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:57,296
them to the world outside of your skin

433
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,732
or your margins,

434
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,034
sometimes you do, sometimes you don't.

435
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,702
You just wake up with a tummy ache.

436
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:04,103
Right.

437
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:08,941
So what does that mean about today?

438
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:09,808
Ice,

439
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,411
I would say a little narrowly

440
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:16,015
interception is referring to some

441
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,284
observation and inference

442
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,319
on hidden states

443
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,488
with a referent that's inteiro

444
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,189
inside of the body

445
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,759
as opposed to zero outside of the body.

446
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:27,626
But there's probably

447
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,161
also a lot of like blurring.

448
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,096
And what is the retina really doing?

449
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,332
Is it doing inference on itself

450
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,168
and where is it actually doing inference

451
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:39,004
on the outside world structure?

452
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,907
Right. Intercept of internal models.

453
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,877
You added some images. So what are they?

454
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:45,511
Yeah.

455
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,746
So I'll just read this real quick.

456
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:48,314
Psychologists

457
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,281
refer to the trend of thought,

458
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,283
including interception by many terms.

459
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,218
I think I think that's important

460
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:53,953
because there hasn't

461
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,421
always been agreement

462
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:58,724
about clearly defining what

463
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,459
an internal model is

464
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,162
thinks like unconscious inference

465
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,331
seems to fit into this realm of embodied

466
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,733
simulation concepts and categories.

467
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:08,901
Controlled hallucination,

468
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,202
which was new to me

469
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,203
because I don't know what

470
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,871
that even means.

471
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,306
And regardless of what it's called,

472
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,208
the author says to construct

473
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,410
a dynamic model of its body

474
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,411
in the world in shape,

475
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,246
we use the terms prediction,

476
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,681
simulation, concept.

477
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:27,486
And so for somebody with sort of my deep

478
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,587
research background

479
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:32,391
in terms of abduction to signal

480
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:35,461
interpreted the object,

481
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,896
what is that model of how do we

482
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,533
how do we avoid getting into another

483
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:42,334
great debate

484
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,736
about whether that's

485
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,371
representational and content

486
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,039
filled or not?

487
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,808
Or is there something that

488
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:54,913
we sense from the inside every day,

489
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,382
every single time

490
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,618
data is coming at us and being poured

491
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,255
onto our different sensory surfaces,

492
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:06,759
exterior, external from the outside,

493
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:08,761
I think that there's a

494
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,262
piece that comes from the outside.

495
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,697
I know when the temperature

496
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,931
goes up in the room,

497
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:13,599
but my temperature

498
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,566
might also be going up

499
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,869
because a too bad shrimp

500
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,137
and it's sometimes difficult

501
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,972
to figure out whether or not it's

502
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,607
because the heat gone up

503
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,509
or whether my body's

504
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,478
responding with an inflammatory

505
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:27,546
gesture.

506
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,283
Yeah, that's a

507
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:31,984
nice point.

508
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,219
Like sometimes called difference

509
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,487
making cause or difference

510
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,889
that makes a difference.

511
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,424
Does a viral infection

512
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,060
cause the body temperature to rise

513
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,961
and or to what extent cannot

514
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,263
be decomposed

515
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,565
into factors from the virus versus

516
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,599
the dynamics

517
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,701
changing of the immune system.

518
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,005
So in

519
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,774
the image on the left nose, I can know,

520
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:56,675
I can't tell

521
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:59,044
whether the image on the left

522
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,312
by the image on the left,

523
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,214
what's what speed

524
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,215
the image on the right

525
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,451
is actually moving down the road.

526
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,352
And that's kind of why I wanted the

527
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,487
ambiguity there

528
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,757
for an intercepted model because,

529
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,393
you know, Damasio talks a lot about like

530
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,796
what can we really describe in perceived

531
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,398
precise terms

532
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,867
and what remains somewhat ambiguous.

533
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,335
And the authors in this paper

534
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,337
talk a little bit about that as well.

535
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:25,904
Yeah,

536
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,673
when the referent is external,

537
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:28,774
it's objective.

538
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,609
Then there's the opportunity

539
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,710
for multiple

540
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,812
external perspectives to align.

541
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,514
Not even saying that's better,

542
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,783
but just the opportunity to do more.

543
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,319
As if the embodied behavior

544
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:44,490
of your physiological set point for some

545
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,760
physiological regulation is changed.

546
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,130
It doesn't have the same opportunity

547
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,731
for external alignment.

548
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:53,432
Again, for better

549
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,101
and for worse, and almost always

550
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:59,805
with difficulty communicating

551
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,908
or sometimes measuring in laboratory

552
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,076
settings as well

553
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,311
and can quote, controlling.

554
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,181
So speaking with authors on this and

555
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,283
why they study this modality

556
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,852
will be interesting.

557
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:14,820
Yeah. All right.

558
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,056
As for the computational or

559
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,126
system independent phenomena

560
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:22,161
that they're going

561
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,163
to be trying to integrate with,

562
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:28,200
our with an interception is our status.

563
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,271
They define this term as alpha

564
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,772
status is to anticipate

565
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,874
changing needs, evaluate priorities

566
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:37,409
and prepare the organism

567
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:38,243
to satisfy them

568
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,112
before they lead to errors,

569
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,147
a process called alpha status.

570
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:42,814
So let's just say

571
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,983
that you have an alpha static model

572
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,985
of the temperature in the room

573
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,420
and the core body

574
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,822
temperature doesn't change.

575
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:51,356
So then

576
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,491
can one look back and say

577
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:53,325
it didn't change

578
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,727
because it was expected to change?

579
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,062
And somebody will just say, well,

580
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:57,963
how do you know it worked?

581
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,398
And because it didn't

582
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:03,302
raise the body temperature.

583
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,336
I focused on the part

584
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,171
that the fact that they describe it

585
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,106
as a three part process.

586
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,175
So me being always talking about

587
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:11,143
what's the minimum here,

588
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,077
what's the minimum here

589
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,979
that we need in order to be able to

590
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:14,580
do this?

591
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,981
I find that really,

592
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,049
really quite interesting.

593
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,651
Why three,

594
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,921
not four or five are breaking it out

595
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,591
into into smaller slices.

596
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:26,491
That's again,

597
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,260
another one of those questions.

598
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,494
I'd like to be able to talk

599
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,530
to the authors about.

600
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:31,830
All right.

601
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,632
Active inference

602
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,501
they wrote

603
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:38,370
before

604
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,872
diving into formal modeling details

605
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:41,139
below

606
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:41,573
which we're going

607
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,308
to get to later in the paper.

608
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,077
It might be helpful to compare

609
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,846
and contrast the approach here APC

610
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,282
with the prominent modeling framework,

611
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,383
active inference,

612
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,252
and we're going to return to

613
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,219
some of these details

614
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:54,686
and I'm sure

615
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,355
have a lot of discussion on it.

616
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,690
But you made a really interesting point

617
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,859
in our preparation

618
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:01,426
about how

619
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,496
they're not treating their model as a

620
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,532
downstream or a corollary of any

621
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:11,103
commitment to a particular physics,

622
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:12,871
which is how we often hear

623
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:13,939
about free energy

624
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,507
principle, basic mechanics,

625
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,844
but rather they're treating

626
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,814
the model as a first order

627
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:23,715
of construction.

628
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:24,950
Anything you want to add on that?

629
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,351
Because I thought that was really like,

630
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,520
help me frame what the paper was about.

631
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,522
You know, that street

632
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:32,658
where I think that the

633
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:33,325
fourth bullet,

634
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,494
unlike most active as far as the lecture

635
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,095
material below, considers

636
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:40,132
an indefinite time or infinite horizon.

637
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,034
Control setting

638
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:42,801
is interesting

639
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,969
because that makes it really,

640
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:44,636
really clear

641
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,105
between what they're talking about

642
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:48,907
and what we often see

643
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,509
in a lot of the representations,

644
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:55,580
which is to 0t12t, whatever,

645
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:56,915
in terms

646
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,083
of being able to figure out

647
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,118
what is going on sequentially.

648
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:00,952
So.

649
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,256
Right, cool.

650
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,325
This section in the introduction

651
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:06,692
talks

652
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,994
about some issues with other models.

653
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,331
They talk about how existing

654
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,733
models of intersection

655
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,635
have either formulated elasticity

656
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,037
as a prospective decision making problem

657
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:20,605
without considering

658
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,240
how these decisions are enacted,

659
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,874
which has a bunch

660
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,543
of different interpretations,

661
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:25,744
but maybe, for example,

662
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:28,380
requiring the enumeration of policies

663
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,982
and then the selection from policies

664
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,052
or as a motor control problem

665
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,220
without considering

666
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,421
where motor commands come from.

667
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,091
Another issue they

668
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:40,425
have with other models, rather

669
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:41,760
than treat metabolic efficiency

670
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,627
as the objective,

671
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,496
they discuss homeostasis,

672
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:45,831
the regulation of bodily

673
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,299
variables to fix set points

674
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,601
with fixed tolerance for error.

675
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:50,068
So this is

676
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:52,571
really going to be a cool theme which is

677
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:55,006
rather than fixed

678
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,609
the set point in variability,

679
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,745
see that outcome

680
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:03,014
as being due to some other process

681
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:06,752
that does results in an attracting set

682
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,253
or point

683
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:11,423
with a fixed set point and an empirical

684
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,924
tolerance for error

685
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:13,759
as well as maybe

686
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,395
some points of no return and so on.

687
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,130
But seeing all those outcomes

688
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,266
as the realization of a dynamical system

689
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,067
that actually doesn't

690
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,604
pursue a set point, but rather pursues

691
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:29,174
a slope on a graph that we'll explore,

692
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,108
and that like

693
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:32,644
zone of maximum control ability

694
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,780
and reduction of surprises around

695
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,949
the zone of maximum controllability

696
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,818
over evolutionary time

697
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,153
will come to be

698
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,120
associated with this

699
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,522
kind of a survival variable

700
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,324
and some other points.

701
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,627
Okay. Anything else?

702
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:49,561
Well, its relationship,

703
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:50,829
relationship, relationship.

704
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:51,930
And then they say this paper

705
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,698
aims to fill this gap.

706
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,600
I think relation doesn't

707
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,768
necessarily imply

708
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,205
that things have to get

709
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,140
closed in terms of

710
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,376
whatever the gap is

711
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:05,710
by filling something in.

712
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,078
I think I think the fact

713
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,480
that they talk about targeting,

714
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:08,980
I think

715
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,581
the fact that

716
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,684
they see relationship as playing

717
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,152
kind of the key

718
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:14,686
role in

719
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:17,189
what they think is happening here

720
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,425
means that that maybe the gap

721
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:22,327
continues.

722
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:22,861
I mean,

723
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,496
they're putting stuff in here

724
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,431
for us to consider and contemplate,

725
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:27,999
but I'm not sure

726
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,668
if we're actually filling a gap

727
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,636
or if we're just sort of understanding

728
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:36,641
what's in the space, right.

729
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:39,711
Section two.

730
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:42,047
So at the beginning of Section two,

731
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:42,581
the top

732
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:44,716
paragraphs,

733
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,485
interception modeling, the body,

734
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,420
estimating insufficiency,

735
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,056
and then the below the fold.

736
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:54,459
Section 2.5, the summary.

737
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:57,095
So both of these

738
00:24:57,095 --> 00:25:03,301
pre and post 22.02.2

739
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:07,806
contains a lot of structural information

740
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:10,008
about the key points in this paper.

741
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,978
Anything to add on this specific

742
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:13,545
slide two

743
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:14,279
or we'll just go on

744
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,080
through the section, just.

745
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,413
A quick

746
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,482
start down at the very bottom there.

747
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:19,217
People might want to have a read on that

748
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:20,485
because I think that's

749
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:21,286
not saying

750
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,255
that that's controversial,

751
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,023
but I do think it's interesting.

752
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,359
Yeah.

753
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,627
That the

754
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:29,995
the movement towards the responsive

755
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,296
range of a capacity curve

756
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,731
could be potentially

757
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:33,698
obviating the need

758
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,368
for a dedicated neural circuit or module

759
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,702
that specifically calculates

760
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,237
the behavioral constructs

761
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:41,072
of reward and cost.

762
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:44,309
So what does it mean to move into a

763
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:48,280
non reward centric

764
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,682
understanding of physiology

765
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,518
or reinterpreting reward?

766
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:56,521
K Section 2.1 introduces a distinction

767
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,424
that is going to be key

768
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,092
in the rest of the paper,

769
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:01,860
which is the difference

770
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,095
between two types of visceral

771
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,932
sensory variables. Intercept

772
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:07,966
those which represent

773
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:09,668
quantities of resources,

774
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:10,835
regulated resources,

775
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,971
and those which represents rates

776
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:13,772
which processes

777
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:16,675
act controlled processes.

778
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,810
Regulated resources are kept stable,

779
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,312
relatively stable over time.

780
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:21,513
Examples include blood

781
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,848
glucose and core body temperature.

782
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,383
So of note is

783
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:26,751
they don't have to be a deplete

784
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,920
of all resource.

785
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,422
The regulated resource is kind of

786
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,690
like the bounded

787
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,658
variable in a physiology

788
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:35,260
in a homeostasis context.

789
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,261
It's not necessarily

790
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,564
a deplete of all like metabolite

791
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,766
regulated resources, like blood glucose

792
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,702
or core body temperature

793
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,236
represents a physical quantity

794
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:46,438
or substance like glucose.

795
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,072
Its quantity

796
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,007
cannot change instantaneously.

797
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,042
So I think it will be interesting

798
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:51,776
to ask like

799
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,846
what different

800
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:57,449
regulatory sources

801
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,618
I of different modalities are

802
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,721
and then controlled processes

803
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:03,488
are the rates

804
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:03,788
at which

805
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,624
physiological processes operate.

806
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,925
So in that case would be like

807
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:07,592
the kind of input

808
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:09,694
output relationships of blood glucose.

809
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:11,730
Okay.

810
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,131
Yeah, we just talk about that.

811
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:13,832
We talked about that

812
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,300
recently is what's the difference

813
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,168
between gripper and grip

814
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,904
and can both exist at once.

815
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:20,672
Nice

816
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:22,007
to point

817
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,409
you back to the dodgeball example.

818
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:25,377
The heart rate

819
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,045
and the blood pressure must increase

820
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,047
during aerobic exercise.

821
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,950
As noted in the dodgeball example.

822
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,652
So there has to be

823
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,321
some physiological adaptation

824
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,722
in order to start

825
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:41,526
exercising and continue exercising

826
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:42,927
upon resting conditions.

827
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:43,895
The barer receptors

828
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,263
that's pressure

829
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:46,598
receptor heart rate

830
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,466
reflex would normally counter

831
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:49,801
any rise in blood pressure

832
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,536
by slowing the heartbeat.

833
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:52,737
However, with exertion,

834
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,372
your blood pressure and heart rate

835
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:55,740
both must increase to support

836
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,474
the needed increase

837
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:56,975
in blood flow

838
00:27:56,975 --> 00:28:00,745
required by your exercising muscles.

839
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:02,547
And so then there's a discussion

840
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:06,451
of how this kind of modulation of reflex

841
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:09,020
allows for

842
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,355
the shifting of an entire function

843
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,090
relating a change in blood

844
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,892
pressure to a change in your heart rate.

845
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,795
So this is describing

846
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:17,162
like a

847
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,430
dynamical systems

848
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,665
approach and physiological model

849
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,902
for how the causal

850
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,236
or correlational structure

851
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,272
of different physiological

852
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,241
variables can be models

853
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:31,810
pretty generally,

854
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,746
but it's going to get more specific.

855
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,248
Now, a little a little bit of variation

856
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,516
there and

857
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,986
and physiology and where we go.

858
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,788
To point to predicting and modeling

859
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:44,856
the ranges of regulated

860
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:47,225
and controlled processes.

861
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,126
This is describing

862
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:52,597
some of the parameters of the curve,

863
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,133
the threshold and saturation points,

864
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,534
which partly

865
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:57,268
define curves

866
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:59,304
that are derived from functions

867
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:00,238
which physiologists

868
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,339
commonly used to model.

869
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:02,841
The connection between perturbations

870
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,642
and regulatory responses

871
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:05,677
usually naming them

872
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,812
response curves or transfer functions.

873
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:11,649
And then the term capacity curves

874
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,051
will be used to emphasize

875
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,219
the fact that while such curves

876
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,087
can shift over time

877
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,055
in any one instant,

878
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,356
they represent the current range

879
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:18,857
of limited

880
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:19,991
regulatory resources

881
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:22,227
available to an organism.

882
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,362
So one could imagine, like a financial

883
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,966
capacity curve to maintain some

884
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:29,868
market

885
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:30,735
at some point,

886
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:32,837
like kind of like the depth,

887
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,073
but by analogy.

888
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,209
And then this

889
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:40,712
idea of modeling

890
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,781
how a system responds to perturbations

891
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,517
doesn't necessarily require

892
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,152
modeling the internal model

893
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:49,053
of that system.

894
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:50,822
But as you build a better

895
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,123
generative model

896
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,792
of the system, being perturbed,

897
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,059
then the better experiments

898
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,629
and the further you can

899
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,664
have kind of perturbed ability

900
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:00,732
of the system,

901
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,333
it allows you to approach a system

902
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,935
without a strong hypothesis

903
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:07,806
about its structure.

904
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,207
The capacity curve in FIG.

905
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:10,441
two point or in FIG.

906
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,510
one has the mathematical form,

907
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,946
and then Fig.

908
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,481
one is shown alongside

909
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:20,185
with equation one.

910
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,619
The parameters are defined.

911
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,655
The function Y is

912
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:27,058
taking in you view K, big R, big B,

913
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:32,430
and combining those into an equation.

914
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,799
The figure one on the x axis

915
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,801
is showing the blood pressure

916
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,570
and then the y axis is showing

917
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,672
the baseline activation percentage

918
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,140
of the reflects

919
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,342
modulating this physiological variable.

920
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:46,978
So at 100, which is the target

921
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,146
blood pressure

922
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:48,847
or sort of

923
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:49,714
what would be called

924
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,649
the homeostatic set point

925
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:53,284
because it seems to be an attractor

926
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,520
at that point.

927
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,588
The baseline

928
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:57,956
activation of the barrel

929
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,657
reflex is happening

930
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:02,093
when the blood pressure increases,

931
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:03,561
then the bell reflex

932
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:04,295
activates up

933
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:05,463
to two x

934
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:06,598
thresholding at two x

935
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,266
activation of baseline.

936
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:09,601
And then as the blood pressure

937
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,070
decreases, the beryl reflex, again

938
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:18,076
with this sigmoid symmetry decreases.

939
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:21,846
That's a dynamical model of regulation,

940
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:24,015
of blood pressure

941
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,052
equations

942
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:31,856
two, three and four

943
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,925
outline the form of a generative model

944
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:34,525
a procedure

945
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:35,560
for probabilistically

946
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,961
predicting observed variables.

947
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:39,430
In terms of unobserved variables,

948
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,665
the variables listed

949
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,033
are unobserved variables

950
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:42,867
which are sampled

951
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,736
from an a primary probability

952
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,772
distribution, not dependent on data.

953
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:49,774
So that's referring to using

954
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,409
generative model

955
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,045
and how these equations constituted.

956
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,214
The proposal here has an unusual feature

957
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,315
the equations for X,

958
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:58,750
the mean arterial blood pressure

959
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,052
and Y, the bearer reflex activation

960
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,420
as a percentage of baseline.

961
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,923
So figure one x and y

962
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:05,189
are in

963
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:07,692
terms of the quantile variable you

964
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,360
the quantile variables

965
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,129
uniformly represents

966
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:11,796
the relationship

967
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:12,931
between the blood pressure

968
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,933
and the barrel reflex activation,

969
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,067
irrespective of changes

970
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:16,801
in the capacity

971
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:19,570
curves, operating point view and gain k

972
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,039
the quantile depends

973
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,173
only on the functional form

974
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:23,574
of the capacity curve

975
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,076
and on the parameters.

976
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:26,577
So we'll unpack that

977
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:27,512
a little more technically,

978
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:28,446
but they point to that

979
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:32,550
as a feature of their model.

980
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,018
Here again is FIG.

981
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:36,154
one, a little bigger with more space

982
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,588
to discuss later.

983
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:38,389
And here's Fig.

984
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,425
two, which is the capacity

985
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,059
curve from Fig.

986
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,860
one in blue

987
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,330
with the linear eye's response in orange

988
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,966
around the operating point, the blue

989
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,202
diamond marker.

990
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:51,703
So

991
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,771
one can see this as the

992
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:54,906
maximum positive

993
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,941
slope of this sigmoid curve,

994
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:01,446
and that under the specification

995
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:03,448
that the reflex

996
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:04,549
is going to be activated

997
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,718
in a sigmoid away.

998
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,553
Then, depending on

999
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:09,253
whether one is

1000
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,022
in like a curving up part

1001
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,024
or a curving down part

1002
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,025
or thinks about it

1003
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:16,094
as pursuing the maximum positive slope,

1004
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:19,330
then pursuing that point

1005
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,332
and being rewarded by movements

1006
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,334
towards maximum maneuverability

1007
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,802
and control

1008
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:26,304
would have the equivalent

1009
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:29,607
of pursuing a homeostatic model

1010
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:30,408
where this is like

1011
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,877
a fixed point attractor.

1012
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:34,579
So it puts the kind of bottom

1013
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:35,847
of the ball

1014
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,815
in this orange line

1015
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,084
being maximized in slope

1016
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:42,787
rather than the blue diamond

1017
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:45,957
being reduced in its distance from 100

1018
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,528
right.

1019
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:54,399
I think we copied this

1020
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:56,901
section twice.

1021
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:58,169
It was so unusual.

1022
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,138
We copied it twice. And

1023
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:02,640
now.

1024
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,275
2.3

1025
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:07,578
returned to the dodgeball example

1026
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:10,381
and they're going to widen their scope

1027
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,850
beyond just the barrel reflex

1028
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,352
blood pressure

1029
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,621
to circulating levels of oxygen,

1030
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,723
glucose and carbon dioxide.

1031
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,757
Next, we focus on blood

1032
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,526
glucose as a regulated resource

1033
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,393
with glucagon

1034
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,094
as the controlled

1035
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:25,163
process, enabling secretion of glucose

1036
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:26,197
into the blood

1037
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:26,798
and insulin

1038
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:27,365
as the control

1039
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,332
process, enabling

1040
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,735
removal of glucose from the blood.

1041
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,103
So the barrel reflex

1042
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:34,772
was like a single volume knob

1043
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:35,940
or a triage nurse

1044
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,641
that can lower

1045
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,843
or raise the single response.

1046
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:40,244
So if some physiological variable

1047
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:40,711
is high,

1048
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:43,848
it's like it can be like removed.

1049
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,416
Glucose regulation

1050
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,418
has multiple hormones.

1051
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,820
It's going to be like buffers

1052
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,121
from two different sides

1053
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,222
in a slightly different way,

1054
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,391
but using a lot of the same formalism

1055
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,694
and logic to introduce

1056
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,062
a slightly

1057
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:00,231
different and more complex

1058
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,933
physiological system.

1059
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:06,437
Okay.

1060
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,440
The section discusses some findings

1061
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,741
that blood glucose blood

1062
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:11,709
glucose levels

1063
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:12,877
are not actively defended

1064
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,213
at a biologically hard coded set point.

1065
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,013
Any more than heart

1066
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:18,182
rate is instead glucagon and insulin.

1067
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:19,550
Two hormones

1068
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,586
activity balance each other's effects

1069
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,121
to bring the blood glucose

1070
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,156
to a point within its settling range,

1071
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,792
with glucose entering the blood

1072
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,961
after the person ingest food and glucose

1073
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,262
then crossing from the blood

1074
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:32,430
into other bodily tissues

1075
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,665
to support their function.

1076
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,602
Anything to add on this

1077
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,136
slide?

1078
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,303
Not that specific,

1079
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:39,737
and I'll wait

1080
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,906
till to get to the end of section

1081
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,442
the section two stuff.

1082
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:47,044
So here is figure three.

1083
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:48,179
They're writing FIG.

1084
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,180
three

1085
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:52,150
shows, plots of the resulting functions

1086
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,118
of this equation

1087
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:57,121
applied to the insulin case,

1088
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,055
which can be interpreted

1089
00:35:58,055 --> 00:35:59,157
as capacity curves.

1090
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,826
Orange sigmoid is insulin.

1091
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,328
The blue sigmoid is glucagon.

1092
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:08,132
They have different hormone levels, a

1093
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,667
different x axis,

1094
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,536
which is the level of glucose

1095
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:12,537
in the blood.

1096
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:13,304
And so you kind of see

1097
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:14,338
familiar behavior

1098
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,340
and glucose is high, then

1099
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:21,212
insulin is at high secretion,

1100
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:24,482
which drives the absorption of glucose.

1101
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:26,717
And when glucose gets low

1102
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:27,919
in this case below

1103
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,421
2.5 or three or so, then

1104
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,691
glucagon is secreted to

1105
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:38,462
elicit glucose to enter the blood.

1106
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:41,666
Okay?

1107
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,634
And so one can imagine

1108
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,369
that the glucose level

1109
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,472
will be oscillating in this space,

1110
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:54,445
but not exactly set at a set point

1111
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:58,916
with a residual being minimized.

1112
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:01,352
That section 2.4

1113
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,921
is where they move from discussing

1114
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:07,858
this kind of a regulatory model

1115
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,294
into viable ranges and capacities

1116
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:13,231
could obviate a modular reward system.

1117
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,100
Here's an argument

1118
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,435
or appeal to neuroanatomy.

1119
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,636
There's no single brain site

1120
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,071
that specifically encodes

1121
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:20,871
app additive

1122
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:23,040
or aversive reinforcement value.

1123
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,675
It is useful to reframe

1124
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,310
discrete reward and decision systems

1125
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,545
as domain general

1126
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:30,214
or allosteric static control systems.

1127
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:31,282
The domain generality

1128
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:32,550
of intersection provides

1129
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,485
further theoretical support for the idea

1130
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,654
that we do not need mental modules

1131
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,856
or faculty psychology

1132
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,324
concepts to understand how

1133
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,093
a brain works,

1134
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,294
a mathematically sound

1135
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:45,062
and biologically plausible

1136
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,064
account of our static control

1137
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:48,799
does not require a modular or separate

1138
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:49,567
reward system

1139
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,836
in the central nervous system.

1140
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:54,038
And a bit more on this topic.

1141
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:54,672
Anything to add?

1142
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:58,175
Now let's get to 37.

1143
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:00,144
All right, the rewards of control.

1144
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:00,511
So here

1145
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:01,445
I wanted to highlight

1146
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,581
two papers with some nice images

1147
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,783
by both papers

1148
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,918
involving Tobias NORVILLE.

1149
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:12,089
And these papers are cited in the paper

1150
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:13,591
under discussion,

1151
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:14,625
and they all show

1152
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,227
some pretty interesting features.

1153
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:17,061
So just to highlight

1154
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:20,731
some of these graphs, here's movements

1155
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:24,001
within a glucose and temperature space.

1156
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:25,503
So regulation

1157
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:28,839
of multiple physiological variables

1158
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,374
here on the bottom left

1159
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:31,976
is the integration

1160
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,645
of interception, homeostatic, set point

1161
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:35,479
and motor

1162
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:39,617
commands like related to foraging.

1163
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:42,453
Here is some Bayesian

1164
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,823
visualizations with a prior posture

1165
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,091
and likelihood.

1166
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:48,592
And about this two way

1167
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:50,828
relationship type of inference

1168
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,396
and a forward dynamical model,

1169
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:54,131
the tail of two densities

1170
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,066
and then last one.

1171
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,233
This is

1172
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:58,836
another body temperature, glucose

1173
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:02,206
modeling approach that

1174
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,408
gets to that

1175
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,510
notion that we describe as

1176
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,546
going to the bottom of the ball

1177
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:11,215
where the shape of this

1178
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,418
napkin

1179
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,321
could be designed or evolved or selected

1180
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:19,857
so that the marble spends

1181
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,860
most of its time in a certain zone.

1182
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,527
And this is like

1183
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,462
just one other way

1184
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:25,863
to think about

1185
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,399
these types of attractor systems

1186
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:32,336
rather than as like traces or so on.

1187
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:34,171
Okay, anything to add?

1188
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,407
I think Section two basically confirms

1189
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:37,575
that if you're going to be doing

1190
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,177
any kind of predictive performance

1191
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,381
that has a element of continuity

1192
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,916
to it, that depends on on sort of

1193
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,086
recognizable finite limits

1194
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:51,122
and also variability

1195
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,491
within whatever those limits are.

1196
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:55,993
And I think that

1197
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,629
kind of speaks to the idea that there's

1198
00:39:58,629 --> 00:39:59,196
an in a

1199
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:02,466
in a sort of a two factor situation.

1200
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,602
There's signaling that looks like this.

1201
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:05,803
And they sort of pointed out

1202
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:06,904
a couple of examples

1203
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,739
of the barrel reflex and then

1204
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,908
and the glucagon thing and

1205
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:12,777
they also

1206
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,178
are trying to avoid

1207
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:15,579
oversimplifying or over

1208
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,747
reducing like they

1209
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,983
they tried to keep

1210
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:21,685
the complexity of those two examples

1211
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:23,020
retained in terms

1212
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,156
of what they were trying to hold up, as

1213
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,224
is something that allows us to start

1214
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:31,962
looking at these capacity curves.

1215
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:33,030
All right.

1216
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,199
Section three control theory,

1217
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,035
the unifying lens for physiology, motor

1218
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:40,070
control and decision making.

1219
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,939
And then one of their summaries

1220
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:42,907
of the chapter.

1221
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:44,408
This section

1222
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:45,543
introduces concepts

1223
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:47,711
from engineering control theory,

1224
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,680
then reviews its applications

1225
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,215
in the life sciences.

1226
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:53,617
These include Physiology Section 3.1

1227
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:54,919
Skeletal Motor

1228
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:55,719
Movement, Section

1229
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:58,255
3.2 and Decision Making Section 3.3.

1230
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:00,224
Section 3.4 will connect

1231
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:02,159
future intercept of states

1232
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:02,693
to present

1233
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:03,894
movements illuminating

1234
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:06,130
what makes our static regulation

1235
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,164
more energy efficient

1236
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:09,633
than homeostatic regulation.

1237
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,735
The next section for we'll build off

1238
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:13,003
the account of control

1239
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,071
used in physiology

1240
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:14,905
to suggest

1241
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:17,341
how interception supports our spaces.

1242
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,144
Okay, here, we're not going

1243
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,179
to read everything on the slide,

1244
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,181
but this is from section 3.1

1245
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:26,016
Control Theory for Physiology.

1246
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,917
A reliable

1247
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,152
or reliable body built

1248
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,820
from unreliable parts.

1249
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,223
Anything to add on this note.

1250
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,925
People just want to read this.

1251
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:35,359
Yep.

1252
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,194
I'll just call out for a controller to

1253
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:37,828
perform well.

1254
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,597
It must contain some sort of copy

1255
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:40,831
or mirror of the plant's

1256
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,066
expected behavior,

1257
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:42,700
which is referred

1258
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,768
to as an internal model.

1259
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:46,403
Control theorists call this

1260
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:48,272
the driven system to plant

1261
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:49,840
and its desired trajectory,

1262
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,276
the reference trajectory.

1263
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:53,277
And there's

1264
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:54,712
some interesting discussion

1265
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,614
of this kind of

1266
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,683
thread of control theory.

1267
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,885
Figure four

1268
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,387
So Figure four is a functional block

1269
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:05,789
diagram of model based control system.

1270
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,992
The plant in Orange is the object

1271
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:08,592
or system whose.

1272
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:11,061
Motion or other behavior is controlled.

1273
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:12,229
The controller purple

1274
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:14,098
send signals controls,

1275
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:16,600
solid block arrows, the change

1276
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,168
how the plant moves and signals

1277
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:19,803
the expected outcome predictions

1278
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:21,772
solid yellow arrow to the state

1279
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:24,475
estimate are in yellow and so on.

1280
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:25,976
People can read the rest of it.

1281
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:28,679
For these figures.

1282
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:29,246
Daniel As

1283
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:31,248
we get further down in the slides,

1284
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:32,316
why don't I read

1285
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:34,218
and then you can run the cursor over

1286
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,020
the different parts of the model

1287
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,656
so people can kind of see real time

1288
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:40,391
how the two things like.

1289
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,392
Sounds get will do that

1290
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,826
for the future ones.

1291
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:46,297
And this is going to revoke or recall

1292
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:50,434
some of our earlier discussions

1293
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:53,971
in life frame 23 Skillful Performance

1294
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,774
and Interaction ISM and Obstructionism

1295
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,742
and how to think about motor plants

1296
00:42:58,742 --> 00:42:59,710
and so on.

1297
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:00,811
Right to

1298
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,080
section 3.2,

1299
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,814
moving the body,

1300
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:06,183
the reference control hypothesis.

1301
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:08,385
So the reference control hypothesis,

1302
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,753
the citations provided

1303
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:13,691
were to Feldman 2015 and later 2021

1304
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,960
and the referent control

1305
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,994
hypothesis describes

1306
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,228
the skeletal motor system

1307
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:20,397
in terms of a hierarchy of controllers

1308
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:21,932
with higher level

1309
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,467
controllers in the brain,

1310
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:24,568
prescribing reference

1311
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:26,136
trajectories to the lower level

1312
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:28,172
reflex is in the spinal cord.

1313
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:29,940
These referent reflexes

1314
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,208
then compare the actual length

1315
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:31,809
of the muscle

1316
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:32,443
as signaled

1317
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,445
by afferent proprioceptive neurons

1318
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:35,913
to the reference length

1319
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,081
sent down by the brain.

1320
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:38,282
It contracts the muscle

1321
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,384
to bring the two into agreement.

1322
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:41,352
And so here

1323
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,621
is the top part of the table of content

1324
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,788
of Feldman's

1325
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,656
2015 book

1326
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:46,890
reference Control of Action

1327
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,094
and Perception and the Paper of La

1328
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:53,063
Tosh in Physics of Life Review 2021

1329
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,699
with some graphics around

1330
00:43:56,133 --> 00:44:03,741
this type of approach,

1331
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:05,442
you can start this slide

1332
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:09,213
on the real world.

1333
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:09,880
Okay, well,

1334
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:12,082
I'll just

1335
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:12,983
point out a couple things

1336
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:13,651
the authors say,

1337
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,251
because they

1338
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:16,487
do not want to be accused

1339
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,156
of sort of overfitting your structure.

1340
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:19,723
Motor control

1341
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,291
experiments only limited overlap

1342
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:22,226
with the actual structure

1343
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:23,460
of motor control.

1344
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,797
So only limited overlap

1345
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:28,499
experiment on region

1346
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,000
behaviors involves an experimenter

1347
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,902
described in reaching task

1348
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:32,703
to the participants.

1349
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:33,303
Participants

1350
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:35,039
brain does not function specifically

1351
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:36,974
to follow instructions

1352
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:37,908
from an experimenter,

1353
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:40,511
but rather to regulate their own body.

1354
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,679
The actual

1355
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,113
organization of the central nervous

1356
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:44,915
system occurs better with an inside out

1357
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:47,051
view of motor function.

1358
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:49,420
Women at the body, either somatic

1359
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,221
cell matter

1360
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:51,755
or motor

1361
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:55,092
pathways surge regulation of the body.

1362
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:57,828
For example, in a game of dodgeball, you

1363
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:59,897
if you unexpectedly step on a hard

1364
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:02,700
or shark bark object, you usually don't

1365
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,902
purposely impale yourself

1366
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:05,703
who has stepped on it.

1367
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,471
So I just want to go through my foot now

1368
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:09,273
because my

1369
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:10,340
my focus is still on

1370
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,642
stabilizing my posture.

1371
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:13,744
Rather, you recoil in pain,

1372
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:16,113
you feel that introspectively

1373
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,848
and the unplanned disturbance

1374
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:18,482
of any tissue

1375
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:19,850
damage requires

1376
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,185
you to make a decision

1377
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:22,352
about what to do next.

1378
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:23,554
Excuse yourself

1379
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,155
to nurse your foreplay

1380
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:26,957
through that pain.

1381
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:27,791
I think

1382
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:29,426
the fact that they're trying to limit

1383
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:32,830
what they are saying is the extent

1384
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,566
to which the whole piece of this

1385
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,002
can be said to apply

1386
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:40,337
is a good thing,

1387
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:41,071
because I think there's

1388
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,574
a couple of areas around.

1389
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:46,376
So what is in this relationship

1390
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:48,412
between a command system

1391
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,115
or a control system and a demand system?

1392
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:54,818
Where do things like like when your body

1393
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:57,154
is starting

1394
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:57,654
to suffer

1395
00:45:57,654 --> 00:46:00,657
from mild hypothermia and, you know,

1396
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:01,592
people know that

1397
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,460
that your brain stops

1398
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,263
functioning correctly.

1399
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,265
How do you differentiate between,

1400
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:09,633
for example,

1401
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:11,201
I'm getting a

1402
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:12,002
slurping headache

1403
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:13,237
and you put the Slurpee down

1404
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:14,671
and stop drinking it

1405
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:15,172
because you know

1406
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:17,174
that that's the effect versus

1407
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:19,243
you have your limbs

1408
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:20,577
which aren't,

1409
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:21,945
you know, frostbitten

1410
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,046
at this point early.

1411
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:24,481
Certainly not frostbitten.

1412
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:25,983
Continue to move

1413
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:29,753
so that you don't stop you

1414
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,356
you avoid stopping moving altogether,

1415
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:34,658
which which essentially is death.

1416
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:36,293
So here

1417
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:39,096
we've got to wonder whether or not,

1418
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:41,331
without getting into the argument,

1419
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:42,666
of course, it's pretty obvious

1420
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,635
if your brain is dead, you're dead.

1421
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,903
But if your hands are dead

1422
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:47,638
and you are still alive,

1423
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,705
that clear distinction

1424
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:50,808
between a command center consequence

1425
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,910
and a demand center consequence.

1426
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:55,145
What does that mean in terms of,

1427
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,347
okay, so there's things that happen

1428
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:58,982
that you do automatically

1429
00:46:58,982 --> 00:46:59,449
in order

1430
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:00,651
to keep yourself alive

1431
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,754
in some of the most critical situations.

1432
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:06,156
And it's not like your your your

1433
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:09,326
your hand has the brain.

1434
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:12,462
And yet it may in just simply

1435
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:15,065
moving around beyond a reflexive thing,

1436
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,201
be able to keep you alive long enough

1437
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:18,168
until somebody comes to

1438
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,671
your rescue as a as a, for example.

1439
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:21,839
So I don't know

1440
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,106
if that's confusing or not,

1441
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:24,041
but I think that there's

1442
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,109
a reconciliation

1443
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:28,178
that goes on between command and demand.

1444
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,547
And maybe some of control

1445
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:32,649
is the ability to give up

1446
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:35,385
command at times in order for a new

1447
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,722
a new response to take over

1448
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:39,957
and keep you alive.

1449
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:41,491
And you may not necessarily

1450
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,361
know how to do that from

1451
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,429
a command center.

1452
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:46,830
So we'll have to talk

1453
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:47,798
to the authors about that,

1454
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:49,967
because these are questions that I have,

1455
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,134
because I got a bit

1456
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,803
of a physiological difference.

1457
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:55,405
I wonder about these extreme situations.

1458
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:57,941
All right.

1459
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:01,111
Section 33, making decisions,

1460
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:02,379
constructing future

1461
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,681
reference trajectories.

1462
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:07,050
They use the word demands, so

1463
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,286
we'll talk about it later. Yep.

1464
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:11,221
More quotes from 33

1465
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,590
for those who want to screenshot

1466
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:15,259
talking about Erica, the city,

1467
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:17,227
which is also raised in the Appendix

1468
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,430
B, which we're not going to focus on.

1469
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:20,964
Okay.

1470
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:22,499
You can read figure five

1471
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:24,768
and I'll use the mouse for it.

1472
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:26,737
So a functional block diagram

1473
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:27,804
for an experiment.

1474
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:30,173
Experimental psychologist, task

1475
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:31,942
oriented view of motor control.

1476
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:34,144
The diagram shows a formal logic

1477
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:36,780
structure here at a conceptual up,

1478
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,248
the boxes and arrows

1479
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,050
do not map onto the anatomy

1480
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,251
of a brain or nervous system.

1481
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:41,952
In contrast

1482
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:44,154
to figure for this dagger diagram

1483
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:45,455
differentiates between

1484
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:48,992
skeletal motor brain and peripheral

1485
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,428
stretch reflex controllers

1486
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:54,731
between sensory state, estimated

1487
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:55,933
ears, brain

1488
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,234
and peripheral sense

1489
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,336
organs, sensory surfaces,

1490
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:00,871
sensory surfaces,

1491
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:02,472
the diagram shows

1492
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:04,808
an engineering perspective.

1493
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:05,642
Important to note

1494
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:08,645
that on a psychology experiment

1495
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:11,048
in which the experimenter prescribes

1496
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:13,183
a task for behavior to participants,

1497
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:15,118
so there's an externality

1498
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,520
and a participants brain

1499
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,389
then access control system to achieve

1500
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:20,490
the behave the prescribed

1501
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:21,692
behavior

1502
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:23,260
systems that maintain the body,

1503
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,028
therefore serve systems

1504
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:26,296
that move the body,

1505
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:27,531
which

1506
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:30,567
in turn serve a prescribed behavior.

1507
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:33,003
So again, the focus on the prescriptive,

1508
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:34,504
the externality,

1509
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:37,641
the information coming in.

1510
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:40,410
All right.

1511
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:42,412
Thanks a lot.

1512
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:44,147
Next, one functional block

1513
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,416
diagram for a control theoretic view

1514
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:47,718
about Stacy's.

1515
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:49,319
In contrast to Figure five,

1516
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,722
this diagram shows a closed loop

1517
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:52,956
control system designed

1518
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:54,591
for the autonomous regulation

1519
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:55,592
of the body

1520
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:56,493
and experimenters

1521
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,329
desired task behavior is replaced with

1522
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:00,831
or by sorry,

1523
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,767
the other static capacity estimate,

1524
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:04,634
which sends

1525
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:07,137
predictions of capacity curves

1526
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:08,538
which we've already looked at

1527
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:10,741
to the intercept of state estimated

1528
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,009
and receives

1529
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,210
prediction errors

1530
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,612
with reached updated estimates.

1531
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,714
The updated estimates are issued

1532
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:20,417
as a reference signal

1533
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:22,052
to the disorder motor controller.

1534
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:22,953
This diagram shows

1535
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:25,322
a formal logical structure,

1536
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:27,524
a conceptual loop.

1537
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,693
The hypothesis depicted is constrained

1538
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,228
by the inferred

1539
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:34,164
anatomical structures in Bert 2017,

1540
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:37,200
but the boxes and arrows do not map.

1541
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:40,003
I repeat, do not map 1 to 1

1542
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,204
part of the anatomy of

1543
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,272
the brain or nervous system.

1544
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:47,444
All right, great.

1545
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:48,912
So just to

1546
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:51,014
highlight the difference here,

1547
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:51,915
the left

1548
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:54,017
is almost like an instructional list

1549
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,421
arrangement.

1550
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:57,988
And this is

1551
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:00,090
how the experimental psychologist

1552
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,892
thinks about this task,

1553
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:02,759
which is like

1554
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:03,660
we write down

1555
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:04,561
the instructions,

1556
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,696
the pseudocode for the task,

1557
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:08,765
keep your heart rate within this range.

1558
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:10,500
And then

1559
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,401
there's some decision

1560
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,804
making with the skeletal motor system.

1561
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,840
But they're capable of conscious action

1562
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:22,679
and stretching or more subconscious

1563
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:26,149
and then acting through physiology

1564
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:29,086
in the body or in the external world.

1565
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,823
That intercept of state estimated here

1566
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:35,358
comes into alignment with the desire

1567
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:36,793
and implementation

1568
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:39,162
of the skeletal motor decision.

1569
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:39,963
In contrast,

1570
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:42,165
the role of the task instructions,

1571
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:44,534
so to speak, is substituted

1572
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:47,604
in this control theoretic view

1573
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:48,271
with the

1574
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,040
our static capacity estimate

1575
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,242
or as the imperative,

1576
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:54,711
and that feeds on through a very similar

1577
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:57,647
set on the right side.

1578
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:58,715
But here

1579
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:00,117
we actually have the visceral motor

1580
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,252
decision controller

1581
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:05,322
in in contrast to a skeleton motor

1582
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:06,189
decision controller

1583
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:08,692
because this is more focused on like

1584
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:10,594
choose the left button

1585
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:11,695
or the right button

1586
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:12,996
and figure six

1587
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:13,763
is focused

1588
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:16,766
more on the kind of barrel reflex

1589
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:18,702
control theory view.

1590
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:23,106
But that also generalizes beyond.

1591
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:23,473
Okay,

1592
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,108
I think that's just another review

1593
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:26,476
section for Alice

1594
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,978
thesis as trajectory

1595
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:32,849
tracking stochastic optimal control.

1596
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:34,117
This section will describe

1597
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:36,052
our formal model of allosteric decision

1598
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:36,887
making the

1599
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:40,957
static path integral control APC model

1600
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:44,027
APC has a simple idea at its core,

1601
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,196
just as perceptual concept service

1602
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:47,597
internal models of the body's

1603
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,432
sensory surfaces.

1604
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:50,367
Action concepts

1605
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:51,468
also serve

1606
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:52,402
as internal models

1607
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:53,970
of potential behaviors

1608
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:55,572
and their predicted outcomes.

1609
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,375
Section 4.1

1610
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,944
Drives in SLC

1611
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:02,112
objective function

1612
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:03,213
from the mathematical form

1613
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:03,880
by which section

1614
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,249
two representative capacity curves.

1615
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:06,983
Then Section

1616
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:10,887
4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 are described out.

1617
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:12,956
This APC model, anything to add?

1618
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:15,559
Oh, let's go there.

1619
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:15,859
All right.

1620
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,160
4.1 Transforming

1621
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,295
capacity curves

1622
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:21,097
into objective functions.

1623
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:22,866
Since any given capacity curve,

1624
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:23,967
such as the one in FIG.

1625
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:25,502
one above,

1626
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:27,370
which is a maximum value

1627
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,072
on the vertical axis,

1628
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:31,708
it can be divided by its maximum y value

1629
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,476
to normalize it

1630
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:35,712
to range between zero and one.

1631
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:36,713
Once normalized.

1632
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:37,247
In this way,

1633
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:38,248
it can be interpreted

1634
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:39,816
as a cumulative distribution

1635
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:42,152
function from probability theory.

1636
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:44,521
This is precisely, in fact precisely

1637
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:46,890
what Sreenivasan, Loughlin and Dubs

1638
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,393
did to interpret the firing

1639
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,728
of retinal neurons in flies

1640
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,663
as a form of predictive coding.

1641
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:54,531
See their Fig. one,

1642
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,901
the derivative of the CDF

1643
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,769
cumulative distribution function

1644
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:01,238
yields a probability

1645
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,840
density function pdf,

1646
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:09,813
so the derivative of a CDF gives a pdf.

1647
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:11,147
This is the more familiar way

1648
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:11,781
of representing

1649
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:13,316
a probability distribution

1650
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:13,817
where the height

1651
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:15,051
on the vertical axis

1652
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:17,120
corresponds to likelihood in the PDF.

1653
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:19,389
But for a pdf derived

1654
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:20,390
from a capacity curve,

1655
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:21,591
it represents relative

1656
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,727
responsiveness to perturbation.

1657
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:25,395
We will call such distribution

1658
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:27,197
a reference distribution.

1659
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:29,599
So this is a transformation

1660
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,768
of statistical distributions

1661
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,570
between the PDF,

1662
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:34,804
which is the probability

1663
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:36,172
density function

1664
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:37,540
and CDF cumulative

1665
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,242
distribution function.

1666
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:40,844
It might be very familiar to some,

1667
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:42,879
it might be totally new to some,

1668
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,181
so it's all good.

1669
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:46,316
Hopefully this is useful.

1670
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:47,083
Still

1671
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:48,585
to consider the relationship

1672
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:49,919
between the two.

1673
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:50,954
So here

1674
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,122
on the left of these three

1675
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,124
images, the PDF

1676
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,859
which is the more familiar way

1677
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:56,526
of representing

1678
00:54:56,526 --> 00:54:58,194
a probability distribution

1679
00:54:58,194 --> 00:54:59,162
we would say

1680
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:01,231
this is a uniform distribution.

1681
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:02,432
There's a one in six chance

1682
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:04,434
of getting each outcome from a six

1683
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:05,702
sided die

1684
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:09,239
or in the Gaussian bell curve situation,

1685
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:11,308
which both of these two

1686
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,443
middle and right images show.

1687
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:14,944
The PDF of the bell curve

1688
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:15,812
is the Bell Curve.

1689
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,747
So the PDF is the most familiar one.

1690
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:19,015
The uniform distribution

1691
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:21,151
is like a flat line in the pdf.

1692
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,152
The bell curve is like

1693
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,353
the bell curve in the PDF,

1694
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:25,655
but since you know

1695
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,491
the maximum and minimum values,

1696
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,627
if only asymptotically,

1697
00:55:30,627 --> 00:55:31,828
then you can make

1698
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,563
a cumulative distribution function

1699
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:34,731
which starts basically

1700
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:37,734
as low as the function can go.

1701
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:40,036
The support for that distribution,

1702
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:43,273
and it just accumulates cumulatively.

1703
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,509
So it's useful to answer the question

1704
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:47,811
what is the probability

1705
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:50,947
of getting a four or three or two

1706
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:51,915
or one

1707
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:54,250
that is two thirds

1708
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,553
or what is the probability of getting a

1709
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:58,688
Z score of below two

1710
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:01,424
like two standard deviations positive?

1711
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:05,161
What fraction of the curve is below

1712
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:07,330
that z score on the pdf?

1713
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,432
And that is addressable by quickly.

1714
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:11,735
Just looking up a point on this CDF,

1715
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:14,671
it turns out that that relationship

1716
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:15,939
between the PDF and the CDF,

1717
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:17,474
which is more familiar to again

1718
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:19,142
like rolling a die

1719
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:21,544
or evaluating like height in a classroom

1720
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:25,315
can be used on the capacity

1721
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:27,484
curve discussed earlier

1722
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,552
to move to a distribution

1723
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:32,455
which when maximized, is in this

1724
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:34,090
spot of

1725
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:38,895
maximum control.

1726
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,330
So here the CDF from FIG.

1727
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,665
two gets the derivative

1728
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:45,468
and then it becomes the PDF

1729
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,271
with the sort of negative

1730
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:51,441
curve shape.

1731
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:53,042
And that's kind of

1732
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:54,110
what was being hinted at

1733
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,379
with this orange line being maximized

1734
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:58,548
or his line being maximized

1735
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:01,117
is the high point on this

1736
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:03,086
bell curve like

1737
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,921
but it's not a classical bell curve,

1738
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,090
but it is a mountain.

1739
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:07,891
It's

1740
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:10,126
one peak that you can know

1741
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:11,327
which side you're on

1742
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:12,195
and therefore

1743
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:15,565
pretty easily optimized towards

1744
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:20,103
for analytical convenience.

1745
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:20,403
We take

1746
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:21,871
the practice from Todorov

1747
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:24,007
2006 of using a log density.

1748
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,575
The logarithm of a PDF

1749
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:26,576
as an objective function

1750
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:28,845
rather than the PDF itself.

1751
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:29,779
The operating point

1752
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:30,914
then continues to appear

1753
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:31,881
as local maximum,

1754
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:32,882
while the gain determines

1755
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:33,950
the cost of movement away

1756
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:34,951
from the operating point

1757
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,086
and the value of movement towards it.

1758
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:37,987
Figure eight shows

1759
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:39,722
the objective function log density

1760
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:40,957
corresponding to the original

1761
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,492
barrel reflex capacity curve.

1762
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:43,893
FIG.

1763
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:45,662
nine further clarifies the relationship

1764
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:46,396
between the various

1765
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:47,630
forms of capacity curve

1766
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:48,031
by showing

1767
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,532
all three alongside each other.

1768
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:51,634
So this is a really nice figure

1769
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:52,202
on the top

1770
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:55,238
left of the figure is the figure one

1771
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:56,639
with the reflex

1772
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:57,607
that gets dialed up

1773
00:57:57,607 --> 00:57:58,875
or dialed down

1774
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:02,045
to regulate blood pressure.

1775
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:04,547
That's when interpreted as the CDF

1776
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:08,117
can result in a PDF

1777
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:10,820
and that is a single peak

1778
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,922
that you can maximize.

1779
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,190
Instead of trying to calculate

1780
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:15,325
a residual.

1781
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:17,794
The shape of this curve

1782
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:19,395
becomes slightly nicer

1783
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:22,065
to optimize computationally

1784
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:22,932
when you make it

1785
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:25,668
so that it's like a smoother ball

1786
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,737
rather than this kind of like inverted

1787
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,740
funnel shape, it just

1788
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:33,109
we can go into more detail.

1789
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:34,611
Why? I think that'll be cool.

1790
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:36,779
Why does this log stuff matter

1791
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:37,413
or does it matter?

1792
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:38,781
But suffice to say that

1793
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:40,216
this is the big move

1794
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:40,617
that lets

1795
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:44,220
you turn the sigmoid juggling act

1796
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:47,323
into the mountain, climb

1797
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:50,693
table one

1798
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,762
summarizes some key

1799
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:58,568
table one summarizes some key notations

1800
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:01,304
we do not claim our graphical model

1801
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:02,138
accurately captures

1802
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:03,039
the anatomy of the brain.

1803
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,374
It captures reference

1804
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:05,341
sensory motor control

1805
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:06,576
across a hierarchy of time

1806
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:07,710
scales, a single feature

1807
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,312
shared with the brain

1808
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,348
variables in a table

1809
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:16,586
equations five and six

1810
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:19,322
about the instantaneous capture rate.

1811
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:23,660
We'll discuss it in the .1.2.

1812
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:24,928
Section 4.2

1813
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:26,863
also will be nice to discuss.

1814
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:27,964
It is optimal

1815
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:29,265
foraging theory suggests

1816
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:30,199
a functional form

1817
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:32,302
for all static control.

1818
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:33,770
Do you want to add anything up

1819
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:37,440
front about optimal foraging?

1820
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,175
No, other than I want to.

1821
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:41,277
I want to talk with the authors about

1822
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:46,649
what does that even mean?

1823
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:47,884
That'll be great.

1824
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:51,254
Write Equation eight Global Capture Rate

1825
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:53,523
Section 4.3

1826
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:55,024
Feedback or Feedforward

1827
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:57,260
Control with Generative Action Concepts.

1828
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,496
So here are some more formal isms.

1829
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:01,998
And this is within

1830
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:04,167
not the experimental psychologist

1831
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:05,902
framework,

1832
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:06,569
but rather

1833
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:08,371
the control theoretic framework

1834
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:09,872
with our static capacity

1835
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:12,141
estimate here on the left,

1836
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:15,511
section 4.3,

1837
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:18,581
Equation ten, equation 11

1838
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:20,016
or variables

1839
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:24,187
stochastic optimal control associate,

1840
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,222
which was mentioned earlier,

1841
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:31,127
Equation 12, Figure ten

1842
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:33,930
This one will be used to discuss

1843
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35,398
a hierarchical,

1844
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:36,332
generative model,

1845
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:37,800
capturing multiple timescales

1846
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:38,968
and reference distributions

1847
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,403
at each level

1848
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:42,271
without addressing empirical questions

1849
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:43,873
about neural hierarchies.

1850
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:44,941
Here we employ a model

1851
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:47,010
with L equal four models to match FIG.

1852
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:50,580
six.

1853
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:51,347
It defines

1854
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:54,350
what some of these nodes mean, but the

1855
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:56,619
y axis is increasing time scale.

1856
01:00:58,021 --> 01:01:00,990
So perhaps slower things higher up.

1857
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:02,425
And then on

1858
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:05,461
the right is the passage of time.

1859
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:06,262
So what does this make

1860
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:07,430
you think about or what is it

1861
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:08,498
like a way we can approach

1862
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:09,899
the interpretation of this?

1863
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:12,335
Well, I'm not trying to be a

1864
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,136
smart apple,

1865
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:15,805
but I do find it interesting that floor,

1866
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:16,606
because it

1867
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:18,841
gives you quite a bit of information

1868
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,310
that I mean, there's maybe

1869
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:22,879
and they talk about the fact

1870
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:24,313
that there's more than four levels,

1871
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:26,249
but they want to focus on those four.

1872
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:28,184
I mean, where my brain goes is, okay,

1873
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,152
so we got the water,

1874
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:30,820
we got the yeast, we got the hops,

1875
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,088
we've got the grains.

1876
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:34,791
And that can create quite,

1877
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:36,359
quite the product.

1878
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,027
So you can go past that,

1879
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,429
you can add juice or whatever,

1880
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:40,496
but you've got the four

1881
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:41,431
basic ingredients.

1882
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:44,434
So now moving to time,

1883
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:46,536
what does that enable?

1884
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:49,172
So again, be nice for them to pull out

1885
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:51,174
all that apart

1886
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:53,342
because I think even in this,

1887
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:54,377
there's enough there

1888
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:56,713
to

1889
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:57,547
figure it.

1890
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,115
A lot of stuff out.

1891
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:00,450
Right?

1892
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,585
4.4 Feedback Control

1893
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:04,053
with generative action concepts.

1894
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:08,624
Still there is equation 13, Equation 14

1895
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:11,661
and then a nice quote.

1896
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:12,395
Readers are familiar

1897
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,197
with predictive processing

1898
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:16,532
and active inference will recognize

1899
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:18,901
the form of the above equation 14

1900
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:21,170
as negative free energy

1901
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:22,405
or variational lower

1902
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,973
bound for discussion.

1903
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:27,176
See some citations since the objectives

1904
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:28,411
can typically be written out

1905
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,179
and interpreted in several equivalent

1906
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:31,013
ways,

1907
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:32,482
each of which

1908
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:34,617
can come with its own intuitions.

1909
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:35,485
There are arguments

1910
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:36,452
for the computational

1911
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:38,087
and thermodynamic efficiency

1912
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:40,156
of minimizing this specific divergence

1913
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:42,358
in the course of neural processing.

1914
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:43,392
But to date, the available

1915
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:44,527
evidence does not rule out

1916
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:46,295
other, more complex information.

1917
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:47,730
Divergences for penalizing

1918
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:50,500
feedback, correction of movements.

1919
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,169
So it's pretty interesting how different

1920
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:56,472
lower bounds

1921
01:02:56,472 --> 01:02:57,306
variational lower

1922
01:02:57,306 --> 01:02:59,509
bounds, negative free energies

1923
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:02,612
exist like there's expected free energy

1924
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:03,813
and then there's free energy

1925
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:05,414
of the expected future

1926
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:06,849
and there's all of these variance.

1927
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:09,185
And then each of those

1928
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:11,788
energies can be decomposed differently,

1929
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:17,193
like equation 2.6 in the textbook.

1930
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:19,996
So it's

1931
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:22,732
interesting to see how first off,

1932
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:26,035
how did they converge to this kind

1933
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:27,570
of a bound

1934
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:29,572
and from

1935
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:31,841
why should it have such resonance

1936
01:03:31,841 --> 01:03:33,776
with free energy principle

1937
01:03:33,776 --> 01:03:35,611
and what does that mean?

1938
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:38,281
And then how can different partitioning

1939
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:39,882
of these energy balance

1940
01:03:39,882 --> 01:03:41,551
help us think about

1941
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:45,121
systems that survive?

1942
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:46,222
I'll just out here, Danielle,

1943
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:48,591
that we're going to get to these things.

1944
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:51,093
But up to this point in the paper,

1945
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,595
guess I had a bit of familiarity

1946
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:54,330
and I didn't really struggle

1947
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,065
with the sort of the

1948
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:57,033
lockstep way

1949
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:59,468
that we were going through this.

1950
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:01,003
But then as soon as we got to

1951
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,605
Equations 13

1952
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:04,841
and the jump to Equation 50 and, and 16,

1953
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:05,908
somebody,

1954
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:06,909
somebody brighter than me is

1955
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:07,610
going to have to be able

1956
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:09,045
to explain that jump

1957
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:10,713
in real simple terms,

1958
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:12,181
because even though I read it

1959
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:14,116
a number of times, I'm

1960
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:15,751
not exactly sure how it works.

1961
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:18,254
So again, the authors really want to

1962
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:19,255
bring their

1963
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:20,523
their

1964
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:21,858
softest gloves because

1965
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:24,093
I need my handheld.

1966
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:28,531
Yeah, agreed.

1967
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,066
Section 4.4.

1968
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:35,705
Still, here's equation 15,

1969
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,941
Section 4.4, here's equation 16.

1970
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:42,912
Substituting the augmented objective

1971
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:46,582
fancy j Equation 14

1972
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:49,652
and the analytical expression

1973
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:50,853
for the optimal feedback

1974
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:51,721
controller alone.

1975
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,156
Equation 15 into the Belmont Equation.

1976
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:57,627
Equation 12 would yield.

1977
01:04:57,627 --> 01:05:00,563
Equation 16 Let's learn what it is.

1978
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,933
Yep.

1979
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:05,134
Now the intractable

1980
01:05:05,134 --> 01:05:07,436
recursive term in the equation is

1981
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:09,572
etc.

1982
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:11,173
Finding a way to replace

1983
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:12,441
this term will yield

1984
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:14,577
a more computational tractable problem.

1985
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:17,880
The information diversions term in fancy

1986
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:18,748
j provides

1987
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:19,548
just such a way,

1988
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:21,918
since it could be written as precisely

1989
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,986
the difference between the intractable

1990
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:26,856
maximum under Q Star Sub Phi

1991
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:28,724
and the more tractable smooth

1992
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:30,559
maximum under the pre-planned action

1993
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:33,963
concept in symbols equation 17.

1994
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:35,665
Pretty interesting.

1995
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:38,768
Okay.

1996
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:46,842
Equation 17 through 21.

1997
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:49,011
Then the final section, section

1998
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:50,246
five discussion.

1999
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:52,081
This is more modified.

2000
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:54,150
Maybe you can help me today.

2001
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:58,087
So were 13 through 17 and

2002
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:01,590
and then 18, 19 and 20 a way

2003
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:03,826
of being able to put together

2004
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:06,963
some of the scale three

2005
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,932
formalism with the scale specific

2006
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:11,167
or scale friendly

2007
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:15,137
details and particulars.

2008
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:17,506
When you read this, is that what you

2009
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:25,514
saw them trying to clarify?

2010
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:27,516
That's a great question.

2011
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:30,886
As they talk about global,

2012
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,388
and I think they have to be able

2013
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:34,590
to spell that out. And I think it did.

2014
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:37,593
But again, I'm it was all of a sudden

2015
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:41,831
things went off into the ditch for me.

2016
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,466
Here's what I would

2017
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:45,034
venture

2018
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:49,171
in the early section.

2019
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:53,609
There's a contrasting of homeostasis

2020
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:55,211
with our spaces

2021
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:57,680
and about how reward systems

2022
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,514
are no longer

2023
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,349
required under certain

2024
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,585
distributed models of brain

2025
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:05,187
neuroanatomy and a function

2026
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:07,189
so I believe that the following

2027
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:08,357
formal isms

2028
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:10,960
substitute the augmented objective

2029
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:14,964
into in optimality

2030
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:16,966
and optimization and framework

2031
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:18,667
like the Bellman equation,

2032
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:19,769
which is often used

2033
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:21,737
for reward maximization.

2034
01:07:21,737 --> 01:07:23,305
So I'm rewarded by getting

2035
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:25,141
to the top of the mountain.

2036
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:28,077
So I'm going to evaluate paths

2037
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:30,379
based upon how much reward they accrue,

2038
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:33,582
and then curiosity or so on

2039
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,084
will be valuable

2040
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:36,419
to the extent over the time

2041
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:38,421
horizon that I considered.

2042
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:40,656
It facilitates reward

2043
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:41,791
in terms of elevation,

2044
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:44,827
whereas we

2045
01:07:44,827 --> 01:07:45,494
here are

2046
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:46,695
seeing the move towards

2047
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:47,163
that like

2048
01:07:47,163 --> 01:07:50,166
optimal maneuverability maximization

2049
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:53,869
with pdf CDF relationship

2050
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:55,504
like instead of trying

2051
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:57,339
to reduce divergence

2052
01:07:57,339 --> 01:07:59,742
to the midpoint of the CDF

2053
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:02,845
where you maximize your responsiveness

2054
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:05,548
in terms of maximizing the log pdf.

2055
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:06,482
Okay.

2056
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:08,951
So I think that's the augmented

2057
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:10,953
reward function

2058
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,456
which is tractable.

2059
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:16,292
And then some work remains

2060
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:19,662
to specify that function

2061
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:21,330
and how it behaves.

2062
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:22,598
Perhaps

2063
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:23,666
what.

2064
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:27,403
Then?

2065
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:28,471
Section five

2066
01:08:28,471 --> 01:08:29,738
discussion interception

2067
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:31,440
stabilizes action and constructs

2068
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:35,611
all static references.

2069
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:36,812
People can look at the quotes.

2070
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:38,881
Anything to summarize here?

2071
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:40,816
No. All right.

2072
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:41,684
5.1 Viewing

2073
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:42,051
the brain

2074
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:45,721
as an allosteric optimal controller,

2075
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:48,057
the allosteric path integral control

2076
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:49,024
APC model

2077
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:49,492
in Section

2078
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:50,259
four implies

2079
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:52,328
a number of specific hypotheses

2080
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:53,496
beyond those generic

2081
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:55,698
to stochastic optimal control.

2082
01:08:56,665 --> 01:08:58,501
There's some discussion

2083
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:00,302
of shared modeling choices

2084
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:01,170
with active inference

2085
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:04,640
models, perhaps enough for APC

2086
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,374
to be considered

2087
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:07,643
an active inference model of sorts,

2088
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:10,246
and then

2089
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:10,880
a few other

2090
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:11,947
features that are shared

2091
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:13,983
with active inference models

2092
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:16,585
in strict sense, if one even exists,

2093
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:18,721
and also related

2094
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:22,558
modeling efforts, anything to add.

2095
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:24,126
Know how to spell it out

2096
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:24,860
pretty clearly here.

2097
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:26,395
You just want to read through this.

2098
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:26,962
All right.

2099
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:29,532
5.1, provide some predictions

2100
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,568
and some contrasts with APC model

2101
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:37,439
5.2,

2102
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:38,841
the body in the brain

2103
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:42,578
through the lens of control theory.

2104
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:43,913
Figure six

2105
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:45,881
show how visceral sense data is

2106
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:47,383
and in effect to become ex

2107
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:53,055
afferent intercept of prediction errors.

2108
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:54,123
Do you want to explain

2109
01:09:54,123 --> 01:09:56,792
briefly what an x afferent means?

2110
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:58,561
Because people wait.

2111
01:09:58,561 --> 01:09:59,528
They do explain that

2112
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:01,864
in the glossary, but

2113
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,098
it's basically an accurate

2114
01:10:03,098 --> 01:10:04,266
signal on an accuracy.

2115
01:10:04,266 --> 01:10:06,468
Lose a bit a recursion there.

2116
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:10,272
You want to add anything to that?

2117
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:10,706
I

2118
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:13,776
see the distinction

2119
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:16,178
just to highlight what afferent is.

2120
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,314
Afferent is conducting

2121
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:19,882
or conducted inwards

2122
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:22,318
or towards something for the nerves.

2123
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:24,053
The central nervous system

2124
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,254
for blood vessels,

2125
01:10:25,254 --> 01:10:27,122
the organ supplied right.

2126
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:28,390
And

2127
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:31,260
how you distinguish exact it's.

2128
01:10:32,795 --> 01:10:35,197
Just it's just that it's sort of

2129
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:36,632
cumulative.

2130
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,301
It's not it's not sort of the

2131
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:40,603
the initial

2132
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:44,473
is what I took away from that

2133
01:10:44,473 --> 01:10:50,112
the accumulation of those signals.

2134
01:10:50,112 --> 01:10:51,447
Interesting

2135
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:54,617
I like your on that's what I took.

2136
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:57,253
Five three interception and capacity

2137
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,387
curves

2138
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:01,590
theories of peripheral predictive coding

2139
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:02,691
reason that a neurons

2140
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:03,626
most metabolically

2141
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:05,160
cheap responses should represent

2142
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,629
the predictable stimuli, whereas

2143
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:08,097
expensive responses are reserved

2144
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:11,066
for the most surprising stimuli.

2145
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:12,801
Some predictions and suggestions

2146
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,970
from BERRETT 2017

2147
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:18,040
and findings of two work in 2013.

2148
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,675
Certain peripheral interceptors

2149
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:20,142
in humans

2150
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:21,577
reduce their afferent firing

2151
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:24,013
rate to zero under a constant stimulus.

2152
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:26,115
So that's kind of interesting.

2153
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:29,218
Like if no change, don't tell me

2154
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:29,685
about it.

2155
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:31,954
And that should be cheap.

2156
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,222
Under a model

2157
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:34,456
where something is changing.

2158
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:37,593
Less often than not, it's

2159
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:42,564
and there's some more

2160
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:43,565
hypotheses

2161
01:11:43,565 --> 01:11:45,100
we have hypothesized that increases

2162
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,068
in such responsiveness,

2163
01:11:46,068 --> 01:11:48,871
which is the imperative in this APC

2164
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:49,605
model

2165
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:51,240
could function as rewards

2166
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,341
positively reinforcing

2167
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:53,342
behavioral trajectories,

2168
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:55,177
while decreases in responsiveness

2169
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:56,979
could function as costs

2170
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:58,213
negatively reinforcing

2171
01:11:58,213 --> 01:12:00,082
behavioral trajectories.

2172
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:02,318
So keeping options open

2173
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,620
over the infinite time horizon

2174
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:05,654
becomes equivalent

2175
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:08,190
to keeping the business

2176
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:11,060
floating or keeping physiology bounded.

2177
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:14,196
Yep.

2178
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:17,299
Continuity instead of just maximizing

2179
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,802
amount of USD or calories.

2180
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:20,903
Right.

2181
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:22,404
But rather having reduced

2182
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:23,372
or bounded surprises

2183
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:25,107
or about a range

2184
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:28,110
and a trajectory and a strategy.

2185
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:30,679
Not in this model as stated here,

2186
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,415
to generate that

2187
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:34,283
pathway.

2190
01:12:39,722 --> 01:12:42,391
Finally, we return to the amateur

2191
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:44,126
dodgeball player.

2192
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:46,995
We aren't mature.

2193
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:47,663
Yet

2194
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:51,767
and some summarization

2195
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:53,936
of the epic model

2196
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:55,871
and suggestions

2197
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:57,339
about its compatibility

2198
01:12:57,339 --> 01:12:59,408
with the referent control hypothesis

2199
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:04,146
and some of its tractability.

2200
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:05,247
That's the discussion.

2201
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:07,616
Then Appendix B Judiciary,

2202
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:09,685
which we've talked about before,

2203
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:10,953
but it's kind of a cool topic.

2204
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:12,121
So just to skip

2205
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:13,088
through these appendices,

2206
01:13:13,088 --> 01:13:15,224
just discussing them with the authors,

2207
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,459
we hope then

2208
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:20,729

And so a kind of closing note,

2227
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:57,466
we wondered how

2228
01:13:57,466 --> 01:13:59,735
this connects to the Bayesian mechanics

2229
01:14:00,702 --> 01:14:03,906
and to the path formulation, the right?

2230
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:06,008
Most of the three

2231
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:08,577
phases of Bayesian mechanics

2232
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:10,712
and about how coming

2233
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:12,381
potentially from quite a different

2234
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:15,884
starting point and with different

2235
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:18,954
approaches and constraints,

2236
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:22,925
some similar features

2237
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:26,161
might have

2238
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:28,831
arisen and been highlighted in APAC

2239
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:30,632
that are also highlighted

2240
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:32,367
and relevant for Bayesian mechanics

2241
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:34,169
in the PATH Formalization.

2242
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:36,038
And maybe there's like

2243
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:39,374
a kind of unmapped Venn diagram there

2244
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:44,279
and some similarities and differences.

2245
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:46,448
The proximity to the last live stream,

2246
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:48,784
whether by accident or by intent,

2247
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:52,821
makes the way that you look

2248
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:54,490
at this paper

2249
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:57,559
interesting.

2250
01:14:57,559 --> 01:14:58,760
I'll just say.

2251
01:14:59,094 --> 01:15:01,330
Yeah, agreed.

2252
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:01,997
Well,

2253
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:04,967
anything you want to

2254
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:06,468
close with?

2255
01:15:06,702 --> 01:15:08,337
I think the idea of being able

2256
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:09,605
to look at a model

2257
01:15:09,605 --> 01:15:10,239
and modeling

2258
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:11,139
internal modeling

2259
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:13,542
and sort of the coordination of that,

2260
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:16,645
either either again, kind of

2261
01:15:16,645 --> 01:15:19,515
as a minimum to other as risk management

2262
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:20,883
or risk

2263
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:22,084
minimizing exercise,

2264
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:24,419
therefore limiting strategy

2265
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:26,522
or as an option generating

2266
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,457
or an expanding strategy

2267
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:28,724
would be

2268
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:30,092
something really interesting

2269
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:32,194
to talk to the authors about,

2270
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:34,129
because, again, I can't

2271
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:35,931
I can't really figure out

2272
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:36,832
whether or not

2273
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:40,235
the APIC model works in both domains.

2274
01:15:40,802 --> 01:15:42,437
Do I get past

2275
01:15:42,437 --> 01:15:44,706
the jump between formalism 13

2276
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:49,678
and all the way up to 17, 18, 19 and 21?

2277
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:52,114
I mean, with an explanation of that

2278
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:53,515
and and

2279
01:15:53,515 --> 01:15:55,183
and then a gentle prod,

2280
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:57,286
it'd be interesting to find out how

2281
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,021
how that works

2282
01:15:59,021 --> 01:16:02,891
when those things seem to be, be it

2283
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:06,428
we as physiological entities

2284
01:16:06,428 --> 01:16:07,829
are able to juggle

2285
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:10,699
both the risk management and the option

2286
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:13,936
and option generator option, expanding.

2287
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:15,904
So I am really actually quite

2288
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:17,372
excited about that. From a

2289
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,409
here's what I'm feeling.

2290
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,311
How should I read that

2291
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:24,880
in terms of what I can, how far out

2292
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,849
I can make my next bet

2293
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:30,152
from analysis, static perspective,

2294
01:16:30,152 --> 01:16:32,521
I think that's really exciting.

2295
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:34,022
If you get yeah,

2296
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:34,456
like I said,

2297
01:16:34,456 --> 01:16:35,891
if I can get

2298
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:38,594
a better sense of how that jump

2299
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:43,231
works in their model.

2300
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:43,932
Yeah,

2301
01:16:43,999 --> 01:16:45,300
definitely interested

2302
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,369
in that infinite time horizon

2303
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:50,639
and that mentality of like

2304
01:16:51,406 --> 01:16:54,376
what's the best physiological

2305
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:56,645
decision over the infinite

2306
01:16:56,878 --> 01:17:00,182
horizon, right?

2307
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:02,851
That's a great question.

2308
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:06,622
And yeah, the eternal now the presence

2309
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:10,325
and then also a little bit more mundane,

2310
01:17:10,492 --> 01:17:12,594
like what kind of data

2311
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:15,330
are relevant for this type of model?

2312
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:17,766
Is it data that already exists for

2313
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,570
people or is it something

2314
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:22,938
where you can extrapolate

2315
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:24,606
a lot from a sparse data set?

2316
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:26,541
Or do you need a bunch of

2317
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:27,409
replication

2318
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:29,177
to get good statistical confidence

2319
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:30,979
on the model parameter

2320
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:31,613
and extract

2321
01:17:31,613 --> 01:17:35,617
findings that are like non-trivial?

2322
01:17:35,617 --> 01:17:36,284
And.

2323
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:38,186
Whereas, this

2324
01:17:38,186 --> 01:17:39,388
technology or approach

2325
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:40,756
being used or where could it be

2326
01:17:40,756 --> 01:17:42,991
used, there's like a lot of things

2327
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:45,160
that'll be interesting to talk about.

2328
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:46,662
Well,

2329
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:49,464
thank you for all the preparation

2330
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:50,666
and help on this one

2331
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:52,934
Dean and see you in

2332
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:54,603
the don't want to be aren't.

2333
01:17:54,603 --> 01:17:55,771
My friend take care.

2334
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:58,040
Bye.
