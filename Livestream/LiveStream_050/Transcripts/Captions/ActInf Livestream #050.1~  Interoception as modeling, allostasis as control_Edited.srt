DANIEL FRIEDMAN (Speaker A): Hello everyone. We're in Active

1020
00:00:29,682 --> 00:00:33,292
Inference livestream number 50.1 on

1030
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,275
October 20, 2022.

1040
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:38,967
We're discussing the paper "Interception

1050
00:00:39,027 --> 00:00:41,600
as Modeling, Allostasis as Control."

1060
00:00:42,187 --> 00:00:43,752
Welcome to the Active Inference

1070
00:00:43,782 --> 00:00:45,987
Institute. We're a participatory

1080
00:00:46,062 --> 00:00:48,207
online institute that is communicating,

1090
00:00:48,297 --> 00:00:50,577
learning and practicing applied Active

1100
00:00:50,607 --> 00:00:52,927
Inference. This is recorded in an

1110
00:00:52,945 --> 00:00:55,207
archived livestream, so please provide

1120
00:00:55,285 --> 00:00:57,427
feedback so we can improve our work.

1130
00:00:57,595 --> 00:00:59,497
All backgrounds and perspectives are

1140
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,672
welcome and we'll be following video

1150
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:04,912
etiquette for Live streams. Head over to

1160
00:01:04,975 --> 00:01:07,447
activeinference.org to learn more about

1170
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,082
how to get involved with different

1180
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,077
learning groups and projects like the

1190
00:01:11,095 --> 00:01:12,962
Live Streams and otherwise.

1200
00:01:14,887 --> 00:01:18,547
We're here in livestream number 50 point 1 with

1210
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,362
our second discussion of the paper

1220
00:01:20,425 --> 00:01:23,647
"Interoception as Modeling, Allostasis as

1230
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,327
Control." Previously we had number 50 point 0

1240
00:01:28,495 --> 00:01:30,562
where Dean and I provided some

1250
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:32,952
background and context. And now we're

1260
00:01:32,982 --> 00:01:34,837
really appreciative that we'll have some

1270
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,107
authors joining for the Dot One and Two to

1280
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:41,397
unpack and explore some ideas.

1290
00:01:41,592 --> 00:01:46,057
And today it will be great to hear from

1300
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,067
multiple authors, see a little

1310
00:01:48,115 --> 00:01:51,622
presentation and dive into the middle of

1320
00:01:51,655 --> 00:01:53,902
things, the thick of things, as we do in

1330
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,722
the dot one. And so we'll begin with

1340
00:01:56,755 --> 00:01:59,407
introductions, then we will have a

1350
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:02,347
presentation and then discussion. So

1360
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,897
we'll begin with introductions with

1370
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:08,422
non-authors first and they can feel

1380
00:02:08,455 --> 00:02:11,137
free to introduce, say hi and anything

1390
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,432
that they're excited to explore today.

1400
00:02:13,585 --> 00:02:16,042
So, I'm Daniel, I'm a researcher in

1410
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,522
California and I'm looking forward

1420
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:22,767
to understanding some of the formalisms

1430
00:02:22,902 --> 00:02:26,182
in the model and how they connect to

1440
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,422
active inference and Bayesian mechanics.

1450
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:30,512
And I'll pass to Dave.

1460
00:02:31,612 --> 00:02:35,600
DAVE DOUGLASS: Hi, I'm Dave. I'm a

1470
00:02:36,562 --> 00:02:39,892
discourse curator and a student of [the late] Jaak

1480
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,547
Panksepp and Mark Solms. I live in the

1490
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,132
mile-high academic city of Baguio,

1500
00:02:45,222 --> 00:02:48,042
200 km north of Manila. Dean!

1510
00:02:48,177 --> 00:02:51,777
DEAN (Speaker C): Thanks, David. I'm Dean.

1520
00:02:51,807 --> 00:02:55,507
I'm in Calgary. What's interesting

1530
00:02:55,585 --> 00:02:58,977
to me is that on a metaphorical

1540
00:02:59,007 --> 00:03:01,612
level, this started out me in an open

1550
00:03:01,675 --> 00:03:04,672
field and I got into a forest and that

1560
00:03:04,705 --> 00:03:06,952
forest got denser and denser! By the

1570
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,422
time I got to section four of this

1580
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,807
paper, I started reading it over and

1590
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,517
over again, which is a fantastic sign

1600
00:03:12,565 --> 00:03:13,867
because if I have to read something

1610
00:03:13,915 --> 00:03:16,297
many, many times to really get my head

1620
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,747
around it, that's good - because

1630
00:03:19,855 --> 00:03:22,617
I don't question things unless I don't

1640
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:24,802
get them. That doesn't mean that it

1650
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,902
wasn't spelled out correctly, it just

1660
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,532
means that you got my attention. So I'm

1670
00:03:29,547 --> 00:03:30,922
not sure which author to pass it to

1680
00:03:30,955 --> 00:03:34,325
first. Maybe. Eli, you'd like to say hi.

1690
00:03:35,287 --> 00:03:38,122
ELI SENNESH (Speaker B): Hello everyone, I'm Eli, I'm the first

1700
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:44,107
author on this paper. So a

1710
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,892
bit before the live stream started,

1720
00:03:46,015 --> 00:03:48,817
Jordan was mentioning that this work

1730
00:03:48,865 --> 00:03:51,022
comes out of what we were sort of

1740
00:03:51,055 --> 00:03:52,927
studying together in our lab at an

1750
00:03:52,945 --> 00:03:55,272
energetics working group, brain

1760
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:57,127
energetics reading group before the

1770
00:03:57,145 --> 00:04:00,397
pandemic really did us. And so when I

1780
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,687
was confined,

1790
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:06,177
you know, I effectively started reading

1800
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:08,047
and re-reading everything that we have

1810
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,122
gone through and trying to come up with

1820
00:04:11,155 --> 00:04:15,387
some way to think about allostasis.

1830
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:18,792
Because in our group and in our previous

1840
00:04:18,852 --> 00:04:20,767
publications as a group, the

1850
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:23,437
Interdisciplinary Effective Science Lab,

1860
00:04:23,575 --> 00:04:26,557
we've referenced allostasis a lot. And

1870
00:04:26,635 --> 00:04:29,047
every time I would ask, how can we give

1880
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,612
a mathematical and computational

1890
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,927
characterization of allostasis,

1900
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:37,477
I would basically be told, well, we

1910
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:39,952
thought Peter Sterling had one. And then

1920
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,425
I would go look at Peter Sterling, and

1930
00:04:43,162 --> 00:04:45,007
he's the originator of the concept of

1940
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,677
Allostasis, by the way. So there's

1950
00:04:46,707 --> 00:04:48,962
numerous works by him on the subject.

1960
00:04:49,312 --> 00:04:51,650
Probably the longest form,

1970
00:04:52,987 --> 00:04:56,592
let's say nonexpert treatment,

1980
00:04:56,652 --> 00:04:58,522
would probably be his book "What is

1990
00:04:58,555 --> 00:04:59,150
Health?"

2000
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:07,152
And when I would look at Sterling's

2010
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,677
work, I would sort of spot a

2020
00:05:08,695 --> 00:05:11,152
contradiction or a contradiction in

2030
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,300
terms. On one side,

2040
00:05:14,887 --> 00:05:17,727
he's specifically charting the variation

2050
00:05:17,907 --> 00:05:19,972
in physiological parameters and

2060
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:23,542
regulation over time, where time

2070
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,027
can be the course of a lifetime, the

2080
00:05:25,045 --> 00:05:27,202
course of development, or even just the

2090
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,502
course of a single day. And yet, on the

2100
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,752
other hand, if you ask him, well, how is

2110
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:37,222
this done? He would effectively say "this

2120
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:39,477
is done by reinforcement learning via

2130
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:42,587
the dopaminergic systems in the brain."

2140
00:05:42,937 --> 00:05:44,827
Now, the dopaminergic systems in the

2150
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:48,417
brain don't track a shifting signal

2160
00:05:48,477 --> 00:05:51,212
over time. They just maximize reward.

2170
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:54,727
And so actually, in my view, at least, as

2180
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:56,467
a computationalist, they were more

2190
00:05:56,515 --> 00:05:58,787
homeostatic than allostatic.

2200
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:02,122
And from that contradiction and what

2210
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:05,017
followed on from it really came this

2220
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:08,647
whole paper. But to

2230
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,962
re-emphasize, I would say, and before

2240
00:06:12,025 --> 00:06:15,472
we jump into slides material inside the

2250
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:17,497
paper, I think it's really worth

2260
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,897
emphasizing, just based on watching the

2270
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,037
50.0 livestream, that our

2280
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,587
group are more, let's say,

2290
00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:29,092
biologists and physiologists in

2300
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,012
orientation than physicists.

2310
00:06:32,737 --> 00:06:34,797
So Bayesian, the paper on "Bayesian

2320
00:06:34,842 --> 00:06:37,092
Mechanics" came out while we were writing

2330
00:06:37,152 --> 00:06:40,402
this, and I

2340
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,977
don't think we really managed to

2350
00:06:41,995 --> 00:06:43,942
integrate the two sets of material yet

2360
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,550
together, or together yet.

2370
00:06:47,362 --> 00:06:48,997
That's not to say they can't or

2380
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,877
shouldn't be integrated. It's to say we

2390
00:06:51,895 --> 00:06:54,427
don't actually have, so to speak, we

2400
00:06:54,445 --> 00:06:55,582
don't always have the physics and

2410
00:06:55,585 --> 00:06:58,627
dynamical systems expertise of someone

2420
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,242
like Thomas Parr or Maxwell Ramstead,

2430
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:03,322
let alone Karl Friston. On the other

2440
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:07,947
hand, we have very concrete notions

2450
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:10,627
of what biology and physiology we need

2460
00:07:10,645 --> 00:07:11,825
to fit to.

2470
00:07:15,037 --> 00:07:18,125
And really, the bulk of this paper,

2480
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:21,117
the reason it's not just a short Section

2490
00:07:21,177 --> 00:07:24,577
Four with some math, is because we have

2500
00:07:24,595 --> 00:07:26,802
to fit to the physiology and the anatomy

2510
00:07:26,832 --> 00:07:27,875
that we know about.

2520
00:07:31,162 --> 00:07:33,382
FRIEDMAN: Thank you! Jordan, feel free to intro

2530
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,152
and then, Eli, off to you for some presentation.

2540
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,667
JORDAN THERIAULT: For sure. I'm a postdoc

2550
00:07:38,727 --> 00:07:40,482
in the lab here, so I think maybe I'll

2560
00:07:40,497 --> 00:07:41,757
just get some context of where we're

2570
00:07:41,772 --> 00:07:43,417
both working too, and how it got here.

2580
00:07:43,465 --> 00:07:45,672
So for me, I've had a bit of a weird

2590
00:07:45,717 --> 00:07:47,527
path to get to this point in that I did

2600
00:07:47,545 --> 00:07:49,827
my PhD in social psychology and moral

2610
00:07:49,857 --> 00:07:53,677
psychology, then sort

2620
00:07:53,695 --> 00:07:55,897
of got really, really interested in

2630
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,502
predictive processing perspectives and

2640
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,122
active inference and then really wanted

2650
00:07:59,155 --> 00:08:00,702
to dig into that and find someone who's

2660
00:08:00,732 --> 00:08:02,837
working on it around here in boston.

2670
00:08:03,262 --> 00:08:05,547
So I'm working with Lisa Feldman,

2680
00:08:05,592 --> 00:08:07,342
Barrett and Karen Quickly, who co direct

2690
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,267
the interdisciplinary Affect of Sciences

2700
00:08:09,327 --> 00:08:12,652
lab here. And like you guys saying, the

2710
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,622
perspective that we have is really more

2720
00:08:15,655 --> 00:08:17,527
of a biologically grounded one or more

2730
00:08:17,545 --> 00:08:20,407
of one that's based in physiology and

2740
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,127
neuroscience. So Lisa and Carol joke

2750
00:08:23,157 --> 00:08:24,937
that Lisa sort of handles everything

2760
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,502
from the neck up and Karen handles

2770
00:08:26,532 --> 00:08:28,417
everything from the neck down, so

2780
00:08:28,465 --> 00:08:30,125
together they form a whole person.

2790
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:34,372
And what I was really lucky to do was I

2800
00:08:34,405 --> 00:08:37,497
stumbled into an existing collaboration

2810
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:39,147
that's been going on for about a decade

2820
00:08:39,192 --> 00:08:43,032
here, which we called the Psychology

2830
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,677
Engineering Neuroscience Group, or the

2840
00:08:44,695 --> 00:08:46,777
Penn Group, where there's been an

2850
00:08:46,795 --> 00:08:49,777
ongoing collaboration with professors in

2860
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,437
the electrical engineering department.

2870
00:08:51,862 --> 00:08:53,652
Probably most importantly, Dana Brooks

2880
00:08:53,682 --> 00:08:55,072
has really helped run it a lot, that

2890
00:08:55,105 --> 00:08:57,742
Dennis Dogmas and Jennifer D have both

2900
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,200
also been really involved in this.

2910
00:09:01,012 --> 00:09:02,767
And so what they would do is they'd meet

2920
00:09:02,815 --> 00:09:04,752
every week and they would sort of pour

2930
00:09:04,782 --> 00:09:06,927
through active interest papers,

2940
00:09:06,957 --> 00:09:08,762
predictive processing papers,

2950
00:09:09,187 --> 00:09:11,322
information theory. They'd sort of catch

2960
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:14,242
all of us neuroscientists up to speed on

2970
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,177
understanding engineering, and we try to

2980
00:09:16,195 --> 00:09:17,872
bring them up to speed on a sort of

2990
00:09:17,905 --> 00:09:19,027
biological understanding of

3000
00:09:19,045 --> 00:09:24,097
neuroscience, too. So what

3010
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,600
we've been really interested in doing is

3020
00:09:27,787 --> 00:09:29,622
thinking about some of the abstractions

3030
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:32,202
that had come up in the active inference

3040
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:34,297
literature and thinking about how to

3050
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,747
ground those biological processes and

3060
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,727
how to really make this tractable at an

3070
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:43,432
empirical biological level. And so the

3080
00:09:43,585 --> 00:09:44,997
interest that I've had in brain

3090
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:48,682
energetics has been a way to apply

3100
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:52,452
some of that traction onto my original

3110
00:09:52,482 --> 00:09:53,902
interest, which is sort of moral and

3120
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,467
social norms. So I've done a bit of work

3130
00:09:56,515 --> 00:10:00,350
on thinking about how we can think about

3140
00:10:00,712 --> 00:10:02,947
energetic costs of information

3150
00:10:03,055 --> 00:10:07,272
processing as a way of how individuals

3160
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:08,917
exercise control over a social

3170
00:10:08,965 --> 00:10:10,252
environment by conforming to

3180
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:14,077
expectations within it. And then at

3190
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:15,652
the same time, I've been interested in

3200
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,942
going into the other end and thinking

3210
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,752
about some of the details of brain

3220
00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:21,822
metabolism and brain glucose metabolism

3230
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:23,547
that are associated with the Bold MRI

3240
00:10:23,592 --> 00:10:26,167
signal so that we can really dig down

3250
00:10:26,215 --> 00:10:27,607
deeper into the metabolism of the

3260
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,887
thunderblind neuroimaging literature.

3270
00:10:31,987 --> 00:10:35,607
But in the process of basically forming

3280
00:10:35,622 --> 00:10:37,707
this energetic reading group where we've

3290
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:39,382
been digging into all of those topics to

3300
00:10:39,385 --> 00:10:41,087
try to understand the brain biology.

3310
00:10:42,112 --> 00:10:43,372
Eli and I really ended up working

3320
00:10:43,405 --> 00:10:45,307
together in this paper to try to apply

3330
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:48,942
some of that energetics and biological

3340
00:10:49,002 --> 00:10:52,402
work again. With a ton of help from

3350
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,902
Karen and Lisa. Who really know the

3360
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,852
details of the neuroscience and the

3370
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,402
actual physiology. I think Karen

3380
00:10:57,432 --> 00:10:59,452
especially. That Eli would probably say

3390
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:03,192
has been really critical

3400
00:11:03,252 --> 00:11:05,322
for understanding these physiological

3410
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:08,752
systems. But basically. Yeah. How we

3420
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,827
can have some of the parameters and

3430
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:13,302
assumptions of these active inference

3440
00:11:13,332 --> 00:11:16,942
models grounded in real biological terms

3450
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,517
so that we can start to look to the

3460
00:11:18,565 --> 00:11:20,922
empirical literature. The biological

3470
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:23,002
literature. And sort of gain some more

3480
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,072
inspiration from that rather than just

3490
00:11:25,255 --> 00:11:27,650
living entirely at an abstract level.

3500
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:31,252
Cool. And with that, I'll hand it over

3510
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,550
to you. Excellent. All right,

3520
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:37,222
I've unsure. Feel free to go for it.

3530
00:11:37,255 --> 00:11:39,062
Thanks for that context.

3540
00:11:40,987 --> 00:11:44,842
And just a note, this paper

3550
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,752
does bring in some topics that we

3560
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,117
haven't discussed on any of the

3570
00:11:49,165 --> 00:11:52,777
preceding 50 papers, many of

3580
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,850
which were also motivators of what you

3590
00:11:56,737 --> 00:11:59,547
set out to explore. So I'll just crop

3600
00:11:59,592 --> 00:12:02,347
and resize and so on. And Eli, please go for it.

3610
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,700
ELI SENNESH: All right.

3620
00:12:06,487 --> 00:12:09,522
So before I really get into the material

3630
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:11,397
of the paper. I think it might be useful

3640
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:13,927
to follow on from what Jordan said in

3650
00:12:13,945 --> 00:12:15,982
order to additionally motivate sort of

3660
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,222
our turn towards biology and physiology

3670
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:21,202
here. Which is that most of the time in

3680
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,127
active inference modeling note that I

3690
00:12:24,145 --> 00:12:25,872
say modeling or inactive inference

3700
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:29,712
physics. So to speak. You need a term

3710
00:12:29,862 --> 00:12:32,452
in your expected free energy or in your

3720
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,527
joint density. That is sorry, the

3730
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:37,147
generative joint density, not the

3740
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,712
recognition one, which you would call

3750
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,667
often. I've heard it called the prior

3760
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:45,582
preferences, essentially a probability

3770
00:12:45,672 --> 00:12:48,922
density over sensory outcomes. That

3780
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:52,447
describes what hard to

3790
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,487
avoid entropomorphic language here. But

3800
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:59,542
well, what you want to observe now

3810
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,697
in real biological systems that as

3820
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,737
we sort of can hear from Peter Sterling

3830
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:11,217
or numerous other authors, that cannot

3840
00:13:11,277 --> 00:13:13,037
be fixed.

3850
00:13:14,362 --> 00:13:17,422
That is, prior preferences can't be

3860
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:21,027
fixed. I prefer different observations

3870
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:23,802
when I'm about to go to sleep versus

3880
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:26,525
when I am waking up.

3890
00:13:27,187 --> 00:13:29,722
And the assumption that usually gets

3900
00:13:29,755 --> 00:13:33,897
baked into principles

3910
00:13:33,942 --> 00:13:37,342
like, say, the free energy principle is

3920
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:41,077
that actually, let me moderate that

3930
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:42,922
a little bit based on conversations with

3940
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,652
some free energy principle folks, if you

3950
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,067
have a nonpath based, a state based

3960
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:49,507
formulation of the free energy

3970
00:13:49,585 --> 00:13:51,867
principle, then you will typically

3980
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:53,307
assume something called arrogate

3990
00:13:53,322 --> 00:13:55,327
ergodicity. And you'll note that we have

4000
00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:57,952
an appendix about ergodicity. I saw that

4010
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,037
you discussed it last week in the .0

4020
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,797
episode. Thank you for catching on to

4030
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,002
that and thank you to anyone in the

4040
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,552
audience and the listenership who caught

4050
00:14:06,582 --> 00:14:10,767
onto that. The ergodicity assumption

4060
00:14:10,827 --> 00:14:12,507
essentially allows you to exchange

4070
00:14:12,597 --> 00:14:15,937
uncertainty about time or over

4080
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,372
time for uncertainty in the moment. So

4090
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:21,867
you can just say there's gaussian prior

4100
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:24,892
preference density. It has this much

4110
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,847
precision or this much variance,

4120
00:14:26,892 --> 00:14:30,172
depending on which way you prefer to put

4130
00:14:30,205 --> 00:14:34,557
your division sign. And then it's

4140
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:37,327
the same for all time. Now, if you're

4150
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:42,517
doing a path space formulation, then you

4160
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:44,932
lose the tie between the free energy

4170
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,317
principle and conventional physiological

4180
00:14:49,377 --> 00:14:52,642
notions of homeostasis. Because now,

4190
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,517
after all, can't the set point be

4200
00:14:54,565 --> 00:14:57,517
anything or everything? You need to know

4210
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:59,752
something about physiology, anatomy to

4220
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,452
tie it back. And so that's really the

4230
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,997
motivation we're coming from in this

4240
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:07,687
paper, is what if you have to acquire or

4250
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,842
learn prior preferences throughout

4260
00:15:10,902 --> 00:15:14,247
development? How little can you bake

4270
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:14,900
it?

4280
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:23,775
And so we start by sort of reviewing

4290
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:27,340
in the paper and in these slides, the

4300
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:30,250
sort of perspectives that we study from

4310
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,110
study the nervous system, study the

4320
00:15:32,142 --> 00:15:34,905
brain. One of them is predictive

4330
00:15:34,965 --> 00:15:36,550
processing. I think that's probably

4340
00:15:36,612 --> 00:15:38,455
going to be the important one for this

4350
00:15:38,502 --> 00:15:41,490
audience. And in predictive processing,

4360
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,890
we talk about the perceptual systems of

4370
00:15:44,907 --> 00:15:47,375
the brain, really the sensory systems,

4380
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:49,980
as performing approximate Bayesian

4390
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,155
inference. So then you'll have top down

4400
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,010
prediction signals, bottom up prediction

4410
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:59,745
error signals. And there's

4420
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,905
this notion of active inference which

4430
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:05,160
says that we essentially treat motor

4440
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:08,515
outputs as parameters to the

4450
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:11,740
recognition model in one of its in one

4460
00:16:11,757 --> 00:16:13,555
of the earliest formulations before

4470
00:16:13,602 --> 00:16:16,555
there was any expected free energy. But

4480
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:19,735
ultimately, it still says in any new or

4490
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:22,410
recent formulation, we have some notion

4500
00:16:22,455 --> 00:16:25,845
of prediction error between densities

4510
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,110
and this is an information theoretic

4520
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:31,645
quantity. So really, we're talking about

4530
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:34,905
a divergence or an entropy or a cross

4540
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:38,035
entropy. We want to minimize that. And

4550
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:40,060
we're not only going to minimize that by

4560
00:16:40,092 --> 00:16:42,730
changing the top down predictions that

4570
00:16:42,777 --> 00:16:45,450
flow through, say, the sensory cortex.

4580
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,680
We're also going to change these extra

4590
00:16:47,727 --> 00:16:51,050
parameters that correspond to motor

4600
00:16:52,675 --> 00:16:55,320
motor predictions, motor commands,

4610
00:16:55,485 --> 00:16:57,415
motor references, depending on the

4620
00:16:57,432 --> 00:16:59,365
terminology you want to use to refer to

4630
00:16:59,382 --> 00:17:03,787
them. So then in our lab,

4640
00:17:04,225 --> 00:17:06,910
where we are sort of biologists of

4650
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:10,775
emotion, we often study interoception.

4660
00:17:11,575 --> 00:17:14,880
And that's really it's given a fairly

4670
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,212
vague definition on the slide here

4680
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,560
because there's a lot of debate among

4690
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,670
their own atomists about sort of where

4700
00:17:21,747 --> 00:17:23,565
interception ends and exter

4710
00:17:23,595 --> 00:17:25,945
exteroception begins, which exact

4720
00:17:26,022 --> 00:17:28,060
modalities should be classified, which

4730
00:17:28,092 --> 00:17:30,520
way or another. But really,

4740
00:17:30,597 --> 00:17:34,405
interception is still a set

4750
00:17:34,452 --> 00:17:38,300
of or category of sensory modalities.

4760
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,790
And when I say sensory modalities, I am

4770
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:45,430
mentioning that specifically because the

4780
00:17:45,477 --> 00:17:48,030
literature on interceptive active

4790
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:52,135
inference then tends to take what

4800
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:56,137
we might call the

4810
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,450
earliest form of active inference.

4820
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,810
It takes the road of the earliest form

4830
00:18:01,842 --> 00:18:04,465
of active inference, saying, I have a

4840
00:18:04,482 --> 00:18:06,555
generative density. I have a recognition

4850
00:18:06,615 --> 00:18:09,640
density. Action becomes effectively a

4860
00:18:09,657 --> 00:18:12,675
parameter to fit the recognition density

4870
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,955
to the generative density. And there

4880
00:18:16,002 --> 00:18:20,205
isn't really a notion of an internal

4890
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,905
generative model that is

4900
00:18:23,952 --> 00:18:26,035
separate that separates belief and

4910
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:29,515
desire. So in a lot of the literature on

4920
00:18:29,532 --> 00:18:31,550
interceptive active inference,

4930
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:35,875
you'll find references to having very

4940
00:18:35,937 --> 00:18:40,185
precise priors or even innate

4950
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,175
priors about interceptive parameters.

4960
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:47,785
And you'll see this notion that you

4970
00:18:47,817 --> 00:18:49,465
use active inference in the

4980
00:18:49,482 --> 00:18:51,760
interoception domain more than you use

4990
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:54,765
it in the somatic domain because you're

5000
00:18:54,795 --> 00:18:57,615
trying to fit your internal physiology

5010
00:18:57,795 --> 00:19:02,225
to a notion of apriori

5020
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,585
setpoints that are determined by

5030
00:19:04,617 --> 00:19:08,095
evolution. Do you think

5040
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:10,080
you could give an example of that, eli

5050
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,935
what sort of set points people might

5060
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:14,225
think are innate?

5070
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,875
Speaker B: Let's see, I've seen carbon dioxide

5080
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,055
levels in the blood mentioned, glucose

5090
00:19:23,115 --> 00:19:26,335
levels. Core body temperature is really

5100
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:28,312
the one that I tend to go back to

5110
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:31,455
because it really does remain constant

5120
00:19:31,515 --> 00:19:34,665
most of the time. It can vary,

5130
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,990
but really, that's an inextremis type of

5140
00:19:38,007 --> 00:19:38,587
situation.

5150
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,925
So if you think about core body

5160
00:19:42,987 --> 00:19:46,560
temperature. There's a circuit

5170
00:19:46,605 --> 00:19:49,470
in, I believe, Jordan, correct me if I'm

5180
00:19:49,485 --> 00:19:51,390
wrong, but this is the NTS again, isn't

5190
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,860
it? The nucleus solitarius.

5200
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,340
Okay, yeah. Essentially in the brain

5210
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,287
stem there's a circuit that codes the

5220
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:07,075
typical set point for core body

5230
00:20:07,137 --> 00:20:09,390
temperature. And from an active

5240
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,530
inference perspective, you could say

5250
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:15,540
that is a fixed likelihood.

5260
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,000
It can't be re parameterized by some

5270
00:20:19,137 --> 00:20:22,210
prediction flowing from higher up, or

5280
00:20:22,242 --> 00:20:24,565
rather, most of the time it is not

5290
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:27,835
reparameterized. So that flows down

5300
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:29,230
as a prediction. And then every

5310
00:20:29,277 --> 00:20:32,125
temperature sensor in the body can

5320
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:34,230
compare actual temperature to desired

5330
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,990
temperature, calculate a precision

5340
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,112
weighted prediction error between them,

5350
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:42,490
send those errors back up, and then the

5360
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,590
brain can say, AHA, I need to find a way

5370
00:20:44,607 --> 00:20:48,355
to minimize these errors. And doing so

5380
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:51,385
will effectively keep you in an

5390
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,140
environment where you can maintain your

5400
00:20:53,157 --> 00:20:56,065
core body temperature around, you know,

5410
00:20:56,082 --> 00:20:59,560
I think it's 98.6 Fahrenheit is the

5420
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:03,050
stereotype. It varies for individuals.

5430
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,180
Now, the reason my next slide was about

5440
00:21:07,227 --> 00:21:11,905
allostasis is because while

5450
00:21:11,952 --> 00:21:15,615
there are bodily parameters like core

5460
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:19,245
temperature that usually behave

5470
00:21:19,335 --> 00:21:21,037
according to a set point,

5480
00:21:22,675 --> 00:21:26,675
really physiologically most parameters

5490
00:21:27,475 --> 00:21:29,437
do not have a set point.

5500
00:21:30,925 --> 00:21:34,375
They move. The regulated levels move

5510
00:21:34,512 --> 00:21:37,780
all the time. So that includes heart

5520
00:21:37,827 --> 00:21:41,450
rate, blood pressure, blood sugar,

5530
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,675
blood oxygen levels,

5540
00:21:46,525 --> 00:21:50,085
various hormone levels. In the endocrine

5550
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:54,330
systems, inflammation levels shift

5560
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:57,600
over time. And I mentioned inflammation

5570
00:21:57,675 --> 00:22:00,810
because from the body's perspective,

5580
00:22:00,855 --> 00:22:03,580
there is inflammation is not something

5590
00:22:03,627 --> 00:22:07,155
with a set point of zero. Inflammation

5600
00:22:07,215 --> 00:22:10,780
is sometimes appropriate. And actually,

5610
00:22:10,827 --> 00:22:12,535
if you want to think what is the

5620
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:14,935
situation in which adapting all of these

5630
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:18,255
core parameters is physiologically

5640
00:22:18,315 --> 00:22:21,760
adaptive, then I

5650
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:25,680
think heavy exercise

5660
00:22:25,815 --> 00:22:29,905
and sickness are probably the two

5670
00:22:29,952 --> 00:22:33,615
largest examples. So for heavy

5680
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:36,475
exercise, we could talk about, say,

5690
00:22:36,537 --> 00:22:39,640
arousal levels. And that refers to the

5700
00:22:39,657 --> 00:22:42,715
balance of cooperative activity in the

5710
00:22:42,732 --> 00:22:44,340
branches of the autonomic nervous

5720
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,755
system. But essentially, if you're going

5730
00:22:47,802 --> 00:22:51,265
to go for a run, say from a

5740
00:22:51,282 --> 00:22:54,760
predator or after some food in

5750
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:57,615
your good old fashioned evo psych

5760
00:22:57,645 --> 00:23:00,790
ancestral environment, you're going to

5770
00:23:00,807 --> 00:23:03,355
need to decrease the activity in some

5780
00:23:03,402 --> 00:23:06,835
organ systems, increase the activity in

5790
00:23:06,867 --> 00:23:10,500
other organ systems, and adjust

5800
00:23:10,575 --> 00:23:14,280
physiological parameters to be regulated

5810
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,725
to the new levels.

5820
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:20,800
So this is a pretty wellobserved fact of

5830
00:23:20,862 --> 00:23:22,100
physiology.

5840
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:28,410
You know, informally, Peter Sterling,

5850
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:31,560
I would say, having invented allostasis

5860
00:23:31,605 --> 00:23:34,630
as an observation that gets made, he

5870
00:23:34,677 --> 00:23:37,690
then editorializes a little bit about it

5880
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,950
and says it should replace homeostasis

5890
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:44,365
as a mode of regulation. So rather than

5900
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:45,985
having set points, you should be

5910
00:23:46,017 --> 00:23:48,850
comparing to something like a set

5920
00:23:48,912 --> 00:23:52,605
trajectory. And in the ideal

5930
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:54,730
case, when you're theorizing, you should

5940
00:23:54,777 --> 00:23:58,705
assume that there is no global set point

5950
00:23:58,752 --> 00:24:02,365
of any parameter. And of course, as we

5960
00:24:02,382 --> 00:24:04,585
mentioned before, in extremists this is

5970
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:07,825
true if you get ill, your body does

5980
00:24:07,887 --> 00:24:10,165
actually override that circuit in the

5990
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:13,110
brain stem to raise the core

6000
00:24:13,155 --> 00:24:15,085
temperature. That's why you'll get

6010
00:24:15,117 --> 00:24:17,985
chills. You're at the same temperature.

6020
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,535
But the regulated level has been shifted

6030
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,187
up.

6040
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,315
Speaker C: There's also an interesting point to

6050
00:24:25,332 --> 00:24:28,135
make if you go back for one secular just

6060
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,490
that in the way that the sort of

6070
00:24:30,507 --> 00:24:32,305
language of science evolves here too,

6080
00:24:32,352 --> 00:24:34,060
it's worth pointing out because some

6090
00:24:34,092 --> 00:24:35,740
people might be listening and might be

6100
00:24:35,757 --> 00:24:39,190
thinking, well, homeostasis doesn't have

6110
00:24:39,207 --> 00:24:40,990
to include set point either. You can

6120
00:24:41,007 --> 00:24:42,640
have sort of hierarchical notion of

6130
00:24:42,657 --> 00:24:45,790
homeostasis. You can have sort of

6140
00:24:45,807 --> 00:24:47,665
multiple levels of control involved in

6150
00:24:47,682 --> 00:24:49,435
that. And some people made the same

6160
00:24:49,467 --> 00:24:52,570
criticism of allostasis as an ocean. So

6170
00:24:52,722 --> 00:24:54,875
there's a paper by Carpenter,

6180
00:24:57,175 --> 00:24:59,115
there's a paper we cite by Carpenter

6190
00:24:59,145 --> 00:25:01,087
that does exactly this, right?

6200
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,660
But the problem is that even if that's

6210
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:09,010
like, that's technically true, and

6220
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:10,215
people who really know what they're

6230
00:25:10,245 --> 00:25:11,695
doing and are using the concept of

6240
00:25:11,697 --> 00:25:14,095
homeostasis in that way might already

6250
00:25:14,172 --> 00:25:16,050
understand that you don't necessarily

6260
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:19,765
need set points. But the

6270
00:25:19,782 --> 00:25:21,990
reality is that the way allostasis tends

6280
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,490
to get used in the way that it tends to

6290
00:25:24,507 --> 00:25:27,790
be understood is it's come to have some

6300
00:25:27,807 --> 00:25:29,695
of this association with set plant or

6310
00:25:29,697 --> 00:25:31,390
with the simple thermostat model, as

6320
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:33,235
opposed to something broader that

6330
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:34,915
includes multiple levels of control.

6340
00:25:35,007 --> 00:25:40,510
And so some

6350
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:42,295
people might be curmudgeony and want to

6360
00:25:42,297 --> 00:25:44,190
say that homeostasis already includes

6370
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,685
all of these notions, so we should just

6380
00:25:45,717 --> 00:25:48,787
reclaim the term homeostasis for that.

6390
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,705
I think we're more of the perspective

6400
00:25:51,765 --> 00:25:53,665
that we're willing to just give that up,

6410
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:55,435
and it might be time to just start using

6420
00:25:55,467 --> 00:25:57,115
a different term to remind people of

6430
00:25:57,132 --> 00:26:00,150
those other associations. So we're

6440
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,190
seeding ground a little bit when we're

6450
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:06,835
using the term allostasis to just

6460
00:26:07,017 --> 00:26:09,115
not have to fight with people about what

6470
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:10,987
allostasis really means.

6480
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:16,150
Speaker B: Yes, so Jordan is completely correct

6490
00:26:16,212 --> 00:26:17,530
there, but I would actually even

6500
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:21,000
recommend that everyone listening

6510
00:26:21,075 --> 00:26:22,912
if you can go find the paper,

6520
00:26:23,275 --> 00:26:25,935
Homeostasis a Plea for a Unified

6530
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,290
Approach by RHS. Carpenter. It's in our

6540
00:26:29,307 --> 00:26:31,690
citations, and you should be able to

6550
00:26:31,707 --> 00:26:34,480
type the name into Google Scholar. Go

6560
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:37,615
look at it, because it'll really explain

6570
00:26:37,707 --> 00:26:39,937
where our paper is coming from.

6580
00:26:40,525 --> 00:26:42,855
As a short summary of what's relevant.

6590
00:26:42,915 --> 00:26:46,312
What Carpenter says in his paper is that

6600
00:26:46,825 --> 00:26:49,875
back in the good old days, they taught

6610
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,190
control theory and controls engineering

6620
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,375
to physiologists, and that included

6630
00:26:57,175 --> 00:26:59,305
research physiologists and also

6640
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:02,485
clinicians. And by back in the day, he

6650
00:27:02,517 --> 00:27:04,915
really means back in like the 1940s to

6660
00:27:04,932 --> 00:27:08,385
the 1960s, before another new approach

6670
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:12,180
took over. And she says, hey, if you're

6680
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,645
an educated, mathematically mature

6690
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:18,125
and fluent controls engineer,

6700
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,590
then you don't need, you know, then

6710
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:23,755
these awkward names are all

6720
00:27:23,802 --> 00:27:26,265
really just different ways of cutting

6730
00:27:26,295 --> 00:27:29,320
the same cake. It's all a control

6740
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,570
system. It's a hierarchical control

6750
00:27:31,647 --> 00:27:34,330
system. This is very evident, he says,

6760
00:27:34,377 --> 00:27:36,190
in the anatomy and physiology that

6770
00:27:36,207 --> 00:27:38,995
you'll look at. He's even writing for a

6780
00:27:38,997 --> 00:27:41,375
physiology education journal.

6790
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,190
And then he effectively starts

6800
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,090
complaining that everyone sort of

6810
00:27:46,107 --> 00:27:49,030
strawman homeostasis down to this

6820
00:27:49,077 --> 00:27:50,437
thermostat model.

6830
00:27:52,225 --> 00:27:54,955
And he has to complain like this in 2004

6840
00:27:55,002 --> 00:27:58,510
because indeed, everyone really has sort

6850
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:00,865
of associated the word Homeostasis with

6860
00:28:00,882 --> 00:28:04,387
this, thermostat model global set plant

6870
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:07,480
things like body temperature rather than

6880
00:28:07,527 --> 00:28:08,825
blood glucose.

6890
00:28:10,075 --> 00:28:11,812
And as a result,

6900
00:28:15,925 --> 00:28:18,145
as a result, much of the actual control

6910
00:28:18,222 --> 00:28:20,962
theory got simplified away.

6920
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,615
So even as someone who is housed in

6930
00:28:25,632 --> 00:28:27,565
a computer science department took a

6940
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:30,865
class on reinforcement learning and can

6950
00:28:30,882 --> 00:28:32,770
work the equations of optimal control

6960
00:28:32,847 --> 00:28:35,965
theory. I was not introduced to the

6970
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:39,475
concept of a reference signal as a time

6980
00:28:39,537 --> 00:28:43,135
varying function until

6990
00:28:43,317 --> 00:28:47,080
Carpenter. And that was actually pretty

7000
00:28:47,127 --> 00:28:50,155
revelatory for me. That rather than

7010
00:28:50,202 --> 00:28:56,340
having an error function whose

7020
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:59,812
global minimum is fixed for all time.

7030
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,410
You can have an error function that

7040
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:04,210
measures the difference between your

7050
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,200
actual trajectory and a desired

7060
00:29:07,275 --> 00:29:09,630
trajectory. You can do trajectory

7070
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,115
tracking control when you have the

7080
00:29:12,132 --> 00:29:16,255
mathematics. So we could say

7090
00:29:16,377 --> 00:29:19,615
for our paper, for our purposes, if

7100
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,787
homeostasis refers to this,

7110
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,662
thermostat style point tracking control,

7120
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:30,450
then allostasis refers to trajectory

7130
00:29:30,525 --> 00:29:31,762
tracking control.

7140
00:29:36,737 --> 00:29:39,542
So moving on a little bit and getting

7150
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:42,287
back on the main track from our

7160
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,377
perspectives informed by physiology and

7170
00:29:45,395 --> 00:29:49,137
anatomy and a little bit of Evodevo

7180
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:53,447
interception, and allostasis have both

7190
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,922
pretty well demonstrated themselves to

7200
00:29:55,955 --> 00:29:58,927
be really central to how the nervous

7210
00:29:58,957 --> 00:30:02,567
system is actually structured and

7220
00:30:02,615 --> 00:30:06,212
seemingly largely concerned with the

7230
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:09,077
metabolism and efficient functioning of

7240
00:30:09,095 --> 00:30:12,662
the viscera. So for anyone who wants

7250
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,942
citations for this, I think it's Jordan.

7260
00:30:17,002 --> 00:30:19,937
It would be Barrett. And who?

7270
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,892
2015. Oh,

7280
00:30:23,015 --> 00:30:25,237
barrett and Simmons 2015 yes. Barrett

7290
00:30:25,737 --> 00:30:27,017
and simultaneous neuroscience paper.

7300
00:30:27,065 --> 00:30:29,182
Yeah. Nature Reviews neuroscience

7310
00:30:29,347 --> 00:30:32,037
interceptive predictions in the Brain

7320
00:30:32,612 --> 00:30:34,772
There's a more recent review written by

7330
00:30:34,805 --> 00:30:37,587
Karen Quigley, our other senior author

7340
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:40,232
on the interception came out in 2021.

7350
00:30:40,235 --> 00:30:43,772
And so you can

7360
00:30:43,805 --> 00:30:45,452
really go check for yourself. And I

7370
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,037
would advise it just how central

7380
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,787
interoception and visceral regulation

7390
00:30:51,512 --> 00:30:54,675
are empirically to the nervous system.

7400
00:30:55,262 --> 00:30:57,127
You could possibly design a nervous

7410
00:30:57,157 --> 00:30:58,622
system for a robot that worked

7420
00:30:58,655 --> 00:31:01,522
differently, but the ones that evolved

7430
00:31:01,717 --> 00:31:06,202
are ubiquitously, centered on keeping

7440
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:08,102
the internal Nilia of the body

7450
00:31:08,195 --> 00:31:09,087
efficient.

7460
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:14,400
So yes.

7470
00:31:15,512 --> 00:31:18,677
Dan Pickles? Yeah. Do you mind if I have

7480
00:31:18,695 --> 00:31:20,850
a quick question here? Of course.

7490
00:31:22,262 --> 00:31:24,197
Speaker D: The two office here maybe can just

7500
00:31:24,305 --> 00:31:26,347
confirm that my parachute is packed

7510
00:31:26,392 --> 00:31:28,277
properly. That's what I'm basically

7520
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:31,457
wanting to be comfortable with.

7530
00:31:31,535 --> 00:31:35,027
So just stepping back for a second in

7540
00:31:35,045 --> 00:31:36,752
that slide that you would just had up

7550
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,947
there, the warp and the west here, the

7560
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,122
kind of the weave that you guys were

7570
00:31:42,155 --> 00:31:45,292
working on on this paper was the stasis

7580
00:31:45,352 --> 00:31:47,567
and the interoception. Those were your

7590
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:51,652
focal point. Right. And then you've

7600
00:31:51,682 --> 00:31:54,047
spent quite a bit in sort of prepping us

7610
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,112
for the difference between the discreet

7620
00:31:57,262 --> 00:32:00,272
time aspect of what you're looking at

7630
00:32:00,305 --> 00:32:03,002
and the global capture rate because you

7640
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,202
say we can't get fixed.

7650
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,877
This is what I'm saying. I want to make

7660
00:32:07,895 --> 00:32:10,772
sure my shoot is packed properly. And

7670
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:14,042
then you're talking about biology and

7680
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:17,867
physiology. So just on that

7690
00:32:17,915 --> 00:32:20,657
great big am I going to go splat or am I

7700
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,122
going to be able to land this relatively

7710
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:26,700
softly? Can you maybe just

7720
00:32:27,287 --> 00:32:30,272
tell me whether or not that is in fact,

7730
00:32:30,455 --> 00:32:33,122
is it a comparison? Is it an

7740
00:32:33,155 --> 00:32:35,312
intersection? Are these things running

7750
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:37,822
in parallel? How much of this is risk

7760
00:32:37,867 --> 00:32:40,217
management versus how much of this is

7770
00:32:40,265 --> 00:32:41,262
strategic?

7780
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:46,697
Speaker B: I would think of it more as an

7790
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:50,227
intersection. And when we're

7800
00:32:50,257 --> 00:32:52,012
specifically referring to quantities

7810
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:55,247
like the global capture rate, those are

7820
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,512
intended to be strategic rather than

7830
00:32:57,575 --> 00:33:00,750
risk management or epistemic value.

7840
00:33:03,362 --> 00:33:06,572
So specifically there there's a whole

7850
00:33:06,605 --> 00:33:09,677
book on this, let's say Vigor the

7860
00:33:09,695 --> 00:33:11,897
Neuroeconomics of Movement Control by

7870
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:16,022
Reza Shadmir, and it chronicles in

7880
00:33:16,055 --> 00:33:18,787
very long form extensively the empirical

7890
00:33:18,862 --> 00:33:22,862
evidence that real

7900
00:33:22,925 --> 00:33:26,192
organisms will time average their

7910
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,822
reward rate. So in order to move from

7920
00:33:29,855 --> 00:33:33,162
an episodic setting to a continual

7930
00:33:33,962 --> 00:33:36,247
control settling point, a continual

7940
00:33:36,442 --> 00:33:40,027
lifelong setting, you need some notion

7950
00:33:40,057 --> 00:33:43,097
of indefinite time control. Obviously,

7960
00:33:43,205 --> 00:33:46,147
you're not going to live until T reaches

7970
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:49,417
infinity. But in the limit,

7980
00:33:49,477 --> 00:33:51,557
you do need to have a coherent control

7990
00:33:51,635 --> 00:33:54,592
problem, at least for modeling purposes,

8000
00:33:54,652 --> 00:33:58,067
because you can't fix the end of, say,

8010
00:33:58,115 --> 00:34:01,812
a bird's life in the lab on a laptop.

8020
00:34:04,112 --> 00:34:06,302
And there's two ways conventionally to

8030
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,127
do that. One is this notion of the

8040
00:34:10,145 --> 00:34:12,812
global capture rate. So the time

8050
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:16,072
average, the sum of all benefits minus

8060
00:34:16,117 --> 00:34:18,422
the sum of all costs divided by the

8070
00:34:18,455 --> 00:34:21,737
total amount of time, and the other is

8080
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,562
exponential discounting.

8090
00:34:25,562 --> 00:34:27,912
Now, for engineering purposes,

8100
00:34:28,637 --> 00:34:30,932
exponential discounting makes the

8110
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:33,837
mathematicians much more tractable.

8120
00:34:34,937 --> 00:34:37,097
And so in the early two thousands, they

8130
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:40,062
essentially found that the real brains,

8140
00:34:40,637 --> 00:34:44,227
like basal ganglia and dopaminergic

8150
00:34:44,257 --> 00:34:47,942
firing are best fitted by time

8160
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:51,682
averaging. And then on the computational

8170
00:34:51,772 --> 00:34:53,792
side, everyone ignored that and did

8180
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,437
exponential discounting.

8190
00:34:57,362 --> 00:35:00,047
And so really, when we talk about

8200
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,742
something like a global capture rate,

8210
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:04,352
we're just saying we're going with the

8220
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:07,727
biological evidence and writing down a

8230
00:35:07,745 --> 00:35:10,502
model that accounts best for the

8240
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,622
empirical findings. If you want to,

8250
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:15,827
quote, unquote, try this at home, you

8260
00:35:15,845 --> 00:35:17,702
are perfectly welcome to go ahead and

8270
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,752
switch to exponential discounting. It's

8280
00:35:20,782 --> 00:35:23,552
fine. Or the machine learning community

8290
00:35:23,645 --> 00:35:25,472
is starting to come out with papers on

8300
00:35:25,505 --> 00:35:28,892
time averaging lately, the past

8310
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,000
couple of years.

8320
00:35:33,737 --> 00:35:35,507
Speaker D: That's one more quick question then. Of

8330
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,072
course. Yeah. Thank you for that

8340
00:35:38,105 --> 00:35:41,497
explanation. So if we're raising

8350
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:44,447
the question around tractability, that

8360
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,937
assumes that there's some sort of

8370
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,547
slipperyness or some fluidity piece to

8380
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,425
this thing that we're looking at.

8390
00:35:53,087 --> 00:35:56,625
What is that? What is that thing,

8400
00:35:57,137 --> 00:36:00,022
that's fluid, that's slippery, that's

8410
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:03,047
causing us to not normally be able to

8420
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,627
model? Is that a feature or is that a

8430
00:36:05,645 --> 00:36:08,822
flaw? I would say

8440
00:36:08,855 --> 00:36:12,202
the slippery no is the slip between map

8450
00:36:12,232 --> 00:36:13,287
and territory.

8460
00:36:15,062 --> 00:36:18,687
So when talking about real brains,

8470
00:36:19,862 --> 00:36:22,867
we know that we observe time averaging

8480
00:36:22,927 --> 00:36:26,597
in the territory. What we

8490
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,502
don't know how to do is write an

8500
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,557
algorithm that provably,

8510
00:36:32,647 --> 00:36:35,337
produces correct time averaging,

8520
00:36:35,762 --> 00:36:38,412
and works in practice and engineering.

8530
00:36:40,037 --> 00:36:42,452
So let's even say rather than map and

8540
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,507
territory because the scientist has a

8550
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:47,887
map as well, let's say the slippage

8560
00:36:47,962 --> 00:36:50,972
is between empirical science and

8570
00:36:51,005 --> 00:36:51,987
engineering.

8580
00:36:55,487 --> 00:36:58,097
And when we write out our model, we are

8590
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,842
really trying to address the empirical

8600
00:36:59,902 --> 00:37:02,412
science. And we don't mind if engineers

8610
00:37:03,362 --> 00:37:06,000
want to make their little slippage and

8620
00:37:06,587 --> 00:37:08,327
use something that just makes the

8630
00:37:08,345 --> 00:37:11,775
algorithmics easier, that's fine.

8640
00:37:13,187 --> 00:37:14,797
And in fact, that is what the deep

8650
00:37:14,842 --> 00:37:16,875
active inference community does.

8660
00:37:21,062 --> 00:37:22,922
Okay, so heading back a little more

8670
00:37:22,955 --> 00:37:26,867
towards active inference when we

8680
00:37:26,915 --> 00:37:30,152
read all of this stuff, this is sort of

8690
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:33,022
a bit of a bible for our lab, Sterling

8700
00:37:33,067 --> 00:37:36,727
and Loughlin. So Simon

8710
00:37:36,757 --> 00:37:38,627
Loughlin was involved in some of the

8720
00:37:38,645 --> 00:37:40,672
earliest publications on predictive

8730
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:44,542
coding in the Fly retina. Peter Sterling

8740
00:37:44,677 --> 00:37:47,552
is the originator of the concept of

8750
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:51,312
allostasis. And what we actually notice,

8760
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:54,077
as mentioned a bit earlier, is this sort

8770
00:37:54,095 --> 00:37:56,597
of slippage, another slippage or

8780
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:00,975
contradiction. So they say

8790
00:38:01,337 --> 00:38:04,397
when you get a reward, some dopamine is

8800
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:08,242
released this invokes a reinforcement

8810
00:38:08,302 --> 00:38:12,612
learning principal algorithm.

8820
00:38:14,012 --> 00:38:15,847
Let's be careful with neural circuits

8830
00:38:15,892 --> 00:38:17,552
that we're not studying in detail for

8840
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:20,617
the moment. That is, let's be careful

8850
00:38:20,677 --> 00:38:22,292
how strong a statement we make about

8860
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:26,102
their function. And then most of the

8870
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,707
empirical evidence they review in the

8880
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,702
book is about the energy efficiency of

8890
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,987
sensory firing.

8900
00:38:33,137 --> 00:38:36,872
So we're really trying to say we

8910
00:38:36,905 --> 00:38:40,912
want to move from something grounded

8920
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:43,887
in minimizing a prediction error,

8930
00:38:44,462 --> 00:38:48,002
variational inference to something

8940
00:38:48,095 --> 00:38:51,847
grounded ideally with an optimality

8950
00:38:51,892 --> 00:38:53,475
principle in control.

8960
00:38:57,562 --> 00:39:00,262
So then there are some arguments for

8970
00:39:00,325 --> 00:39:04,027
neuroscientists which are more or

8980
00:39:04,045 --> 00:39:07,452
less intended to convince the viewing

8990
00:39:07,482 --> 00:39:10,647
neuroscientists that people studying

9000
00:39:10,692 --> 00:39:14,142
interception and people studying motor

9010
00:39:14,202 --> 00:39:17,542
neuroscience need to work together on

9020
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:20,572
studying the visceral. You can't study

9030
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:23,247
the visceral and ignore the motor branch

9040
00:39:23,292 --> 00:39:26,227
of the visceral nervous system and the

9050
00:39:26,245 --> 00:39:28,412
functions of that motor branch.

9060
00:39:31,237 --> 00:39:34,027
Now, regarding our statement of you

9070
00:39:34,045 --> 00:39:36,137
can't just minimize prediction error,

9080
00:39:36,637 --> 00:39:38,502
one might ask, what about active

9090
00:39:38,532 --> 00:39:43,057
inference? And there

9100
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:45,277
we have to start being careful with the

9110
00:39:45,295 --> 00:39:49,777
term active inference because as

9120
00:39:49,795 --> 00:39:51,907
I have had it personally explained to me

9130
00:39:51,985 --> 00:39:54,397
at length, there are at least the two

9140
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:57,887
different kinds of active inference.

9150
00:39:58,537 --> 00:40:00,350
There's this very old,

9160
00:40:01,612 --> 00:40:04,187
I think it was Adams 2013,

9170
00:40:04,987 --> 00:40:06,792
you know, motor active inference

9180
00:40:06,852 --> 00:40:08,772
predictions not commands active

9190
00:40:08,817 --> 00:40:11,472
inference in the motor in the motor

9200
00:40:11,517 --> 00:40:14,722
system. And then there's this

9210
00:40:14,755 --> 00:40:17,387
notion of decision active inference,

9220
00:40:17,962 --> 00:40:20,225
where you have an expected free energy,

9230
00:40:20,887 --> 00:40:23,422
explicit prior preferences, and so on

9240
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:26,802
and so on. And if you talk to the active

9250
00:40:26,832 --> 00:40:30,282
inference community, read the papers

9260
00:40:30,372 --> 00:40:31,897
that they can write for their own

9270
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,587
community. I would particularly

9280
00:40:34,662 --> 00:40:36,727
recommend the International Workshop on

9290
00:40:36,745 --> 00:40:38,827
Active Inference, which I believe is

9300
00:40:38,845 --> 00:40:40,925
gain to be a conference next year.

9310
00:40:42,187 --> 00:40:44,017
They have three years of very good

9320
00:40:44,065 --> 00:40:47,347
papers where many authors sketch out the

9330
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:51,207
explicit connections between active

9340
00:40:51,222 --> 00:40:53,912
inference, control as inference,

9350
00:40:54,412 --> 00:40:55,775
optimal control,

9360
00:40:57,412 --> 00:41:01,462
etc. So really, when we bang on saying

9370
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,822
don't use active inference to reduce

9380
00:41:03,867 --> 00:41:05,900
motor function to sensory function,

9390
00:41:06,637 --> 00:41:09,607
we're talking to some psychologists and

9400
00:41:09,685 --> 00:41:12,575
philosophers who have been,

9410
00:41:13,087 --> 00:41:15,442
let's say, quite enthusiastic about

9420
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:18,787
predictive processing, but a bit

9430
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,902
eliminative is about some of the

9440
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,597
mathematical constructs that are

9450
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,887
actually used in active. Inference.

9460
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:31,737
So then for our psychologist audience,

9470
00:41:32,312 --> 00:41:34,727
we have once again the argument that we

9480
00:41:34,745 --> 00:41:38,087
are basically showing that you can

9490
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,497
and should do a fully probabilistic

9500
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:44,642
notion of optimal control in order

9510
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:47,222
to sort out what is going on with

9520
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:50,672
allostatic regulation. And we're going

9530
00:41:50,705 --> 00:41:53,152
to take some inspiration from motor

9540
00:41:53,182 --> 00:41:55,200
neuroanatomy in doing it.

9550
00:42:00,175 --> 00:42:03,862
So looking at a simple model system,

9560
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:06,790
and this is getting into figures from

9570
00:42:06,807 --> 00:42:10,965
the paper, we have our Barrow reflex

9580
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,950
exafferent response curve.

9590
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,965
You have a kerated barrel receptor.

9600
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,400
It's in the keratid artery in the neck.

9610
00:42:19,825 --> 00:42:23,415
It measures blood pressure projects

9620
00:42:23,445 --> 00:42:27,070
to a circuit in the NTS in

9630
00:42:27,072 --> 00:42:28,250
the brain stem.

9640
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,190
And we bring this up here because the

9650
00:42:33,207 --> 00:42:36,070
barrel receptor is often used as a model

9660
00:42:36,147 --> 00:42:39,835
interceptor. When I talked to Karen and

9670
00:42:39,867 --> 00:42:42,800
asked for model systems of interception,

9680
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:45,265
she actually said, well, let's think

9690
00:42:45,282 --> 00:42:48,580
about the barrel receptor first and

9700
00:42:48,627 --> 00:42:52,360
again with contradiction. What we

9710
00:42:52,392 --> 00:42:54,555
actually find, looking at the anatomy,

9720
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:57,465
is that the barrel receptor, the caroted

9730
00:42:57,495 --> 00:43:00,810
barrel receptor, is the sensory branch

9740
00:43:00,855 --> 00:43:03,350
of a low level control circuit.

9750
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,237
So the NTS will then have,

9760
00:43:09,925 --> 00:43:13,912
I believe, the middle inflection point

9770
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:16,710
is coded in the NTS here and doesn't

9780
00:43:16,755 --> 00:43:19,375
really change much. But what does happen

9790
00:43:19,437 --> 00:43:21,585
is that you can get top down commands

9800
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:25,035
flowing into the NTS and then changing

9810
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,330
the gain of this circuit so the

9820
00:43:28,377 --> 00:43:31,930
slope of the curve, and if you

9830
00:43:31,977 --> 00:43:35,230
widen that slope so that the curve is

9840
00:43:35,277 --> 00:43:39,105
shallower, then you're preserving

9850
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,700
responsiveness,

9860
00:43:43,825 --> 00:43:47,760
you're widening the approximately linear

9870
00:43:47,955 --> 00:43:51,190
portion of the curve while allowing for

9880
00:43:51,207 --> 00:43:53,287
the blood pressure to rise and fall.

9890
00:43:55,225 --> 00:43:56,965
And so again, we see for the

9900
00:43:56,982 --> 00:44:00,190
interception people that you really need

9910
00:44:00,207 --> 00:44:03,160
to think about what is the role of this

9920
00:44:03,192 --> 00:44:07,165
interceptor in control of the

9930
00:44:07,182 --> 00:44:10,485
body and of the visceral. You can't

9940
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:13,185
just look at it and say it's a sensor.

9950
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,965
Okay, it's a sensor. Where does it

9960
00:44:14,982 --> 00:44:19,290
project you? Interoception cortex?

9970
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:22,060
No, no, not necessarily like, you know,

9980
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:24,630
the error, the prediction error signals

9990
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:28,135
that reach interceptive cortex to

10000
00:44:28,167 --> 00:44:30,330
say, you know, I can't pump enough blood

10010
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:33,340
or something like that, might actually

10020
00:44:33,432 --> 00:44:37,090
have already been processed by what

10030
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:38,985
I believe in the motor active inference

10040
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,935
literature is called a reflex arc. So

10050
00:44:41,967 --> 00:44:44,595
there might already be a reflex

10060
00:44:44,685 --> 00:44:47,455
controller that has operated on that

10070
00:44:47,502 --> 00:44:49,450
signal by the time it reaches the higher

10080
00:44:49,512 --> 00:44:50,900
portions of the brain.

10090
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,810
So in our paper, we set out some

10100
00:44:55,917 --> 00:44:58,960
vocabulary for people to use if they

10110
00:44:58,992 --> 00:45:03,405
want to, don't have to capacity curve

10120
00:45:03,465 --> 00:45:05,320
in particular, we're going to tie it to

10130
00:45:05,322 --> 00:45:07,200
the notion of a cumulative distribution

10140
00:45:07,275 --> 00:45:09,487
function later on.

10150
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:14,485
There's some physiology terminology for

10160
00:45:14,517 --> 00:45:17,785
people who want to learn it. And then

10170
00:45:17,817 --> 00:45:19,635
we note the same thing that Carpenter

10180
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,140
does, carpenter and a

10190
00:45:23,157 --> 00:45:25,537
number of other papers, which is that

10200
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:28,215
this is a massively hierarchical

10210
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,362
controls system.

10220
00:45:31,675 --> 00:45:35,295
Lots of regulated substances,

10230
00:45:35,385 --> 00:45:39,060
let's say, or regulated variables

10240
00:45:39,105 --> 00:45:41,355
are going to have multiple controllers

10250
00:45:41,415 --> 00:45:44,975
influencing them. So, for instance,

10260
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,690
blood nutrient levels, not just glucose,

10270
00:45:48,795 --> 00:45:52,100
but I believe, like salt, fat,

10280
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:55,875
water, are regulated

10290
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:59,185
by pairs of hormones. Sometimes there

10300
00:45:59,217 --> 00:46:01,630
will be multiple pairs of hormones per

10310
00:46:01,677 --> 00:46:04,700
nutrient that has to be in the blood.

10320
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,515
And this isn't a convex trade off. So

10330
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:11,325
that's not antagonistic competitive

10340
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,610
regulation. They can appear to compete

10350
00:46:14,655 --> 00:46:17,985
sometimes, but actually it's cooperative

10360
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:21,760
regulation based on the fact

10370
00:46:21,792 --> 00:46:23,655
that, so to speak, chemical species

10380
00:46:23,715 --> 00:46:27,415
can't encode negative numbers the

10390
00:46:27,432 --> 00:46:30,490
way a digital signal can. So when you do

10400
00:46:30,507 --> 00:46:32,830
things with chemical signals, having

10410
00:46:32,877 --> 00:46:35,887
these pairs turns out to be the way to

10420
00:46:36,625 --> 00:46:39,915
monitor and control the dynamic range

10430
00:46:40,095 --> 00:46:42,125
with the greatest sensitivity.

10440
00:46:44,425 --> 00:46:46,800
So then, using this example of leucaena

10450
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:50,035
and insulin, we can see that sort of

10460
00:46:50,067 --> 00:46:53,440
normal glycemia is really more of a

10470
00:46:53,457 --> 00:46:56,790
range. And it's a range where you're

10480
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,875
going to have approximately linear

10490
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:03,050
response of insulin activity

10500
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:07,087
and you're going to have saturated out

10510
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,365
or really you're going to have threshold

10520
00:47:10,395 --> 00:47:14,140
value glucagon activity. So at

10530
00:47:14,157 --> 00:47:17,235
a normal level of blood sugar, glucagon

10540
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,575
does not have to retrieve additional

10550
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:21,715
blood sugar from the intestines or the

10560
00:47:21,732 --> 00:47:24,730
liver. It doesn't have to call for

10570
00:47:24,777 --> 00:47:26,450
burning fat reserves.

10580
00:47:28,075 --> 00:47:30,040
Essentially, you've eaten enough for the

10590
00:47:30,057 --> 00:47:34,925
day, you're fine. Insulin is responsive

10600
00:47:35,275 --> 00:47:37,465
in a highly response curve where it can

10610
00:47:37,482 --> 00:47:39,255
give a linear response to a linear

10620
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:43,025
change in order to compensate for noise.

10630
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,810
So now we can actually get towards and

10640
00:47:48,842 --> 00:47:50,565
now that we have a controller way to

10650
00:47:50,582 --> 00:47:53,910
think about physiology, we can get more

10660
00:47:53,942 --> 00:47:56,465
towards these notions of active

10670
00:47:56,495 --> 00:47:59,610
inference. And here we're going to go

10680
00:47:59,642 --> 00:48:03,180
back to some of the sources that

10690
00:48:03,227 --> 00:48:06,690
gave us motor active inference. One way

10700
00:48:06,707 --> 00:48:10,062
to think about motor active inference is

10710
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,075
the brain sends a prediction. The reflex

10720
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:16,065
arc in the spinal cord attempts to

10730
00:48:16,082 --> 00:48:19,380
minimize prediction error by

10740
00:48:19,427 --> 00:48:22,620
comparing the prediction with the value

10750
00:48:22,697 --> 00:48:24,700
read off of appropriator.

10760
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:30,630
So again, one way to think about that is

10770
00:48:30,677 --> 00:48:33,170
having a few extra ways to minimize

10780
00:48:33,335 --> 00:48:36,700
prediction error, really entropy.

10790
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:40,560
Another way to think about that is to

10800
00:48:40,592 --> 00:48:42,275
think of having a very elementary

10810
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:45,837
control system at the reflex arc level,

10820
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:50,337
and then the brain prescribes the

10830
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:53,105
reference length that is the reference

10840
00:48:53,165 --> 00:48:56,340
signal for that controller. And it just

10850
00:48:56,357 --> 00:48:58,080
tries to minimize the difference between

10860
00:48:58,127 --> 00:49:00,585
what it gets off Approprioceptor, what

10870
00:49:00,617 --> 00:49:02,940
it reads, the actual muscle length and

10880
00:49:02,957 --> 00:49:06,325
tension, and the reference signal.

10890
00:49:07,425 --> 00:49:09,930
And this is actually a very I'd almost

10900
00:49:09,977 --> 00:49:13,800
call it a fun circuit to study because

10910
00:49:13,862 --> 00:49:16,812
of just how well documented it is,

10920
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:19,812
that there's something very much like,

10930
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,805
I would almost say, like a precision

10940
00:49:22,865 --> 00:49:25,812
weighted pig controller in there.

10950
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,110
If you're a math person, then a muscle

10960
00:49:30,155 --> 00:49:33,465
is kind of like a spring. A spring can

10970
00:49:33,482 --> 00:49:36,890
be the dynamics for a spring metal

10980
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:40,560
spring, stretch it and crunch it can be

10990
00:49:40,667 --> 00:49:42,837
linearized around certain points.

11000
00:49:43,575 --> 00:49:46,035
And so you can just about write down an

11010
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:49,595
LTI pit control error, a musk

11020
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:51,625
for an individual muscle spindle,

11030
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,055
and you'll get two parameters coming

11040
00:49:56,102 --> 00:49:57,960
down from the brain, one of which says

11050
00:49:57,992 --> 00:50:00,615
the reference length and the other of

11060
00:50:00,632 --> 00:50:03,480
which says, what's the sensitivity or

11070
00:50:03,527 --> 00:50:06,240
gain against perturbation? That you

11080
00:50:06,257 --> 00:50:09,255
should exercise. And this is actually

11090
00:50:09,302 --> 00:50:11,715
how your voluntary movements are

11100
00:50:11,732 --> 00:50:14,937
engaged. So really

11110
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,660
all of this stuff about references that

11120
00:50:18,692 --> 00:50:22,275
we're talking about here is just putting

11130
00:50:22,337 --> 00:50:25,050
forward to the hypothesis that maybe

11140
00:50:25,112 --> 00:50:27,555
visceral motor control works on the same

11150
00:50:27,602 --> 00:50:31,225
computational and anatomical principles

11160
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:34,362
as voluntary. somatomotor control.

11170
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,035
Speaker D: Of course. Instead of the commands

11180
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,495
coming down from say. somatomotor

11190
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:44,760
cortex. They might be coming from

11200
00:50:44,942 --> 00:50:47,787
ganglia in the autonomic nervous system

11210
00:50:49,425 --> 00:50:51,440
with the higher level central nervous

11220
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:54,830
system basically just prescribing rough

11230
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:58,730
levels of activity activation

11240
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:00,675
or deactivation for the two different

11250
00:51:00,737 --> 00:51:03,012
sides of the autonomic nervous system.

11260
00:51:03,675 --> 00:51:05,705
Which then again in this opponent

11270
00:51:05,765 --> 00:51:09,305
fashion. Semioponant fully cooperative

11280
00:51:09,365 --> 00:51:12,860
fashion. Allow us to avoid encoding

11290
00:51:12,905 --> 00:51:15,230
digital negative numbers and thereby

11300
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:18,255
give you very finely balanced control

11310
00:51:18,377 --> 00:51:23,185
over the internal mileage.

11320
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:26,660
So we eventually get to our figure which

11330
00:51:26,692 --> 00:51:30,925
essentially says if I know what resource

11340
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,350
supplies. Metabolic resource supplies.

11350
00:51:35,825 --> 00:51:38,585
Nutrients. Oxygen. Carbon dioxide. That

11360
00:51:38,617 --> 00:51:42,380
sort of thing I'm going to have

11370
00:51:42,502 --> 00:51:45,890
in the future. Then my goal is

11380
00:51:45,907 --> 00:51:49,610
going to be. Let's not say to

11390
00:51:49,642 --> 00:51:52,810
maximize uncertainty. Nor to minimize

11400
00:51:52,855 --> 00:51:54,805
uncertainty. But really to maximize

11410
00:51:54,865 --> 00:51:58,955
resilience or freedom to

11420
00:51:59,002 --> 00:52:03,095
stay in the linear portion of a

11430
00:52:03,097 --> 00:52:06,635
cumulative distribution function where

11440
00:52:06,667 --> 00:52:10,840
you can be responsive to any remaining

11450
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:14,855
or upcoming perturbation. And so we draw

11460
00:52:14,902 --> 00:52:17,230
here that you can have this capacity

11470
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:21,380
estimator close the loop and

11480
00:52:21,427 --> 00:52:24,760
start directing motor actions via active

11490
00:52:24,805 --> 00:52:27,905
inference in order to

11500
00:52:27,952 --> 00:52:31,480
follow this preference for resilience

11510
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:33,835
against perturbation of the internal

11520
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,150
milieu, which is then tied

11530
00:52:37,225 --> 00:52:40,200
to interceptive state estimation,

11540
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:43,595
your other state estimate, your actual

11550
00:52:43,672 --> 00:52:47,630
sensory services and

11560
00:52:47,677 --> 00:52:50,175
this whole wiring diagram.

11570
00:52:52,475 --> 00:52:54,410
Speaker C: And maybe one thing just to add to

11580
00:52:54,442 --> 00:52:56,240
right, just to underscore a point is

11590
00:52:56,257 --> 00:52:58,910
that what I think if you go back one

11600
00:52:58,942 --> 00:52:59,912
slide here.

11610
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,690
Speaker B: How this. Relates to the sort of

11620
00:53:05,707 --> 00:53:07,385
adaptive range of the settling point

11630
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:08,705
too. And what I think is really

11640
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:10,787
interesting about this, right, is that

11650
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,330
you're not defining like when we started

11660
00:53:14,377 --> 00:53:16,010
out talking about how you might

11670
00:53:16,042 --> 00:53:17,570
traditionally think about set points for

11680
00:53:17,572 --> 00:53:19,675
allostasis in like a very traditional

11690
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:22,690
thermostat model, right? What you're

11700
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,165
talking about here is that there's

11710
00:53:25,195 --> 00:53:29,125
actually if the overall goal

11720
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,385
of the brain. If the brain is

11730
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:33,560
essentially there to help regulate and

11740
00:53:33,592 --> 00:53:36,835
adapt the sort of entire biological

11750
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,510
system of the body to circumstances

11760
00:53:40,555 --> 00:53:42,095
outside of it that are constantly going

11770
00:53:42,097 --> 00:53:43,940
to be changing different challenges that

11780
00:53:43,957 --> 00:53:46,037
it's going to have to be responsive to.

11790
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,980
Then you don't necessarily have a set

11800
00:53:49,027 --> 00:53:54,710
point. But you have a range where

11810
00:53:54,742 --> 00:53:57,650
the physiology can be most adaptable to

11820
00:53:57,712 --> 00:53:59,920
those perturbations and challenges.

11830
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:03,590
Right? And so even just, I think to

11840
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:07,190
simplify, I think that idea is

11850
00:54:07,207 --> 00:54:08,315
really at the core of what we're trying

11860
00:54:08,332 --> 00:54:10,760
to talk about regularly, that you

11870
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:14,690
essentially want to have a

11880
00:54:14,707 --> 00:54:16,715
range where the physiology can be

11890
00:54:16,732 --> 00:54:20,165
adaptive. And you would imagine that if

11900
00:54:20,182 --> 00:54:22,835
the physiology is if some of these

11910
00:54:22,867 --> 00:54:25,490
parameters are pushed way far outside of

11920
00:54:25,507 --> 00:54:28,495
the center of that sigmoid, then you're

11930
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:30,305
going to have a problem in that they

11940
00:54:30,352 --> 00:54:33,935
will not be able to adapt to

11950
00:54:33,967 --> 00:54:35,990
changes. You're not going to be able to

11960
00:54:36,007 --> 00:54:37,765
be at that linear point of maximum

11970
00:54:37,795 --> 00:54:41,015
stability if you're down here near the.

11980
00:54:41,032 --> 00:54:44,360
Speaker B: Threshold and you get some

11990
00:54:44,392 --> 00:54:46,580
random white noise that pushes you over

12000
00:54:46,627 --> 00:54:49,895
that threshold, obviously there isn't a

12010
00:54:49,897 --> 00:54:53,270
discrete catastrophic failure. But also,

12020
00:54:53,347 --> 00:54:55,865
obviously, you can no longer mount a

12030
00:54:55,882 --> 00:54:59,675
proportional response. Your body

12040
00:54:59,737 --> 00:55:02,630
is made of physical instruments which

12050
00:55:02,677 --> 00:55:06,750
have a limited range of responsiveness.

12060
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:12,635
Speaker C: Yeah. And so our notion of allostasis to

12070
00:55:12,667 --> 00:55:17,020
say, when you can widen

12080
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:20,555
the range of responsiveness rather than

12090
00:55:20,602 --> 00:55:23,665
narrowing it, or rather widen the range

12100
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:27,005
of responsiveness when possible, while

12110
00:55:27,052 --> 00:55:29,690
narrowing the set of states or the

12120
00:55:29,707 --> 00:55:31,595
distribution of states that you actually

12130
00:55:31,672 --> 00:55:35,885
fall into look

12140
00:55:35,917 --> 00:55:37,937
like doing somewhat opposite things.

12150
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:41,105
Speaker C: And so would it be the case, too right.

12160
00:55:41,152 --> 00:55:44,225
That you could have there's different

12170
00:55:44,287 --> 00:55:46,810
ways that you can have these systems

12180
00:55:46,855 --> 00:55:52,535
become sort of maladaptive if

12190
00:55:52,567 --> 00:55:54,640
that sigmoid becomes steeper and steeper

12200
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:56,687
and steeper, where you basically have

12210
00:55:57,275 --> 00:55:59,690
just a very, very narrow range, where

12220
00:55:59,707 --> 00:56:01,135
you can actually have an adaptive

12230
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:03,550
response. That can be one potential

12240
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:05,990
problem. Another potential problem can

12250
00:56:06,007 --> 00:56:08,660
be when the sort of baseline level like

12260
00:56:08,692 --> 00:56:11,090
you're saying is pushed far outside of

12270
00:56:11,107 --> 00:56:14,120
that threshold, then also you're going

12280
00:56:14,122 --> 00:56:16,010
to require a lot more work and a lot

12290
00:56:16,042 --> 00:56:18,440
more control or a lot more control of

12300
00:56:18,457 --> 00:56:21,710
that system needed to really push it far

12310
00:56:21,742 --> 00:56:24,445
outside of that range. To actually adapt

12320
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:27,185
to push it back. Really. To push it back

12330
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:30,605
again. Yes. Which could cause other

12340
00:56:30,652 --> 00:56:32,690
problems downstream as well. Right, but

12350
00:56:32,707 --> 00:56:38,135
the point is just that the

12360
00:56:38,167 --> 00:56:39,755
sort of range that you want the system

12370
00:56:39,802 --> 00:56:41,840
to settle into is a range where it can

12380
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:45,140
be adaptive to changes and prepare for

12390
00:56:45,232 --> 00:56:47,110
fluctuating sorts of circumstances,

12400
00:56:47,155 --> 00:56:50,855
right? Yeah. So I think

12410
00:56:50,902 --> 00:56:54,665
a good intuition to leave with,

12420
00:56:54,757 --> 00:56:56,465
since we are getting drawn towards the

12430
00:56:56,482 --> 00:57:00,290
end of the hour, is that if

12440
00:57:00,307 --> 00:57:03,115
you were to try to minimize interceptive

12450
00:57:03,145 --> 00:57:06,485
uncertainty, then what you might do is

12460
00:57:06,517 --> 00:57:09,155
just stay home all the time, your heart

12470
00:57:09,202 --> 00:57:11,135
rate will never vary too much up and

12480
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,810
down. And we're living in the modern

12490
00:57:13,855 --> 00:57:15,110
world where you don't have to run away

12500
00:57:15,142 --> 00:57:18,440
from tigers. So why deal with the

12510
00:57:18,457 --> 00:57:20,925
uncertainty of going out and exercising,

12520
00:57:21,425 --> 00:57:23,585
or the perturbation of going out and

12530
00:57:23,617 --> 00:57:26,765
exercising? And what our notion of

12540
00:57:26,782 --> 00:57:29,400
allostasis here might tell you in reply

12550
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:34,240
is to say when you go out and exercise,

12560
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:38,110
the curve gets wider and so the adaptive

12570
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:40,855
range where you can mount a proportional

12580
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:43,500
response gets wider.

12590
00:57:44,225 --> 00:57:46,685
So go out and exercise because it

12600
00:57:46,717 --> 00:57:49,385
actually increases your resilience to

12610
00:57:49,417 --> 00:57:51,505
physiology, to future physiological

12620
00:57:51,565 --> 00:57:55,085
challenge. So it's still within the

12630
00:57:55,117 --> 00:57:58,385
active inference set of intuitions, but

12640
00:57:58,417 --> 00:58:00,675
we're really baking in this assumption

12650
00:58:01,025 --> 00:58:03,310
that you should preemptively prepare

12660
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:06,675
yourself against possible challenge

12670
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:11,105
rather than effective, rather than

12680
00:58:11,152 --> 00:58:13,575
acting to avoid possible challenge.

12690
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,105
We've moved the handling of challenge

12700
00:58:16,165 --> 00:58:17,237
into the body.

12710
00:58:20,075 --> 00:58:20,937
Dean, go ahead.

20010
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,155
Speaker A: As you get to those extremes of those

20020
00:58:24,202 --> 00:58:26,435
crisis moments, we talk about a little

20030
00:58:26,467 --> 00:58:29,180
bit about this in the Dot Zero. How does

20040
00:58:29,227 --> 00:58:32,155
the interplay or the instructional

20050
00:58:32,215 --> 00:58:36,110
proportion change between something

20060
00:58:36,142 --> 00:58:40,360
that's interactive and range seeking

20070
00:58:40,555 --> 00:58:44,400
to range reentering?

20080
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:49,070
I'm curious if the normalisms change as

20090
00:58:49,222 --> 00:58:52,490
those extremes are reached because, as

20100
00:58:52,507 --> 00:58:55,037
you said, things don't always become

20110
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:02,237
irreversibly catastrophically set

20120
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:06,212
based on what you guys have obviously

20130
00:59:06,575 --> 00:59:09,287
looked at, what's your sense about how

20140
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:12,085
that relationship between interaction

20150
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:14,765
and instruction shifts as we get to

20160
00:59:14,782 --> 00:59:16,875
those really hard limits?

20170
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:20,135
Speaker B: Jordan, you're often a little better on

20180
00:59:20,167 --> 00:59:21,935
physiology than me. Do you want to take

20190
00:59:21,967 --> 00:59:25,865
this? I'm not sure. I think you

20200
00:59:25,882 --> 00:59:26,912
might have it.

20210
00:59:31,475 --> 00:59:33,737
So let's see.

20220
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,190
I'm honestly not so great on physiology

20230
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:41,237
because I rely on Karen for it.

20240
00:59:43,325 --> 00:59:45,235
Speaker B: I would almost say that there's a map

20250
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:49,385
territory failure here where we

20260
00:59:49,417 --> 00:59:52,190
were trying to model, so to speak,

20270
00:59:52,282 --> 00:59:57,010
normal function under normal

20280
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,655
function, with that intuition about

20290
00:59:58,702 --> 01:00:02,510
resilience against challenge. And

20300
01:00:02,542 --> 01:00:04,715
there's several possible responses to an

20310
01:00:04,732 --> 01:00:08,855
extreme circumstance. One is that some

20320
01:00:08,902 --> 01:00:12,125
high up control mechanism can start

20330
01:00:12,187 --> 01:00:15,287
overriding these operating plant,

20340
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,360
pushing them away from where they

20350
01:00:17,392 --> 01:00:19,340
normally are, and then that allows you

20360
01:00:19,357 --> 01:00:22,585
to deal with extreme circumstances

20370
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:24,515
by no longer treating them as errors at

20380
01:00:24,532 --> 01:00:27,675
all. So, say if you're sick,

20390
01:00:28,175 --> 01:00:30,505
your core body temperature is modulated

20400
01:00:30,565 --> 01:00:34,037
upwards. That puts you in a fever state.

20410
01:00:35,525 --> 01:00:38,465
This is expensive metabolically, and it

20420
01:00:38,482 --> 01:00:42,025
feels bad compared to how you normally

20430
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:45,525
function, but it should cook the germs.

20440
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:48,620
And then when the extreme state, you

20450
01:00:48,622 --> 01:00:51,662
know, when that emergency is over,

20460
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,515
supposedly, hopefully, usually you'll

20470
01:00:56,545 --> 01:00:58,487
be able to go back to normal function.

20480
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:01,715
There are, of course, exceptions, such

20490
01:01:01,732 --> 01:01:04,050
as, say, Long Covet.

20500
01:01:05,525 --> 01:01:06,287
Speaker C: Right.

20510
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:11,105
Speaker A: Just to make sure, though, do you see a

20520
01:01:11,152 --> 01:01:14,980
change in the amount of literally

20530
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,140
commands and the amount of back and

20540
01:01:18,157 --> 01:01:21,320
forth as you approach those

20550
01:01:21,472 --> 01:01:22,350
limits?

20560
01:01:26,912 --> 01:01:28,725
Or do you think they kind of just

20570
01:01:29,087 --> 01:01:31,427
realize that they're getting closer and

20580
01:01:31,445 --> 01:01:34,950
closer to a fall off point?

20590
01:01:36,062 --> 01:01:37,532
Speaker B: I think that's actually an open and

20600
01:01:37,535 --> 01:01:40,427
empirical question. So one of the

20610
01:01:40,445 --> 01:01:43,727
reasons that we went as far as writing a

20620
01:01:43,745 --> 01:01:47,267
full mathematical model in this paper is

20630
01:01:47,315 --> 01:01:51,272
because there often there

20640
01:01:51,305 --> 01:01:54,367
isn't that much empirical, neuro

20650
01:01:54,427 --> 01:01:56,897
computational work on interception at

20660
01:01:56,930 --> 01:02:00,302
all. So if you ask very basic questions

20670
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:03,757
like is interception

20680
01:02:03,847 --> 01:02:06,387
predictably coded below the neck?

20690
01:02:07,412 --> 01:02:09,150
That's still an open question.

20700
01:02:11,612 --> 01:02:13,202
It could be that peripheral and

20710
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:16,577
terraceptors are just transducing a

20720
01:02:16,595 --> 01:02:19,777
stimulus signal, and then it's

20730
01:02:19,807 --> 01:02:22,057
only predictably encoded when it hits

20740
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:25,132
the brain. We don't know yet. So we'd

20750
01:02:25,147 --> 01:02:26,775
rather have some.

20760
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:37,237
Speaker D: Briefly lost eli, but okay,

20770
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,062
while eli is rejoining. Okay, very

20780
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:48,835
interesting. Different path through

20790
01:02:48,867 --> 01:02:52,060
the same material. Dave, if your

20800
01:02:52,092 --> 01:02:53,800
question is for Eli, we can wait a few

20810
01:02:53,862 --> 01:02:57,610
seconds. Not necessarily. I have

20820
01:02:57,642 --> 01:03:00,765
just a side comment. You don't

20830
01:03:00,795 --> 01:03:02,440
necessarily have to respond to this.

20840
01:03:02,532 --> 01:03:04,330
The discussion reminds me of two

20850
01:03:04,377 --> 01:03:06,210
different fallacies. One is the dark

20860
01:03:06,255 --> 01:03:08,835
room fallacy. If you want to minimize

20870
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,040
it's a kind of a parody of active

20880
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:13,165
inference if you don't want to be if you

20890
01:03:13,182 --> 01:03:14,890
don't want to be surprised and just stay

20900
01:03:14,907 --> 01:03:16,645
in a dark room where nothing changes,

20910
01:03:16,722 --> 01:03:18,700
which has been dismissed pretty

20920
01:03:18,762 --> 01:03:20,730
thoroughly by an active inference

20930
01:03:20,865 --> 01:03:24,862
activist. Also, there was a

20940
01:03:25,375 --> 01:03:28,245
fallacy, kind of a social Darwinist

20950
01:03:28,335 --> 01:03:31,735
tinged interoception of

20960
01:03:31,767 --> 01:03:35,950
the observation that every species has

20970
01:03:36,087 --> 01:03:38,410
a fixed number of heartbeats and

20980
01:03:38,442 --> 01:03:41,290
therefore valuable people, members of

20990
01:03:41,307 --> 01:03:43,645
Parliament and clergymen, should not

21000
01:03:43,722 --> 01:03:45,910
work because you're eating up your

21010
01:03:45,942 --> 01:03:49,345
lifetime, which of course isn't true,

21020
01:03:49,422 --> 01:03:52,630
because your heartbeats more slowly, so

21030
01:03:52,677 --> 01:03:54,490
it's stretched out more if you're in

21040
01:03:54,507 --> 01:03:58,320
good shape, right? But more relevant,

21050
01:03:58,485 --> 01:04:01,180
the steepness of the reflex curve. I

21060
01:04:01,302 --> 01:04:03,790
sometimes feel that folks working in

21070
01:04:03,807 --> 01:04:07,180
active inference cover maybe too

21080
01:04:07,227 --> 01:04:10,605
much with the notion of precision.

21090
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:14,287
This is one quantity and it looks like

21100
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:19,175
that slope in the blood pressure curve.

21110
01:04:19,525 --> 01:04:23,050
Is that something that would tend to be

21120
01:04:23,112 --> 01:04:25,780
covered by the term precision? And if

21130
01:04:25,827 --> 01:04:28,885
so, should that be approached in a more

21140
01:04:28,917 --> 01:04:31,000
differentiated way rather than just

21150
01:04:31,062 --> 01:04:33,385
being a single number that applies in

21160
01:04:33,417 --> 01:04:36,085
lots and lots of areas of control and

21170
01:04:36,117 --> 01:04:38,962
perception? That's interesting.

21180
01:04:40,975 --> 01:04:43,090
So normally the precision right, is

21190
01:04:43,107 --> 01:04:45,430
normally applied to the predictions. So

21200
01:04:45,552 --> 01:04:48,145
there's an idea of the precision of the

21210
01:04:48,147 --> 01:04:49,690
predictions being applied. And in this

21220
01:04:49,707 --> 01:04:56,455
case I think the idea is more of so

21230
01:04:56,502 --> 01:05:03,675
it comes back to where the preferences

21240
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:05,565
being targeted in active inference

21250
01:05:05,595 --> 01:05:09,125
models and I think the slopes,

21260
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:11,995
the response curve there is instead

21270
01:05:12,072 --> 01:05:14,985
trying to target that use of prior

21280
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:18,115
preferences, right? So it's trying to

21290
01:05:18,132 --> 01:05:22,960
target specifically where is where

21300
01:05:22,992 --> 01:05:24,875
is the system trying to be navigated?

21310
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,590
When people talk about prior

21320
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:30,055
preferences, they've talked about it

21330
01:05:30,102 --> 01:05:33,565
sometimes in terms of the system

21340
01:05:33,657 --> 01:05:37,860
having strong precise priors

21350
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:39,200
being encoded,

21360
01:05:40,975 --> 01:05:44,515
like April I prior to being encoded to

21370
01:05:44,532 --> 01:05:48,337
be targeted. And in this case, I think

21380
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:52,450
we're trying to give an account of where

21390
01:05:52,512 --> 01:05:54,040
some of those fires can come from and

21400
01:05:54,057 --> 01:05:55,935
how these system and how opponent

21410
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:59,715
processes or opponent chemicals

21420
01:05:59,745 --> 01:06:05,215
can help regulate the physiology and

21430
01:06:05,232 --> 01:06:06,765
we're trying to get a more natural

21440
01:06:06,795 --> 01:06:08,200
approach of where those can come about

21450
01:06:08,262 --> 01:06:12,310
from. But I

21460
01:06:12,342 --> 01:06:12,937
think.

21470
01:06:16,812 --> 01:06:19,587
Speaker D: If it is replaced. I'm just trying to

21480
01:06:19,725 --> 01:06:20,952
talk aloud to think through the

21490
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:25,112
question. So if it is replacing

21500
01:06:25,187 --> 01:06:27,037
basically a prior preference,

21510
01:06:27,762 --> 01:06:30,992
and if normally

21520
01:06:31,052 --> 01:06:32,912
that prior preference would be handled

21530
01:06:32,987 --> 01:06:36,377
by a sort of precision

21540
01:06:36,407 --> 01:06:39,700
account of it, then to some extent the

21550
01:06:41,187 --> 01:06:43,272
steepness of that curve is trying to

21560
01:06:43,305 --> 01:06:46,302
tackle is somewhat of a replacement of

21570
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:55,787
the precision. But yeah,

21580
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:03,362
it's giving a different way of

21590
01:07:06,125 --> 01:07:07,640
maybe it is a replacement for the

21600
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:10,670
precision. In that case. Eli's back so I

21610
01:07:10,672 --> 01:07:12,490
can try to answer your question. Eli,

21620
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,940
do you want to complete your

21630
01:07:14,032 --> 01:07:17,090
presentation? Sure.

21640
01:07:17,182 --> 01:07:19,595
But just to answer the question, if

21650
01:07:19,597 --> 01:07:21,395
we're talking about the gain on one of

21660
01:07:21,397 --> 01:07:22,950
these sigmoid curves,

21670
01:07:23,825 --> 01:07:27,365
then yeah, that's sort of

21680
01:07:27,382 --> 01:07:28,985
a replacement for the precision, but

21690
01:07:29,017 --> 01:07:32,330
it's really thinking about it's thinking

21700
01:07:32,377 --> 01:07:34,712
about it the other way around.

21710
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:39,010
So a variance quantifies your tolerance

21720
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:42,515
for error, a precision or a

21730
01:07:42,532 --> 01:07:45,825
gain quantifies response to error.

21740
01:07:49,575 --> 01:07:52,905
Speaker D: Yes. So when you're talking about

21750
01:07:52,952 --> 01:07:56,615
purely sensory, these extra receptive

21760
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:00,275
signals, the ones that aren't

21770
01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:02,535
prescribing references to you in any

21780
01:08:02,567 --> 01:08:06,555
way, then of course you want to save

21790
01:08:06,602 --> 01:08:08,040
the neural response, which is

21800
01:08:08,057 --> 01:08:11,030
metabolically expensive for precise

21810
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:11,875
signals.

21820
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:17,125
If you're talking about an internal

21830
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,420
physiological curve, say,

21840
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:23,950
reaction to a change in blood pressure,

21850
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:28,605
then you want to try and make

21860
01:08:28,652 --> 01:08:31,760
the gain shallower. You want to tolerate

21870
01:08:31,805 --> 01:08:32,725
variance.

21880
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:42,375
Sorry about getting my

21890
01:08:42,437 --> 01:08:44,240
home modem, I think just restarted

21900
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:47,190
itself for no apparent reason. We call

21910
01:08:47,207 --> 01:08:48,775
that a sleep wake cycle.

21920
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:53,610
Speaker B: Yeah, it's in some

21930
01:08:53,642 --> 01:08:56,915
sleep phase gradient. Updates, but it's

21940
01:08:56,945 --> 01:08:59,640
simpler. It's refreshed. It's ready for

21950
01:08:59,657 --> 01:09:02,900
you to complete the presentation

21960
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:06,465
and then we'll return. Very interesting,

21970
01:09:06,557 --> 01:09:07,212
though.

21980
01:09:13,875 --> 01:09:14,637
Speaker B: Okay,

21990
01:09:17,325 --> 01:09:21,255
see share screen. Here we are.

22000
01:09:21,452 --> 01:09:24,840
Speaker D: All right, continue. Yeah. So now we

22010
01:09:24,857 --> 01:09:28,675
start getting into really what scant

22020
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:31,985
visual material is available for section

22030
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:34,440
four, which I think we'll have to go

22040
01:09:34,457 --> 01:09:36,770
over in detail in a more Q and A format

22050
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:37,812
a little bit.

22060
01:09:39,825 --> 01:09:43,020
So if we then want to talk about how do

22070
01:09:43,022 --> 01:09:46,000
we integrate decision active inference

22080
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:50,535
into this allostasis view, then we

22090
01:09:50,567 --> 01:09:53,940
can say decision making is this

22100
01:09:53,957 --> 01:09:57,012
notion of optimal control controls

22110
01:09:57,675 --> 01:09:59,955
subject to a set of expectations about

22120
01:10:00,002 --> 01:10:03,665
the future. So we'll

22130
01:10:03,695 --> 01:10:05,712
have to write an objective function.

22140
01:10:08,812 --> 01:10:11,337
And then we'll have our wiring diagram

22150
01:10:11,412 --> 01:10:15,072
back and we'll note that motor

22160
01:10:15,117 --> 01:10:18,697
references issued top down are

22170
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:21,950
now conditioned upon or subject to

22180
01:10:22,912 --> 01:10:24,725
predictions about the future.

22190
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:31,437
Then part of how we're going to get into

22200
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:34,755
what this objective function is actually

22210
01:10:34,802 --> 01:10:39,617
made up of is

22220
01:10:39,665 --> 01:10:43,022
to first take the intuition that if we

22230
01:10:43,055 --> 01:10:45,542
start from neural circuits that can only

22240
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:48,075
do predictive processing as we know it,

22250
01:10:49,037 --> 01:10:53,400
then one thing we can do with them is

22260
01:10:53,837 --> 01:10:58,212
simulate some ensemble or population

22270
01:10:59,237 --> 01:11:02,902
of potential state trajectories,

22280
01:11:03,007 --> 01:11:05,187
or really state action trajectories,

22290
01:11:06,212 --> 01:11:08,250
starting from some initial state.

22300
01:11:10,187 --> 01:11:12,975
Then given an objective function,

22310
01:11:14,237 --> 01:11:17,412
we can estimate the time average.

22320
01:11:18,137 --> 01:11:19,737
Given our ensemble,

22330
01:11:22,562 --> 01:11:25,350
we can turn that into feedback control.

22340
01:11:26,462 --> 01:11:29,197
Getting the stability in control theory,

22350
01:11:29,242 --> 01:11:31,322
the closed loop stability derived from

22360
01:11:31,355 --> 01:11:34,622
using feedback by then having a

22370
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:38,012
recognition model. And then we can say,

22380
01:11:38,075 --> 01:11:41,942
ah, I'm going to update my

22390
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:45,572
entire ensemble or population of

22400
01:11:45,605 --> 01:11:48,917
simulations by taking

22410
01:11:48,965 --> 01:11:51,722
them from the recognition model, which

22420
01:11:51,755 --> 01:11:55,162
is conditional upon observed sensory

22430
01:11:55,237 --> 01:11:56,337
outcomes,

22440
01:11:59,775 --> 01:12:03,237
and then having predictions from the

22450
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:07,725
recognition density, which we're super

22460
01:12:07,787 --> 01:12:10,100
scripting here with SuperScript

22470
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:13,845
parentheses two in comparison to

22480
01:12:13,922 --> 01:12:16,737
SuperScript parentheses one here.

22490
01:12:20,525 --> 01:12:23,510
We can then penalize a notion of

22500
01:12:23,542 --> 01:12:27,290
distance. So really we can penalize the

22510
01:12:27,307 --> 01:12:30,785
quote unquote size of the update in

22520
01:12:30,817 --> 01:12:32,837
information theoretic terms.

22530
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:37,460
And if you've seen a free energy or an

22540
01:12:37,492 --> 01:12:39,635
expected free energy written out term by

22550
01:12:39,667 --> 01:12:42,545
term before, you should have seen one of

22560
01:12:42,547 --> 01:12:44,475
these. It's a KL divergence.

22570
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,830
But what that gives us is feedback

22580
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:54,430
stability control using stability

22590
01:12:54,565 --> 01:12:58,355
models. And that actually

22600
01:12:58,402 --> 01:12:59,990
gets to more or less the end of the

22610
01:13:00,007 --> 01:13:01,487
slides per se.

22620
01:13:04,025 --> 01:13:06,512
So as a few summary points,

22630
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:12,140
our computational model gives us a

22640
01:13:12,157 --> 01:13:15,600
useful notion of affordance competition.

22650
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:20,570
Basically run a bunch of forward

22660
01:13:20,647 --> 01:13:24,455
simulations, pick the ones that

22670
01:13:24,502 --> 01:13:27,625
are going to have good expected values

22680
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:31,275
over time, averaging to actually enact

22690
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:33,300
as motor references.

22700
01:13:36,575 --> 01:13:41,330
Speaker C: The. Sigmoidal curves after

22710
01:13:41,377 --> 01:13:43,315
we've taken their derivatives to convert

22720
01:13:43,345 --> 01:13:45,225
them to probability densities,

22730
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,235
then taken the logarithm of those to

22740
01:13:49,267 --> 01:13:52,235
convert to log densities, which is much

22750
01:13:52,267 --> 01:13:54,845
more typical for active inference like a

22760
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:58,295
log prior preference. Those actually

22770
01:13:58,372 --> 01:14:00,750
provide a notion of common currency

22780
01:14:02,975 --> 01:14:06,715
because now we've normalized all notion

22790
01:14:06,745 --> 01:14:10,565
of probability mass to one. So a

22800
01:14:10,657 --> 01:14:13,480
density over one variable and a density

22810
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:15,425
over the other variable have the same

22820
01:14:15,487 --> 01:14:18,710
units. We don't need any more notion of

22830
01:14:18,742 --> 01:14:22,712
a reward currency in this model.

22840
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:28,640
Then there's some encouragement for the

22850
01:14:28,657 --> 01:14:31,637
anatomists and physiologists to say hey,

22860
01:14:32,075 --> 01:14:35,035
let's go look at autonomic and visceral

22870
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:39,110
motor regulation and see if we can

22880
01:14:39,217 --> 01:14:42,160
understand it in terms of these motor

22890
01:14:42,205 --> 01:14:44,837
control circuits at the low level.

22900
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,750
And that just brings us to some very

22910
01:14:50,812 --> 01:14:52,275
overall conclusions.

22920
01:14:55,437 --> 01:14:57,402
Ideally our work should be placed in

22930
01:14:57,420 --> 01:15:00,237
dialogue with active inferences control

22940
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:05,217
work by other authors and

22950
01:15:05,265 --> 01:15:07,752
of course acknowledgements. You can

22960
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:10,122
really see here how much work went into

22970
01:15:10,155 --> 01:15:13,302
this on behalf of absolutely everyone in

22980
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:18,070
the team and

22990
01:15:18,147 --> 01:15:19,025
references.

23000
01:15:23,137 --> 01:15:25,702
So I'll stop sharing and we can shift to

23010
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:29,300
a more interactive format. Awesome,

23020
01:15:30,037 --> 01:15:33,787
well, thanks for sharing that. And so

23030
01:15:33,850 --> 01:15:36,382
where was that previously shared? In

23040
01:15:36,385 --> 01:15:37,412
what context?

23050
01:15:40,012 --> 01:15:42,275
Speaker B: Just in the context of our lab group.

23060
01:15:42,637 --> 01:15:45,927
Speaker D: Alright, cool. Psychology engineering

23070
01:15:45,957 --> 01:15:49,497
group your time. Yeah, so the slides

23080
01:15:49,542 --> 01:15:52,632
are really made for this like biologist

23090
01:15:52,722 --> 01:15:56,075
psychology with a few engineers group.

23100
01:15:57,862 --> 01:16:00,950
Speaker D: Cool. Okay. Well,

23110
01:16:02,662 --> 01:16:05,797
many ways, many paths to go.

23120
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:09,287
Just kind of highlight a few pieces

23130
01:16:10,387 --> 01:16:14,412
under this broad umbrella of physiology.

23140
01:16:14,562 --> 01:16:18,472
One important point you raised was

23150
01:16:18,655 --> 01:16:23,000
how much homeostasis same

23160
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:27,432
stasis is in effect versus

23170
01:16:27,522 --> 01:16:30,577
a mechanism of actually is that

23180
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:33,892
stability sometimes empirically of

23190
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:39,050
stasis and even allostasis that

23200
01:16:39,487 --> 01:16:43,492
underlaying by a drive to a set point

23210
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:46,702
as it has been simplified or

23220
01:16:46,795 --> 01:16:49,842
understood as in that simple thermometer

23230
01:16:49,977 --> 01:16:53,602
model. And then to what extent do

23240
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:57,887
we bring in allostasis hornesis arousal

23250
01:16:58,312 --> 01:17:00,887
and different physiological phenomena?

23260
01:17:01,312 --> 01:17:03,727
And consider these all part of just the

23270
01:17:03,745 --> 01:17:06,822
dynamic and multimodal homeostatic

23280
01:17:06,867 --> 01:17:12,212
engagements of complex bodies versus

23290
01:17:14,362 --> 01:17:17,512
discard, the old and with the new and

23300
01:17:17,575 --> 01:17:20,502
how much to lump and split physiology

23310
01:17:20,607 --> 01:17:23,122
when even at the single cellular life

23320
01:17:23,155 --> 01:17:26,902
form level they're engaging from a

23330
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:28,852
computational or control or information

23340
01:17:28,945 --> 01:17:31,657
theoretic perspective in processes that

23350
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:34,325
are analogous to some of these?

23360
01:17:36,412 --> 01:17:38,742
That's one point that we can explore.

23370
01:17:38,877 --> 01:17:42,622
Another area to explore is on

23380
01:17:42,655 --> 01:17:45,237
that theme of what are these systems

23390
01:17:45,312 --> 01:17:48,532
doing and how do we model it?

23400
01:17:48,610 --> 01:17:52,032
The map territory or the engineering

23410
01:17:52,197 --> 01:17:55,672
basic research question? We could

23420
01:17:55,705 --> 01:17:57,897
talk about a given physiological

23430
01:17:57,942 --> 01:18:00,582
process, body temperature stabilization

23440
01:18:00,672 --> 01:18:03,277
or the barrel receptor, the glucose and

23450
01:18:03,295 --> 01:18:07,187
so on. Is there the minimization

23460
01:18:07,687 --> 01:18:10,627
of a difference, for example, between

23470
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:13,987
preferred and observed? Is there

23480
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:17,727
a maximization of reward according

23490
01:18:17,757 --> 01:18:19,925
to some reward function?

23500
01:18:20,962 --> 01:18:24,437
Is there a maximization of precision?

23510
01:18:25,237 --> 01:18:28,177
Precision on what? Is there a

23520
01:18:28,195 --> 01:18:31,117
maximization of responsibility which

23530
01:18:31,165 --> 01:18:33,522
corresponds in the Sigmoidal curve

23540
01:18:33,567 --> 01:18:36,662
family to the linearized region.

23550
01:18:37,612 --> 01:18:39,472
Are there cases where all four of these

23560
01:18:39,505 --> 01:18:40,972
things are going to be happening

23570
01:18:41,155 --> 01:18:44,467
indistinguishably? Is there a case

23580
01:18:44,515 --> 01:18:47,152
where some of these phenomena are

23590
01:18:47,170 --> 01:18:49,925
occurring at the detriment of others?

23600
01:18:50,887 --> 01:18:53,242
Can we differentiate models and actually

23610
01:18:53,290 --> 01:18:55,752
make unique predictions, explanations

23620
01:18:55,857 --> 01:18:59,392
and control systems if we move

23630
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:02,752
our emphasis from one of these

23640
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:05,687
lenses to another lens?

23650
01:19:06,562 --> 01:19:08,707
And how should we think about different

23660
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:12,757
physiological systems ranging from the

23670
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:16,452
implicit and very ancient

23680
01:19:16,557 --> 01:19:19,762
mechanisms to those

23690
01:19:19,825 --> 01:19:22,417
which consciously may even feel like,

23700
01:19:22,465 --> 01:19:24,567
for example, error minimization, reward

23710
01:19:24,627 --> 01:19:26,967
maximization, precision maximization,

23720
01:19:27,102 --> 01:19:29,237
responsibility maximization.

23730
01:19:30,712 --> 01:19:34,207
So I'll pause there and either

23740
01:19:34,285 --> 01:19:36,637
authors may make some remarks or anyone

23750
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:38,225
may raise a question or thought.

23760
01:19:56,450 --> 01:19:58,700
Speaker C: I wanted to ask you maybe just a direct

23770
01:19:58,762 --> 01:20:00,365
within this, because you talked at the

23780
01:20:00,382 --> 01:20:03,920
end about that. This gets us away

23790
01:20:03,997 --> 01:20:07,725
from having to have a reward currency.

23800
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:13,445
Yeah, and maybe I'd be interested if you

23810
01:20:13,447 --> 01:20:15,737
can elaborate on that a little bit. So

23820
01:20:16,475 --> 01:20:18,890
just what would the typical role of

23830
01:20:18,907 --> 01:20:21,110
reward currency would be and how does

23840
01:20:21,142 --> 01:20:23,915
this sort of how does the framework that

23850
01:20:23,932 --> 01:20:25,862
you're proposing change that, right?

23860
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:29,537
Speaker B: Yeah. So really I'd back off and say

23870
01:20:30,275 --> 01:20:31,960
what changes? This is the active

23880
01:20:32,005 --> 01:20:34,412
inference point of view, right?

23890
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:39,737
Typically if you're doing something like

23900
01:20:41,075 --> 01:20:43,810
if you're someone like Yale Neve or Sam

23910
01:20:43,855 --> 01:20:47,690
Gershman, then you think about reward as

23920
01:20:47,782 --> 01:20:50,225
in a reinforcement learning terms as

23930
01:20:50,287 --> 01:20:53,090
something that the brain has to

23940
01:20:53,107 --> 01:20:56,390
maximize. And then you

23950
01:20:56,407 --> 01:20:59,870
would say, all right, well, I want the

23960
01:20:59,947 --> 01:21:01,940
uncertainty of my beliefs to be

23970
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:04,650
minimized while I maximize reward.

23980
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,870
So those are then two separate modular

23990
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:10,555
computations that have almost opposite

24000
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:12,970
goals. One of them is to minimize

24010
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:15,815
uncertainty right now and the other is

24020
01:21:15,832 --> 01:21:18,300
to maximize reward over the long term

24030
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:22,100
and income's active inference and really

24040
01:21:22,162 --> 01:21:25,340
says no, no. If you phrase this as

24050
01:21:25,357 --> 01:21:27,737
a variational optimization problem,

24060
01:21:28,325 --> 01:21:30,590
then you can get a unified objective for

24070
01:21:30,607 --> 01:21:34,610
this where the common currency is,

24080
01:21:34,642 --> 01:21:35,612
so to speak,

24090
01:21:38,375 --> 01:21:41,815
evidence, really evidence that you're

24100
01:21:41,845 --> 01:21:43,675
following the correct trajectory,

24110
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:45,365
evidence that you're executing a

24120
01:21:45,382 --> 01:21:49,650
behavior correctly and evidencebased

24130
01:21:50,225 --> 01:21:52,805
in terms of, I guess we would call them

24140
01:21:52,852 --> 01:21:55,790
nats or bits are the units of

24150
01:21:55,807 --> 01:22:00,365
information theory. So if you're using e

24160
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:02,775
as the basis of your logarithm,

24170
01:22:03,425 --> 01:22:06,500
then it's not if you're using a log to

24180
01:22:06,562 --> 01:22:08,550
base it's bits.

24190
01:22:12,037 --> 01:22:13,777
My dogs are getting picked up for their

24200
01:22:13,795 --> 01:22:14,537
walks.

24210
01:22:17,212 --> 01:22:19,925
Speaker D: Yes, this is a very interesting

24220
01:22:21,112 --> 01:22:24,350
complementary perspective where

24230
01:22:24,712 --> 01:22:27,650
we'll get reward maximization over time

24240
01:22:28,462 --> 01:22:32,082
when we increase our precision.

24250
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:35,032
Now everybody agrees on that. And is it

24260
01:22:35,035 --> 01:22:37,297
gain to be the cart before the horse or

24270
01:22:37,330 --> 01:22:38,797
the horse before the cart? And which

24280
01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:40,252
one's the horse and which one's the

24290
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:44,472
cart? And framing the unified

24300
01:22:44,517 --> 01:22:46,897
objective function in information

24310
01:22:47,005 --> 01:22:50,937
theoretic terms as a surprisal

24320
01:22:51,012 --> 01:22:54,592
founding heuristic, as has been done in

24330
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:56,707
Bayesian evidence lower bounds for a

24340
01:22:56,710 --> 01:22:59,862
long time by framing surprise

24350
01:23:00,012 --> 01:23:03,612
minimization bounding as the unified

24360
01:23:03,762 --> 01:23:06,397
objective function and currency. Then

24370
01:23:06,505 --> 01:23:10,302
there is the realized maintenance

24380
01:23:10,482 --> 01:23:12,952
of homeostasis or however you want to

24390
01:23:12,970 --> 01:23:16,477
call that without needing a

24400
01:23:16,495 --> 01:23:19,927
traditionally structured maximization of

24410
01:23:19,945 --> 01:23:22,792
reward as defined by a reward or time

24420
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:25,100
discounted reward function.

24430
01:23:26,737 --> 01:23:29,752
And it's also very interesting, like

24440
01:23:29,845 --> 01:23:31,792
we're not trying to accumulate body

24450
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,127
temperature, we're not trying to

24460
01:23:33,145 --> 01:23:36,772
accumulate glucose. If we were playing a

24470
01:23:36,805 --> 01:23:39,997
game where simply more points were

24480
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:43,797
better, like some social and subsocial

24490
01:23:43,842 --> 01:23:47,337
games, then a unilateral

24500
01:23:47,487 --> 01:23:51,252
optimization via maximization paradigm

24510
01:23:51,282 --> 01:23:53,872
makes a lot of sense. But for the kind

24520
01:23:53,905 --> 01:23:56,497
of physiological infinite games that we

24530
01:23:56,530 --> 01:23:58,927
play, as you highlighted with the

24540
01:23:58,945 --> 01:24:03,052
infinite horizon, then it may

24550
01:24:03,145 --> 01:24:06,402
make more sense to have a bounded

24560
01:24:06,582 --> 01:24:10,147
responsivity and an

24570
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:13,537
emphasis on controllability under

24580
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,867
inherited priors that those controllable

24590
01:24:15,927 --> 01:24:17,742
ranges are the survival ranges.

24600
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:20,092
Otherwise how could one have existed for

24610
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:25,047
generations rather than try to stack

24620
01:24:25,092 --> 01:24:26,237
up glucose?

24630
01:24:30,087 --> 01:24:33,642
Speaker B: Yeah. So I think it's always

24640
01:24:33,690 --> 01:24:35,682
really interesting to go back and read

24650
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:39,400
Peter Sterling in this light because

24660
01:24:41,412 --> 01:24:44,342
beyond just the formal physiological

24670
01:24:44,402 --> 01:24:47,052
material. There are these stories that

24680
01:24:47,070 --> 01:24:48,987
he can tell of. For instance. People

24690
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:52,012
living in longterm stressful situations

24700
01:24:52,362 --> 01:24:54,372
and they develop what we would now call

24710
01:24:54,405 --> 01:24:56,287
the diseases of civilization.

24720
01:24:58,362 --> 01:25:02,207
Which Sterling sort of implies

24730
01:25:02,297 --> 01:25:06,477
are the diseases of homeostasis living

24740
01:25:06,570 --> 01:25:09,025
too much the same too much of the time.

24750
01:25:11,787 --> 01:25:14,472
And indeed, speaking of not wanting to

24760
01:25:14,505 --> 01:25:16,387
stack up glucose,

24770
01:25:18,462 --> 01:25:20,562
this is an actual disease that happens

24780
01:25:20,625 --> 01:25:22,837
to people that is called diabetes.

24790
01:25:24,237 --> 01:25:27,117
It is considered a pathology. And so

24800
01:25:27,165 --> 01:25:30,842
there's almost an interesting misfit

24810
01:25:30,902 --> 01:25:33,362
between that intuitive notion of reward

24820
01:25:33,437 --> 01:25:36,522
or at least let's sneer slightly and say

24830
01:25:36,555 --> 01:25:40,122
that economic notion of reward which

24840
01:25:40,155 --> 01:25:42,737
has to be a form of accumulative wealth

24850
01:25:42,812 --> 01:25:46,742
in a common currency versus physiology,

24860
01:25:46,802 --> 01:25:48,447
in which too much of a good thing is

24870
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:51,475
actually a bad thing, gain. Right.

24880
01:25:51,987 --> 01:25:54,100
And that actually comes back to.

24890
01:25:56,337 --> 01:25:58,197
Speaker A: Part. Of what this is contributing then.

24900
01:25:58,230 --> 01:26:00,327
Right, in one ways is a sort of shift in

24910
01:26:00,345 --> 01:26:03,672
metaphor. Right. I think

24920
01:26:03,705 --> 01:26:07,472
that point about an economic

24930
01:26:07,517 --> 01:26:11,200
conception of value and of reward is

24940
01:26:12,012 --> 01:26:13,947
it's useful to have a counterpoint to

24950
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:17,322
that because as Eli is saying, there is

24960
01:26:17,355 --> 01:26:19,652
no other limit to economic reward,

24970
01:26:19,757 --> 01:26:21,837
there is a benefit to accumulating it.

24980
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:24,112
If you think about sort of accumulating

24990
01:26:24,537 --> 01:26:28,797
capital to spend it in

25000
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:31,392
this case, right. What we're focusing on

25010
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:35,892
is how to basically

25020
01:26:36,015 --> 01:26:39,732
keep balanced and adaptable so that

25030
01:26:39,885 --> 01:26:41,667
future challenges can be actually

25040
01:26:41,715 --> 01:26:43,467
encountered and dealt with. And that

25050
01:26:43,590 --> 01:26:45,492
sometimes means packing light, not

25060
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:47,667
keeping so much glucose on hand so that

25070
01:26:47,715 --> 01:26:50,472
you can deal with the reward or deal

25080
01:26:50,505 --> 01:26:52,322
with changing circumstances and adopt

25090
01:26:52,367 --> 01:26:54,562
them, but you can't.

25100
01:26:56,262 --> 01:26:59,942
It's actually been a pretty serious

25110
01:27:00,002 --> 01:27:02,622
problem to have this completely

25120
01:27:02,730 --> 01:27:07,842
abstracted notion of value that is

25130
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:10,150
endlessly accumulative and.

25140
01:27:12,687 --> 01:27:14,157
Speaker B: Doesn'T. Interfere with any of the

25150
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:18,032
biological realities of what systems

25160
01:27:18,047 --> 01:27:21,025
are actually doing. Right? Yeah.

25170
01:27:22,587 --> 01:27:27,152
Speaker C: It's so abstract that it's

25180
01:27:27,182 --> 01:27:28,347
going to have a really hard time

25190
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:31,392
interfacing with biology. Yeah. Before

25200
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:33,527
we go to the question, let's say let's

25210
01:27:33,557 --> 01:27:36,972
sum that up by saying bank accounts are

25220
01:27:37,005 --> 01:27:39,177
unbounded and they are useful because

25230
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:42,917
they're unbounded like an economist

25240
01:27:42,977 --> 01:27:45,717
can conceive of trillions of dollars in

25250
01:27:45,765 --> 01:27:49,872
assets in a way that my

25260
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:53,887
body cannot. Bodies are bounded,

25270
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:57,177
they are physically bounded. They are

25280
01:27:57,195 --> 01:27:59,367
made of a finite amount of matter at

25290
01:27:59,415 --> 01:28:02,292
once. If you try to put too much more

25300
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:05,200
into them, something bad will happen.

25310
01:28:07,287 --> 01:28:09,147
Speaker C: Actually, after setting us up on that

25320
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:11,127
channel discussion, I've got a duck off

25330
01:28:11,145 --> 01:28:12,822
a little bit early, but I'm gain to try

25340
01:28:12,855 --> 01:28:14,732
to be back for 50.2 next week and I'm

25350
01:28:14,747 --> 01:28:15,822
really interested to see where this

25360
01:28:15,855 --> 01:28:17,742
conversation goes. I'll catch up on the

25370
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:20,875
noise. Thank you. Alright, thanks.

25380
01:28:21,762 --> 01:28:23,822
Speaker B: If nobody minds, I'd like to ask Dave

25390
01:28:23,867 --> 01:28:25,527
his question first just because I was

25400
01:28:25,545 --> 01:28:27,925
about to when I got kicked off.

25410
01:28:28,962 --> 01:28:30,487
Speaker D: Yes. Go for it, Dave.

25420
01:28:32,037 --> 01:28:35,127
Speaker E: Is that one that I said? Yeah, I know

25430
01:28:35,145 --> 01:28:38,022
which one that was. If you have a new

25440
01:28:38,055 --> 01:28:39,872
question, is fine. Oh yeah, that's

25450
01:28:39,917 --> 01:28:43,872
probably better. Yeah, just to what

25460
01:28:43,905 --> 01:28:45,942
we were speaking of just now, the

25470
01:28:46,065 --> 01:28:49,047
diseases of civilization. There is the

25480
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:52,277
rumor, and maybe this was just a fallacy

25490
01:28:52,307 --> 01:28:54,372
or misunderstanding, that people who

25500
01:28:54,405 --> 01:28:56,802
managed to stay in London during the

25510
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:59,502
Blitz under conditions that you would

25520
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:02,125
expect would produce massive amount of

25530
01:29:03,612 --> 01:29:06,632
psychosomatic disease, hysteria,

25540
01:29:06,722 --> 01:29:09,317
conversion syndromes, that it didn't

25550
01:29:09,377 --> 01:29:12,737
happen. People were just preposterously

25560
01:29:12,812 --> 01:29:14,952
state because they didn't have time to

25570
01:29:14,970 --> 01:29:16,452
be sick, they didn't have time to be

25580
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:19,825
crazy. Did that really happen?

25590
01:29:21,837 --> 01:29:24,597
Did the sense of mission override what

25600
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:28,612
otherwise would have been general stress

25610
01:29:29,037 --> 01:29:32,212
syndrome causing breakdowns?

25620
01:29:34,512 --> 01:29:36,387
Speaker B: Does someone know the detailed history

25630
01:29:36,450 --> 01:29:38,177
of the London Blitz in World War II?

25640
01:29:38,207 --> 01:29:42,412
Because I really don't. It's not english

25650
01:29:42,987 --> 01:29:46,377
1.5 journey for us to

25660
01:29:46,395 --> 01:29:49,917
explore, but to speak

25670
01:29:49,965 --> 01:29:52,557
to it generally. It's an interesting

25680
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:56,125
question as well. To what extent by

25690
01:29:56,487 --> 01:30:00,762
comforting and regularizing we

25700
01:30:00,825 --> 01:30:04,847
even work against that and let alone

25710
01:30:05,042 --> 01:30:07,892
neglect other tradeoffs and incur

25720
01:30:07,952 --> 01:30:10,612
externalities dean.

25730
01:30:13,587 --> 01:30:17,202
Speaker A: This has been fantastic. So here's my

25740
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:20,502
thing. Maybe in the

25750
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:24,177
dot two we'll get into that I

25760
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:26,157
mentioned at the end of the dot zero. I

25770
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:27,447
was hoping you really had some really

25780
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:30,642
velvet gloves to walk me through the 4.4

25790
01:30:30,690 --> 01:30:34,367
because and especially after the context

25800
01:30:34,427 --> 01:30:35,937
you've been able to provide us today

25810
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,097
around the idea that engineers

25820
01:30:40,142 --> 01:30:41,967
and psychologists came into a room.

25830
01:30:42,015 --> 01:30:44,172
Now, I don't know if that once you got

25840
01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:45,777
into that room, it became an

25850
01:30:45,795 --> 01:30:47,397
intersection with red light, green light

25860
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:49,922
and you guys kind of played a red rover,

25870
01:30:49,967 --> 01:30:53,022
come on over thing or whether you know

25880
01:30:53,055 --> 01:30:55,797
it so well. Here's the thing, because I

25890
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:58,272
actually did work with CFOs and

25900
01:30:58,305 --> 01:31:01,997
engineers and so what you discover

25910
01:31:02,192 --> 01:31:05,097
is there's a bit of an isomorphist I

25920
01:31:05,130 --> 01:31:07,617
want to be able to diagram this out for

25930
01:31:07,665 --> 01:31:10,752
you view that has to be biased for

25940
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:12,692
engineers and then there's the spatially

25950
01:31:12,752 --> 01:31:15,317
enveloped view of the psychologist,

25960
01:31:15,377 --> 01:31:16,647
right? Like they're in their

25970
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:19,352
phenomenological space. And what you've

25980
01:31:19,382 --> 01:31:23,262
done is you've tried to say when

25990
01:31:23,325 --> 01:31:26,702
those two worlds come together, I don't

26000
01:31:26,732 --> 01:31:28,107
know if it's a collision, I don't know

26010
01:31:28,110 --> 01:31:30,402
if it's cooperation. It's a variety of

26020
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:32,627
things, right? It's complicated we'll

26030
01:31:32,657 --> 01:31:35,772
just leave it there. But my question is

26040
01:31:35,805 --> 01:31:39,422
this as I got to 4.4, it felt

26050
01:31:39,467 --> 01:31:42,777
like if I was skiing I went from a

26060
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:46,087
beautiful powder field to some sparsely

26070
01:31:47,337 --> 01:31:49,967
disturbance trees to tighter and tighter

26080
01:31:50,027 --> 01:31:52,077
and finally I was like, I don't know how

26090
01:31:52,095 --> 01:31:53,547
it's going to keep going because there

26100
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:56,547
doesn't seem to be any more gaps here.

26110
01:31:56,655 --> 01:31:58,677
It's just getting too tight for me. And

26120
01:31:58,695 --> 01:32:00,602
the reconciliation, like when you're

26130
01:32:00,632 --> 01:32:03,117
skiing as a metaphor is you're not

26140
01:32:03,165 --> 01:32:06,342
looking at the trees, you're looking at

26150
01:32:06,465 --> 01:32:08,727
the nonsense, the non objects. It's a

26160
01:32:08,745 --> 01:32:11,667
reconciliation. And when we're talking

26170
01:32:11,715 --> 01:32:14,022
about dodgeball as your metaphor or

26180
01:32:14,055 --> 01:32:16,952
whether we're talking about glucose

26190
01:32:16,982 --> 01:32:19,227
control, these to me what you were

26200
01:32:19,245 --> 01:32:22,347
describing up until that point was

26210
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:25,032
essentially you were saying for us to

26220
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:27,672
know what's going on, we're gain to look

26230
01:32:27,705 --> 01:32:29,802
at the risk management, we're going to

26240
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:31,257
look at the coordination, we're going to

26250
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:32,532
look at those things that are

26260
01:32:32,610 --> 01:32:35,637
essentially backwards facing. We can say

26270
01:32:35,775 --> 01:32:38,192
that in order for the process to carry

26280
01:32:38,252 --> 01:32:40,797
forward, to continue, there has to be

26290
01:32:40,830 --> 01:32:43,572
some addressing of those factors and

26300
01:32:43,605 --> 01:32:47,222
then there has to be the reconciliation.

26310
01:32:47,267 --> 01:32:49,152
Just like when the engineers and the

26320
01:32:49,170 --> 01:32:51,327
psychologists are proximal to one

26330
01:32:51,345 --> 01:32:53,627
another, it's an entanglement and it's

26340
01:32:53,657 --> 01:32:56,172
not the engineers get to tell the

26350
01:32:56,205 --> 01:32:57,852
psychologists what to do any more than

26360
01:32:57,870 --> 01:32:59,577
the psychologists get to tell the

26370
01:32:59,595 --> 01:33:04,347
engineers what to do. Right? So if

26380
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:07,122
the behavioral piece, if the idea of the

26390
01:33:07,155 --> 01:33:10,347
biology and the physiology is if I do

26400
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:13,000
this now in real terms,

26410
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:16,647
I have to look at that. And you guys had

26420
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:19,687
an L, four different time frames,

26430
01:33:20,412 --> 01:33:23,897
right? I can manage that. You spoke

26440
01:33:23,942 --> 01:33:27,432
clearly to that. I read that and

26450
01:33:27,585 --> 01:33:31,292
it was clear to me I can coordinate

26460
01:33:31,352 --> 01:33:34,917
that. Again, that was very, very clear.

26470
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:39,117
And then I got the four four and I

26480
01:33:39,165 --> 01:33:42,507
simply lost the thread because

26490
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:44,052
what I was looking for was the

26500
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:46,917
reconciliation. I will align this next

26510
01:33:46,965 --> 01:33:50,342
move with the range recapitulator.

26520
01:33:50,477 --> 01:33:53,322
That's what I was expecting next. And

26530
01:33:53,355 --> 01:33:56,802
then so I went, okay, so where is the

26540
01:33:56,820 --> 01:33:59,697
strategy? Because that's there when

26550
01:33:59,805 --> 01:34:01,707
psychologists and engineers get into a

26560
01:34:01,710 --> 01:34:04,122
room, they don't just abandon their

26570
01:34:04,155 --> 01:34:07,247
strategy. It comes with them. It follows

26580
01:34:07,292 --> 01:34:09,177
them into that space and carries them to

26590
01:34:09,195 --> 01:34:13,347
that question of I reconcile an

26600
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:16,602
advantage and all of the above until I

26610
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:18,962
choose this choice while I was keeping

26620
01:34:19,037 --> 01:34:20,937
all of the above. So you guys talked

26630
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,277
about that in other parts of it. You

26640
01:34:23,295 --> 01:34:26,547
said we can't just abandon it. But I

26650
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:28,837
couldn't understand how the formalism

26660
01:34:29,337 --> 01:34:32,202
reconciled it. So I'm sorry that's such

26670
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:34,587
a long winded question but your paper

26680
01:34:34,725 --> 01:34:38,592
always spend 6 hours of my life

26690
01:34:38,790 --> 01:34:41,322
going, these guys have got to be much

26700
01:34:41,355 --> 01:34:42,752
closer to answering this because I've

26710
01:34:42,782 --> 01:34:44,652
never been able to answer it. But then I

26720
01:34:44,670 --> 01:34:47,307
got lost and I just felt like, oh man,

26730
01:34:47,385 --> 01:34:48,562
what am I missing?

26740
01:34:51,237 --> 01:34:54,797
Speaker B: Okay, so I'm going to disappoint

26750
01:34:54,842 --> 01:34:58,127
you slightly and say what you're missing

26760
01:34:58,232 --> 01:34:59,200
is. That.

26770
01:35:01,512 --> 01:35:04,087
Speaker B: I think what's missing from our writing

26780
01:35:04,962 --> 01:35:07,287
is really being clear that we're working

26790
01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:10,512
under a very unusual set

26800
01:35:10,575 --> 01:35:13,122
of constraints in how we formulated this

26810
01:35:13,155 --> 01:35:15,932
model. So specifically,

26820
01:35:16,022 --> 01:35:20,662
unlike, say, Sam Gershman or Yale Neve,

26830
01:35:21,837 --> 01:35:25,127
or unlike the literature on deep active

26840
01:35:25,157 --> 01:35:29,537
inference in computers, we're assuming

26850
01:35:29,687 --> 01:35:35,037
that you essentially don't need an

26860
01:35:35,175 --> 01:35:37,367
extra set of computational ingredients

26870
01:35:37,427 --> 01:35:39,025
for reinforcement learning.

26880
01:35:41,037 --> 01:35:43,302
So we're saying, assuming that you can

26890
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:47,387
do only the computational

26900
01:35:47,462 --> 01:35:49,602
operating point to be involved in

26910
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:53,217
predictive processing, what can you come

26920
01:35:53,265 --> 01:35:55,257
up with that will handle a control

26930
01:35:55,335 --> 01:35:58,557
problem? And the answer is this

26940
01:35:58,635 --> 01:36:02,312
very specific thing with these nastily

26950
01:36:02,387 --> 01:36:06,137
involved derivations called pathogen

26960
01:36:06,212 --> 01:36:09,572
control. And you'll notice

26970
01:36:09,617 --> 01:36:11,672
that when I was gain over those slides,

26980
01:36:11,792 --> 01:36:13,947
I basically said, let's just say you can

26990
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:17,437
simulate possible futures,

27000
01:36:18,087 --> 01:36:21,752
like possible episode length courses

27010
01:36:21,782 --> 01:36:25,827
of future activity, and you

27020
01:36:25,845 --> 01:36:28,647
can evaluate them in terms of your

27030
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:31,842
objective function, and then

27040
01:36:31,890 --> 01:36:35,352
you can update them by means of a

27050
01:36:35,370 --> 01:36:38,402
recognition model or by integrating

27060
01:36:38,507 --> 01:36:40,172
prediction error and using predictive

27070
01:36:40,217 --> 01:36:43,602
coding. Then how do we

27080
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:46,900
build a formalism out of just those?

27090
01:36:49,212 --> 01:36:51,897
And the upside is that this does let us

27100
01:36:51,930 --> 01:36:54,462
look at the controls literature and say,

27110
01:36:54,525 --> 01:36:59,612
alright, this is actually optimal

27120
01:36:59,762 --> 01:37:02,200
feedback stabilized control.

27130
01:37:03,462 --> 01:37:05,147
We can look at some of the bounded

27140
01:37:05,192 --> 01:37:08,192
rationality literature in cognitive

27150
01:37:08,252 --> 01:37:12,162
science and neuroscience and say our

27160
01:37:12,225 --> 01:37:15,250
objective function is a free energy.

27170
01:37:16,137 --> 01:37:19,307
That is, if you have to penalize

27180
01:37:19,397 --> 01:37:23,067
how much you change neural firing over

27190
01:37:23,115 --> 01:37:26,247
time, or how much you change your mind

27200
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,450
and update your beliefs over time

27210
01:37:30,312 --> 01:37:32,897
because you only have so much metabolic

27220
01:37:32,942 --> 01:37:36,177
power in your head, then we include a

27230
01:37:36,195 --> 01:37:37,825
penalty term for that.

27240
01:37:39,612 --> 01:37:41,652
And we can say, this can all just be

27250
01:37:41,670 --> 01:37:44,217
done by embodied simulation and

27260
01:37:44,265 --> 01:37:46,450
reference configuration motor control.

27270
01:37:47,112 --> 01:37:48,722
Does that mean this is how the brain

27280
01:37:48,767 --> 01:37:50,800
actually does things? Of course not.

27290
01:37:52,812 --> 01:37:55,467
It does mean that if you want to do your

27300
01:37:55,515 --> 01:37:58,727
modeling with I think Andy

27310
01:37:58,757 --> 01:38:02,950
Clark tends to quote Quine and say,

27320
01:38:04,062 --> 01:38:05,642
if you have a taste for desert

27330
01:38:05,702 --> 01:38:09,357
landscapes, then we've given you

27340
01:38:09,510 --> 01:38:12,807
a computational model that is basically

27350
01:38:12,885 --> 01:38:16,437
just sand and rocks. And as such,

27360
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:18,512
yes, it's something of a hostile

27370
01:38:18,587 --> 01:38:19,537
environment.

27380
01:38:22,062 --> 01:38:23,897
Walk without rhythm. You won't attract

27390
01:38:23,942 --> 01:38:24,862
the worm.

27400
01:38:27,987 --> 01:38:30,037
Speaker D: In the planes of octaves.

27410
01:38:33,837 --> 01:38:35,997
Speaker B: If you live behind the shield wall where

27420
01:38:36,030 --> 01:38:39,287
we have state estimate

27430
01:38:39,362 --> 01:38:41,500
value objective function. Good for you.

27440
01:38:42,162 --> 01:38:45,647
Speaker D: In the stretched sigmoid with broad

27450
01:38:45,692 --> 01:38:48,447
variability. So stretched that it is

27460
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:51,227
flat and plain like, but still highly

27470
01:38:51,257 --> 01:38:55,052
controller within large bounds. That's

27480
01:38:55,082 --> 01:38:57,925
where we're oscillating. Yeah,

27490
01:38:59,187 --> 01:39:01,992
very interesting. It'll be,

27500
01:39:02,115 --> 01:39:05,742
I think, great in our lab to pick

27510
01:39:05,790 --> 01:39:08,247
up a few points. From am I the one

27520
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:11,712
cutting out again? I still see

27530
01:39:11,775 --> 01:39:15,357
you. It's okay.

27540
01:39:15,510 --> 01:39:17,052
Speaker A: Yeah, you're back. All right. You

27550
01:39:17,070 --> 01:39:20,352
flickered a bit. Okay. In the

27560
01:39:20,370 --> 01:39:23,742
last minutes, we can talk

27570
01:39:23,790 --> 01:39:26,202
about some ideas from earlier in the

27580
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:28,347
paper. Look at any of the figures, and

27590
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:31,017
then in the dot two. That will be

27600
01:39:31,065 --> 01:39:34,162
awesome to really approach the formalism

27610
01:39:34,512 --> 01:39:39,112
and help Dean on that ski journey.

27620
01:39:43,737 --> 01:39:46,077
What would be something to go to in

27630
01:39:46,095 --> 01:39:47,725
these last minutes.

27640
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,995
Justine. Maybe I'll

27650
01:39:55,010 --> 01:39:56,840
be able to get a chance to elaborate

27660
01:39:56,870 --> 01:39:58,800
with a bit more with Jordan in the next

27670
01:39:58,862 --> 01:40:00,700
one. But I'm curious.

27680
01:40:02,175 --> 01:40:05,175
You took gain at Great Lakes to say,

27690
01:40:05,312 --> 01:40:08,535
look, this doesn't map directly on

27700
01:40:08,567 --> 01:40:11,355
to all the complexities that we know

27710
01:40:11,402 --> 01:40:14,760
exist, because you said you started this

27720
01:40:14,792 --> 01:40:17,385
in 2019, you had a bit of time on your

27730
01:40:17,417 --> 01:40:20,640
hands and then did kind

27740
01:40:20,657 --> 01:40:23,125
of allude to this at the beginning.

27750
01:40:24,375 --> 01:40:27,090
Were there discoveries that you made

27760
01:40:27,257 --> 01:40:31,455
that you didn't anticipate? Because you

27770
01:40:31,577 --> 01:40:35,700
were very also very respectful in who

27780
01:40:35,762 --> 01:40:39,270
you acknowledged as sort of laying the

27790
01:40:39,422 --> 01:40:41,115
groundwork here. You had a bit of

27800
01:40:41,132 --> 01:40:43,725
stability to work off of,

27810
01:40:43,862 --> 01:40:49,280
but did you find yourself introduced,

27820
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:52,505
being introduced to things that weren't

27830
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:56,255
there prior to you guys coalescing

27840
01:40:56,315 --> 01:40:57,810
around this? And do you think it

27850
01:40:57,842 --> 01:41:00,360
continues to evolve or does it just stay

27860
01:41:00,392 --> 01:41:01,962
on a theoretical level?

27870
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:10,375
Speaker B: Actually, I'd say for me personally,

27880
01:41:10,950 --> 01:41:13,680
the big unanticipated discovery was just

27890
01:41:13,727 --> 01:41:17,510
how little we know about interceptive

27900
01:41:17,555 --> 01:41:21,090
neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, and I

27910
01:41:21,107 --> 01:41:24,555
mean in the periphery. So our

27920
01:41:24,602 --> 01:41:26,735
lab with Lisa and Karen, lisa handles

27930
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:29,540
the stuff above the neck. And so we've

27940
01:41:29,570 --> 01:41:32,370
got Barrett and Simmons 2015. There's a

27950
01:41:32,372 --> 01:41:34,200
number of other good papers saying

27960
01:41:34,262 --> 01:41:36,410
essentially you look at the brain

27970
01:41:36,455 --> 01:41:39,405
architecture and it looks like, at least

27980
01:41:39,452 --> 01:41:42,785
in cortex, the interceptive and visceral

27990
01:41:42,830 --> 01:41:46,290
motor cortices are fairly central to the

28000
01:41:46,307 --> 01:41:49,155
architecture. And then you ask, okay,

28010
01:41:49,202 --> 01:41:52,260
so what kinds of signals are coming in

28020
01:41:52,292 --> 01:41:55,460
from the periphery to then be subjected

28030
01:41:55,505 --> 01:41:58,975
to predictive processing in cortex?

28040
01:42:00,375 --> 01:42:02,265
And you basically get told, well,

28050
01:42:02,357 --> 01:42:04,437
interceptive signals, obviously.

28060
01:42:07,050 --> 01:42:09,495
So there was that moment when I was

28070
01:42:09,572 --> 01:42:12,105
working with Karen and realized, oh,

28080
01:42:12,152 --> 01:42:15,330
okay, so it looks like there's actually

28090
01:42:15,377 --> 01:42:17,475
this close analogy that we could

28100
01:42:17,537 --> 01:42:21,185
hypothesize between the known

28110
01:42:21,230 --> 01:42:25,265
function of a somatomotor

28120
01:42:25,445 --> 01:42:29,337
circuit for voluntary motor control

28130
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:35,225
and this way of handling barrel reflex

28140
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:38,190
function. And it looks like for the

28150
01:42:38,207 --> 01:42:41,150
barrel reflex, you can voluntarily

28160
01:42:41,225 --> 01:42:44,655
change the gain or the tolerance, those

28170
01:42:44,702 --> 01:42:46,437
being inverse model each other.

28180
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:51,275
Changing the operating point voluntarily

28190
01:42:51,350 --> 01:42:53,165
doesn't seem to happen, but it does seem

28200
01:42:53,195 --> 01:42:56,565
to shift. And it does begin to look as

28210
01:42:56,582 --> 01:42:58,980
though, ah, we can just we can stop just

28220
01:42:59,027 --> 01:43:02,520
saying, you know, there are

28230
01:43:02,597 --> 01:43:04,665
interceptive signals, we don't know

28240
01:43:04,682 --> 01:43:07,920
anything about them, right? And instead

28250
01:43:07,997 --> 01:43:09,615
ask, how could we break down the

28260
01:43:09,632 --> 01:43:12,960
autonomic nervous system and

28270
01:43:12,992 --> 01:43:16,662
the interoception periphery into these

28280
01:43:17,775 --> 01:43:20,370
control circuits, where there's a

28290
01:43:20,372 --> 01:43:23,385
reference that flows from above or is

28300
01:43:23,417 --> 01:43:26,370
possibly built in as a prior and then a

28310
01:43:26,372 --> 01:43:28,515
sensor and then a motor neuron or an

28320
01:43:28,532 --> 01:43:29,425
effector?

28330
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:36,800
Speaker D: Again, total speculating.

28340
01:43:36,950 --> 01:43:40,265
One can imagine that loop could be ultra

28350
01:43:40,370 --> 01:43:43,685
local or even get cellular

28360
01:43:43,805 --> 01:43:47,025
electrical junction. So as local as

28370
01:43:47,087 --> 01:43:49,275
could be to close the motor control

28380
01:43:49,337 --> 01:43:51,270
loop, and then there would be

28390
01:43:51,347 --> 01:43:54,230
potentially a more measles scale purely

28400
01:43:54,290 --> 01:43:57,360
within the periphery, maybe some sort of

28410
01:43:57,392 --> 01:44:00,845
motor coordination or vasoconstriction

28420
01:44:00,935 --> 01:44:04,100
type actions that are being enacted

28430
01:44:04,175 --> 01:44:07,845
through local neural networks and other

28440
01:44:07,922 --> 01:44:11,760
systems. And then when you got to make

28450
01:44:11,792 --> 01:44:13,662
the call to the. Central nervous system

28460
01:44:14,325 --> 01:44:17,112
and engage at that level.

28470
01:44:17,550 --> 01:44:21,290
It's the highest capacity of like inner

28480
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:24,545
modal memory computation,

28490
01:44:24,635 --> 01:44:27,855
all these other complex phenomena which

28500
01:44:27,977 --> 01:44:31,370
then can be seen to have their rightful

28510
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:35,285
place maybe even in a specific brain

28520
01:44:35,330 --> 01:44:39,140
region. But the entire integrated

28530
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:42,930
Dodgeball performance is not

28540
01:44:42,977 --> 01:44:45,455
going to be located to a brain region

28550
01:44:45,515 --> 01:44:47,790
any more than it would be located to a

28560
01:44:47,807 --> 01:44:50,550
fingertip because it all needs to be

28570
01:44:50,612 --> 01:44:54,315
coordinated and not every call can

28580
01:44:54,332 --> 01:44:57,480
be local and not every call can be

28590
01:44:57,527 --> 01:45:01,425
global. So finding out how bodies as

28600
01:45:01,487 --> 01:45:05,125
territories and our models as maps

28610
01:45:07,575 --> 01:45:10,980
wire things up is

28620
01:45:11,027 --> 01:45:12,840
going to make models that are more

28630
01:45:12,857 --> 01:45:16,065
interpretable, better aligned with

28640
01:45:16,082 --> 01:45:19,205
empirical data, making more useful

28650
01:45:19,265 --> 01:45:22,545
predictions and explanations. Very

28660
01:45:22,697 --> 01:45:26,535
interesting angle. And I would say

28670
01:45:26,717 --> 01:45:29,490
just to piggyback a little, you know,

28680
01:45:29,507 --> 01:45:31,515
as a modeling paradigm, I think this is

28690
01:45:31,532 --> 01:45:33,065
one of the real strengths of active

28700
01:45:33,095 --> 01:45:35,585
inference is that once you're dealing

28710
01:45:35,630 --> 01:45:37,950
with these probability densities and log

28720
01:45:38,012 --> 01:45:41,637
probability densities, you are

28730
01:45:42,825 --> 01:45:44,685
able to start sketching out these

28740
01:45:44,717 --> 01:45:48,135
hierarchical structures. And that

28750
01:45:48,167 --> 01:45:49,730
doesn't mean that every hierarchical

28760
01:45:49,790 --> 01:45:51,840
active internal model is automatically a

28770
01:45:51,857 --> 01:45:54,810
map of the nervous system, but it does

28780
01:45:54,842 --> 01:45:56,715
mean that you have a language that is at

28790
01:45:56,732 --> 01:45:59,315
least minimally capable of expressing

28800
01:45:59,495 --> 01:46:01,965
what we so abundantly find in the

28810
01:46:01,982 --> 01:46:03,325
empirical evidence.

28820
01:46:05,175 --> 01:46:08,715
Speaker D: Yeah, one part of the paper that

28830
01:46:08,732 --> 01:46:12,210
was very interesting, we in

28840
01:46:12,242 --> 01:46:15,480
reading it, remarked how although most

28850
01:46:15,527 --> 01:46:18,000
papers are written in words, this one

28860
01:46:18,062 --> 01:46:22,745
was very wordforward. Each section

28870
01:46:22,910 --> 01:46:27,912
had a preamble content

28880
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:31,935
summary sandwiching technique, as did

28890
01:46:31,967 --> 01:46:34,500
the paper. At a higher scale, the

28900
01:46:34,562 --> 01:46:38,430
nomenclature was upfront and clear and

28910
01:46:38,477 --> 01:46:42,570
then the relationship between the

28920
01:46:42,722 --> 01:46:45,525
cumulative distributions and the

28930
01:46:45,587 --> 01:46:48,475
classical PDF type probability densities

28940
01:46:49,275 --> 01:46:52,812
was made clear. But this

28950
01:46:53,625 --> 01:46:57,300
exactly connects something

28960
01:46:57,362 --> 01:46:59,112
that has a,

28970
01:47:00,675 --> 01:47:04,085
in the generic case, a guaranteed

28980
01:47:04,130 --> 01:47:06,455
inflection point interpretable

28990
01:47:06,515 --> 01:47:08,690
thresholded values. This is why Sigmoid

29000
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:10,250
functions are used as activation

29010
01:47:10,325 --> 01:47:13,525
functions in artificial neural networks

29020
01:47:13,950 --> 01:47:18,815
with an optimizable

29030
01:47:18,995 --> 01:47:22,212
Laplacian approximation like

29040
01:47:23,475 --> 01:47:27,315
inverted quadratic form that

29050
01:47:27,407 --> 01:47:30,775
is able to be used as a log probability.

29060
01:47:31,350 --> 01:47:33,510
And so really. Like. Especially with

29070
01:47:33,542 --> 01:47:37,295
figure nine showing the stepwise

29080
01:47:37,385 --> 01:47:40,685
relationship opens the door

29090
01:47:40,730 --> 01:47:42,620
to like hey. If you've seen a Sigmoid

29100
01:47:42,710 --> 01:47:46,455
somewhere. Now you can think about that

29110
01:47:46,502 --> 01:47:50,585
as like a PDF hiding a PDF bell curve

29120
01:47:50,780 --> 01:47:53,105
and then where you have seen a Gaussian

29130
01:47:53,165 --> 01:47:55,310
or bell curve or Laplacian

29140
01:47:55,355 --> 01:47:58,230
approximation. You can go the other

29150
01:47:58,277 --> 01:48:01,515
direction and think about that in

29160
01:48:01,532 --> 01:48:04,225
terms of a Sigmoidal response action.

29170
01:48:04,950 --> 01:48:08,870
And so they're rarely connected.

29180
01:48:09,035 --> 01:48:11,460
So clearly though, those with

29190
01:48:11,492 --> 01:48:14,340
familiarity, it's almost the water that

29200
01:48:14,357 --> 01:48:15,930
they swim in and those without

29210
01:48:15,977 --> 01:48:17,875
familiarity wouldn't see the connection

29220
01:48:18,225 --> 01:48:21,285
and the challenge and the opportunity is

29230
01:48:21,317 --> 01:48:25,455
like to stick in the middle and stay in

29240
01:48:25,502 --> 01:48:28,835
the connection space to raise

29250
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:30,135
attention to some of these

29260
01:48:30,167 --> 01:48:31,940
relationships. Which again, otherwise

29270
01:48:32,045 --> 01:48:33,645
you could have a whole subfield of

29280
01:48:33,647 --> 01:48:35,915
physiology working on the Sigmoid

29290
01:48:35,945 --> 01:48:39,075
response curve and a whole subfield of

29300
01:48:39,137 --> 01:48:41,180
hierarchical predictive processing

29310
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:44,655
models working in the PDF space or log

29320
01:48:44,702 --> 01:48:48,365
PDF space. And it's just a derivative

29330
01:48:48,545 --> 01:48:52,125
and a log or an exponentiation and a

29340
01:48:52,187 --> 01:48:55,560
derivation away from

29350
01:48:55,742 --> 01:48:58,370
those two fields being formally

29360
01:48:58,460 --> 01:49:00,195
connected, not just as like a

29370
01:49:00,197 --> 01:49:01,965
speculative review paper, someone could

29380
01:49:01,982 --> 01:49:04,785
or should do this, but it's done. We

29390
01:49:04,817 --> 01:49:05,862
just didn't know.

29400
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:11,030
Cool. So I think regarding the writing,

29410
01:49:11,090 --> 01:49:13,065
I really have to hand credit to Lisa and

29420
01:49:13,082 --> 01:49:16,575
Karen for a lot of things where speaking

29430
01:49:16,637 --> 01:49:18,530
of more, speaking of dialectical

29440
01:49:18,590 --> 01:49:21,305
processes, we have a very simple writing

29450
01:49:21,365 --> 01:49:23,790
dialectic on these papers, which is

29460
01:49:23,957 --> 01:49:26,950
junior author knows math. Senior authors

29470
01:49:28,125 --> 01:49:30,210
did not specialize in math in their

29480
01:49:30,242 --> 01:49:33,030
undergrad or master's degree or even

29490
01:49:33,077 --> 01:49:36,612
PhD, however good they are with it now.

29500
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:40,310
And the result ends up being you're

29510
01:49:40,355 --> 01:49:43,035
always told to go back and explain every

29520
01:49:43,142 --> 01:49:46,450
single step. And of course, Jordan,

29530
01:49:46,875 --> 01:49:49,440
who was here before, was helping a lot

29540
01:49:49,457 --> 01:49:50,970
with the writing and the structuring and

29550
01:49:50,972 --> 01:49:55,410
the sign posting. And then I

29560
01:49:55,442 --> 01:49:57,690
think the actual insight that you can

29570
01:49:57,707 --> 01:49:59,790
take one of these sigmoids and turn it

29580
01:49:59,807 --> 01:50:04,415
into a PDF I think came after hammering

29590
01:50:04,445 --> 01:50:07,385
our heads on some of the embodied

29600
01:50:07,430 --> 01:50:09,665
predictive processing literature a bunch

29610
01:50:09,695 --> 01:50:13,950
of times because

29620
01:50:14,087 --> 01:50:15,945
it is one of those things that is

29630
01:50:16,022 --> 01:50:17,500
literally embodied.

29640
01:50:19,650 --> 01:50:22,980
Speaker A: Dean yeah, I just wanted

29650
01:50:23,027 --> 01:50:26,315
to get this in. What attracted

29660
01:50:26,345 --> 01:50:28,362
me to the paper in the first place was

29670
01:50:28,725 --> 01:50:32,885
the allostasis and the interception.

29680
01:50:33,005 --> 01:50:36,990
What kept me going back to it was and

29690
01:50:37,007 --> 01:50:39,237
we talked about this in the dot zero was

29700
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:44,285
wayfinder, that rule perspective

29710
01:50:44,330 --> 01:50:48,830
swaps versus a way finder.

29720
01:50:48,890 --> 01:50:50,865
When I first state reading this paper,

29730
01:50:51,032 --> 01:50:55,140
I saw the metamorphosis from

29740
01:50:55,307 --> 01:50:58,737
identifying a way to find things.

29750
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:01,460
And now after having this conversation

29760
01:51:01,580 --> 01:51:04,620
with you today and Jordan and of course

29770
01:51:04,772 --> 01:51:08,810
the usual suspects. It's clearer

29780
01:51:08,855 --> 01:51:12,105
to me that this paper is trying to play

29790
01:51:12,152 --> 01:51:16,300
that role of being wayfinder

29800
01:51:17,250 --> 01:51:20,930
prospective identifier as opposed

29810
01:51:20,990 --> 01:51:24,495
to we found our way

29820
01:51:24,572 --> 01:51:28,650
or this is our way to solve all

29830
01:51:28,712 --> 01:51:31,470
the world's ills. Which of course I

29840
01:51:31,472 --> 01:51:32,855
don't think it was ever your intention.

29850
01:51:32,915 --> 01:51:35,535
But when you pull things that are

29860
01:51:35,567 --> 01:51:37,650
seemingly quite far apart. Like

29870
01:51:37,712 --> 01:51:40,450
allostasis and interception.

29880
01:51:41,775 --> 01:51:45,315
I get excited. But as you pointed out,

29890
01:51:45,407 --> 01:51:46,965
pump the brakestem, don't get too

29900
01:51:46,982 --> 01:51:48,810
excited here. We're doing the best we

29910
01:51:48,842 --> 01:51:51,687
can. So on that level,

29920
01:51:54,450 --> 01:51:56,315
my Amygdala is still functioning

29930
01:51:56,345 --> 01:52:00,240
correctly. In our

29940
01:52:00,332 --> 01:52:02,862
closing thoughts with a driving example.

29950
01:52:03,525 --> 01:52:06,590
Are we accumulating speed or minimizing

29960
01:52:06,620 --> 01:52:09,845
the amount of time? Or are speed limits

29970
01:52:09,935 --> 01:52:14,780
even set as exteriorized norms

29980
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:18,405
and stigmaergic marks on the niche such

29990
01:52:18,452 --> 01:52:22,455
that a variety of cars from a sports car

30000
01:52:22,577 --> 01:52:25,860
to 18 wheeler can be within a zone of

30010
01:52:25,892 --> 01:52:28,410
optimal controllability, taking into

30020
01:52:28,442 --> 01:52:30,660
account the presence of crosswalks and

30030
01:52:30,692 --> 01:52:34,140
so on. And so alongside as

30040
01:52:34,157 --> 01:52:35,825
we think about what we want to explore

30050
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:38,805
in the dot two alongside diving into

30060
01:52:38,852 --> 01:52:42,762
formalisms. Trying to do some

30070
01:52:43,350 --> 01:52:47,550
excavation and interoception on

30080
01:52:47,687 --> 01:52:50,900
how and where the economic

30090
01:52:51,050 --> 01:52:55,890
optimization as maximization is

30100
01:52:55,982 --> 01:53:00,435
implicitly used and where

30110
01:53:00,617 --> 01:53:03,690
some of these other notions that

30120
01:53:03,707 --> 01:53:07,800
were being raised without needing to

30130
01:53:07,862 --> 01:53:11,625
be polemical or replace value

30140
01:53:11,762 --> 01:53:15,987
maximization. But where we can see

30150
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:21,700
these other survivability criterion

30160
01:53:23,025 --> 01:53:25,490
has potentially different decompositions

30170
01:53:25,595 --> 01:53:27,615
of unified objective function that are

30180
01:53:27,632 --> 01:53:30,065
informational and so on. I think that's

30190
01:53:30,095 --> 01:53:33,030
going to be quite far ranging because

30200
01:53:33,077 --> 01:53:35,450
there's more situations I would venture

30210
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:37,155
where we would rather have

30220
01:53:37,202 --> 01:53:40,750
controllability and exteroception

30230
01:53:41,175 --> 01:53:44,865
bounding and meeting rather than

30240
01:53:45,032 --> 01:53:48,045
point stacking. So final

30250
01:53:48,197 --> 01:53:50,262
comments you like?

30260
01:53:52,650 --> 01:53:54,675
Speaker B: Yeah, so I just really want to close by

30270
01:53:54,737 --> 01:53:56,937
reemphasizing that.

30280
01:54:02,475 --> 01:54:05,315
I think I have this joke on my Twitter

30290
01:54:05,345 --> 01:54:08,610
profile, "Abolish the value function!" And

30300
01:54:08,642 --> 01:54:10,455
that's really just a pun for the people

30310
01:54:10,502 --> 01:54:14,310
who can get it, but we're not trying to

30320
01:54:14,342 --> 01:54:16,515
tell people, contrary to their

30330
01:54:16,532 --> 01:54:18,515
subjective experience, oh, you don't

30340
01:54:18,545 --> 01:54:22,610
really have value in your brain.

30350
01:54:22,805 --> 01:54:24,975
There's actually just, you know, trying

30360
01:54:25,037 --> 01:54:27,175
to track your reference trajectory.

30370
01:54:27,975 --> 01:54:31,110
So in the plant two, we can talk about

30380
01:54:31,217 --> 01:54:33,755
which specific kinds of feedback

30390
01:54:33,815 --> 01:54:36,785
control, what kinds of feedback

30400
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:39,990
mechanisms are really being spoken of in

30410
01:54:40,007 --> 01:54:43,140
this paper. And I think

30420
01:54:43,232 --> 01:54:46,775
as preview,

30430
01:54:46,850 --> 01:54:48,945
it's negative, both negative in the

30440
01:54:48,947 --> 01:54:51,005
sense of avoiding negative reinforcement

30450
01:54:51,065 --> 01:54:54,230
and in the sense of trying to flatten

30460
01:54:54,290 --> 01:54:57,315
out a response function and be able to

30470
01:54:57,332 --> 01:55:01,440
proportionally respond. So, you know,

30480
01:55:01,607 --> 01:55:04,380
with the benefit of hindsight, this

30490
01:55:04,427 --> 01:55:06,965
paper is going to have a pretty limited

30500
01:55:07,145 --> 01:55:08,412
domain of application,

30510
01:55:10,650 --> 01:55:13,470
but it's helpful in that it gives us a

30520
01:55:13,472 --> 01:55:15,840
language to turn around to the

30530
01:55:15,857 --> 01:55:18,840
empiricists and say, this is what we

30540
01:55:18,857 --> 01:55:20,637
want to actually look for.

30550
01:55:25,350 --> 01:55:27,465
Speaker D: Any closing comments? Otherwise that's a

30560
01:55:27,482 --> 01:55:30,510
great noise. Well,

30570
01:55:30,617 --> 01:55:33,015
Eli and Jordan as well, thanks for

30580
01:55:33,107 --> 01:55:35,810
coming out and for engaging in dot

30590
01:55:35,855 --> 01:55:39,462
oneery and we'll see you next week.

30600
01:55:39,825 --> 01:55:41,812
Speaker A: Thanks, guys. See you next week.
