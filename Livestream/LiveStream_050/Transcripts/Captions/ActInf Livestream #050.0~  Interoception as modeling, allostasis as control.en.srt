19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,220
today in 50.0 we're starting this series

20
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,840
discussing the paper interception as

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,240

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,460

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,119
it is a paper published in the journal

27
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,320
biological psychology in January of 2022

28
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,140
and this is just an introduction and

29
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,280
context video as Dean here and I

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,500
work through this paper and discuss some

31
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,360
related topics

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,400
we're going to go over some big

33
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,280
questions basic aims and Abstract

34
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,400
roadmap of the paper then go into the

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,920
paper touch on a few key points and

36
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,799
images and themes and then primarily

37
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,560
look forward to discussing it with any

38
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,420
authors or anyone else who'd like to

39
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,939
join in the coming weeks

40
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,759
all right so I'm Daniel I'm a researcher

41
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,920
in California and

42
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,680
the paper was selected by decentralized

43
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,940
upvote

44
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,500
it was uh fun to read and it brings some

45
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,800
new topics into our regime of attention

46
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,540
so I'm looking forward to this and I'll

47
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,459
pass to Dean

48
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,379
thanks Charlie I'm Dean I'm here in

49
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,000
Calgary

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,860
I think what's interesting about any

51
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,099
paper that um pulls to seemingly

52
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:30,300
discreet

53
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,120
things and put some proximal and gets

54
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,819
them entangling and then pulls them

55
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,940
apart again and tries to look at sort of

56
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,760
what happens when things get combined is

57
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,900
always something that I'm always

58
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,700
interested in that in fact it was the

59
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,500
title of this and the fact that they

60
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,819
were bringing allostasis and

61
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,400
teresception together and what what does

62
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,760
that mean was the reason why I spent a

63
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,560
little bit of time on this and really

64
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,239
I'm quite interested in hearing what the

65
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,340
authors have to say now that they put

66
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,440
this idea to

67
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,200
to work

68
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,120
right how would you describe the big

69
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,360
question

70
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,879
well I mean I think the focus here is on

71
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,159
on what happens and what we can say

72
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,080
about controller requirements necessary

73
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,080
to carry out physiological tasks varying

74
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,640
degrees of complexity

75
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,440
um

76
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,159
I've never been really sure how the the

77
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,860
specificity of different outcomes and

78
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,980
behaviors looks in aggregate but I think

79
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,739
one of the things that we can say is if

80
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,599
there is a predictive component and

81
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,459
there's a feedback component

82
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,560
and they're focusing on two particular

83
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,959
types of that

84
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,299
um it's interesting perhaps what kind of

85
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,540
generalities we can walk away with

86
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,640
um never you know sort of not getting

87
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,099
lost in the weeds of well this happened

88
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,780
here and then that happened there but

89
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,760
just on that General level what what

90
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,319
sorts of things when those two things

91
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,060
are put together

92
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,659
um should we say as a certain pattern or

93
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,760
commonality

94
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,879
nice I agree I would put it in the

95
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,239
category of asking how a given system

96
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,739
independent

97
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,199
or modality independent phenomena like

98
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,918
allostasis which is anticipatory changes

99
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,100
in physiology and connects with a domain

100
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,460
or a use case like interception and it

101
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,139
does seem like a lot of the models that

102
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:31,500
we've explored have been visual or

103
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,139
conceptual or symbolic

104
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,400
and the interceptive modality has popped

105
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,800
up again and again in discussions and so

106
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,160
this is a cool opportunity to look at

107
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,080
some formalisms for interception

108
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,720
okay here's the paper

109
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,880
as described earlier just a few of the

110
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,740
highlights that were written by the

111
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,360
authors on the

112
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,120
publication page

113
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,380
interception enables the brain to

114
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,840
anticipate the body's upcoming metabolic

115
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,660
needs interception provides performance

116
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,380
metrics for viscera motor regulation

117
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,360
we connect control theory with decision

118
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,240
making and motor control of the body

119
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,360
we model allostatic control as optimal

120
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,820
control with the time varying reference

121
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,620
signal

122
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,840
they talk about some

123
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,860
limitations of previous models and some

124
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,240
unique aspects of what their model does

125
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,759
and the way that they formulate the apic

126
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,639
model

127
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,340
anything to add

128
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,060
no I think their aims are

129
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,800
straightforward

130
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,360
okay on claim so Dean and I were

131
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,600
looking into

132
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,580
thinking of ourselves

133
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,220
in terms of claims adjusters appraisers

134
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,820
examiners and investigators

135
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,440
as we

136
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,560
pulled out a whole handful of really

137
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,800
important and salient

138
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,419
within the argument of this relatively

139
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:13,560
long

140
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,979
and technically scaffolded paper

141
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:20,639
and pulling out a bunch of claims that

142
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,180
are written that connect the dots and

143
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,060
set some of the relevant uh

144
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,880
interpretations for the formalisms

145
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,160
do you want to highlight any of them or

146
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,199
it's fine to just have them

147
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,919
for anyone who wants to yeah

148
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:40,259
off of this but I will say this here

149
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:43,319
there is a I think a parallel trying to

150
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,060
be drawn here between

151
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,620
predictive

152
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,340
predictive uh processing no I'm not

153
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,340
saying that predictive processing but

154
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,560
processing as a as a predictive device

155
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,360
and feelings

156
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,520
and control and feedback and so I think

157
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,259
there are a lot of claims that can be

158
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,160
made

159
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,199
but that's a really really

160
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,380
um nuanced and also a very very

161
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,180
complex

162
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,000
uh space to play in and so I can

163
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,800
understand why

164
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,259
um there's lots and lots of claims

165
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:23,400
um again whether or not or how far those

166
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,460
claims can hold before they break down

167
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,740
will be an interesting thing to talk to

168
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,500
with the authors

169
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,800
yeah well said it's a very intertwined

170
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,960
area maybe that's what you're pointing

171
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,860
towards when you say complex operating

172
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,080
yeah I have a lot of hair so it's It's

173
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,819
Tricky for me

174
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,139
all right

175
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,240
abstract

176
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,479
okay I'll read the first three

177
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,340
the brain regulates the body by

178
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,380
anticipating its needs and attempting to

179
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,539
meet them before they arise a process

180
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,580
called allostasis

181
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,460
allostasis requires a model of the

182
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,199
changing sensory conditions within the

183
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,080
body a process called interception in

184
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,240
this paper we examine how interoception

185
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,400
may provide performance feedback for

186
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,020
allostasis

187
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,380
we suggest studying allostasis in terms

188
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,479
of control theory reviewing control

189
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,759
theories applications to related issues

190
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,039
in physiology motor control and decision

191
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,199
making

192
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,060
we synthesize these by relating them to

193
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,680
the important properties of outostatic

194
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,339
Regulation as a control problem we then

195
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:33,958
sketch a normal formalism for how the

196
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,599
brain might perform allostatic control

197
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,839
of the viscera by analogy two skeletal

198
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,120
motor control including a mathematical

199
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,180
View and how intersection acts as a

200
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,640
performance feedback for allostasis

201
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,620
finally we suggest ways to test

202
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,019
implications of our hypothesis

203
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,519
okay onto the roadmap

204
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,880
paper starts with introduction to

205
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,380
function

206
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,600
of the brain in the body

207
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,080
and then introduces some of the key

208
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,380
pillars or foundations of their

209
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,660
synthesis and interpretation

210
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,640
which is interception

211
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,160
control theory as an approach for

212
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,959
unifying physiology motor control

213
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,580
decision making

214
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,760
and allostasis as a trajectory

215
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,120
tracking stochastic optimal control

216
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,060
the fifth section is a discussion and

217
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,940
then there's an appendix B and C

218
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,519
and in their words four sections in this

219
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,620
paper connect interception to allostasis

220
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,540
section two establishes how

221
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,279
interoception enables the brain to

222
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,560
estimate the physiological efficiency of

223
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,600
the body in the present moment which is

224
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,339
precisely what it needs to know to

225
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,860
evaluate and refine action

226
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,839
Section 3 introduces control theory

227
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,120
section 4 applies the principles of

228
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,760
control theory to derive a novel format

229
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,100
model of how the brain might estimate

230
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,720
the desirability of physiological

231
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,000
trajectories and make prospective

232
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,940
regulatory decisions finally Section 5

233
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,339
synthesizes the previous three sections

234
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,740
to explore the direct implications of

235
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,959
the proposed formalism appendix a

236
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,760
provides a glossary of terms but this is

237
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,920
moved up and it's no longer an appendix

238
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,540
so there's no appendix a

239
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,700
appendix B1 provides mathematical

240
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,800
details related to section 3 and

241
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,899
appendix C1 provides mathematical

242
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:29,360
details related to section 4.

243
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,140
the keywords were interception

244
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,180
allostasis and predictive processing

245
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,620
we're going to talk a lot about

246
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,380
interception and allostasis

247
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,019
somewhat in this dot zero but certainly

248
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,060
in the coming discussions and for

249
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,180
predictive processing a good recent

250
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,500
stream is live stream number 43 with

251
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,540
Maria

252
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,240
okay also just for reference we'll pause

253
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,700
on these just long enough for you to

254
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,040
screenshot them if you want

255
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,320
there's a nomenclature table

256
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,140
with the definition of many words so

257
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,260
here's the first nomenclature terms 1

258
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,279
through 25.

259
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,600
and then here's the second half of the

260
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,360
nomenclature 26 to 49.

261
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,560
sort it alphabetically

262
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,519
anything to add on the nomenclature

263
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,560
other than to say that

264
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,079
it's good that they provided it and

265
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:34,980
it'll be used in the coming sections

266
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,660
well I think it's interesting that you

267
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,180
pointed out that the um they pulled they

268
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,579
pulled the definitions forward and then

269
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:44,820
when you look at the formalisms and so I

270
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,680
think from the standpoint of what they

271
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,860
what they want to message around

272
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,360
this

273
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,339
this braiding

274
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:57,360
um requires us to at least get a

275
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,560
Common Sense around what things mean

276
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,940
before we start

277
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,120
trying to pull apart what they equal

278
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,600
so yeah I kind of what kind of like that

279
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,579
well said

280
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:14,040
all right section one introduction the

281
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,380
functions of the brain in the body

282
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,660
okay

283
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:21,120
there's an evocative beginning to this

284
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,339
paper

285
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:24,959
um playing a simple game of dodgeball

286
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,480
then requires your brain to continually

287
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,420
coordinate the systems of your body

288
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,200
and this motif of dodgeball is going to

289
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,220
be

290
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,079
returning again

291
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:41,220
and on the left is a hugging face

292
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,680
implementation of a stable diffusion

293
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,680
algorithm The Prompt of the image was

294
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,560
DodgeBall playful ants active inference

295
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,720
free energy principle

296
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,720
and while we were making the slides we

297
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,000
were engaged in active inference with

298
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,060
some of these image generating

299
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,680
affordances and allowing that to

300
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,660
do what

301
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,980
well I think it's really interesting

302
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,160
that this what what the generator said

303
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,079
this would be the result of a

304
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:15,240
coordinated

305
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,079
um

306
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,139
what's the word I'm looking for

307
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:21,120
entanglement of these of these prompts

308
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,000
but didn't talk anything about what what

309
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,579
strategy each one of those

310
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:28,920
um Silhouettes is now employing

311
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,800
and I think that there is an implied

312
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,720
sense that there's a strategy going on

313
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,980
as well so again when you bring some of

314
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,940
these really interesting things together

315
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,860
um it I guess it depends on how deep you

316
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,360
want to go how much you want to

317
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,279
dimensionalize the space

318
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,760
so what is that right there yeah this is

319
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,139
the same prompt this was just another

320
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,240
one this one's coming more a little more

321
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,860
photorealistic

322
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,380
a little bit more like

323
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,600
elusive you know are they playing

324
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,740
dodgeball

325
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,240
yeah

326
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,560
are they just inferring

327
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:10,139
all right next keyword you can go for it

328
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:11,459
if you just people can read the

329
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,200
definition here but just give your own

330
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,959
take what is interception

331
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,540
well I think at the at the end of the

332
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,459
day there's there's a certain amount of

333
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,399
signaling signaling going on that we

334
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,920
become aware of sometimes young people

335
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,740
or all people like sort of categorize

336
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,160
them all under the umbrella of feelings

337
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,060
and uh

338
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,820
I grabbed this from tots On Target just

339
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,160
because I always worked in that kind of

340
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,139
space of how do we keep this as simple

341
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:43,680
as we can and so when you get these

342
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,899
signals these sensory signals originate

343
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,240
from within the body these are the

344
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,199
feelings you get and uh whether or not

345
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:56,160
you connect them to the world outside of

346
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,000
your

347
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,639
skin or your margins

348
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:02,220
um sometimes you do sometimes you don't

349
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,320
you just wake up with a tummy ache right

350
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,940
so what does that mean about today

351
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,320
nice

352
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,740
I would say a little narrowly

353
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,459
interception is referring to some

354
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:19,320
observation and inference on hidden

355
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,459
States

356
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:23,220
with a referent that's in Tarot inside

357
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,100
of the body as opposed to X tarot

358
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,899
outside the body but there's probably

359
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,000
also a lot of like blurring and what is

360
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,800
the retina really doing is it doing

361
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,500
inference on itself and where is it

362
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,500
actually doing inference on the outside

363
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,699
world

364
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:41,519
structure all right interceptive

365
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,620
internal models you added some images so

366
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,600
what are they

367
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,940
so I'll just read this real quick so

368
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,560
psychologists refer to the internal mod

369
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,019
including interception by many terms and

370
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,459
I think it I think that's important

371
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:54,660
because there hasn't always been

372
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,579
agreement about clearly defining what an

373
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,680
internal model is

374
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,300
um things like unconscious interest

375
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,699
seems to fit into this umbrella embodied

376
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,579
simulation Concepts and categories

377
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:10,199
controlled hallucination which was new

378
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:11,639
to me because I don't know what that

379
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,339
even means uh and regardless of what

380
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:15,899
it's called the brain is hypothesized to

381
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,899
construct a dynamic model of its body in

382
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:20,699
the world in this paper we use the terms

383
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:24,240
prediction simulation and concept and so

384
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,839
to somebody with sort of my deep

385
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,839
research background in terms of

386
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,660
abduction the the signal the interpreted

387
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,459
the object

388
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:39,120
um what is that model how do we how do

389
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,240
we avoid getting into another great

390
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,759
debate about whether that's

391
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,920
representational and content filled or

392
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,079
not or is there something that

393
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:52,620
we

394
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,500
sense From the Inside every every every

395
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,220
single time data is coming at us and

396
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,480
being poured

397
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,040
onto our different sensory surfaces

398
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,859
exterior exterior on the outside

399
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,660
I I think that there's a piece that

400
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,699
comes from the outside I know when the

401
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,559
temperature goes up in the room but my

402
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:14,819
temperature might also be going up

403
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,459
because I ate a bad shrimp and it's

404
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:18,959
sometimes difficult to figure out

405
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,179
whether or not it's because the heat

406
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:24,299
gone up or whether my body's responding

407
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,520
with an inflammatory

408
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,620
gesture

409
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,320
yeah that's a

410
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,200
nice Point like sometimes called a

411
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,640
difference making cause or difference

412
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,220
that makes a difference does a viral

413
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,200
infection cause the body temperature to

414
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,160
rise

415
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,380
and or to what extent can that be

416
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,200
decomposed into factors from the virus

417
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,260
versus this the Dynamics changing of the

418
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,059
immune system

419
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:52,140
so

420
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,799
interesting image on the left knows I

421
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,100
can't tell whether the image on the left

422
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,679
by the image on the left what's what

423
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,020
speed the image on the right is actually

424
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,480
moving down the road and that's kind of

425
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,600
why I wanted the ambiguity there

426
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,480
for an enteroceptor model because you

427
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,240
know demacio talks a lot about what what

428
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,679
can we really

429
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,919
describe and pursue precise terms and

430
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,440
what remains somewhat ambiguous and the

431
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,240
authors in this paper talk a little bit

432
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,000
about God as well yeah when the referent

433
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,059
is external it's objective then there's

434
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,640
the opportunity for multiple external

435
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,860
perspectives to align not even saying

436
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,960
that's better but just the opportunity

437
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,100
to whereas if the embodied behavior of

438
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,620
your physiological set point for some

439
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,880
physiological regulation

440
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,760
is changed it doesn't have the same

441
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,280
opportunity for external alignment again

442
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,020
for better and For Worse

443
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,980
and almost always with difficulty

444
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,700
communicating or sometimes measuring in

445
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,160
laboratory settings as well and quote

446
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,480
controlling

447
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,080
So speaking with authors on this and why

448
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,299
they study this modality

449
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:16,380
will be interesting all right as for the

450
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,900
computational or

451
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,260
system independent phenomena that

452
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,760
they're going to be trying to integrate

453
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,720
with Alice with in tersection is

454
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,039
allostasis they Define this term as

455
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,500
allostasis is to anticipate changing

456
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,960
needs evaluate priorities and prepare

457
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,240
the organism to satisfy them before they

458
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,039
lead to errors a process called

459
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,919
allostasis so let's just say that you

460
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,840
have an allostatic model of the

461
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,100
temperature in the room

462
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,919
and the core body temperature doesn't

463
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,799
change so then can one look back and say

464
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,660
it didn't change because it was expected

465
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,799
to change

466
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,660
and somebody will just say well how do

467
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,039
you know it worked then because it

468
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,600
didn't raise the body temperature

469
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,700
I focused on the part that the fact that

470
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,940
they describe it as a three-part process

471
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,740
so me being always talking about what's

472
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,360
the minimum here what's the minimum here

473
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,520
we need in order to be able to to do

474
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,860
this I find that really not really quite

475
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,120
interesting

476
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,860
why three

477
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,160
not four or five are breaking it out

478
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,640
into into smaller slices that's again

479
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,919
another one of those questions I'd like

480
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:31,559
to be able to talk to the authors about

481
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:35,059
all right active inference

482
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,260
they wrote

483
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,179
before

484
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,100
diving into formal modeling details

485
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,419
below which we're going to get to later

486
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:43,440
in the paper

487
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,480
it might be helpful to compare and

488
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,100
contrast the approach here

489
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,660
apic

490
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,400
with the prominent modeling framework

491
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,980
active inference and we're going to

492
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,720
return to some of these details and I'm

493
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,000
sure have a lot of discussion on it but

494
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,580
you made a really interesting point in

495
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,220
our preparation about how they're not

496
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,419
treating their model as

497
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:08,160
Downstream or a corollary of any

498
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,120
commitment to a particular physics which

499
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,100
is how we often hear about free energy

500
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,799
principle basically mechanics

501
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,740
but rather they're treating

502
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,600
the

503
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,400
model as a first order construction

504
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,380
anything you want to add on that because

505
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,179
I thought that was really like help me

506
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:29,340
frame what the paper was about

507
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,760
yeah that's Street part I think that the

508
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,799
work bullet unlike most active interest

509
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,360
models in the literature are the

510
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,400
material below considers an indefinite

511
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,059
time or infinite Horizon control setting

512
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:44,220
is interesting because that makes it

513
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,080
really really clear between what they're

514
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,679
talking about and what we often see in a

515
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,860
lot of the representations which is t0

516
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,080
T1 to T

517
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,580
whatever

518
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,320
in terms of being able to figure out

519
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,159
what is going on sequentially so

520
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,320
all right cool

521
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,960
this section in the introduction talks

522
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,640
about some issues with other models

523
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,559
they talk about how existing models of

524
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:16,140
interception have either formulated

525
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,940
allostasis as a prospective

526
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,919
decision-making problem

527
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,600
without considering how these decisions

528
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,280
are enacted which has a bunch of

529
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,679
different interpretations but maybe for

530
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,900
example requiring the enumeration of

531
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,419
policies and then the selection from

532
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:31,740
policies

533
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,919
or as a motor control problem without

534
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:36,539
considering where motor commands come

535
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:37,980
from

536
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,900
another issue they have with other

537
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,640
models rather than treat metabolic

538
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,380
efficiency as the objective they discuss

539
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,200
homeostasis the regulation of bodily

540
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,179
variables to fix set points with fixed

541
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:49,679
tolerance for error

542
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,780
so this is really going to be a cool

543
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,580
theme which is

544
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,460
rather than fix the set point and

545
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,780
variability

546
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:02,220
see that outcome as being due to some

547
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,120
other process that does result in an

548
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,480
attracting set or point with a fixed set

549
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,720
point and an empirical tolerance for

550
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,059
error as well as maybe some points of no

551
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:16,500
return and so on

552
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,620
but seeing all those outcomes as the

553
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,780
realization of a dynamical system that

554
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,900
actually doesn't pursue a set point but

555
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,740
rather pursues a slope on a graph that

556
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,780
we'll explore and that like zone of

557
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,700
maximum controllability

558
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,520
and reduction of surprisal around the

559
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,760
zone of maximum controllability

560
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,460
over evolutionary time will come to be

561
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,200
associated with this kind of a survival

562
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,480
variable

563
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,659
and some other points okay anything else

564
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:50,340
well it's relationship relationship

565
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,840
relationship and then they say this

566
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,760
paper aims to fill this Gap

567
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,860
I think in relationship doesn't

568
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,620
necessarily imply that things have to

569
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,320
get

570
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,039
closed in terms of whatever the Gap is

571
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:07,020
by filling something in I think I think

572
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,760
the fact that they talk about targeting

573
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,980
I think about the fact that they see

574
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,440
relationship as playing

575
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,080
kind of the key role in what they think

576
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,059
is happening here

577
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:21,780
um means that that they maybe the gap

578
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,340
um continues I mean they're they're

579
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,919
putting stuff in here for us to consider

580
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,200
and contemplate but I'm not sure

581
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,059
if we're actually filling a gap where

582
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:32,159
we're just sort of understanding what's

583
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,059
in this space

584
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:38,460
right

585
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,100
section two so at the beginning of

586
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,700
section two the top

587
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,500
paragraphs interception modeling the

588
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,320
body estimating its efficiency and then

589
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,200
the below the fold

590
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,179
section 2.5 the summary so both of these

591
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:00,720
pre and post 2.

592
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,520
um 2.0

593
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,159
2.2

594
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:07,679
contains a lot of structural information

595
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,400
about the key points in this paper

596
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,620
anything to add on this specific slide

597
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,240
to or we'll just go into the sections

598
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,400
star down at the very bottom there

599
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,440
people might want to have a read on that

600
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,600
because I think that's and that's saying

601
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,179
that that's controversial but I do think

602
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:27,480
is interesting yeah

603
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,940
um that the the movement towards the

604
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,620
responsive range of a capacity curve

605
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,960
could be potentially obviating the need

606
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,659
for a dedicated neural circuit or module

607
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:38,159
that specifically calculates the

608
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,220
behavioral constructs of rewarding costs

609
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,900
so what is it

610
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,419
mean to move into uh

611
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:48,360
non-reward-centric

612
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,700
understanding of physiology

613
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,580
or reinterpreting reward

614
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,220
okay section 2.1 introduces a

615
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:00,000
distinction that is going to be key in

616
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,919
the rest of the paper which is the

617
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,260
difference between two types of visceral

618
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,020
sensory variables interceptive

619
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,120
those which represent quantities of

620
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,580
resources regulated resources and those

621
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,500
which represents rates at which

622
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,740
processes act controlled processes

623
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,900
regulated resources are kept stable

624
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,000
relatively stable over time examples

625
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,799
include blood glucose and core body

626
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,000
temperature

627
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,700
so of note is they don't have to be a

628
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,980
depletable resource

629
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,840
the regulated resource is kind of like

630
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,080
the bounded variable in a physiology in

631
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,000
a homeostasis context it's not

632
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,419
necessarily A depletable like metabolite

633
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:42,000
uh regulated resource like blood glucose

634
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,760
or core body temperature represents a

635
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,260
physical quantity or a substance like

636
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,940
glucose its quantity cannot change

637
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,940
instantaneously so I think it will be

638
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,799
interesting to ask like

639
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,960
what different uh regulated resources

640
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,720
of different modalities are

641
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,820
and then controlled processes

642
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,559
are the rates at which physiological

643
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,840
processes operate so in that case would

644
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,159
be like the kind of input output

645
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,860
relationships of blood glucose

646
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,679
okay yeah we just talk about that we

647
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,419
talked about that recently is what's the

648
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:17,760
difference between gripper and gript and

649
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,980
can both exist at once

650
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,720
nice

651
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,200
2.2 back to the DodgeBall example the

652
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,820
heart rate and the blood pressure must

653
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,520
increase during aerobic exercise as

654
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,039
noted in the DodgeBall example

655
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:34,980
so there has to be some physiological

656
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,419
adaptation

657
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:38,940
in order to start exercising and

658
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,299
continue exercising

659
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:44,279
upon resting conditions the baroreceptor

660
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,860
that's pressure receptor heart rate

661
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,380
reflex would normally counter any rise

662
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,760
in blood pressure by slowing the

663
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,340
heartbeat however with exertion your

664
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,260
blood pressure and heart rate both must

665
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,640
increase to support the needed increase

666
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,140
in blood flow required by your

667
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,840
exercising muscles

668
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,659
and so then there's a discussion of how

669
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:07,799
this kind of modulation of reflex allows

670
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,500
for uh shifting of an entire function

671
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,140
relating a change in blood pressure to a

672
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,720
change in your heart rate

673
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,880
so this is describing like a dynamical

674
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,360
systems approach and physiological model

675
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,960
for how the causal or correlational

676
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,799
structure of different physiological

677
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:30,900
variables can be modeled

678
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,820
pretty generally but it's going to get

679
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,418
more specific

680
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,799
yeah a little bit of covariation there

681
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,179
and uh

682
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:41,640
and Physiology and away we go

683
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,159
okay 2.2 predicting and modeling the

684
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,659
ranges of regulated and controlled

685
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:49,020
processes this is describing some of the

686
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,700
parameters

687
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,020
of

688
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,340
the Curve

689
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,260
the threshold and saturation points

690
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,600
which partly derive Define curves that

691
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,400
are derived from functions

692
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,380
which physiologists commonly use to

693
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,279
model the connection between

694
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,380
perturbations and Regulatory responses

695
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,080
usually naming them response curves or

696
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,760
transfer functions

697
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,419
and then the term capacity curves will

698
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,039
be used to emphasize the fact that while

699
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:16,200
such curves can shift over time

700
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,000
in any one instant they represent the

701
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,679
current range of limited regulatory

702
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,320
resources available to an organism

703
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,080
so one could imagine like a financial

704
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,399
capacity curve to maintain some

705
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:31,500
Market at some point like kind of like

706
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,940
the depth

707
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,559
but by

708
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,880
analogy

709
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,640
and then this um

710
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,059
idea of modeling how a system responds

711
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:43,740
to perturbations

712
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,679
doesn't necessarily require modeling the

713
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:50,220
internal model of that system but as you

714
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,799
build a better generative model of the

715
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,720
system being perturbed than the better

716
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,539
experiments and the further you can uh

717
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:00,299
have kind of perturbability of the

718
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,340
system it allows you to approach your

719
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,380
system without a strong hypothesis about

720
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,039
its structure

721
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,960
the capacity curve in figure two point

722
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,480
or in figure one has the mathematical

723
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,080
form and then figure one is shown

724
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,120
alongside with equation one

725
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,440
the parameters are defined the function

726
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,899
y is uh taking in U mu K being R Big B

727
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:32,460
and combining those into an equation

728
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,520
the figure one on the x-axis is showing

729
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,899
the blood pressure

730
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:39,059
and then the y-axis is showing the

731
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:41,340
Baseline activation percentage of the

732
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,980
reflex modulating this physiological

733
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,620
variable so at 100 which is the target

734
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,679
blood pressure or sort of what would be

735
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,140
called the homeostatic set point because

736
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,480
it seems to be an attractor

737
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,899
at that point the Baseline activation of

738
00:30:57,899 --> 00:30:59,820
the barrel reflex is happening

739
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,760
when the blood pressure increases then

740
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,299
the barrel reflex activates up to 2x

741
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:07,500
thresholding at 2x activation of

742
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,720
Baseline and then as the blood pressure

743
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,480
decreases the barrel reflex again with

744
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,360
this sigmoid symmetry decreases

745
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,960
that's a dynamical model of regulation

746
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,980
of blood pressure

747
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,919
equations 2 3 and 4.

748
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,440
outline the form of a generative model a

749
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,880
procedure for probabilistically

750
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,620
predicting observed variables in terms

751
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,539
of unobserved variables

752
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:41,880
the variables listed are unobserved

753
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,740
variables which are sampled from an A

754
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,779
Priory probability distribution not

755
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,820
dependent on data

756
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,220
so that's referring to using a

757
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,559
generative model and how these equations

758
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,120
constitute it

759
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,159
The Proposal here has an unusual feature

760
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,440
the equations for X the mean arterial

761
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,659
blood pressure and why the barrel reflex

762
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:02,460
activation as a percentage of Baseline

763
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,919
so figure 1 X and Y

764
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:08,460
or in terms of the quantile variable U

765
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,200
the quantile variable uniformly

766
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,720
represents the relationship between the

767
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,039
blood pressure and the barrel reflex

768
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:16,559
activation irrespective of changes in

769
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,539
the capacity curve's operating Point mu

770
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:21,720
and gain K the quantile depends only on

771
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,100
the functional form of the capacity

772
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,220
curve and not on the parameters so we'll

773
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,720
unpack that a little more technically

774
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,640
but they point to that as a feature of

775
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,299
their model

776
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,399
here again is figure one a little bigger

777
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:38,220
with more space to discuss later and

778
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,539
here's figure two

779
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:41,340
which is the capacity curve from figure

780
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,640
one in blue with a linearized response

781
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,320
in Orange

782
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,120
around the operating point the Blue

783
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,020
Diamond marker

784
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,860
so

785
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,140
one can see this as the maximum positive

786
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,020
slope of this sigmoid curve

787
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,059
and that under

788
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:02,159
the specification

789
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,679
that the reflex is going to be activated

790
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:06,840
in a sigmoidal way

791
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,960
then depending on whether one is in like

792
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,200
a curving up part or a curving down part

793
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,240
or thinks about it as pursuing the

794
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,039
maximum positive slope

795
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,640
then pursuing that point and being

796
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,620
rewarded by movements towards maximum

797
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,960
maneuverability and control

798
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,440
would have the equivalent of pursuing a

799
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,840
homeostatic model where this is like a

800
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,360
fixed Point attractor

801
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,100
so it puts the kind of bottom of the

802
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,240
bowl

803
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,419
in this Orange Line being maximized in

804
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:44,039
slope rather than the Blue Diamond being

805
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:48,379
reduced in its distance from 100.

806
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,960
right

807
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,679
I think we copied this

808
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,120
section twice

809
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,340
it was so unusual we copied it twice

810
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,860
yeah 2.3

811
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,679
return to the DodgeBall example

812
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,440
and they're going to widen their scope

813
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,379
Beyond just the Barrow reflex blood

814
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:14,460
pressure

815
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,339
to circulating levels of oxygen glucose

816
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:18,780
and carbon dioxide

817
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,820
next we focus on blood glucose as a

818
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,099
regulated resource with glucagon as the

819
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:25,020
controlled process enabling secretion of

820
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,239
glucose into the blood and Insulin as

821
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,399
the Control process enabling removal of

822
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:31,859
glucose from the blood so the barrel

823
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:34,859
reflex was like a single volume knob

824
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:37,080
or a triage nurse that can lower or

825
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,599
raise the single response so if some

826
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,280
physiological variable is high it's like

827
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,918
it can be like removed

828
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:47,060
glucose regulation has multiple hormones

829
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,619
it's going to be like buffered from two

830
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:51,179
different sides in a slightly different

831
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,980
way but using a lot of the same

832
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,679
formalisms and logic

833
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,200
to introduce a slightly

834
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,140
different and more complex physiological

835
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:01,980
system

836
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,460
okay

837
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,540
um the section discusses some findings

838
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,300
that blood blood glucose levels are not

839
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,920
actively defended at a biologically

840
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,260
hard-coded set point any more than heart

841
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,599
rate is instead glucagon and Insulin two

842
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:19,619
hormones

843
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,079
activity balance each other's effects to

844
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,880
bring the blood glucose to a point

845
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,280
within its settling range

846
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,500
with glucose entering the blood after

847
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,480
the person ingests food and glucose then

848
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,980
Crossing from the blood into other

849
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,280
bodily tissues to support their function

850
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,800
anything to add on this

851
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,260
slide not not specifically now wait till

852
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,960
we get to the end of section the second

853
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,700
two stuff

854
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,160
so here is figure three

855
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,500
they're writing figure three

856
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,200
shows plots of the resulting functions

857
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,240
of this equation

858
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,180
applied to the insulin case

859
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,099
which can be interpreted as capacity

860
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:01,980
curves orange sigmoid is insulin

861
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,160
the blue sigmoid is glucagon

862
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,520
they have different hormone levels at

863
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,160
different x-axis which is the level of

864
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,320
glucose in the blood and so you kind of

865
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,359
see familiar behavior when glucose is

866
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:21,300
high then insulin is at high secretion

867
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,200
which drives the absorption of glucose

868
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,540
and when glucose gets low in this case

869
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:31,740
below 2.5 or 3 or so then

870
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:35,940
glucagon is secreted to elicit glucose

871
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,520
to enter the blood

872
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,000
okay

873
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,700
and so one can imagine that the glucose

874
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:49,320
level will be oscillating in this space

875
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,300
but not exactly

876
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,619
set

877
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:55,800
at a set point with a residual being

878
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,460
minimized

879
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,260
section 2.4

880
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,619
is where they move from discussing this

881
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:06,900
kind of a regulatory model

882
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,500
uh into viable ranges and capacities

883
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:15,300
could obviate a modular reward system

884
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,980
here's an argument or appeal to

885
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,660
neuroanatomy there's no single brain

886
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,220
site that specifically encodes

887
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,380
appetitive or aversive reinforcement

888
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,440
value it is useful to reframe discrete

889
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,240
reward and decision systems as domain

890
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,359
General allostatic control systems

891
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:32,460
the domain generality of interception

892
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,380
provides further theoretical support for

893
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,060
the idea that we do not need mental

894
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,720
modules or faculty psychology Concepts

895
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,180
to understand how a brain works

896
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,460
a mathematically sound and biologically

897
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,920
plausible account of allostatic control

898
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,140
does not require a modular or separate

899
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,180
reward system in the central nervous

900
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:51,900
system

901
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,780
and a bit more on this topic anything to

902
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,800
add

903
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,260
now let's get to 37.

904
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,720
all right the rewards of control so here

905
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,820
I wanted to highlight two papers with

906
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,440
some nice images

907
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,980
by both papers involving Tobias Norville

908
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:12,300
and these papers are cited in the paper

909
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,180
under discussion and they all show some

910
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,099
pretty interesting features so just to

911
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:18,720
highlight some of these

912
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,619
graphs here's movements within a glucose

913
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:25,920
and temperature space so regulation of

914
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,859
multiple physiological variables

915
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:31,020
here on the bottom left is the

916
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,320
integration of interception homeostatic

917
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,480
set point and motor commands like

918
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,440
related to foraging

919
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,680
here is some Bayesian

920
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,140
visualizations with a prior posterior

921
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,839
unlikelihood and about this two-way

922
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:51,780
relationship of inference and a former

923
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,280
dynamical model the tale of two

924
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,339
densities and then last one this is uh

925
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:59,240
another body temperature glucose

926
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,980
modeling approach

927
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,180
that

928
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,460
that gets to that notion that we

929
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,800
describe as going to the bottom of the

930
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,640
bowl

931
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,200
where the shape of this

932
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,760
napkin

933
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,119
could be designed or evolved or selected

934
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:20,760
so that the marble spends most of its

935
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,760
time in a certain Zone and this is like

936
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,980
just one other way to think about

937
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,500
these types of attractor systems

938
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,460
rather than as like traces or so on

939
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,560
okay anything to add

940
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,240
well I think section two basically

941
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,619
confirms that if you're going to be

942
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:40,460
doing any kind of predictive performance

943
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,920
that has a an element of continuity to

944
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,240
it that depends on on sort of

945
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,339
recognizable finite limits and also

946
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:52,800
variability within whatever those limits

947
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,180
are

948
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,520
and I think that um

949
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,380
kind of speaks to the idea that there's

950
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,160
in a in a sort of a two-factor situation

951
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,800
there's signaling that looks like this

952
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,720
and they sort of pointed out a couple of

953
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,640
examples of the barrel reflex and the

954
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,300
and the glucagon thing and

955
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,480
they also were trying to avoid

956
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,800
oversimplifying or over reducing like

957
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,079
they they tried to keep

958
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:21,859
the complexity of those two examples

959
00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:24,000
retained in terms of what they were

960
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,579
trying to hold up is is something that

961
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:28,079
allows us to start looking at these

962
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,920
capacity curves

963
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:35,040
all right section three control theory

964
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,220
the unifying lens for physiology motor

965
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,200
control and decision making

966
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,540
and then one of their summaries of the

967
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,460
chapter this section

968
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,740
introduces Concepts from engineering

969
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,380
control theory then reviews its

970
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,839
applications in the Life Sciences these

971
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,780
include physiology section 3.1 skeletal

972
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,119
motor movement section 3.2 and decision

973
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,119
making section 3.3 section 3.4 will

974
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:02,579
connect future interceptive states to

975
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:04,380
present movements Illuminating what

976
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,900
makes allostatic regulation more energy

977
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,720
efficient than homeostatic regulation

978
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,300
the next section 4 will build off the

979
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,700
account of control used in physiology to

980
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,800
suggest how interception supports

981
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,839
allostasis

982
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,119
okay here we're not going to read

983
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,460
everything on the slide but this is from

984
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,320
section 3.1 control theory for

985
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,020
physiology a reliable a reliable body

986
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,599
built from unreliable Parts anything to

987
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:31,859
add on this

988
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:33,359
nope

989
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,820
people just want to read this yep I'll

990
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,380
just call out for a controller to

991
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,359
perform well it must contain some sort

992
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,099
of copy or mirror of the plant's

993
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,140
expected Behavior which is referred to

994
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,820
as an internal model

995
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,980
control theorists called assist the

996
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,500
driven system to plant and its desired

997
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,320
trajectory the reference trajectory

998
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,960
and there's some interesting discussion

999
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,119
of this kind of um

1000
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,760
thread of control theory

1001
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,740
figure four

1002
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,599
so figure four is a functional block

1003
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,880
diagram of model based control system

1004
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,339
the plant in Orange is the object or

1005
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,079
system whose motion or other behavior is

1006
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,099
controlled

1007
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:13,380
the controller purple sends signals

1008
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,200
controls solid block arrows

1009
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,000
the change how the plant moves and

1010
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,980
signals the expected outcome predictions

1011
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,020
solid yellow arrow to the state

1012
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:25,200
estimator in yellow and so on people can

1013
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,960
read the rest of it

1014
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,000
for these figures Daniel as we get

1015
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,280
further down in the slides why don't I

1016
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,140
read and then you can run the cursor

1017
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,540
over the different parts of the model so

1018
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,880
people can kind of see and can real time

1019
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,980
with how the two things align sounds

1020
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,420
good we'll do that for the future ones

1021
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,460
and this is gonna

1022
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:47,119
revoke or uh recall

1023
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,020
that of our earlier discussions in live

1024
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,960
stream 23 skillful performance and

1025
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,540
interactionism and instructionism and

1026
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,400
how to think about motor plants and so

1027
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,160
on right

1028
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,319
section 3.2 moving the body the

1029
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,140
reference control hypothesis so the

1030
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,060
reference control hypothesis the

1031
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,300
citations provided were to Feldman 2015

1032
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,520
and latash 2021

1033
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,680
and the reference control hypothesis

1034
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,720
describes the skeletal motor system in

1035
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,540
terms of a hierarchy of controllers with

1036
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,400
higher level controllers in the brain

1037
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,740
prescribing reference trajectories to

1038
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:28,079
the lower level reflexes in the spinal

1039
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,900
cord these reflexes then compare the

1040
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,760
actual length of the muscle as signaled

1041
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,280
by afferent proprioceptor neurons to the

1042
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,079
reference length sent down by the brain

1043
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:39,060
and contracts the muscle to bring the

1044
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:42,119
two into agreement and so here is the

1045
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,339
top part of the table of content of

1046
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:46,859
Feldman's 2015 book referent control of

1047
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:50,220
action and perception and the paper of

1048
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,099
latash in physics of Life review 2021

1049
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:57,180
with some graphics around this type of

1050
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,760
approach

1051
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,720
foreign

1052
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,119
you can start with this slide on the

1053
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:08,420
real world

1054
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:13,079
okay well I'll just point out a couple

1055
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:14,579
things the authors say because they they

1056
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:17,520
do not want to be accused of sort of

1057
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,900
overfitting here

1058
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,520
start your motor control experiment is

1059
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,079
only limited overlap with the actual

1060
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,780
structure of motor control so

1061
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:28,140
only limited overlap experiment on

1062
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,760
reaching behaviors involves an

1063
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,380
experimenter prescribing the reaching

1064
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,540
task to the participants participants

1065
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,520
brain does not function specifically to

1066
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,280
follow instructions from an experimenter

1067
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,560
but rather to regulate their own body

1068
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,200
the actual organization of the central

1069
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,760
nervous system occurs better with an

1070
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,980
inside out view of motor function

1071
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:51,140
movement of the body I.E the somatous

1072
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:54,839
somatomotor pathways surge regulation of

1073
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:57,119
the Body for example in the game with Dr

1074
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,119
value if you unexpectedly step on a hard

1075
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:02,579
or sharp block or object you usually

1076
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:05,579
don't purposely impale yourself who have

1077
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:06,900
stepped on it so I just wanted to go

1078
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,520
through my foot now

1079
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,740
because I might my focus is still on

1080
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,020
stabilizing my posture gravity with coil

1081
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:16,380
and pain you feel that interceptively

1082
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,420
and the unplanned disturbance of any

1083
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,119
tissue damage requires you to make a

1084
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,980
decision about what to do next excuse

1085
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,440
yourself to nurse your foot or play

1086
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,060
through that pain

1087
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,460
I think the fact that they're trying to

1088
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,240
limit what they are saying is the extent

1089
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,420
to which the goal piece of this

1090
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:40,500
can be said to apply as a good thing

1091
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,819
because I think there's a couple of

1092
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:43,140
areas

1093
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,400
around

1094
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,980
so what is in this relationship between

1095
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:50,339
a command system or a control system and

1096
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:53,339
a demand system where do things like

1097
00:45:53,339 --> 00:45:56,940
like when your body is

1098
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,460
started to suffer from mild hypothermia

1099
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,280
and and you know people know that that

1100
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,300
your brain stops functioning correctly

1101
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,359
um how do you differentiate between for

1102
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:10,440
example

1103
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,420
um I'm getting a Slurpee headache and

1104
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,920
you put the Slurpee down and stop

1105
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,900
drinking it because you know that that's

1106
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:19,980
the effect versus you have your limbs

1107
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,619
which aren't you know frostbitten at

1108
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:24,180
this point or at least hopefully not for

1109
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:28,140
us button continue to move so that you

1110
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:31,680
don't stop you you you avoid stopping

1111
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,660
moving all together which is which

1112
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:37,680
essentially is death so here we've got a

1113
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,020
wonder whether or not

1114
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,880
um without getting into the argument of

1115
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,319
because it's pretty obvious if your

1116
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:45,480
brain is dead you're dead but if your

1117
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,160
hands are dead or and you are still

1118
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,560
alive that clear distinction between a

1119
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,780
command center consequence and a demand

1120
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,359
Center consequence what does that mean

1121
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:57,060
in terms of okay so there's things that

1122
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,460
happen that you do automatically in

1123
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,440
order to keep yourself alive in some of

1124
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,440
the most critical situations and it's

1125
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,339
not like yours your your

1126
00:47:07,339 --> 00:47:11,579
your hand has the brain and yet it may

1127
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:14,400
in just simply moving around Beyond a

1128
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,740
reflexive thing be able to keep you

1129
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,359
alive long enough until somebody comes

1130
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:21,420
to your rescue as a as a for example

1131
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,160
so I don't know if that's confusing or

1132
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,540
not but I think that there's a

1133
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:27,359
reconciliation but that goes on between

1134
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,700
command and demand and maybe some of

1135
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,599
control is the ability to give up

1136
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:36,240
commanded times in order for a new

1137
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,599
a new response to take over and keep you

1138
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,140
alive and you may not necessarily

1139
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,359
um know how to do that from a command

1140
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,460
center so we'll have to talk to the

1141
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,319
authors about that because these are

1142
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:51,420
questions that I have because I got a

1143
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,280
bit of a physiological background so I

1144
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,300
wonder about these extreme situations

1145
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,280
all right

1146
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,040
section 33 making decisions constructing

1147
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,800
future reference trajectories

1148
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,140
they use the word demands so

1149
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:09,960
we'll talk about it later yep more

1150
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,940
quotes from three three for those who

1151
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:14,040
want to screenshot

1152
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,380
talking about ergonicity which is also

1153
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,540
raised in the appendix B which we're not

1154
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,460
going to focus on

1155
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,160
okay you can read figure five and I'll

1156
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,040
use the mouse uh so a functional block

1157
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,040
diagram for an experiment experimental

1158

1159
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,500
control the diagram shows a formal logic

1160
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,760
structure here

1161
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,220
at a conceptual level the boxes and

1162
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:40,440
arrows do not map onto the anatomy of

1163
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,119
the brain or nervous system in contrast

1164
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,240
to figure four the diagram

1165
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,619
differentiates between skeletal motor

1166
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:47,940
brain

1167
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,940

1168
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:54,540

1169
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:57,480

1170
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,900
organs sensory surfaces sensory surfaces

1171
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,540
the diagram shows an engineering

1172
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,099
perspective

1173
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:08,040
important to note that on a psychology

1174
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,619
experiment in which the experimenter

1175
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:12,780
prescribes a task for Behavior to

1176
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,839
participants so there's an externality

1177
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:18,180
and a participant's brain then acts as a

1178
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,220
control system to achieve the behavior

1179
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,900
the prescribed Behavior

1180
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,000
systems that maintain the body therefore

1181
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,359
serve systems that move the body

1182
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,180
which in turn serve a prescribed

1183
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,760
Behavior so again focus on the

1184
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,980
prescriptive the externality the

1185
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:38,000
information coming in

1186
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:40,980
all right

1187
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,380
function of laptop yeah next one

1188
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,720
functional block diagram for a control

1189
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,480
theoretic view of allostasis in contrast

1190
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,760
to figure five this diagram shows a

1191
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,460
closed loop control system designed for

1192
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:56,160
autonomous regulation of the body and

1193
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,560
experimenter's desired task behaviors

1194
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,920
replaced with or by sorry the allostatic

1195
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,839
capacity estimator

1196
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,180
which sends predictions of capacity

1197
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:09,060
curves which we've already looked at to

1198
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,160
the interior receptive State estimator

1199
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,800
and receives prediction errors with

1200
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,720
which to update its estimates

1201
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,079
the updated estimates are issued as a

1202
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:21,540
reference signal to the visitor motor

1203
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,819
controller this diagram shows a formal

1204
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:28,020
logical structure a conceptual level the

1205
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,180
hypothesis depicted is constrained by

1206
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:33,420
the inferred anatomical structures in

1207
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:36,839
Bear 2017 but the boxes and arrows do

1208
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:38,040
not map

1209
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,099
a repeat do not map one to one onto the

1210
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:43,680
anatomy of the brain or nervous system

1211
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,220
all right

1212
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,420
great

1213
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,119
so just to highlight the difference here

1214
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,400
the left is almost like an

1215
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,119
instructionalist

1216
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,619
Arrangements and this is how the

1217
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:00,900
experimental psychologist thinks about

1218
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,900
this task which is like we write down

1219
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,000
the instructions the pseudocode for the

1220
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,460
task keep your heart rate within this

1221
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,599
range

1222
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,940
and then there's some decision making

1223
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,940
with the Skeletor motor system whether

1224
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,760
capable of conscious action

1225
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,559
and stretching

1226
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:23,520
or more uh subconscious

1227
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,119
and then acting through physiology in

1228
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,740
the body or in the external world that

1229
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,480
interceptive state estimator comes into

1230
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,760
alignment with the desired

1231
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,040
implementation of the skeletal motor

1232
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,240
decision

1233
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,220
in contrast the role of the task

1234
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:44,760
instructions so to speak is substituted

1235
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,700
in this control theoretic View

1236
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,460
with the allostatic capacity estimator

1237
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,760
as the imperative and that feeds on

1238
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,119
through a very similar set on the right

1239
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,700
side but here we actually have the

1240
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,339
viscera motor decision controller

1241
00:52:02,339 --> 00:52:05,579
in uh in contrast to a scalar motor

1242
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:07,380
decision controller because this is more

1243
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:09,839
focused on like

1244
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,280
choose the left button or the right

1245
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,400
button and figure six is focused more on

1246
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,859
the kind of barrel reflex

1247
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:19,740
control theory view but that also

1248
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,700
generalizes Beyond

1249
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:24,839
okay I think that's just another view

1250
00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:28,260
section four allostasis as trajectory

1251
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:32,480
tracking stochastic optimal control

1252
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,920
this section will describe our formal

1253
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,960
model of allostatic decision making the

1254
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,960
allostatic path integral control apic

1255
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,760
model

1256
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,880
apic has a simple idea at its core just

1257
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,920
as perceptual Concepts serve as internal

1258
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,500
models of the body's sensory surfaces

1259
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,380
action Concepts also serve as internal

1260
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,720
models of potential behaviors and their

1261
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,760
predicted outcomes

1262
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:01,020
section 4.1 drives an SOC

1263
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,240
objective function from the mathematical

1264
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,859
form by which section 2 represented

1265
00:53:04,859 --> 00:53:06,300
capacity curves

1266
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:10,140
then section 4.2 4.3 and 4.4 are

1267
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:12,180
described flushing out this apic model

1268
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:14,460
anything to add

1269
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,680
no let's go there all right 4.1

1270
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,839
transforming capacity curves into

1271
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:21,300
objective functions

1272
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,460
since any given capacity curve such as

1273
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,680
the 1 and figure 1 above

1274
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,260
which is a maximum value on the vertical

1275
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:31,500
axis it can be divided by its maximum y

1276
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,800
value to normalize it to range between 0

1277
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,619
and 1. once normalized in this way it

1278
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:39,240
can be interpreted as a cumulative

1279
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,040
distribution function from probability

1280
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,180
Theory

1281
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,119
this is precisely in fact precisely what

1282
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,540
srinivasan Laughlin and dubs

1283
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:51,119
did to interpret the firing of retinal

1284
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:52,619
neurons and flies as a form of

1285
00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:55,680
predictive coding see there figure one

1286
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,680
the derivative of a CDF cumulative

1287
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,780
distribution function yields a

1288
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:04,020
probability density function PDF

1289
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:09,740
so the derivative of a CDF gives a PDF

1290
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:11,579
this is the more familiar way of

1291
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:13,200
representing a probability distribution

1292
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,359
where the height on the vertical axis

1293
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:18,240
corresponds to likelihood in the PDF

1294
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,400
but for a PDF derived from a capacity

1295
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,839
curve it represents relative

1296
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:24,359
responsiveness to perturbation we will

1297
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:26,339
call such distribution a reference

1298
00:54:26,339 --> 00:54:27,359
distribution

1299
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,180
so this is a transformation of

1300
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:32,760
statistical distributions between the

1301
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,520
PDF which is the probability density

1302
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,339
function and CDF cumulative distribution

1303
00:54:38,339 --> 00:54:39,359
function

1304
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,280
it might be very familiar to some it

1305
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,680
might be totally new to some so that's

1306
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,859
all good hopefully this is useful still

1307
00:54:46,859 --> 00:54:49,380
to consider the relationship between the

1308
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:50,099
two

1309
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:52,440
so here on the left of these three

1310
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:55,440
images the PDF which is the more

1311
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,000
familiar way of representing a

1312
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,980
probability distribution we would say

1313
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:01,859
this is a uniform distribution there's a

1314
00:55:01,859 --> 00:55:03,540
one in six chance of getting each

1315
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,940
outcome from a six-sided die

1316
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:08,760
or in about gaussian bell curve

1317
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,819
situation which both of these two middle

1318
00:55:11,819 --> 00:55:13,559
and right images show

1319
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:15,660
the PDF of the bell curve is the bell

1320
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,640
curve so the PDF is the most familiar

1321
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,859
one the uniform distribution is like a

1322
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:22,260
flat line in the PDF the bell curve is

1323
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,599
like a bell curve in the PDF

1324
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:26,940
but since you know the maximum and

1325
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,559
minimum values

1326
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,720
if only asymptotically

1327
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,700
then you can make a cumulative

1328
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,559
distribution function which starts

1329
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:37,920
basically as low as the function can go

1330
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,339
the support for that distribution and it

1331
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:44,160
just accumulates cumulatively

1332
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,440
so it's like useful to answer the

1333
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,300
question what is the probability of

1334
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:51,619
getting a four or three or two or one

1335
00:55:51,619 --> 00:55:55,380
that is two-thirds or what is the

1336
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:58,020
probability of getting a z-score of

1337
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,960
below two like two standard deviations

1338
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,859
positive what fraction of the curve is

1339
00:56:04,859 --> 00:56:08,099
below that z-score on the PDF and that

1340
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:10,140
is addressable by quickly just looking

1341
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,780
up a point on this CDF

1342
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,880
it turns out that that relationship

1343
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,680
between the PDF and the CDF which is

1344
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,660
more familiar to again like rolling a

1345
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:21,420
die or evaluating like height in a

1346
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,500
classroom

1347
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,480
can be used

1348
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,540
on the capacity curve discussed earlier

1349
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:30,359
to move to a distribution which when

1350
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:33,540
maximized is in this

1351
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:37,099
spot of Maximum control

1352
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:41,760
so here the CDF from figure 2

1353
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,819
gets the derivative and then it becomes

1354
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:46,319
the PDF

1355
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,500
with uh this sort of negative

1356
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:53,819
curve shape and that's kind of what was

1357
00:56:53,819 --> 00:56:55,319
being hinted at with this Orange Line

1358
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:57,420
being maximized Orange Line being

1359
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:58,680
maximized

1360
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:02,099
is the high point on this

1361
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:04,559
bell curve like but it's not a classical

1362
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:08,940
velcro but it is a mountain it's one

1363
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:11,040
Peak that you can know which side you're

1364
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,740
on and therefore pretty easily optimized

1365
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,098
towards

1366
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,040
um

1367
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:20,940
for analytical convenience we take the

1368
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,640
practice from tedorov 2006 of using a

1369
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,220
log density the logarithm of a PDF as an

1370
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:27,780
objective function rather than the PDF

1371
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:28,920
itself

1372
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,900
the operating point then continues to

1373
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,640
appear as local maximum while the gain

1374
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,140
determines the cost of movement away

1375
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,760
from the operating point and the value

1376
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,280
of movement towards it figure 8 shows

1377
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,780
the objective function log density

1378
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,460
corresponding to the original Barrel

1379
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,680
reflex capacity curve

1380
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,480
figure 9 further clarifies the

1381
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,040
relationship between the various forms

1382
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,720
of capacity curve by showing all three

1383
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,400
alongside each other so this is a really

1384
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,700
nice figure on the top left of the

1385
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,760
figure is the figure one with the reflex

1386
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,460
that gets dialed up or dialed down to

1387
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:02,099
regulate blood pressure

1388
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:05,880
that's when interpreted as a CDF

1389
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,220
can result in a PDF

1390
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:11,760
and that is a single Peak that you can

1391
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,020
maximize

1392
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,520
instead of trying to calculate a

1393
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,500
residual

1394
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:19,079
the shape of this curve becomes slightly

1395
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:22,140
nicer to optimize computationally

1396
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:24,359
when you make it so that it's like a

1397
00:58:24,359 --> 00:58:25,800
smoother Bowl

1398
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,619
rather than this kind of like inverted

1399
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:30,359
funnel shape

1400
00:58:30,359 --> 00:58:31,800
it just

1401
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,960
we can go into more detail why I think

1402
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,180
that'll be cool why does this log step

1403
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,819
matter or does it matter but suffice to

1404
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:40,980
say that this is the big move that lets

1405
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:43,200
you turn the sigmoid

1406
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,260
juggling act into

1407
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:49,640
the mountain climb

1408
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:54,980
table one summarizes some key

1409
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,880
table one summarizes some key notations

1410
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,440
we do not claim our graphical model

1411
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,059
accurately captures the anatomy of the

1412
00:59:03,059 --> 00:59:04,680
brain it captures reference based

1413
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,599
sensory motor control across a hierarchy

1414
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:08,339
of time scales a single feature shared

1415
00:59:08,339 --> 00:59:10,280
with a brain

1416
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,880
variables

1417
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,579
in a table

1418
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:17,339
equations five and six about the

1419
00:59:17,339 --> 00:59:19,440
instantaneous capture rate

1420
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:23,700
we'll discuss it in the dot 1.2

1421
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,940
section 4.2 also will be nice to discuss

1422
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:29,700
it is optimal foraging Theory suggests a

1423
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,400
functional form for allostatic control

1424
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,200
do you want to add anything up front

1425
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,460
about optimal foraging

1426
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:40,559
no other than I want to I want to talk

1427
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:42,180
with the authors about what does that

1428
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:44,660
even mean

1429
00:59:46,339 --> 00:59:49,500
that'll be great all right equation

1430
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,460

section 4.3 feedback or feed forward

1433
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:58,440
control with generative action Concepts

1434
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,559
so here's some more formalisms and this

1435
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:03,599
is within not the experimental

1436
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:06,000
psychologist framework

1437
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,040
but rather the control theoretic

1438
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,960
framework with the allostatic capacity

1439
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,780
estimator on the left

1440
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:15,540
section 4.3

1441
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:18,599
equation 10 equation 11.

1442
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:21,619
more variables

1443
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:24,900
stochastic optimal control SOC which was

1444
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,460
mentioned earlier

1445
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:29,420
equation 12.

1446
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,720
figure 10. this one will be nice to

1447
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,359
discuss a hierarchical generative model

1448
01:00:36,359 --> 01:00:38,220
capturing multiple time scales and

1449
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:40,559
reference distributions at each level

1450
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,240
without addressing empirical questions

1451
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,579
about neural hierarchies here we employ

1452
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:46,740
a model with L equal four models to

1453
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:49,520
match figure six

1454
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,640
it defines what some of these nodes mean

1455
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:58,200
but the y-axis is increasing time scale

1456
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:02,220
so perhaps slower things higher up and

1457
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:05,520
then on the right is the passage of time

1458
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,020
so what does this make you think about

1459
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:08,640
or what is like a way we can approach

1460
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,520
the interpretation of this

1461
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,260
well I'm not trying to be a smart Apple

1462
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:15,960
but I do find it interesting that L4

1463
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:18,000
gives it gives you quite a bit of

1464
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,579
information that that I mean there's

1465
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:23,099
maybe and they they talk about the fact

1466
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:24,720
that there's more than four levels but

1467
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,760
they want to focus on those for me I

1468
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,619
mean where my brain goes is Okay so

1469
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:30,180
we've got the water we've got the yeast

1470
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:32,579
we got the Hops we got the grains and

1471
01:01:32,579 --> 01:01:34,859
that can create quite the

1472
01:01:34,859 --> 01:01:38,160
quite the product so you you can go past

1473
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,020
that you can add juice or whatever but

1474
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:42,119
you got the four basic ingredients so

1475
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:46,079
now moving through time what does that

1476
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:49,140
enable so again it'd be nice for them to

1477
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:52,020
pull that pull that apart because I

1478
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:55,680
think even in this there's enough there

1479
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,299
to

1480
01:01:57,299 --> 01:01:59,660
figure a lot of stuff out

1481
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:03,119
right 4.4 feedback control with

1482
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,700
generative action Concepts still there

1483
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:11,339
is equation 13 equation 14. and then a

1484
01:02:11,339 --> 01:02:12,839
nice quote readers familiar with

1485
01:02:12,839 --> 01:02:14,339
predictive processing

1486
01:02:14,339 --> 01:02:17,040
and active inference will recognize the

1487
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:20,040
form of the above equation 14.

1488
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,140
as a negative free energy or variational

1489
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:24,960
lower Bound for discussion see some

1490
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,960
citations since objectives can typically

1491
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,579
be written out and interpreted in

1492
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,579
several equivalent ways Each of which

1493
01:02:32,579 --> 01:02:35,280
can come with its own intuitions there

1494
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,960
are Arguments for the computational and

1495
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,119
thermodynamic efficiency of minimizing

1496
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:40,920
this specific Divergence in the course

1497
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,380
of neural processing but to date the

1498
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:44,880
available evidence does not rule out

1499
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,380
other more complex information

1500
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:48,480
divergences for penalizing feedback

1501
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,640
correction of movements

1502
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:54,359
so it's pretty interesting how different

1503
01:02:54,359 --> 01:02:56,579
lower bounds

1504
01:02:56,579 --> 01:02:58,500
variational lower bounds negative free

1505
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:02,040
energies exist like there's expected

1506
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,900
free energy and then there's free energy

1507
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,180
of the expected future and there's all

1508
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:09,240
of these variants and then each of those

1509
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,000
energies can be decomposed differently

1510
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,339
like equation 2.6 in the textbook

1511
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:20,460
so it's

1512
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:23,819
interesting to see how first off how did

1513
01:03:23,819 --> 01:03:27,780
they converge to this kind of abound

1514
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,099
and

1515
01:03:29,099 --> 01:03:31,980
from why should it have such resonance

1516
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,900
with free energy principle

1517
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,880
and what does that mean

1518
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,460
and then how can different partitionings

1519
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:40,799
of these energy bounds help us think

1520
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:45,020
about systems that survive

1521
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:48,000
I'll just add here Daniel that uh we're

1522
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,339
gonna get to these things but up into

1523
01:03:50,339 --> 01:03:52,260
this point in the paper I guess I had a

1524
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:54,000
bit of familiarity and I didn't really

1525
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,059
struggle with the sort of the lock step

1526
01:03:57,059 --> 01:03:59,520
way that they were going through this

1527
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,160
but as soon as we got to equations 13

1528
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:05,220
and the jump to equation 15 and 16.

1529
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,260
somebody somebody brighter than me is

1530
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,640
going to have to be able to explain that

1531
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,520
jump in real simple terms because even

1532
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,079
even though I've read it a number of

1533
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:15,660
times I'm still not exactly sure how it

1534
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:18,000
works so again the authors will really

1535
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,280
want to bring their their their their

1536
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,559
their softest gloves because I need my

1537
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:24,180
handheld

1538
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:27,960
yeah agreed

1539
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:34,680
section 4.4 still here's equation 15.

1540
01:04:35,819 --> 01:04:40,559
section 4.4 here's equation 16.

1541
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:42,960
substituting the augmented objective

1542
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,460
fancy

1543
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:45,780
J

1544
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,640
equation 14.

1545
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:50,280
and the analytical expression for the

1546
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,780
optimal feedback controller alone

1547
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:54,299
equation 15 into the Bellman equation

1548
01:04:54,299 --> 01:04:57,559
equation 12 would yield

1549
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:03,779
equation 16. let's learn what it is yep

1550
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:06,780
now the intractable recursive term in

1551
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:09,000
the equation is

1552
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:09,740
Etc

1553
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:12,299
finding a way to replace this term will

1554
01:05:12,299 --> 01:05:14,220
yield more computationally tractable

1555
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:15,839
problem

1556
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:18,180
the information Divergence term in fancy

1557
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,339
J provides just such a way since it can

1558
01:05:20,339 --> 01:05:22,020
be written as precisely

1559
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:23,760
the difference between the intractable

1560
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,180
hard maximum under Q star star sub Phi

1561
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:29,460
and the more tractable smooth maximum

1562
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,859
under the pre-planned action Concept in

1563
01:05:31,859 --> 01:05:35,760
symbols equation 17. pretty interesting

1564
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,280
okay

1565
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:43,460
um s equation 17 through 21

1566
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:49,559
then the final section section five

1567
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:51,740
discussion

1568
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:56,400
maybe you can help me today so we're 13

1569
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:01,740
through 17 and and then 18 19 and 20 a

1570
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:04,859
way of being able to put together

1571
01:06:04,859 --> 01:06:07,160
some of the scale free

1572
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:10,440
formalisms with the scale specific or

1573
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:13,339
scale friendly

1574
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:16,020
um details in particulars when you read

1575
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:21,119
this is that what you saw them trying to

1576
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:23,900
clarify

1577
01:06:25,559 --> 01:06:27,000
that's great

1578
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,380
question

1579
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:31,140
and so you talk about global

1580
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:32,760
and I think they have to be able to

1581
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:35,099
spell that out and I think yeah but

1582
01:06:35,099 --> 01:06:36,480
again I'm I'm

1583
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,240
it was all of a sudden things went off

1584
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,940
into the ditch for me

1585
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:44,339
here's what I would

1586
01:06:44,339 --> 01:06:46,880
um venture

1587
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:50,220
in the early section

1588
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:52,980
there's a contrasting of

1589
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:55,319
homeostasis with allostasis

1590
01:06:55,319 --> 01:06:58,500
and about how reward systems are no

1591
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,240
longer required under certain

1592
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:03,720
distributed models of brain neuroanatomy

1593
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,339
and a function

1594
01:07:05,339 --> 01:07:07,500
so I believe that the following

1595
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:10,500
formalisms substitute the augmented

1596
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,180
objective

1597
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:13,740
into

1598
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:16,799
in optimality and optimization framework

1599
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,740
like the Bellman equation which is often

1600
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:22,619
used for reward maximization so I'm

1601
01:07:22,619 --> 01:07:24,420
rewarded by getting to the top of the

1602
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:25,200
mountain

1603
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,619
so I'm going to evaluate paths based

1604
01:07:28,619 --> 01:07:31,440
upon how much reward they accrue okay

1605
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,740
and then curiosity or so on will be

1606
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:36,599
valuable to the extent over the time

1607
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:38,520
Horizon that I considered

1608
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:41,520
it facilitates reward in terms of

1609
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,780
elevation

1610
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:46,440
whereas we here are seeing the move

1611
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,000
towards that like Optimal

1612
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,780
maneuverability maximization

1613
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:54,839
with the pdfcdf relationship

1614
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:56,160
like instead of trying to reduce

1615
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:59,400
Divergence to the midpoint of the CDF

1616
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,940
right you maximize your responsiveness

1617
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:06,599
in terms of maximizing the log PDF okay

1618
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:09,180
so I think that's the augmented

1619
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:11,400
um reward function

1620
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,559
which is tractable

1621
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:17,839
and then some work remains to

1622
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:21,179
specify that function and how it behaves

1623
01:08:21,179 --> 01:08:23,819
perhaps

1624
01:08:23,819 --> 01:08:26,359
okay

1625
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:29,339
then section five discussion

1626
01:08:29,339 --> 01:08:31,198
interception stabilizes action and

1627
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:34,879
constructs allostatic references

1628
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,259
people can look at the quotes anything

1629
01:08:37,259 --> 01:08:39,238
to summarize here

1630
01:08:39,238 --> 01:08:42,540
no all right 5.1 viewing the brain as an

1631
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:45,779
allostatic optimal controller

1632
01:08:45,779 --> 01:08:48,000
the allostatic path integral control

1633
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,759
apic model in section 4 implies a number

1634
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:53,160
of specific hypotheses Beyond those

1635
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:56,759
generic to stochastic Optimum control

1636
01:08:56,759 --> 01:08:59,880
there's some discussion of shared

1637
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,560
modeling choices with active inference

1638
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,179
models

1639
01:09:03,179 --> 01:09:05,640
perhaps enough for apic to be considered

1640
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:09,299
an active inference model of sorts

1641
01:09:09,299 --> 01:09:11,939
and then a few other features that are

1642
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:14,460
shared with active inference models in

1643
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:17,339
strict sense if one even exists

1644
01:09:17,339 --> 01:09:19,799
and also related modeling efforts

1645
01:09:19,799 --> 01:09:22,380
anything to add

1646
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:24,960
no no they spell that up pretty clearly

1647
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,160
here you just want to read through this

1648
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:29,640
right the 5.1 provides some predictions

1649
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:34,699
and some contrasts with the apic model

1650
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:37,979
5.2

1651
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:39,600
the body and the Brain through the lens

1652
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,380
of control theory

1653
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:45,839
figure six show how visceral sense data

1654
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:48,060
Ascend in effect to become X afferent

1655
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:51,620
interceptive prediction errors

1656
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:55,320
do you want to explain briefly what an X

1657
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,880
affluent means

1658
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,400
because people might they do explain

1659
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:02,280
that in the glossary but it's it's

1660
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,080
basically an apparent signal on an

1661
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,160
operating signal there's a bit of

1662
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,120
recursion

1663
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:09,600
there you want to add anything to that

1664
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,380
um

1665
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:11,820
I

1666
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:13,800
see the distinction

1667
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:17,100
just to highlight what afferent is

1668
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:19,260
afferent is conducting or conducted

1669
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:22,020
inwards or towards something for the

1670
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:24,600
nerves the central nervous system for

1671
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,239
blood vessels the organ supplied right

1672
01:10:27,239 --> 01:10:29,219
and um

1673
01:10:29,219 --> 01:10:32,880
how would you distinguish exact efforts

1674
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,400
just it's just that it's that sort of

1675
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,900
cumulative

1676
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:39,179
it's not it's not sort of the the

1677
01:10:39,179 --> 01:10:42,140
initial

1678
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:45,179
is what I took away from that the

1679
01:10:45,179 --> 01:10:49,340
accumulation of those apparent signals

1680
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:51,840
interesting

1681
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,780
I think you're wrong that's what I took

1682
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:57,420
five three interception and capacity

1683
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,920
curves

1684
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:01,679
theories of peripheral predictive coding

1685
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:03,179
reason that a neuron's most

1686
01:11:03,179 --> 01:11:04,980
metabolically cheap responses should

1687
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:06,420
represent the predictable stimuli

1688
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:08,400
whereas expensive responses are reserved

1689
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,100
for the most surprising stimuli

1690
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,380
some predictions and suggestions from

1691
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:15,060
Barrett 2017

1692
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:18,659
and findings of dwark in 2013 certain

1693
01:11:18,659 --> 01:11:20,400
peripheral interceptors and humans

1694
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,739
reduce their operant firing rate to zero

1695
01:11:22,739 --> 01:11:24,840
under a constant stimulus

1696
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,540
so that's kind of interesting like if no

1697
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:28,679
change

1698
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:31,679
don't tell me about it and that should

1699
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:33,900
be cheap under a model where something

1700
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:38,659
is changing less often than not

1701
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:42,960
um and there's some more uh

1702
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,940
hypotheses we have hypothesized that

1703
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:46,620
increases in such responsiveness which

1704
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:49,380
is the imperative in this apic model

1705
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:52,020
could function as rewards positively

1706
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:53,520
reinforcing behavioral trajectories

1707
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,620
while decreases in responsiveness could

1708
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:58,440
function as costs negatively reinforcing

1709
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,239
behavioral trajectories

1710
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:03,120
so keeping options open over the

1711
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:06,000
infinite time Horizon becomes equivalent

1712
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,600
to keeping the business floating or

1713
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,940
keeping physiology bounded

1714
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:13,320
yeah

1715
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,360
foreign

1716
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:17,400
continuity instead of just maximizing

1717
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,520
amount of USD or calories

1718
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,860
right but rather having reduced or

1719
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:25,800
bounded surprisal about a range and a

1720
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,199
trajectory and a strategy

1721
01:12:28,199 --> 01:12:31,560
not in this model as stated here

1722
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,960
to generate that

1723
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,600
5.3 interception and capacity curves

1724
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,040
more

1725
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:42,120
5.4 conclusions finally we return to the

1726
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,260
amateur

1727
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:45,659
dodgeball player

1728
01:12:45,659 --> 01:12:50,000
the ant mature yeah and

1729
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:54,980
um some summarizations of the apic model

1730
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,480
and suggestions about its compatibility

1731
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:00,179
with a referent control hypothesis

1732
01:13:00,179 --> 01:13:03,980
and some of its tractability

1733
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,780
that's the discussion then appendix B

1734
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:08,520
air conditioning

1735
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,199
which we've talked about before but it's

1736
01:13:10,199 --> 01:13:12,300
kind of a cool topic so just to skip

1737
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:14,760
through these appendices just discussing

1738
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,699
them with the authors we hope then uh

1739
01:13:17,699 --> 01:13:21,120
some more equations in equation B

1740
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,940
formulating prescription and control

1741
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,780
aerodically leads to the free energy

1742
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:27,480
principle fep

1743
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:31,500
more of appendix B appendix C apic model

1744
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,540

1745
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:36,140

1748
01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:43,640
equations

1749
01:13:44,699 --> 01:13:46,800
the path integral form for the value

1750
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,260
desirability function gives its name to

1751
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:52,739
the technique of path integral control

1752
01:13:52,739 --> 01:13:56,219
and so on a kind of closing note

1753
01:13:56,219 --> 01:13:58,620
we wondered how this connects to the

1754
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:00,780
Bayesian mechanics

1755
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:03,900
and to the path formulation the

1756
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:06,060
rightmost of the three

1757
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:08,699
faces of Bayesian mechanics

1758
01:14:08,699 --> 01:14:11,699
and about how coming potentially from

1759
01:14:11,699 --> 01:14:14,159
quite a different starting point

1760
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:16,739
and with different

1761
01:14:16,739 --> 01:14:20,460
approaches and constraints

1762
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:24,920
some similar features

1763
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:28,020
might have Arisen and been highlighted

1764
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:29,699
in apic

1765
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:31,500
that are also highlighted and relevant

1766
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,120
for Bayesian mechanics in the path

1767
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,120
formalization and maybe there's like

1768
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:39,000
a kind of unmapped Venn diagram

1769
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,760
there and some similarities and

1770
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,179
differences

1771
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,500
proximity to the last live stream

1772
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:49,679
whether by accident or by intent

1773
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:51,540
makes the

1774
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:54,960
um the way that you look at this paper

1775
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,940
um

1776
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:59,159
interesting I'll just say

1777
01:14:59,159 --> 01:15:00,480
yeah

1778
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:03,360
agreed well

1779
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,340
anything you want to

1780
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:06,780
close with

1781
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:09,000
I think the idea of being able to look

1782
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,100
at a mod at modeling and internal

1783
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:13,739
modeling and sort of the coordination of

1784
01:15:13,739 --> 01:15:15,420
that either

1785
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:18,420
again kind of as a minimum two other as

1786
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:21,659
a risk management or risk minimizing

1787
01:15:21,659 --> 01:15:24,480
exercise therefore a limiting strategy

1788
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,120
or as an option generating or an

1789
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,340
expanding strategy would be something

1790
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:31,739
really interesting to talk to the

1791
01:15:31,739 --> 01:15:34,620
authors about because again I can't I

1792
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:36,960
can't really figure out whether or not

1793
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:40,380
the apic model Works in both domains

1794
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:43,500
until I get past the jump between

1795
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,480
formalism 13

1796
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:49,739
and all the way up to 17 18 19 to 20.

1797
01:15:49,739 --> 01:15:51,860
but I mean with an explanation of that

1798
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:56,040
and uh and a and a gentle prod it'd be

1799
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,080
interesting to find out how

1800
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:01,320
how that works when those things seem to

1801
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:05,820
be be it we as physiological

1802
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:08,520
entities are able to juggle both the

1803
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:12,000
risk management and the options option

1804
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,699
generator option expanding so I am

1805
01:16:14,699 --> 01:16:17,219
really actually quite excited about that

1806
01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:18,840
from a

1807
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,540
here's what I'm feeling how should I

1808
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:24,840
read that in terms of what I can how far

1809
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:28,679
out I can make my next bet

1810
01:16:28,679 --> 01:16:30,719
from an allostatic perspective I think

1811
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:31,739
that's

1812
01:16:31,739 --> 01:16:34,920
really exciting if you if like I said if

1813
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,120
I can get

1814
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:39,600
a better sense of how that jump Works in

1815
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:40,880
their model

1816
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,320
[Music]

1817
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:46,260
yeah definitely interested in that

1818
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:50,040
infinite time Horizon and that mentality

1819
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,480
of like

1820
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:54,420
what's the best physiological

1821
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:59,659
decision over the infinite Horizon

1822
01:16:59,719 --> 01:17:04,140
wait that's a great question and yeah

1823
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:06,060
the Eternal now

1824
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:07,500
the presence

1825
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:10,140
and then um also just a little bit more

1826
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:12,659
mundanely like what kind of data

1827
01:17:12,659 --> 01:17:15,360
are relevant for this type of model

1828
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:18,719
is it data that already exists for

1829
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,040
people

1830
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,560
is it something where you can

1831
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,780
extrapolate a lot from a sparse data set

1832
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:27,900
or do you need a bunch of replication to

1833
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:30,060
get good statistical confidence on the

1834
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:32,280
model parameter and extract findings

1835
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,620
that are like non-trivial

1836
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:35,699
um

1837
01:17:35,699 --> 01:17:38,219
and where's this

1838
01:17:38,219 --> 01:17:40,560
technology or approach being used or

1839
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,179
where could it be used there's like a

1840
01:17:42,179 --> 01:17:45,000
lot of things that'll be interesting to

1841
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,080
talk about

1842
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,280
well

1843
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,860
thank you for all the preparation and

1844
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:53,280
help on this one Dean and see you in the

1845
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,199
dot one and beyond all right my friend

1846
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:58,400
take care bye
