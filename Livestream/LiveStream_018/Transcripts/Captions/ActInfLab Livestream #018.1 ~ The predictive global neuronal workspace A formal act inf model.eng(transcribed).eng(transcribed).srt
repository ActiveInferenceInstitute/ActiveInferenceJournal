1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,040
hello and welcome

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,080
to the active inference lab this is the

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,920
active inference lab and the active

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,599
inference live stream

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,519
today we are in active inference live

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,039
stream 18.1

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,480
on march 23rd 2021

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,920
welcome to the active inference lab

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,480
everyone we're a participatory online

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:24,960
lab

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,720
that is communicating learning and

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,039
practicing applied active inference

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,760
you can find us at our links here this

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,000
is a recorded in an archived live stream

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,840
so please provide us with feedback so we

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,520
can improve our work

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,360
all backgrounds and perspectives are

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,960
welcome here and we'll be

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,840
using good video etiquette for live

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,320
streams

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,520
today we're in live stream 18.1 in our

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,280
first of two participatory group

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,000
discussions

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,520
on the predictive global neuronal

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,760
workspace paper and we're with the

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,879
authors here

27
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,960
ryan smith and christopher white so

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,320
thanks to both of you

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,000
for joining today today in 18.1

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,080
the goal is just going to be to discuss

31
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,080
and learn and ask some questions about

32
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,560
this awesome paper and we're going to go

33
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,400
through some introductions and warm-ups

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,040
and then

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,799
i believe christopher will have some

36
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,400
slides to share with us

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,960
and set some context and then we'll just

38
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,840
proceed with

39
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,360
probably a bunch of questions that we

40
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,520
all have about the paper as well as some

41
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,600
questions from the live chat

42
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,159
to get started though let's just go

43
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:26,880
around

44
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,520
and introduce ourselves and we can each

45
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,280
just give a short introduction or check

46
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,799
in and then pass it to somebody who

47
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,000
hasn't spoken

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,360
so i'm daniel i'm in california and i

49
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,640
will pass it first to dean

50
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,439
i'm dean i'm up here in calgary in

51
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,640
canada

52
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,320
and i'll pass to stephen

53
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,360
hello i'm stephen i'm up in toronto in

54
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,240
canada

55
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,079
and i'll pass it over to christopher

56
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,479
hi thanks i'm christopher white i'm a

57
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,680
phd student at

58
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,880
the university of cambridge and this is

59
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,240
this page just to give some brief

60
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,280
context this paper is really

61
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,000
a work that kind of came out of my

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,440
master's thesis that i was doing with

63
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,560
ryan but we've kind of continued on

64
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,319
um working on so hopefully we can chat

65
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,800
about both this paper and then at some

66
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,440
point

67
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,200
chat about some things that we've been

68
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,480
continuing on

69
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,399
and so i'll talk past to blue

70
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,800
hi i'm blue knight i am an independent

71
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,040
research consultant based out of new

72
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,840
mexico

73
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,560
and i will pass it to dave

74
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,959
dave douglas i'm in the mountains of the

75
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,720
northern philippines where it's

76
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,920
almost the end of spring um

77
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,840
i'm retired from i.t uh especially from

78
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,720
uh machine

79
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,000
translation working on the

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,160
semi-technical aspects of our education

81
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,560
project

82
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,080
and then i believe ryan um

83
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,640
yeah so i'm ryan smith um i'm an

84
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,760
investigator at the

85
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,640
laureate institute for brain research um

86
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,200
and i

87
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,360
yeah we're in tulsa oklahoma basically i

88
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,560
run a lab focused on

89
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,920
computational neuroscience and

90
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,319
computational psychiatry

91
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,159
well i'm sure we'll talk a lot more

92
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,080
about that let's uh

93
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,720
maybe just go right to christopher's

94
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,599
slides

95
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,920
and then we can pick up just with

96
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,680
conversation or with this

97
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,239
slide deck as needed but christopher go

98
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,360
ahead and share your

99
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,120
slides and i'll make them the full

100
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,879
screen yeah sure

101
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,760
okay

102
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,440
okay so i'm assuming you can see my um

103
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,400
screen are you saying we're seeing our

104
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,840
jitsi

105
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,959
uh okay how about now

106
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,120
yep looks good okay well i now i it

107
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,239
seems like i can't

108
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,000
both look at the even of the dual

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,080
monitor setup it doesn't seem like it

110
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,680
it wants to share the same screen that

111
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,360
jitsi is on and that's okay so it means

112
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,599
i just can't see anyone

113
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,439
um so just give me a shout

114
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,238
um so this this is these are slides that

115
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,079
uh from a talk i gave at ucl

116
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,239
about midway through last year um

117
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,479
and so i i may need some reminding of

118
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,720
bits of this paper because we did write

119
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,880
it quite a while ago although it did get

120
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,880
only just get published in december last

121
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,720
year

122
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,600
okay so the idea with this paper was

123
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,280
really just to

124
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,560
kind of formalize some things

125
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,280
that had been around in literature for a

126
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:45,840
while

127
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,560
and namely putting global workspace

128
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,120
theory

129
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,919
into kind of a predictive processing

130
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,479
framework

131
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,280
and so they've been so carfriston has a

132
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,199
really nice 2012 paper that kind of did

133
00:04:59,199 --> 00:04:59,520
this

134
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,800
somewhat formally uh jacob but it didn't

135
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,160
really connect that deeply with the

136
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,759
global workspace literature

137
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,440
um at all really um jacob had

138
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,639
in chapter 10 of his 2013 book yakupovi

139
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,120
sorry

140
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,479
um has a really wonderful chapter where

141
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,320
he discusses

142
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,080
the relationship between phenomenal

143
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,639
unity and global workspace theory and

144
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,039
how

145
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,199
active and how predictive kind of the

146
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,479
predictive processing framework in

147
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,639
general and active inference

148
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,560
kind of broadly conceived fit in with

149
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,320
global workspace theory and how these

150
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,919
ideas can kind of

151
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,919
take help make sense of some puzzles

152
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,840
within global workspace theory and also

153
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,639
kind of give

154
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,840
predictive processing a theory of

155
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,919
consciousness as it were

156
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,440
um and then in terms of

157
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,280
i published a brief paper kind of

158
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,360
building on jacob's work

159
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,479
where i kind of said hey he is that's

160
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,600
where the predictive global learner

161
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
workspace comes from

162
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,360
um or that term which is just a term

163
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,039
that i kind of want to introduce just to

164
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,039
denote basically kind of predictive

165
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,360
processing approaches to a global

166
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,960
workspace style architecture

167
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,680
and so when ryan and i started chatting

168
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,800
because of that paper

169
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,160
we really our goal was to put

170
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,560
some fairly vague idea conceptual ideas

171
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,160
into a more

172
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,759
computationally precise framework and

173
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,000
that's what we did here

174
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,960
um and so the idea was really just to

175
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,080
use an active a

176
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,960
fairly straightforward deep temporal uh

177
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,319
partially observable markov decision

178
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:32,960
process

179
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,120
solved via active inference and show how

180
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,520
by kind of tuning some of the parameters

181
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,360
you can get basically all of the global

182
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,960
work a very large perception of the

183
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,560
global workspace literature and all of

184
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,240
those empirical results

185
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,240
kind of just falling straight out um

186
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,560
of the model and what's i think really

187
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,280
important

188
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,000
to me to my background is in cognitive

189
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,520
science and philosophy

190
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,240
um and so i did my undergrad in

191
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,720
cognitive science and did my

192
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,479
masters in a computational cognitive

193
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,759
neuroscience lab

194
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,039
um and so although i work on

195
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,800
for a long time for a while i was really

196
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,000
interested in visual awareness and

197
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,039
visual consciousness

198
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,719
i was around a lot of experimentalists

199
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,360
and it's really important to me that all

200
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,280
of these ideas are testable and we

201
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,759
actually

202
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,960
specify testable predictions and so

203
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,080
really what we were doing

204
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,280
in this paper was trying as best we

205
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,080
could to one

206
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,800
reproduce a bunch of existing results

207
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,319
but also kind of extend the model and

208
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,599
show where it actually gave testable

209
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,360
predictions

210
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,639
um and some of those have actually been

211
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,960
confirmed um recently

212
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,960
which is kind of nice so

213
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,039
um i'll just kind of flip through some

214
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,160
things there are just a couple things i

215
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,960
want to highlight

216
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,879
and so the first thing is just to kind

217
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,080
of define terms

218
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,440
uh so we called it

219
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,520
um a active inference model of visual

220
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,120
consciousness and that was really just a

221
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,599
kind of

222
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,440
so conscious is the way i think about at

223
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440
least maybe this is some idiosyncratic

224
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,160
but

225
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,639
confidence to me is just a kind of a

226
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,479
catch-all term

227
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,680
um it isn't one thing there are lots of

228
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,000
sub

229
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,120
things within consciousness that i think

230
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,840
can come apart and so block kind of very

231
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,360
famously in 1995

232
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,280
proposed the term access consciousness

233
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,720
where this is just content

234
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,879
that can be reported from the first

235
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,400
person perspective and it is available

236
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,840
to kind of cognitive control processes

237
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,199
and working memory that's not a quote

238
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,479
from him that's going to be paraphrasing

239
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,080
but that's roughly speaking the idea

240
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,479
and so that allows room for there to be

241
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,599
other processes

242
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,120
or unconscious processes saying the

243
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,320
visual system of which you aren't aware

244
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,559
and that can nonetheless influence

245
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,320
behavior

246
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,760
and he then also proposes it says chief

247
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,120
in that paper his chief kind of worries

248
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,640
distinguish between access consciousness

249
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,000
and phenomenal consciousness where

250
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,760
phenomenal consciousness is kind of the

251
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,600
experiential aspect of this and he

252
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,399
thinks that they

253
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,279
so this is now and he thinks that they

254
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,320
can come apart and that's what's

255
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,360
controversial so

256
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,959
i i don't personally agree that they can

257
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,040
come apart but i i think it's a

258
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,640
it's a useful distinction nonetheless

259
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,560
and so i think in terms of thought

260
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,080
experiment i don't remember where

261
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,279
it might not be it might be in that

262
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,720
paper it might be elsewhere but he's

263
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,560
kind of talked about

264
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,480
the example at least to me was really

265
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,160
intuitive was if you imagine someone

266
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,279
with a jackhammer

267
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,560
or if you're doing if you're working at

268
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,399
a desk and

269
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,600
you can hear a jackhammer in the

270
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,839
background

271
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,399
you might

272
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,640
what at some point you'll become aware

273
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,720
of the jackhammer and

274
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,399
but it was kind of a part of your

275
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,080
experience all along you just weren't

276
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,040
aware of it

277
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,680
in a way um and to me that sounds rather

278
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,519
odd but that's kind of

279
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,360
but that's fine we can we can set that

280
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,360
aside we're just defining terms here

281
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,120
yeah i mean i mean obviously i agree i

282
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,480
mean i think there's lots of cases like

283
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,839
inattentional blindness and change

284
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,839
blindness and things like that where

285
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,279
where you might you might think you were

286
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,399
aware of something the whole time but

287
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,279
actually

288
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,839
work but anyway side thing yeah exactly

289
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,279
i think like there are people

290
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,880
i think i've forgotten who to coin this

291
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,079
term but it's like the refrigerator

292
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,200
light illusion

293
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,279
like you open the refrigerator and the

294
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,440
lights on do you think it was always on

295
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,800
yeah it's kind of a nice analogy

296
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,200
okay so just briefly about the global

297
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,000
workspace

298
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,959
so this idea kind of started in the late

299
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,440
80s with bernard bars and then

300
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,200
stan haan's group really just took it

301
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
and ran with it

302
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,800
and so the idea is roughly speaking

303
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,959
there's this prefrontal parietal network

304
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:29,760
that connects

305
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,160
in kind of motor processes attentional

306
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,800
processing

307
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,760
perceptual systems memory and all of

308
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,519
these systems are in some sense

309
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,760
competing

310
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,200
for access and they are otherwise

311
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,560
relatively kind of modular and

312
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,519
disconnected

313
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,920
but when they what is access to the

314
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,120
global workspace

315
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,320
or the content that kind of wins uh

316
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,839
gains access to global workspaces

317
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,760
broadcast throughout the system so it

318
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,600
enables kind of

319
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,480
otherwise isolate subsystems to share

320
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,000
information in a common format

321
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,240
and he's identified this with a

322
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,680
prefrontal

323
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,279
parietal and this like prima faces a bit

324
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:15,680
of

325
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,600
quite a bit of evidence for this so

326
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,279
across meta analysis in report paradigms

327
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,959
so actually people kind of like actually

328
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,800
report their experience in binocular

329
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,440
rivalry and phenomenal masking

330
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,160
um there is a network of fronto parietal

331
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,440
regions that is

332
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,720
active for uh

333
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,760
conscious but not unconscious you're cut

334
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,040
off we can't hear you

335
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,560
oh really i can actually still hear him

336
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,880
oh maybe it was just me then oh good

337
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,399
okay no worries thanks for pointing it

338
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,279
out though ryan

339
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,639
and uh yeah continue along girl yeah so

340
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,600
there's basically

341
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
the the long the short of it is a cross

342
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,959
meta analysis that actually does seem to

343
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:55,440
be quite

344
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,639
quite a bit of evidence for the view

345
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,680
that there's this frontal parietal

346
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,560
network

347
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,720
um and this story gets more complicated

348
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
when we get into no report paradigms

349
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,480
maybe we can chat about that at the end

350
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,240
or next session because that's kind of

351
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,600
the work that ryan and i are really kind

352
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,360
of concentrating on the moment um

353
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,920
okay i think we can so we'll i'll just

354
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,440
kind of talk briefly about

355
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,760
these two and then kind of move on to

356
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,920
the model

357
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,680
um so the idea so basically

358
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,440
in a cross event related to um potential

359
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,160
studies so this is a kind of contrast

360
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,920
marking study on the right on the left

361
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,839
and on the right there's an attentional

362
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,440
blink i think

363
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,079
goodness yes it is um basically what you

364
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,680
can see is that there's this red line on

365
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,480
the left

366
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,040
and there is this little p3 it's like

367
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,040
literally labeled with a p3b

368
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,839
here and there is this late kind of

369
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,760
seemingly non-linear all-or-nothing

370
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,440
event-related potential over fronto

371
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,839
central electrodes

372
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,360
um that seems to characterize reported

373
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,279
versus non-reported consciousness uh

374
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,880
content sorry uh reporter bull

375
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,560
rather not not um and one what this

376
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,680
actually this is actually

377
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,440
i should just flag for anyone who's kind

378
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,720
of actually in the neuroscience of

379
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,440
consciousness

380
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,760
who is watching this this is no longer

381
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,040
considered a

382
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,560
neural coral of consciousness and i

383
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,120
agree with that um

384
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,959
it seems to drive be driven by task

385
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,440
demands um but nonetheless it is

386
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,040
still a question why it is that when

387
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,839
something is conscious and task relevant

388
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,279
you get a p3b

389
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,839
and that's kind of what we tackle in the

390
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,839
paper

391
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,560
and so really all of the evidence for

392
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,920
the global work for global workspace

393
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,199
theory i think it can be

394
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,920
summed up quite nicely with this 2006

395
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,279
kind of taxonomy

396
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,440
and so the idea is is that you can

397
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,079
orthogonally manipulate

398
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,959
stimulus strength and attention so

399
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,480
similar strength you might just imagine

400
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,839
that either might be

401
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,160
like time of presentation so if you have

402
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,519
a classic kind of

403
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,519
masking experiment you'll have i don't

404
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,279
know it might be a gabor patch

405
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,199
then just after it there'll be some

406
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,639
static noise

407
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,839
and the static noise kind of masks

408
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,000
is the mask to the gabor patch and

409
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,440
depending on the type

410
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,560
kind of the distance between the mask

411
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,279
and the stimulus you can render

412
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,199
something

413
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,920
unreportable so and nonetheless it can

414
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,680
still in some circumstances influence

415
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,680
behavior

416
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,959
and so you can imagine that stimulus

417
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,880
strength might be something like

418
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,519
either you can you could get it might be

419
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,959
contrast it might be the distance

420
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,240
between the mask you could

421
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,800
do both it doesn't really matter for our

422
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,040
very coarse purposes here

423
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,279
um and then in terms of

424
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,279
you can also vary attention so either

425
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,959
have attention to the task or tension to

426
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:49,839
be distracted away

427
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,600
and the idea is that when there's a weak

428
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,519
stimul a bottom-up signal

429
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,519
and attention is absent you basically

430
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,680
just get very little activity it's

431
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,440
whatever activity there is it's confined

432
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,160
to very early striat cortex

433
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,680
when you have attention is present

434
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,279
but the signal is still weak you get

435
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,399
some priming

436
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,360
um but

437
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,560
it's still unavailable for reports and

438
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,240
so at that level starts to influence

439
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,000
behavior then at the kind of the

440
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,880
pre-conscious

441
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,120
level or what they call pre-conscious

442
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,040
borrowing a term from freud

443
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,320
um this is where this is this is

444
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,680
attention inattentional blindness

445
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,040
effectively so you have a very strong

446
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,639
stimulus the gorilla can be walking

447
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,079
across the room and wave at you it can

448
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,600
be in the dead middle of the fovea

449
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,440
and yet people still won't report it and

450
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,600
the idea is the id this is kind of

451
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,440
activity that's still very strong it's

452
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,720
within the visual system but it's kind

453
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,519
of gated

454
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,880
out of um awareness

455
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,320
via a lack of attention um

456
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,440
at least most of the time

457
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,839
and then when in this last quadrant here

458
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,040
when you're attending something

459
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,240
there's a strong signal you get this

460
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,120
widespread kind of bifurcation

461
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,240
in neural activity

462
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,959
that characterizes aware versus unaware

463
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,880
states

464
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,680
and so we kind of had or personally i

465
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,480
had a couple of

466
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,920
reasons i was there a couple of reasons

467
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,600
to be a bit suspicious about this and i

468
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,199
actually do think web workspace theory

469
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,320
has been updated

470
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,440
to kind of accommodate these but

471
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
nonetheless i'll go through them

472
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,160
um so basically unconscious information

473
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,639
can

474
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,480
still be decoded uh from frontal regions

475
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,600
so pfc activity is not synonymous with

476
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,120
consciousness so the idea is that you

477
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,600
could might have

478
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,040
the idea that there is just a global

479
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,440
workspace and you enter it

480
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,600
associate loosely associated pfc and

481
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,040
entering is sufficient for consciousness

482
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,199
this can't be right

483
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,279
um they have a solution to this they

484
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,839
then basically introduced a bayesian

485
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,320
model

486
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
of conscious report where consciousness

487
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,000
also requires a stimulus

488
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,440
representation to be separable from a

489
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,839
noise distribution i really like this

490
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,440
model

491
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,800
in the beginning of my master's thesis i

492
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,000
spent a lot of time kind of playing

493
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,920
around with the code it's really cool

494
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,079
but i it's it's it's an ideal bayesian

495
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:06,880
observer

496
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,640
um it doesn't really give any neural

497
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,799
predictions at all um

498
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,160
i don't know and that that's that's

499
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,839
that's fine limitations

500
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,880
it's an ideal bayesian observer um

501
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,640
that still would be nice if we had

502
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,319
something a little bit more

503
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,079
neurally detailed

504
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,240
a christopher could you actually just

505
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,960
unpack that slide 13 just what are the

506
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,400
discs representing and

507
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,840
how does this relate to bayesian

508
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,039
statistics oh yeah sure so basically

509
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,720
each of these axes is a source of

510
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,720
evidence so evidence for

511
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,840
stimulus y evidence for stimulus x and

512
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,919
then

513
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,280
um basically these two

514
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,480
colored lines the pink colored line or

515
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:50,799
the

516
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,480
green colored line correspond to

517
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,240
different decision criteria that you are

518
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,880
imposing on a space

519
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,919
so the idea is is that alternative to

520
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,440
alternative first choice tasks where

521
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,559
you're forced to choose between two

522
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,360
things

523
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,400
or versus report something as

524
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,480
present or absent actually employ

525
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,640
different decision criteria

526
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,440
and so you can imagine these as a

527
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,280
essentially a multivariate each of these

528
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,200
as a gaussian distribution each of these

529
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,720
circles as kind of

530
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,720
a univariate gaussian distribution

531
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,840
where if you are in the blue you that's

532
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,320
kind of

533
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,120
stimulus to the left if you're all the

534
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,520
way

535
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,559
to the right or on x-axis that is

536
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,559
stimulus on the right um where

537
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,480
and then this green thing kind of close

538
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,919
to the around the origin

539
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,679
is a noise distribution so this is just

540
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,960
saying there's nothing there and

541
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,120
basically what conscious or awareness is

542
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,160
on this account

543
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,440
is basically these

544
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,640
um distributions or

545
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,440
either left or right being far enough

546
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,679
away from the origin that they don't

547
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,440
overlap substantially with the noise

548
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,120
distribution so when you impose the

549
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,360
decision criteria on the space

550
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,039
you are confident that you have seen

551
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,440
something

552
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,919
does that kind of make sense nice thank

553
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:10,880
you

554
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,200
cool okay um and then seeing this is

555
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,320
unseen ignore

556
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,880
ignores the noise distribution it's just

557
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,160
separates left versus right

558
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,720
so really cool model i really like it um

559
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,360
but yeah

560
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,280
unfortunately not quite as nearly

561
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,679
detailed as i would like

562
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,320
second problem is the p3b does not equal

563
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,720
awareness

564
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,080
so these are two paradigms so it's now

565
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,600
being replicated

566
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,559
in a no report condition basically a

567
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,120
person

568
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,559
is there's really sophisticated

569
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,480
experimental techniques

570
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,960
that allow you to basically access or

571
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,640
gain access to a person

572
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,880
make inferences about what a person saw

573
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,880
without having to make explicit reports

574
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,080
and when that happens

575
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,160
you see that basically the p3b which was

576
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,600
at one point taken to be a signature of

577
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,559
awareness

578
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,799
just vanishes and that's a bit of a

579
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,559
problem

580
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,679
so we'd like an explanation of that

581
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,600
and then the last one isn't really a

582
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,799
problem so much

583
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,080
as just a a point of absence so

584
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,240
there's a really large body of evidence

585
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,280
showing that

586
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,760
expectation seems to be a pretty crucial

587
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,200
factor in determining

588
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,559
the content the visual consciousness

589
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,039
so across paradigms continuous flash

590
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,640
depression binocular rivalry motion

591
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,120
induced blindness blah blah blah

592
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,960
or there's all these areas where to show

593
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,400
that expectations

594
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
probably along the lines of similar to

595
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,000
attention

596
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,200
should be a part of part of any taxonomy

597
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,679
or any

598
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,880
taxonomy that claims to kind of try to

599
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,280
be complete of the factors underlying

600
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,960
conscious access

601
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,799
and the global neural workspace as it

602
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,159
stands doesn't really describe how

603
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,440
expectations are implemented

604
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,360
and so our job or what we saw

605
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,320
ourselves as doing really in this paper

606
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,679
was just to kind of

607
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,080
show how we could account for this

608
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,039
existing work

609
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,400
namely the taxonomy

610
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,360
and also explain how the p3b doesn't

611
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,960
equal awareness

612
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,600
um or show hapso show how that

613
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,080
dissociation arises very naturally

614
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,120
and three show how expectations could be

615
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,799
plausibly be implemented and give kind

616
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,840
of a

617
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,919
more give a model that generates

618
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,919
predictions about expectations i should

619
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:34,880
say

620
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,320
and has a story about how they're

621
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,879
implemented

622
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,240
okay um and i think the the real thing

623
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,640
is it's it's okay to revise a model

624
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,080
like revising models is

625
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,840
that that's just good science um

626
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,960
and i think one of the part

627
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,240
of global workspace theory that made me

628
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,240
a little bit suspicious

629
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,120
lately is that the revisions of problem

630
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,000
one and two

631
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,840
they didn't generate surplus neural

632
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,440
predictions really

633
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,200
they were just kind of they abandoned

634
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,679
the p3b signature of conscious access

635
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,760
and they event and they endorsed an

636
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,039
ideal bayesian

637
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,520
observer model of subjective reports but

638
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,720
neither of those things

639
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,760
they were kind of responses

640
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,280
to problems that didn't themselves

641
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,400
generate new predictions that go on

642
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,039
um and that's kind of a characteristic

643
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,320
of what's been called degenerative

644
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,520
research programs by

645
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,000
lactose

646
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,400
and so i mean that we can argue about

647
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,120
whether this

648
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,120
is a fair characterization of global

649
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,400
workspace theory but i think this is

650
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
kind of at least a nice way of setting

651
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,520
up where we were coming from

652
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,840
okay um would you like to give a

653
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,919
a primer on active inference for partial

654
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,600
observable markov decision processes i'm

655
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,120
not sure how much more you want me to

656
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,400
talk or whatever

657
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,840
um i mean i this was an hour long this

658
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,200
is an hour i have an hour worth of

659
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,240
slides

660
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,640
um so i could talk forever but maybe you

661
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,000
want me to skip to the results or

662
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,640
just summarize the model or what let's

663
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,520
actually uh

664
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,679
hear your take here this is just a

665
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,440
really awesome presentation and then

666
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,039
everybody here maybe let's write down a

667
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,960
question or two so then we can have

668
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,640
another however many minutes you want of

669
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,880
the slides have about an hour or a

670
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,480
little more for questions and then we'll

671
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,840
have next week for questions but it's

672
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,280
really great to get this information out

673
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,480
there because the way you're sharing it

674
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,840
is awesome

675
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,159
yeah cool okay well i'll i'll try and be

676
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,520
a little bit more detailed when i go

677
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,480
through the slides because i've kind of

678
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,919
just been clicking through things at the

679
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,240
moment

680
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,720
okay

681
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,120
so what just a brief this is this is a

682
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,120
little bit of a point of confusion and

683
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,679
ryan may want to kind of come up

684
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,360
describe this as well so

685
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,520
what is active inference well it's both

686
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,960
a noun and a verb there's a noun that's

687
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,440
kind of

688
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,159
you can use it to describe two things uh

689
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:58,960
it's a

690
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,559
it's just a mathematical framework that

691
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,640
allows one to formulate models of kind

692
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:02,880
of

693
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,120
scented behavior using equations that

694
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,760
kind of justified a priori

695
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,600
from a very general set of assumptions

696
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,960
about the nature of self-organizing

697
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,480
systems

698
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,640
it's also that you can attach a process

699
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,320
theory to that mathematical framework

700
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,000
that allows you to give predictions

701
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,520
about various neurophysiological

702
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,240
variables like firing rate of neuronal

703
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,640
populations erps and kind of how

704
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,559
neuromodulators like dopamine or

705
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,200
noradrenaline

706
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,279
affect things like firing rate in the

707
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,480
rps

708
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,760
and also behavior um it's also used as a

709
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,240
verb

710
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,520
and especially in kind of maybe pre-2016

711
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,520
literature that's basically what it was

712
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,760
it was basically an extension of

713
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,120
predictive coding

714
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,320
to motor control and so people

715
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,640
often use active inference just as a

716
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,240
catch-all for basically the predicted

717
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,559
coding version of motor control

718
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,080
and there's been all sorts of confusion

719
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,000
in the literature where people are

720
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,880
taking

721
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,840
kind of active inference as a theory

722
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,679
basically of of markov decision

723
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,279
processes right and they're conflating

724
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,159
that

725
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,919
which and because markov decision

726
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,840
processes being a decision process is

727
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,559
kind of a model

728
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,640
of bayesian decision based optimal

729
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,080
decision making

730
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,159
and then if that's conflated with a

731
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,600
theory of motor control or you

732
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,960
use a motor control account of decision

733
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,320
making you're gonna get

734
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,200
say bizarre things um don't actually

735
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,600
track what's going on

736
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,279
yeah i mean i would that would that's

737
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,039
that's the main point if anything that i

738
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:31,679
would want to

739
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,600
you know kind of come you know fully

740
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
emphasize is that like

741
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,200
old active inference is a theory of

742
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,720
motor control i think they're old right

743
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,159
i mean people still do it

744
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,240
but yeah inference where that just means

745
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,720
you know like hold a prior constant and

746
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,000
make a reflex arc

747
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,480
move the body to you know minimize the

748
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,919
prediction error with respect to that

749
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,520
prior about say like

750
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,279
you know like proprioceptive position or

751
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,960
something like that right

752
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,919
that's just a theory about once you've

753
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,279
decided what to do

754
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,960
how to get the body to move accordingly

755
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,799
it doesn't have anything to do with

756
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,840
deciding what to do

757
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,279
right so another control thing is just

758
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:15,679
you know

759
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,200
how do i move how do i get the body to

760
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,880
move how i want to using

761
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,360
something predictive coding ish right

762
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,159
whereas you know

763
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,840
we're talking about kind of like current

764
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,400
is is again it's a it's a theory of

765
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,760
decision making

766
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,679
um which is like it's totally different

767
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,440
i really think these these these

768
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,960
there should be two different terms

769
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,600
right for these for these things yeah

770
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,719
that's the conflation

771
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,440
yeah exactly thanks and stephen do you

772
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,279
have a quick question

773
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,360
um yeah i'll just be curious like as

774
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,360
you're here you know you're doing work

775
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,000
in this

776
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,039
paper here with the neuronal context

777
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,559
of how deductive

778
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,559
choices are made and it taps to the

779
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,559
phenomenological

780
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,640
questions as well do you think that's

781
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,000
when these

782
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,080
you see these problems happen a lot

783
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,360
because when when

784
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,159
people are you're trying to move between

785
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,440
different aspects

786
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,400
of um fields of practice which are

787
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,919
sometimes thought about separately you

788
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:16,960
know phenomenology

789
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,360
phenomenology is often talked about in

790
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,440
the inactivist field and you've got the

791
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,440
neuroscience and they're often clean and

792
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,880
separate but

793
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,640
when you need to bring them together and

794
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,720
try and talk about this bigger picture

795
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,640
the distinction your the distinctions

796
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,919
you're making

797
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,000
become even more important if that makes

798
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,919
sense because

799
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,760
there seems to be a lot of conflation

800
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,120
that happens with that so i'll just be

801
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,520
interested in your thoughts

802
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,960
um so i think

803
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,000
one thing to say is so i i

804
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,720
like an activism um especially what's

805
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,320
kind of been called computational

806
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,159
activism i've forgotten there was a

807
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,080
really awesome paper out in synthesis

808
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,320
um i've forgotten the author name name

809
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,399
of the author but sorry about that

810
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,640
um but to me that stuff doesn't

811
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,480
really have that much to do with what i

812
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,159
would call

813
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,919
consciousness or what i think of as

814
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,000
consciousness as like a cognitive

815
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,760
scientist i suppose

816
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,399
um when i think of awareness i think of

817
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:16,880
a very

818
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,200
sharp my explanatory the thing that i'm

819
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,760
trying to explain is very specific

820
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,919
it is there are these states of which

821
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,520
you are unaware

822
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,520
some of which you can become aware of

823
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,880
say for example

824
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,840
like the intentional blindness case um

825
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,279
or in phenomenal masking

826
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,919
in some cases there is a visual stimulus

827
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,360
in one case where it's unaware and

828
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,200
there's a very small change

829
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,880
physical change the stimulus but there's

830
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,120
this radical non-linear change in

831
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,919
whether you can report it or not i'm

832
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:46,880
interested

833
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,000
in that contrast between reportable

834
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,799
stimuli

835
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,520
and non-reportable stimuli now along

836
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,440
with that comes when stimuli are

837
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,440
reportable generally speaking

838
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,000
there is a we might also be interested

839
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,840
in characterizing kind of the content of

840
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,600
experience as it were not just the

841
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,360
availability for report

842
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,559
um so we're going to get to that

843
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,159
actually kind of towards the end of the

844
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,159
presentation we actually do endorse a

845
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:14,720
version

846
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,799
of the phenomenal consciousness access

847
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,840
consciousness distinction

848
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,080
but really i think

849
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,960
to answer just kind of repeat repeat

850
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,039
myself somewhat and answer the question

851
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,399
all that i'm trying to explain with this

852
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,640
model is that distinction between

853
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,960
con except content that's accessible and

854
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,640
content that's not accessible

855
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,640
everything else i don't really mind like

856
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,799
people can call it whatever they like

857
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,480
uh i'm not interested in modeling it

858
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,640
yeah so i mean i mean in general right i

859
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,919
mean again this just speaks to kind of

860
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:48,559
having

861
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,880
precise theoretical constructs and

862
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,399
having a good kind of toxic you know

863
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:53,919
taxonomy of these things within a

864
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,279
particular area

865
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,360
and also you know if you're going to try

866
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,200
to do any kind of

867
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,919
um interdisciplinary work right where

868
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,919
you have constructs in one kind of field

869
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,000
and you want to find some way to

870
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,880
map them on to right or translate them

871
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,520
into

872
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,919
what you think they ought to be right in

873
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,120
some other

874
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,840
uh you know in some other theoretical

875
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,039
language

876
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,120
right then i mean then also specifying

877
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,559
that in a precise way and how you kind

878
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,320
of recover one from the other

879
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,600
in terms of the way they're

880
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
operationalized empirically

881
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,440
right i mean it's also something that's

882
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,200
that you have to do right to do this

883
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,760
work

884
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,080
well you know so i mean like you know

885
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,760
chris already started

886
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,799
right to kind of just people really

887
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:37,919
loosely

888
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,679
you know at least not in all cases right

889
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,200
obviously some people are very precise

890
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,799
but in some cases

891
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,880
the word consciousness or awareness gets

892
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,480
kind of thrown around to mean a ton of

893
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,679
different things

894
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,240
which makes it confusing and also makes

895
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,600
the term

896
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,679
you know uh imprecise and therefore not

897
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,440
really all that useful

898
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,519
um you know for instance there's

899
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,840
distinctions that people make between

900
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,440
right what we're talking about right

901
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,080
like whether a particular

902
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,799
content particular represented content

903
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,000
in the brain

904
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,200
and if people report um experiencing it

905
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,480
versus if people report

906
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,600
not experiencing it right um but then

907
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,960
there's also some people talk about

908
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,080
levels of consciousness

909
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,519
right which is a totally different thing

910
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,279
you know like that's like

911
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,360
being in a coma versus being in like a

912
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,600
minimal you know like a vegetative state

913
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,679
versus um you know being like awake but

914
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,600
really sleepy you know versus being

915
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,919
really alert right that kind of thing

916
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,360
um you know and there's which is a

917
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,120
totally separate thing right i mean you

918
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,799
can kind of think of one as a

919
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,640
as a precondition in some sense for

920
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,919
another right like

921
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,720
you have to be in a level of

922
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,600
consciousness

923
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,320
that corresponds to being awake right to

924
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,039
have

925
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,840
any you know or organ or like dreaming

926
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,399
right

927
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,159
but your brain has to be in a certain

928
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,519
general state

929
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,519
of of consciousness um level wise

930
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,320
to be able to have the experience of one

931
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,559
particular content over another

932
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,720
right so that's can saying being awake

933
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,320
is a precondition

934
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,919
for studying the thing that we're

935
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,799
interested in which is why you become

936
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,440
conscious of one thing versus another

937
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,480
given very similar stimulus conditions

938
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,360
exactly you know so so there are i mean

939
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,399
there's there's more

940
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,000
right different distinctions right like

941
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,600
i mean like i said there's this you know

942
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,200
distinction between or or

943
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,600
you know potential distinction between

944
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,200
phenomenal consciousness

945
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,919
right just like the what it's like to be

946
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:34,960
experiencing

947
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,600
something versus this access

948
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,159
consciousness

949
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,799
this thing which is roughly being being

950
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,000
aware of the thing you're

951
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,200
experiencing um and uh

952
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,279
and like i said several people think

953
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,120
this kind of thing can come apart

954
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,159
um i also i'm very skeptical about that

955
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,159
um um you know eg the the bridge exact

956
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,440
the fridge flight example

957
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,480
um chris mentioned earlier um you know i

958
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,679
mean like i said at the end of at the

959
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,279
end of this paper

960
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,399
we do in some sense describe how our

961
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,360
model

962
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,960
um can can identify something like

963
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,559
something like two different types of

964
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,760
access where one type of access

965
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,399
um is kind of what's minimally necessary

966
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:18,799
for

967
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,399
empirically verifiable phenomenology

968
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:26,159
um um whereas the other is more kind of

969
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,600
what determines the actual reporting um

970
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,519
but you know so there is something like

971
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,080
a distinction in our model but it's not

972
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,840
the standard kind of phenomenal

973
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,039
consciousness versus that just

974
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,799
consciousness distinction

975
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,120
um but yeah but anyway i mean there's uh

976
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,840
my point is

977
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,039
there's all these different sorts of

978
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,720
things you know you mentioned like uh

979
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,240
somebody mentioned like the

980
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,480
like you know phenomenal like literature

981
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,480
where people just kind of describe

982
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,240
you know the way that phenomenology is

983
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,279
or kind of the dynamics and

984
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,960
phenomenology and things like that and

985
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,559
then also as a kind of completely

986
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:57,360
different

987
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,320
very kind of descriptive you know field

988
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,679
right that doesn't have to do with this

989
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:02,799
just thinking about

990
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,360
what becomes you know experienced versus

991
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,240
not

992
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,199
um so i mean the the general kind of i

993
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,320
mean against is already kind of like

994
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,079
long-winded answer but just

995
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,599
just uh i think very precise

996
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,040
terms and very precise mappings between

997
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,159
terms in different

998
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,079
fields or necessary to do this kind of

999
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,199
thing um

1000
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,960
well at all and that's not always the

1001
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,239
case all right

1002
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,839
yeah just to briefly follow up on that

1003
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,839
like i

1004
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,359
really what i'm interested is this is

1005
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,839
kind of was put out in bernard bars

1006
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,760
he called it the goodness i might

1007
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,839
butcher this i've gotten

1008
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,760
basically a minimal contrast approach

1009
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,280
where you have

1010
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,040
some content of which you're aware some

1011
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,399
content which you're unaware

1012
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,320
and up to all about up to some limit

1013
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,000
the the physical properties of the

1014
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,960
stimulus should be almost identical

1015
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,119
there might be 10 milliseconds extra

1016
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,159
between the mask

1017
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,000
and the stimulus and that's the only

1018
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,359
thing that renders it so

1019
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,119
then the idea there is that we can

1020
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,480
contrast

1021
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,400
the neuronal kind of consequences of

1022
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,560
being aware of a stimulus versus unaware

1023
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,240
independent of hopefully the physical

1024
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,279
properties of the stimulus

1025
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,400
and so so just to give an example and

1026
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,440
just to make sure that i'm being

1027
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,240
charitable

1028
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,440
um so there was recently a

1029
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,480
uh special issue of i'm fairly sure

1030
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,599
especially issue of the journal of

1031
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,680
consciousness studies on like

1032
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,520
uh consciousness in plants um

1033
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,280
and i guess one thing that i'm not

1034
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,720
entirely convinced of

1035
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,960
is that we're really talking about the

1036
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,000
same thing

1037
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,920
i think that's great and people smart we

1038
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,119
should let smart people do what they

1039
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,320
want

1040
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,240
and study all of these things but i'm

1041
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,720
not convinced for example that

1042
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,119
the process or it will take a lot of

1043
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,079
convincing to

1044
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,680
convince me that something like

1045
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,119
phenomenal conscious whatever you want

1046
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,400
to call phenomenal consciousness in a

1047
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,200
tree

1048
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,240
or a plant really has anything at all

1049
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,040
to do with this minimal contrast

1050
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,839
approach

1051
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:02,960
in like the neuroscience of

1052
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,960
consciousness

1053
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,520
yeah one one other one other thing again

1054
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,880
just like things kind of popping up in

1055
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,839
my head here um

1056
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,839
uh

1057
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,760
okay thanks ryan also maybe you could

1058
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,280
talk like a little closer into your

1059
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,760
microphone it gets a little quiet

1060
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,160
okay thank you all right continue and

1061
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,520
i'm really curious to see how active

1062
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,880
inference is going to play

1063
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,640
into this oh sorry sorry i just

1064
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,880
remembered what i was going to say

1065
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,720
so i think another thing that sometimes

1066
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,240
gets plated is

1067
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,440
is just um representing things

1068
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,960
versus being aware of them um right so

1069
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,440
so you know like a major so it's a for

1070
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,160
example

1071
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,599
right i mean in the in the act of the

1072
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,880
inference literature there are other

1073
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,839
papers that have described

1074
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,920
um you know things like jacobian monism

1075
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,520
right is something that like i'm like

1076
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,560
one of carl's

1077
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,760
recent papers um you know where

1078
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,920
where more or less it's a story about

1079
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,119
how

1080
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,880
via the free energy principle you can

1081
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,800
come to have systems where the internal

1082
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,240
states of the system

1083
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,560
um come to parameterize or track in some

1084
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,760
way the states

1085
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,880
of the world outside of the system

1086
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,359
right so so in a really broad sense you

1087
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,320
have some

1088
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,320
some um some way in which the internal

1089
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,400
states are representing or keeping track

1090
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,040
of

1091
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,160
right the external states um that as a

1092
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,160
kind of representation

1093
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,720
um or the kind of seeds of internal

1094
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,560
representations of what's kind of going

1095
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,400
on out in the world

1096
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,960
but the idea you know with this sort of

1097
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,680
literature is

1098
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,839
that the brain can represent a bunch of

1099
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,599
stuff at the same time

1100
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,119
but only some of the stuff that's being

1101
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,359
represented becomes conscious

1102
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,480
at any given moment right so like i can

1103
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,440
flash like

1104
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,680
a word i can flash like so unlike some

1105
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,040
studies for instance i could flash the

1106
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,240
word guilt for you

1107
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,280
really fast um and you won't report ever

1108
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:13,760
having

1109
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,400
seen the word guilt but you'll you'll

1110
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,359
actually

1111
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,920
behave in ways that are more consistent

1112
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,480
with

1113
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,599
uh feeling guilty or something like that

1114
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,440
right or or i mean simpler like

1115
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,280
perceptual or semantic priming examples

1116
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,560
where you might flash something really

1117
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,560
quickly again a person doesn't

1118
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,160
um you know say they are aware of having

1119
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,680
seen anything but

1120
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,720
they'll say complete word stems in one

1121
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,800
particular way versus another right if i

1122
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,480
flash an elephant for you really fast

1123
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,680
you don't know i see it you don't know

1124
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,480
you see it

1125
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,200
and i give you like a words then like el

1126
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,480
you know and it's like complete the word

1127
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,000
people are more likely to say

1128
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,520
elephant than they would be if you

1129
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,839
didn't flash it right or something like

1130
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:54,160
that

1131
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,760
right so behavior is affected by

1132
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,599
something that was clearly

1133
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,560
caught right by the brain but but

1134
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,720
despite that it was represented

1135
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,880
um you didn't become aware of it right

1136
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,560
so i just want to make that distinction

1137
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,359
as well but

1138
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,040
being conscious of something is distinct

1139
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,880
from whether it

1140
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,040
whether the brain actually uh in some

1141
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,000
sense knew what's there

1142
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,560
yeah yeah okay so

1143
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,599
um just the idea

1144
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,520
so we used a passage over markov

1145
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,359
decision process

1146
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,599
as our model a hierarchical one i should

1147
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,520
say so this is just a single level

1148
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,359
markov decision process

1149
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,480
and just very briefly if pomdps

1150
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,240
i'm just going to call them mdps just

1151
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,800
for brevity

1152
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,280
they describe transitions among kind of

1153
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,520
hidden unobservable variables and the

1154
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,040
sensory data they generate so you can

1155
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,079
have a hidden state of the world

1156
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,240
and the observations generated by that

1157
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,520
hidden state

1158
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,960
and the goal of active inference is to

1159
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,359
infer the states and the sequences

1160
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:01,599
or action sequences or policies pi

1161
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,599
um from the set of observations

1162
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,280
and so i'll just kind of like step

1163
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,480
through very basically how this would

1164
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,760
work so

1165
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,000
you could just have a very simple case

1166
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,280
right here where

1167
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,720
where do this is just a graphical

1168
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,240
representation of bayesian inference

1169
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,640
we can just have a hidden state and we

1170
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,480
have a prior over that state

1171
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,480
and we have some likelihood mapping

1172
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,839
between that hidden state

1173
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,119
and some a

1174
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,839
state of the world i think i'm getting

1175
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,200
feedback from someone's computer

1176
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,839
okay try again

1177
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,119
continue christopher thanks okay thanks

1178
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,480
that's better

1179
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,359
um yeah it's funny how that was how um

1180
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,480
that messes with you we've got

1181
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,680
predictive models of

1182
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,920
when our when our speed speech timing

1183
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,440
should be at least we know that you're

1184
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,760
awake

1185
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,680
um okay

1186
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,720
so we've got yeah so this this comes out

1187
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,920
to basically if you then

1188
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,839
invert this model this is just exact

1189
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,640
bayesian inference

1190
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,079
now if we start moving through time

1191
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,280
we have to add in transition

1192
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,440
probabilities and so this just imagine

1193
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,040
this first level of model is just a

1194
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,880
markov chain it's just

1195
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,640
you have some initial state you

1196
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,640
transition into your first state then

1197
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,319
you have state transitions that govern

1198
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,319
how you how those states change over

1199
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:32,880
time

1200
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,079
but you also have variables but you

1201
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,160
don't ever get to see this markov chain

1202
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,359
all you get to see is a set of

1203
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,560
observations and

1204
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,560
so the idea is these observations are

1205
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,400
generated by these hidden states

1206
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,760
and so the task of inverting these

1207
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,319
models

1208
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,880
is to infer the most likely hidden state

1209
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,839
conditioned on

1210
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,359
some stim stimulus

1211
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,599
um and so you get this this is this

1212
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,280
little sigma here is a soft matte

1213
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,960
denotes softmax function

1214
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,720
and basically you can derive message

1215
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,560
passing algorithms um

1216
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,480
or using message passing algorithms

1217
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,640
rather you can derive

1218
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,880
very simple update rules that allow you

1219
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,119
to come up with posterior probabilities

1220
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,760
over states

1221
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,880
and then actions under this framework

1222
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,880
are then just kind of state transitions

1223
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,119
that the agent has control over

1224
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,359
so you can imagine in like a

1225
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,839
psychophysics experiment

1226
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,880
the actions this is a super limited

1227
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,599
exp set of action space for the agent

1228
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,119
basically they can hit left or right and

1229
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,040
they might be able to move their eyes

1230
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,560
so those would be the policies that they

1231
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,079
can control everything else

1232
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,680
the state the screen those are hidden

1233
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,760
states but they're just not transitions

1234
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,200
transitions between those hidden states

1235
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,640
aren't things that the agent can control

1236
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,839
okay so then in a way so how do we

1237
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:58,880
select actions

1238
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,160
well we select actions according to the

1239
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,839
frenzy functional

1240
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,319
so this has two component and you select

1241
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,480
the action or the policy rather

1242
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,000
that is kind of best to expected free

1243
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,839
energy where this has two terms

1244
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:17,200
the first is the expected cost

1245
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,720
so this is kind of the kale divergence

1246
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,920
or the difference between

1247
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,119
our predicted outcomes which is this q

1248
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,240
here and our

1249
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,079
under predicted outcomes under some

1250
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,480
policy

1251
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,119
um so what the outcome i expect given

1252
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,880
that i take a certain action

1253
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,240
and the predict and just our um

1254
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,960
and our preferred observations so these

1255
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,800
are things like having preferences for

1256
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,520
winning versus losing um where the agent

1257
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,119
generally is but you can encode the

1258
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,280
agent wants to win

1259
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,640
or not to lose or something like that

1260
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,160
the second term here this is the

1261
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,160
exploratory component

1262
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,400
this is the expected ambiguity where

1263
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,760
this is basically

1264
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,640
the expected entropy of the likelihood

1265
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,640
mapping it's the idea here is that you

1266
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,520
seek out actions or seek out states of

1267
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,880
the world

1268
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,960
that have a precise mapping to sensory

1269
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,280
outcomes and so for example if you're in

1270
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,960
a hotel room

1271
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,440
um that you've never been in before it's

1272
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,240
really dark

1273
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,000
the best way best actions to take to

1274
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,440
minimize your uncertainty is just to

1275
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,280
turn the light on

1276
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,880
um because that will give you a really

1277
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,240
precise mapping between the hidden

1278
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,760
states of the world

1279
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,560
out there and kind of the observations

1280
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,599
that you generate

1281
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:39,359
all that they generate and so the idea

1282
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:40,000
is that

1283
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,760
expected fringe is minimized when both

1284
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,960
of these terms are minimized

1285
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,000
and it's actually a little bit more

1286
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,280
complicated than this i should say so

1287
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,680
policy selection isn't just um

1288
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,599
the minimization of expected fringy it

1289
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,200
also involves minimization of

1290
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,040
variational free energy but i would just

1291
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,640
say what's the model stream

1292
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,839
um to get into that for our purposes in

1293
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,160
this conversation we can just say

1294
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,640
policies are selected that best minimize

1295
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,640
expected free energy

1296
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,400
and variational free energy where

1297
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,000
variational free energy

1298
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,520
is also basically a stand-in where the

1299
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,640
posterior optimal posterior here

1300
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,480
that you infer will also kind of

1301
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,480
you minimize you you infer the optimal

1302
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,839
posterior

1303
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,839
by minimizing variational free energy

1304
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,680
and

1305
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,880
okay so what about i haven't really

1306
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,480
talked about the brain so far

1307
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,119
um one of the beautiful things back of

1308
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:38,560
inference is that comes the process

1309
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,839
theory

1310
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,520
um and so belief updates those

1311
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,839
changes to your posterior states

1312
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,680
correspond to changes in activation

1313
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,680
levels in response to input

1314
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,800
and the matrix entries here d b

1315
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,000
h c blah blah blah these

1316
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,520
are all h actually isn't really a matrix

1317
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,599
i guess it's a matrix entry sure what is

1318
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,040
h

1319
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,520
entropy

1320
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,079
um so you can just these correspond to

1321
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,440
synaptic connection strengths

1322
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,560
i mean this is just like a very standard

1323
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,040
assumption across neural network

1324
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,079
literature really

1325
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,920
and just in your neural science in

1326
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,359
general where

1327
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,839
synaptic changes in weights of synaptic

1328
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:24,960
connections

1329
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,720
uh correspond to some kind of like

1330
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,839
function approximation

1331
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,920
okay and so then you get these kind of

1332
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,280
somewhat intimidating looking

1333
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,960
equations we can just select the ones

1334
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,800
that are really relevant so this

1335
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,359
first one here is state prediction error

1336
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,280
and so minimizing state prediction area

1337
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,400
in perception

1338
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,200
corresponds to where the corresponds to

1339
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,640
essentially the inference of the

1340
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,160
posterior probability

1341
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,440
q of s whoops and

1342
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,160
you can cast this as a gradient descent

1343
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,760
on variational free energy and that's

1344
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,960
actually where we get

1345
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,000
our erps from

1346
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,319
um christopher could you go into a

1347
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,800
little detail what the variational

1348
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,280
means independently or as related to the

1349
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,880
free energy here

1350
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,720
yeah sure so variational free energy is

1351
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,160
just to

1352
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,839
distinguish it from something like

1353
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,760
thermodynamic free energy

1354
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,760
um so like there are formal

1355
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,280
relationships between these things i

1356
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:25,839
would just say

1357
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,319
read carls kofristen's work if you want

1358
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:29,119
to know about that

1359
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,079
but basically uh variational frangie is

1360
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,839
the kale divergence between

1361
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,240
a generative model and your approximate

1362
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,160
posterior distribution and what you're

1363
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:38,800
trying to do

1364
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,520
is change the approximate posterior

1365
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,920
distribution

1366
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,359
uh it slowly but surely so

1367
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,440
change it bit by bit you nudge it in the

1368
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,240
direction of steepest descent

1369
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,960
until it basically this error term here

1370
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,240
which is basically the difference

1371
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,559
between the log difference between

1372
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,720
your generative model and your

1373
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,240
approximate posterior

1374
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,359
you you change s

1375
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:08,880
until that difference is at the minimum

1376
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,440
and the rate at which that changes so

1377
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,440
this little

1378
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,440
v dot here is your erp

1379
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,599
so the idea and i'm going to go into

1380
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,839
that a little bit more in a moment

1381
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,359
um so the idea is that you have

1382
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,319
our the log probability of our posterior

1383
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:32,160
is essentially a non-normalized log

1384
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:32,960
probability

1385
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,040
it can be positive or negative like a

1386
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,440
voltage

1387
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,960
and then you have you can have your erps

1388
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,160
and this is just like your change in

1389
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,079
membrane potential

1390
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,520
over neuronal populations and that

1391
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,880
corresponds to roughly speaking like

1392
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,680
these big potentials we see at the scalp

1393
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,359
and then we have a normalized firing

1394
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,440
rate where

1395
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,839
um you will basically we normalize the

1396
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:59,520
depolarization variable through by

1397
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,160
branding it through a softmax function

1398
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,200
and the softmax function is just a

1399
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,839
generalization

1400
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:10,000
of a logistic function to

1401
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,079
more than one input more than one cl

1402
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,960
more than two classes

1403
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,319
and what's nice about using a

1404
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:18,240
generalization of a sigmoid function

1405
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,520
is that everyone who's looked at like

1406
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,680
rate models of pop in popular population

1407
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,880
nodes for example or

1408
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,319
somewhat sometimes called main field

1409
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,559
models um

1410
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:28,319
with these basically you can have this

1411
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,480
firing rate versus input curve where on

1412
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,400
the x-axis you have the amount of input

1413
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,720
that you're driving into the population

1414
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,680
and on the y-axis you'll have the firing

1415
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,920
rate of the population

1416
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,440
and it's logistic function so it's going

1417
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,520
to be bounded a roughly speaking between

1418
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,079
0 and 1.

1419
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,280
so what you'll end up with is

1420
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,079
a this kind of sigmoid style looking

1421
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:57,359
curve

1422
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,359
that we treat as a probability

1423
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,680
distribution but can also be interp

1424
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,599
has kind of this lovely biophysically

1425
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,119
plausible well

1426
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,119
i don't know about plausible but

1427
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:08,640
biophysically sensible

1428
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,800
maybe interpretation as a normalized

1429
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,480
firing rate

1430
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,000
and that kind of allows us to translate

1431
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,319
between this kind of normative models

1432
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,079
thinking about probability distributions

1433
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,599
and what the brain is actually doing

1434
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,280
okay is everyone kind of happy with that

1435
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,680
yes stephen do you have a quick question

1436
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,920
just one quick question just is the

1437
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,839
expected free energy um on policies more

1438
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,160
important at level two

1439
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,240
and level one it kind of can soft max

1440
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,119
itself

1441
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,960
um or is it that's a bit simplifying but

1442
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,880
does does expected free energy go all

1443
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,359
the way down or is it a bit more

1444
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,640
you can generally have models that

1445
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,319
uh you can have policy selection at both

1446
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:02,960
levels

1447
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,040
you can policy selection at just the

1448
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,400
lower level or just the higher level

1449
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,359
depends what you're trying to model

1450
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:08,720
really

1451
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,440
generally speaking in models so i in the

1452
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,800
model we're going to be using i'm going

1453
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,240
to introduce in just a moment

1454
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,839
we don't have policy selection at the

1455
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,680
first level

1456
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,599
um we had policy selection at the second

1457
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:20,800
level

1458
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,440
but you might for example there's work

1459
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,319
by thomas parr

1460
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:25,920
and uh ryan and i kind of working on

1461
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,599
some similar work um

1462
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,400
as a part of my thesis where basically

1463
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,839
the idea is that the higher

1464
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,839
higher like working memory-ish

1465
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:34,960
pre-frontal level

1466
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,520
you have goal-directed policy selection

1467
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,280
and at the first level you just have

1468
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:39,760
kind of

1469
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,119
epistemically guided policy selection um

1470
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:45,119
and so the policies that are being

1471
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,400
selected at the first level might be

1472
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,119
something like

1473
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:49,200
where in the visual field to point your

1474
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,319
attention or to move your eyes

1475
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:55,040
and that's just kind of determined by

1476
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,960
the salience of various items which in

1477
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,160
this framework

1478
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,599
corresponds to essentially the

1479
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,520
information gain offered by

1480
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,040
all the precision at the first level

1481
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,559
a matrix um so hopefully that answers

1482
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,240
your question

1483
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,879
yeah thanks

1484
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,760
so as a as just a little bit of kind of

1485
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,839
a generalization of that i mean

1486
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:19,520
really and you know and of course i'll

1487
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,760
go into this but but the way these are

1488
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,000
this is modeled officially is just

1489
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,440
each lower level trial is just a full

1490
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,119
trial as in if you were modeling it

1491
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:30,079
separately

1492
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,119
the higher level is just putting a prior

1493
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,680
on whatever the starting whatever the

1494
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,000
starting prior is for each lower level

1495
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,160
trial um so i mean in a sense

1496
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,119
you're modeling these try you could be

1497
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:46,960
you could think about each trial either

1498
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,480
at the lower level of the higher level

1499
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,599
as being modeled

1500
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,440
independently in some sense right each

1501
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,000
one can have a set of policies

1502
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,079
each can have anything that a single

1503
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:57,760
level model could have it's just that

1504
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,119
the higher level

1505
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,000
is putting fires of some kind on the

1506
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,200
lower level

1507
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,359
and then the posterior observations at

1508
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:06,480
the lower level

1509
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,160
are then feeding back in as the

1510
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,480
observations for the higher level

1511
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,599
um so so it's

1512
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,760
just just think about them as as just

1513
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,280
separate kind of trials

1514
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,559
on different time scales where they're

1515
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:20,000
just connected by their priors and

1516
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,599
posteriors

1517
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,800
yeah exactly um and so i guess what we

1518
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,559
did here was we wanted to have something

1519
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:26,880
like

1520
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,800
to implement something global neural

1521
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,559
workspace like

1522
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,559
in a deep active inference architecture

1523
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,240
and i what i want to highlight i have i

1524
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,640
have mixed feelings about

1525
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,240
defining the term the predictive global

1526
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,000
neural workspace because people lump

1527
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,559
lump this model in in a the few people

1528
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,079
who have been kind enough to cite this

1529
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:45,119
work

1530
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,400
have lumped us in into like models of

1531
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,599
this as being kind of just another

1532
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:51,280
version of the globally on the workspace

1533
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:51,920
um

1534
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,119
i don't think that's accurate uh we took

1535
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,800
the global narrative workspace kind of

1536
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,400
and all of the phenomena that

1537
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,640
that it encompasses kind of as something

1538
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,760
that we want to explain

1539
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,079
um both ryan and i really like the

1540
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:05,839
global neural workspace like

1541
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:07,599
standard harness bars huge heroes of

1542
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,920
mine and aside from kind of like my

1543
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,359
personal

1544
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,400
love of the theory it's also among

1545
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,480
kind of neuroscientists and philosophers

1546
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,680
who work on consciousness

1547
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,760
about 30 the majority of them which is

1548
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,400
about 35 or something like that

1549
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,119
in 2018 said that they regarded as the

1550
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:26,240
most promising

1551
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,640
neuroscientific theory of consciousness

1552
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,319
and so we thought okay if we're going to

1553
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,480
go into this literature this is what we

1554
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,079
should be modeling i think the phenomena

1555
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,839
encompassed by this theory is where it

1556
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,839
should be the starting point

1557
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:40,079
but with that said it's our model is an

1558
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:41,200
active inference model through and

1559
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,040
through

1560
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,000
um and so it really does kind of stand

1561
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,839
on its own independently of the global

1562
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:49,119
around the workspace and so i just kind

1563
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,880
of wanted to flag that

1564
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,839
and so i i don't use those words or in

1565
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,280
the draft of the paper that i'm writing

1566
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,400
at the moment kind of following up on

1567
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,000
this one i don't use those words and i

1568
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,040
don't do it

1569
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,799
that's very deliberate um

1570
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,359
but anyway sorry that was an aside um

1571
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:07,520
that's a very esoterical side of that

1572
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,240
anyway um so the idea here is that we

1573
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,520
implement something global in the

1574
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,119
workspace like in a deep

1575
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:15,119
deep temporal architecture so this

1576
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,400
second level

1577
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,440
we identify deep level we identify with

1578
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,440
the workspace

1579
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,440
and so as ryan was just talking about

1580
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,960
you have these states the second level

1581
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,680
which are really like beliefs about how

1582
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,079
trials at the first level evolve over

1583
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:32,400
time

1584
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,839
and so they provide a prior at each time

1585
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:36,319
step

1586
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:39,920
of the lower level they provide a prior

1587
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,960
over the hidden state and then

1588
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,559
after when there's posterior inference

1589
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:46,400
at the first level after that's happened

1590
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,000
it then shoots back up to the second

1591
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,559
level

1592
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:50,720
and that acts as an observation for the

1593
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,279
second level

1594
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:57,040
okay so we the functions we tip the idea

1595
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,480
here is that the functions we typically

1596
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,240
associate with conscious processing

1597
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,960
take place at the level of the hierarchy

1598
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:03,599
that's kind of

1599
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,839
deep and temporally deep enough to

1600
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,839
abstract away from processes that are

1601
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:09,359
entrained by the moment-to-moment

1602
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:10,720
sensory flux

1603
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,240
and this allows the agent to kind of

1604
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,040
construct a report of its experience

1605
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,960
or to do anything any other kind of kind

1606
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,200
of quite abstract cognitive task

1607
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,240
and the idea is that ignition occurs

1608
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,160
when a first level state is in third by

1609
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,520
the second level

1610
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,839
so ignition sorry is basically like what

1611
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:29,200
dehan has called

1612
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,119
this non-linear bifurcation of this

1613
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:33,200
fronto parietal network

1614
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,799
in the neuronal activity so the idea is

1615
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:36,319
that ignition for our model occurs when

1616
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:37,839
the first level state is inferred by the

1617
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:38,799
second level

1618
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:40,640
with a high enough posterior probability

1619
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,720
to kind of influence policy selection

1620
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,760
at the second level

1621
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:50,000
oops so okay on to the task

1622
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,040
so this is a very kind of general task

1623
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,319
structure which we borrowed from a

1624
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:55,920
really awesome empirical study done by

1625
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,880
michael pitts

1626
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,319
in 2014 and colleagues um so idea was at

1627
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:01,839
the first time step

1628
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:04,799
there was a forward mask presented and

1629
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:06,000
so

1630
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,520
second time step there's a target

1631
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,520
stimulus so these little lines in the

1632
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,240
center can rearrange themselves into

1633
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,240
a square and the second type there's a

1634
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,559
backwards mask of the third time step

1635
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,480
and that the agent is then asked to

1636
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,319
construct a report of its experience so

1637
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:21,599
whether it say whether it's or something

1638
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:23,280
or not

1639
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,160
um and the idea roughly speaking these

1640
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:26,559
little

1641
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,040
colored circles on the outside this is

1642
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,799
how we manipulate attention or and how

1643
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:33,040
michael pits manipulate attention

1644
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,319
um and so they either had people attend

1645
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,000
to the inside and perform a task

1646
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,920
basically click a button whenever the

1647
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,680
circle change the square changed or

1648
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,960
click a button whenever the circle

1649
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,480
changed

1650
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,160
um and so they manipulated kind of

1651
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,280
what was task relevant and i'll get into

1652
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,480
how they manipulate awareness in a

1653
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,520
moment

1654
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,119
but roughly speaking the way we

1655
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:57,200
implemented the model this is kind of a

1656
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,079
bayes net

1657
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,720
representation of the model and then if

1658
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,559
we just kind of click through it

1659
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:06,079
at time one there is a forward mask

1660
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:08,000
presented and this just corresponds to a

1661
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:08,960
black

1662
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,960
with a square trials that's the full

1663
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,160
this is kind of a

1664
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,440
belief at the second level there is a

1665
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,440
full sequence this is beliefs about the

1666
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,359
full sequence over the full trial

1667
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:20,319
so this is a time step one um there's a

1668
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,000
report hidden state factor here

1669
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,280
it's in weight because we haven't asked

1670
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,040
it to construct a report yet

1671
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,559
then at the first level each of these

1672
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:29,359
second level states kind of implies

1673
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:32,400
a first level state that makes sense and

1674
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,240
each of these first level states kind of

1675
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:34,960
implies

1676
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,000
a observation and

1677
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,559
attention in our model was basically we

1678
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:41,839
just hard coded in

1679
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:44,240
as a but we didn't have to hard code it

1680
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,680
you can get these things to emerge we

1681
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,640
just

1682
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,240
it's just a little bit easier in our

1683
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,480
case to do it this way we basically hard

1684
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,079
coded in

1685
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,000
so that attention corresponded to

1686
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,680
modulations of the

1687
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,359
mapping of the precision of the mapping

1688
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,440
between these first level hidden states

1689
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,119
kind of whether there was a square or

1690
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:03,359
lines out there in the world and the

1691
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:04,559
observations

1692
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,960
so okay so first first time point

1693
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,079
forwards mask

1694
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:11,119
we see a sequence type is

1695
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:13,760
going to be a square there's a trial

1696
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,720
phase one

1697
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,240
report okay next one we see trial is

1698
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,599
moved to two

1699
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,280
we've now seen the target has now

1700
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,200
rearranged itself into a square

1701
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,200
we did this for two time steps and we

1702
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,480
did the reason we did it for represent

1703
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,960
the target stimulus the target stimulus

1704
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,200
the two time steps is to allow recurrent

1705
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,119
feedback processes from the first level

1706
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:34,880
kind of first level second level to kind

1707
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,880
of recognize what's going on then feed

1708
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:37,280
back

1709
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,839
on to the first level kind of give

1710
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:40,319
that's

1711
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:41,520
that was kind of our way of modeling

1712
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,000
this ignition style process

1713
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,079
then fourth time step we take away the

1714
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,000
math we replace the little square of

1715
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,680
just the mask again

1716
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,440
and then from five to eight

1717
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,920
do we allow the model to construct a

1718
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,920
report of its experience so basically

1719
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,359
this scene hidden state here implies a

1720
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:02,640
sequence of

1721
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,280
language processing states at the first

1722
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,599
level

1723
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,960
i submit a square yeah just it says i

1724
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,559
see a square and then what would it say

1725
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:14,319
if it was unseen

1726
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:18,160
uh i didn't say anything

1727
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:20,640
i mean to be fit just to be clear like

1728
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,799
uh

1729
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,839
we could have and the model would be

1730
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:27,119
exactly the same in

1731
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:29,920
all aspects we could just chop off this

1732
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,520
kind of language processing part of the

1733
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,359
model

1734
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:34,720
and the model would behave exactly the

1735
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,640
same way

1736
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,160
and we could still use it to generate

1737
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,760
reports and all of that stuff

1738
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,520
what we wanted to do was really just

1739
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,599
kind of use this as kind of an intuition

1740
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:44,400
pump

1741
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,440
for what having this deep temporal

1742
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,200
representation

1743
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,160
allows models to do so holding something

1744
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,119
at that level

1745
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:55,920
allows sequences or a cascade of hidden

1746
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,720
states

1747
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,720
to kind of evolve at lower levels that

1748
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,240
might be something like constructing a

1749
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,680
sentence

1750
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,599
with a goal in mind or it might be

1751
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:06,319
something like um

1752
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:08,319
i don't know make a cup of coffee where

1753
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:10,079
you have to hold multiple tasks in mind

1754
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:10,880
and break things down

1755
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,680
the sub components blah blah blah yep as

1756
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,599
opposed to mapping to button that says

1757
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:16,480
yes or no

1758
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,160
if it's just a two button option then

1759
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,559
it's a one time step paradigm

1760
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:23,599
yeah exactly i mean we could do that i

1761
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:24,400
mean it'd be

1762
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,559
completely identical um this is just

1763
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:28,000
kind of a

1764
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,680
a nice way of showing what these models

1765
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,680
can do really yeah i mean so this was

1766
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,760
this was partially for uh for a kind of

1767
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,400
to make a theoretical point right you

1768
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,119
could say

1769
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:38,720
right we're showing a two-level model

1770
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,480
here but you know

1771
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,440
the brain probably has you know i don't

1772
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,359
know how many levels but a very large

1773
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:47,040
number of levels right not just

1774
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:50,400
two um so you know you could

1775
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,640
you could kind of level the concern or

1776
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,000
question at us that like

1777
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,480
you know why is it that this second

1778
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,240
level is the one that corresponds to

1779
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,839
conscious access

1780
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:02,160
right as opposed to just any other level

1781
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,520
that's above some level

1782
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,760
right in the brain since there's a big

1783
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,520
hierarchy in the brain

1784
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,920
you know so the the idea here is is that

1785
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,520
you know we're appealing to a certain

1786
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,640
level of

1787
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:16,079
deep temporal structure right like

1788
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:18,720
um you can you can flash a stimulus at

1789
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:19,760
somebody

1790
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,599
and they can see it over a very short

1791
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,200
time scale right of like

1792
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,640
you know half a second or something

1793
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,119
really fast but

1794
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,039
actually but the sorts of cognitive

1795
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:30,400
processes

1796
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,599
that can integrate that together

1797
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,160
right and generate you know a set of

1798
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,920
thoughts right that corresponds to being

1799
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,319
aware of that right constructing

1800
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:42,880
a um yeah constructing a sentence or any

1801
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:43,920
of the things that

1802
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:47,119
chris mentioned um those are much

1803
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,440
deeper slower integrative cognitive

1804
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,720
processes

1805
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,039
right so the idea is that there is a

1806
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:54,400
level in the brain

1807
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,720
that is integrative enough and that

1808
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,480
represents things over a deep enough

1809
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,920
temporal scale

1810
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,200
that it has the minimal resources

1811
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,760
to um integrate things together hold

1812
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:06,880
them in mind

1813
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,400
um generate sequences of the sequences

1814
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,319
of words that would be necessary

1815
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:14,160
to communicate that you saw something or

1816
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,920
not right so

1817
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,240
it's that abstract deep temporal

1818
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,280
structure

1819
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,520
that is the necessary conditions for

1820
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,720
what you need to get

1821
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:29,920
empirically um confirmable awareness

1822
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,599
yeah

1823
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,039
okay and just some brief kind of

1824
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:34,960
modeling notes about what we did

1825
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,880
so to model attention and stimulus

1826
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,319
strength we basically just altered the

1827
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:39,680
precision of the air first level a

1828
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,200
matrix mapping by passing it through a

1829
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,319
softmax function

1830
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,720
twice where one of the softmax

1831
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,359
temperature

1832
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:46,720
so when you pass something through a

1833
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,880
softmax function you have a temperature

1834
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,640
on it and the temperature decides how

1835
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,920
precise it is and we just had a

1836
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,280
different temperature

1837
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,119
for each iteration of the softmax

1838
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:56,559
function

1839
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:58,000
and so the idea was then we had an

1840
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,160
ordering basically of precision

1841
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,839
where the most precise was uh

1842
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,400
attention present stimulus strength high

1843
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,079
the second was attention

1844
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:09,920
um attention absence similar strength

1845
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,880
high third was

1846
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,960
you can imagine how that goes on and

1847
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,319
kind of the reason this is

1848
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,079
this sounds pretty abstract and a bit

1849
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:20,079
kind of cooked up and that's true to an

1850
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:20,799
extent

1851
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:22,400
but i think this does actually really

1852
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,839
correspond to so if you look at

1853
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:24,559
something like

1854
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:28,160
divisive normalization in vision

1855
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:32,319
where a tension basically is a

1856
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:34,240
you will have some tuning ker neuronal

1857
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,680
tuning curve and

1858
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,839
basically basically like how precise

1859
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:39,280
that tuning curve is

1860
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,680
is modulated by both the contrast of the

1861
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:42,480
stimulus

1862
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,400
and then the contrast the stimulus gets

1863
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,520
fed into

1864
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:48,880
some attentional process where that will

1865
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,720
together determine kind of the tuning

1866
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,959
curve

1867
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:55,359
that was a very kind of rough and ready

1868
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:56,880
explanation of

1869
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,520
um tuning curves but whatever um and

1870
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,079
then

1871
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:02,640
our threshold for report we basically

1872
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,319
just set up the model to give

1873
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:06,720
have a preference for receiving correct

1874
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,559
versus incorrect feedback

1875
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:12,160
at the final time step and oaf behavior

1876
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,440
was basically modeled by simply

1877
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,119
decreasing the preference for being

1878
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:17,039
incorrect to encourage guessing

1879
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:19,039
um and so i think this was just kind of

1880
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:21,280
our first pass at doing report

1881
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,240
i don't think this is how the brain does

1882
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,359
report

1883
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:27,920
um we actually in our follow-up model

1884
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,799
we've got a much nicer way of doing this

1885
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:34,319
but i think it was it worked in the

1886
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:35,839
sense that it was able to kind of quite

1887
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:37,359
accurately capture a number of empirical

1888
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:38,720
findings so that's kind of good enough

1889
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,960
for me at this point but this first

1890
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,480
first model okay sorry

1891
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,200
that was a lot of preamble um we can get

1892
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,280
into the results

1893
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,400
so foundational simulation um this was

1894
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,440
just like kind of full

1895
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,839
like a very high precision stimulus was

1896
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:56,880
presented the model

1897
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,280
kind of with either on a square present

1898
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,200
or a square absent

1899
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,480
trial and this just kind of to test it

1900
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,520
um so great uh when there was a square

1901
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,839
present the model reported seeing it 100

1902
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:10,640
of the time

1903
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,480
you see this nice kind of bump at the

1904
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,559
second level at the first level where

1905
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:16,960
um the firing rates for square increase

1906
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,720
when we present it goes down

1907
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,960
and chris let's just make sure that

1908
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:21,920
people understand

1909
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,280
and how to interpret these things

1910
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,319
so just just so people understand so

1911
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:30,799
um time in these plots goes from left to

1912
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:31,680
right

1913
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,400
and the grayscale from white to black

1914
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:34,880
black

1915
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,920
corresponds to 100 probability and white

1916
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,520
corresponds to zero

1917
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,480
um probability and the gray so is

1918
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:43,119
something like

1919
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:46,319
you know 50 50. um so

1920
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:48,799
and these are you know cast in terms of

1921
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:50,960
firing rates here so darker than

1922
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,000
implies a higher firing rate um so the

1923
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:54,799
top plot

1924
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:56,720
on the left that says second level

1925
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,839
firing rates

1926
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:00,799
that just means it first sees the black

1927
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:02,559
circles on the outside

1928
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:06,319
so it's confident that it's either

1929
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:10,960
um gonna be a the sequence that has

1930
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,440
black circles in black square or the the

1931
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:14,000
second row

1932
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,839
the other sequence which would be black

1933
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,440
circles and just lines

1934
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,640
with no square um so basically once it

1935
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,400
sees the black circles

1936
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,640
then it knows okay this could either be

1937
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,079
a sequence where there's going to be a

1938
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,680
black square or when there's not going

1939
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:30,160
to be a black square

1940
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:33,119
so then at the and that and you can tell

1941
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,640
what the stimulus was because if you

1942
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,319
look at the first level firing rates

1943
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:39,200
so again the next kind of plot down the

1944
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:39,710
bottom

1945
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:41,520
[Music]

1946
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,160
row there corresponds to seeing the

1947
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,240
lines and the top one corresponds to

1948
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,599
seeing the square

1949
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:49,359
so basically what happens here is it

1950
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:51,839
starts out just seeing the lines

1951
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:54,160
and then at the second time step there

1952
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,680
you can see it kind of bumps up

1953
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,359
and the agent's really confident that

1954
01:07:57,359 --> 01:07:59,680
it's seeing a square

1955
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:02,160
which at the second level corresponds to

1956
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:02,799
becoming

1957
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:04,880
fully confident that it's going to be

1958
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,920
the sequence

1959
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,359
of black circle and square

1960
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:11,520
and then the stimulus goes away at time

1961
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,960
point four which you can see at the

1962
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,640
first level and then stays again

1963
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:17,679
just lines for the rest of it um and

1964
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:19,839
then the the bottom two plots

1965
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:23,040
um show the actual outcomes um where

1966
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:23,520
again

1967
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,479
black is the agent's sort of competence

1968
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:27,359
in what it did

1969
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:30,399
and the um cyan dots

1970
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:33,520
correspond to the actual ground truth um

1971
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,120
so that's just showing

1972
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,158
um that the agent waited

1973
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:40,319
for the first three time steps and then

1974
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,920
recorded scene

1975
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,920
um and kept that scene while it

1976
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,759
generated the sequence of words

1977
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:48,560
at the following four time steps and

1978
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:49,759
then the right one

1979
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:52,640
just kind of shows it started out silent

1980
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,319
for the first four time steps

1981
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:57,198
and then um the words that it observed

1982
01:08:57,198 --> 01:08:59,040
itself report were i see

1983
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,880
a square which is just those the dots

1984
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,198
moving down the diagonal to the right

1985
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:06,080
um so that's that's just just so people

1986
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,600
know how to interpret you know

1987
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,439
what these plots mean yeah exactly

1988
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,040
another clarifying point would just be

1989
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,960
that the same simulation

1990
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,759
is leading to all of these behavioral

1991
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:18,960
outcomes and

1992
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,719
neural correlate predictions and a bunch

1993
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:22,158
of other things so it's like one

1994
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,439
integrated model and

1995
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:24,880
the model stream is kind of where they

1996
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,960
built it up yeah exactly

1997
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,158
um okay so we kind of talked through all

1998
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:33,520
that

1999
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:36,880
okay so in terms of the taxonomy here

2000
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,080
what we wanted to do

2001
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,158
was basically recreate that taxonomy

2002
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:42,399
that we talked about earlier

2003
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:44,719
so this was uh modulating signal

2004
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:46,640
strength from high to low and from kind

2005
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,679
of

2006
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:49,839
and whether attention was present or

2007
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:51,359
absent and then looking at the

2008
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:53,040
corresponding firing rates

2009
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,520
and looking at like the percent seen and

2010
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,640
percent correct

2011
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,440
that kind of thing also sensing report

2012
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,040
behavior and percent correct which

2013
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,400
is false choice behavior

2014
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,480
okay so kind of couple of things to

2015
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,080
highlight

2016
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,320
firing rate first level is enhanced kind

2017
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:13,199
of most strongly

2018
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:15,199
in the conscious quadrant that's nice

2019
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:16,800
that's again what we see in empirical

2020
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,000
findings

2021
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,679
um high firing rate for kind of square

2022
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:23,440
sequence at the second level even when

2023
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,040
reports are low this is kind of nice

2024
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,480
right because i talked about earlier you

2025
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,679
can have kind of

2026
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:30,000
a firing rate at the set you can have

2027
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,480
kind of activity in prefrontal regions

2028
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,440
that is generally speaking below the

2029
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,400
threshold for report

2030
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:42,960
um that is nevertheless

2031
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,880
oh sorry when i say below the threshold

2032
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,400
for report report

2033
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,920
frequency of reports are relatively low

2034
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,840
but you can still have a preference

2035
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,840
for um you can still have a higher

2036
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,280
firing rate

2037
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,960
or the representation of showing that

2038
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,840
there's a representation of the stimulus

2039
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:00,480
basically um and then the last

2040
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,000
thing to highlight is this that the

2041
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
highest firing rate for the kind of the

2042
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,280
square sequence at the second is at the

2043
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:08,000
second level

2044
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,679
is in the conscious quadrant which we

2045
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:11,280
kind of might think about in terms of

2046
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,840
ignition

2047
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:17,679
okay so then erps we see the real thing

2048
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:18,640
to highlight here

2049
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,440
is that we see a large p3 like

2050
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,960
event-related potential in the conscious

2051
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,159
quadrant again

2052
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,920
like a lot of the empirical findings in

2053
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:29,199
the report literature

2054
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:31,760
whereas first level first level erps

2055
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,080
seem to be fairly unmodulated

2056
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,120
by um

2057
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,360
by conscious access essentially which is

2058
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,159
again what we see

2059
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:44,320
so now to a very that was kind of a very

2060
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,320
abstract kind of taxonomy we were just

2061
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,199
manipulating

2062
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:49,760
factors what we wanted to hear was show

2063
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,640
take a concrete empirical result

2064
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,880
and show how we could basically use

2065
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,800
literally exactly the same model

2066
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,760
to reproduce it so this is a really

2067
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,600
clever paradigm by michael pitts i

2068
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,679
talked about before and so the idea is

2069
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:04,640
that you will have

2070
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:08,159
these kind of uh

2071
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:11,040
three phases to an experiment in phase

2072
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,320
one

2073
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:16,400
the participant is just told to attend

2074
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,640
to the dots on the outside of the screen

2075
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,600
and hit a button

2076
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,520
when they dim and what the what

2077
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,040
participant isn't told is that every now

2078
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:23,760
and again

2079
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,239
these uh things these lines in the

2080
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:27,760
middle will rearrange themselves into a

2081
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,760
square pattern

2082
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,520
then at the end of the first phase she

2083
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,880
seek like 300 trials

2084
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,560
and at the end of the first phase they

2085
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,400
are then kind of given a debrief and

2086
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,239
they asked all right so how many people

2087
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:42,320
saw a square pat in the middle and

2088
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,840
roughly speaking it's about 50

2089
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:44,960
and this is now actually really well

2090
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,280
replicated result uh across kind of

2091
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,800
different varieties of intentional

2092
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,640
blindness roughly speaking about 50

2093
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,400
of people don't report seeing it when

2094
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,679
it's not task relevant

2095
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:56,719
so that's nice so then they then all of

2096
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:57,040
those

2097
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,040
so then they have 50 of people who

2098
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,159
didn't report seeing it

2099
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,840
and then in fact are now aware of it and

2100
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,040
then phase two

2101
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,640
they do exactly the same tasks they're

2102
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,320
attending to the disks on the outside

2103
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,440
the outside

2104
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,719
uh so it's irrelevant um

2105
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:16,239
still task relevant but they're now all

2106
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:17,760
aware of it and the debris for the end

2107
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:18,719
of the second phase

2108
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:20,480
everyone reports seeing it and so now

2109
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,080
they've got this contrast

2110
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,280
between aware versus unaware so phase

2111
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,880
one versus phase two

2112
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,000
where the only thing that's different

2113
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,199
between them is whether you're aware of

2114
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:30,080
the stimulus

2115
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:33,120
and and and the stimulus in the middle

2116
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,800
is task relevant and what you can see

2117
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,239
there's no p3b there's no

2118
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:41,679
late positive centro positive central um

2119
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:45,199
component in the erps then the final

2120
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:46,000
phase

2121
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,159
aware task the kind of the aware phase

2122
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:49,679
so all the participants are aware but

2123
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:51,040
they now make a task relevant to have

2124
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,800
them basically attend to

2125
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,960
the dot to the squares in the middle and

2126
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:58,080
when you see there is this big p3b

2127
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,440
very noticeable okay

2128
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,239
so just kind of some um this slide just

2129
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:07,040
summarizes what i just said

2130
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,040
then great so basically what we did was

2131
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,400
we just used a different inverse

2132
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,760
temperature parameter to

2133
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,159
modulate to kind of represent each state

2134
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:15,280
so phase one

2135
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,159
very low um temperature parameter for

2136
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:18,719
attention

2137
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:22,000
attention blur attention

2138
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,560
temperature parameter um that was kind

2139
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,920
of correspond and so this is you can

2140
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,120
kind of see the precision of the a

2141
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,679
matrix here we bump up for phase two we

2142
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:30,239
bump up

2143
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:31,840
the inverse temperature parameter just

2144
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,080
very slightly um this is kind of roughly

2145
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,520
speaking to chorus

2146
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,480
correspond to like a diffuse attention

2147
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,080
so not you're not particularly attending

2148
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,120
to one thing

2149
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,640
one particular feature of the stimulus

2150
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,080
you're attending just kind of diffusely

2151
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,440
to the whole screen

2152
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,120
and then the last state we basically

2153
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,199
model the tension make task relevant by

2154
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:51,440
making a very high or very precise

2155
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,560
temperature parameter where you

2156
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:53,840
basically get almost something that

2157
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,199
looks like a likelihood

2158
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:58,480
like a identity mapping

2159
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,239
okay and so these are the erps that we

2160
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:04,400
the erps and the firing rates do you get

2161
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,199
out of it

2162
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:06,880
and what you this is my favorite slide

2163
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,560
in the whole plot uh oh in the whole

2164
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,320
paper um

2165
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:13,120
what you see is basically results that

2166
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:14,320
look very very like

2167
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,920
shockingly similar to the empirical

2168
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,080
results especially for a model that is

2169
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:21,679
so incredibly simple um like ours is

2170
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:24,480
relatively at least in terms of

2171
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,000
biophysical detail

2172
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,480
um and so what you see is at the first

2173
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,719
time step so there's basically no erp so

2174
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:32,560
first phase basically no ips

2175
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:35,199
and so we we give the model feedback on

2176
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:36,640
every trial but what you should see is

2177
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,400
it's a little bit darker for the square

2178
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,440
for the um

2179
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:42,080
until we give it feedback and tell it no

2180
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,679
you were wrong

2181
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:46,000
um you did we did actually present

2182
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:46,800
squares

2183
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,280
um and the model changes its mind it was

2184
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,320
fairly sure

2185
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:53,679
that it had seen lines then

2186
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:55,440
the second one we bump up the attempt we

2187
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:56,960
bump up the

2188
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,199
tension parameter and now the model sees

2189
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:01,120
things and it gets

2190
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:05,040
or it reports seeing the

2191
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,600
stimulus so at this so i should say in

2192
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,440
phase one our model saw

2193
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,920
um the stimulus 49 of the time basically

2194
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,440
identified the empirical result was a

2195
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,400
fifty percent

2196
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,560
phase two it's sort of 99 of the time

2197
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:17,920
basically the same as the empirical

2198
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,239
results report phase two is 100

2199
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:21,440
and then phase three it's a hundred

2200
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,840
percent of the time um

2201
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,360
and there there's little but by the way

2202
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,719
i should say what the way i generated

2203
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:28,159
these results is basically

2204
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:30,880
i ran several hundred tr i basically set

2205
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,199
up just ran a for loop over the stimulus

2206
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:36,880
over the code and for each condition

2207
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:40,159
and had it generate i think so

2208
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:41,920
each kind of iteration of the for loop

2209
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,840
generated 300 trials

2210
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,239
and i then averaged over maybe 10

2211
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:48,800
iterations of that for loop

2212
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:53,679
so um each with a different random seed

2213
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,520
and so what you should see with the

2214
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:57,360
sorry that was a quick side

2215
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,280
the crucial thing is that in this last

2216
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,440
point there is this when there's a very

2217
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,040
precise stimulus mapping at the first

2218
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:03,520
level

2219
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,920
there is this abrupt change in firing

2220
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:08,239
rates at the second level

2221
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:12,239
and that abrupt change corresponds to

2222
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:14,320
the appearance or the emergence of the

2223
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,320
p3b where the p3 bit where

2224
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,640
remember that erps are generated they

2225
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,159
are the rate of change

2226
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:23,360
of posterior beliefs and so the model

2227
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,040
suddenly becomes very confident that

2228
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,440
saurus square and so you see this big

2229
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:30,800
erp boost in the p3 which corresponds to

2230
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,719
a very precise

2231
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:34,560
input mapping that comes along with

2232
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,920
something with a stimulus being task

2233
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:38,320
relevant

2234
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:39,679
and so there we've kind of got this

2235
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:41,679
really nice explanation

2236
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:44,159
of this kind of somewhat

2237
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:45,840
counterintuitive result

2238
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,159
about the dissociation of the p3 and

2239
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,719
awareness

2240
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,920
okay and then the last thing i want

2241
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,600
we're going to touch on is just kind of

2242
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:59,440
we then decide to extend the taxonomy

2243
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,360
so basically this is exactly the same

2244
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,679
but we also now manipulated

2245
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,960
whether a prior was consistent with a

2246
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:07,920
valid

2247
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,400
expectation so we gave the model kind of

2248
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,120
we made it

2249
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,679
roughly speaking two times the model

2250
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:15,280
photos roughly speaking two times more

2251
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,040
likely to see a stimulus

2252
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:20,320
than uh see a square then lines

2253
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:24,159
um and or two times more likely to see

2254
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:25,280
lines than squares

2255
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,800
and then we presented it with squares

2256
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,320
and so that's kind of the consistent

2257
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,000
inconsistent prior

2258
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,760
and then the key result is that across

2259
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,800
all of this expectations boost

2260
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,800
the effect of feedback on firing rate

2261
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,199
which is nice

2262
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:45,120
and in terms of erps what we see

2263
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,640
is something this very specific

2264
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,400
prediction

2265
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,400
when there is so these are kind of like

2266
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,840
fairly small differences but they are

2267
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:56,239
differences um

2268
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:58,400
only when attention is present do you

2269
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,440
really see

2270
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,360
a p3 that's again in line with the

2271
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:02,480
empirical literature

2272
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,640
but crucially when there's a consistent

2273
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,080
prior or a valid

2274
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,000
phase to say a valid expectation you

2275
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,400
should see a reduced p3b

2276
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,320
in contrast to when there's kind of flat

2277
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,960
priors and when there is an inconsistent

2278
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,480
prior and this is actually something

2279
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,159
that has been empirically that has been

2280
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:19,440
confirmed recently

2281
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,040
again this was something michael

2282
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,320
pitcher's on this paper if anyone's

2283
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,760
interested i can kind of post a link to

2284
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,120
the paper

2285
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,400
and that that's really nice we didn't

2286
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,759
plan for that to happen um

2287
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,800
okay it is slightly annoying i would

2288
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,159
have liked to i would have liked to cite

2289
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:34,640
it

2290
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,800
in the paper but the paper actually came

2291
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,320
out before ours was accepted for

2292
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,800
publication

2293
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,120
oh sorry uh after hours was accepted

2294
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:43,840
publication

2295
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,280
rather that's what i meant to say um

2296
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,040
okay and just a very quick summary

2297
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:51,280
summary of the results

2298
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:53,199
with really what is a really kind of

2299
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:54,719
like surprisingly simple model

2300
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:56,960
we can reproduce a very wide range of

2301
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,320
canonical results

2302
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,800
um from minimal contrast paradigms

2303
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,840
including kind of fmri and erp

2304
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,440
findings so this includes we can account

2305
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:05,760
for

2306
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,920
unconscious pfc activation we can

2307
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,679
account for the association of the p3 in

2308
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:10,239
conscious

2309
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:13,440
access um where the p3 roughly speaking

2310
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,800
reflects the velocity

2311
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,880
of conscious working memory updates i

2312
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,360
kind of like that phrase

2313
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,080
and four we have an explicit and

2314
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,280
formally defined role for prior

2315
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,880
expectations and the implementation of

2316
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,239
process theory

2317
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:27,679
and then we've got a number of key

2318
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:29,679
predictions that emerge from this

2319
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:31,920
so p3 is attention dependent and invert

2320
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,440
and should its amplitude should be

2321
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,960
inversely proportional

2322
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:38,719
to expectation feedback from fronto

2323
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:40,080
parietal regions

2324
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,000
this is a very specific prediction

2325
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,600
feedback from frontosharinal regions

2326
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,280
should be enhanced unconscious trials

2327
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,360
and it should disinhibit granular layers

2328
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,480
in the relevant sensory

2329
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,960
population sensory cortex that's a very

2330
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,159
specific prediction that falls out of

2331
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:55,040
the process theory

2332
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,920
that that can be tested with dcm and

2333
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,600
then consistent expectate expectation

2334
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:00,080
again

2335
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,280
consistent expectations should

2336
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:02,880
disinhibit granule layers and sensory

2337
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:03,840
cortices

2338
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,520
while inconsistent price should inhibit

2339
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,600
them

2340
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,679
okay so any questions at this point

2341
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:13,679
christopher thanks for this awesome

2342
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:14,960
presentation

2343
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,440
do any of the panelists um maybe want to

2344
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:18,480
queue up a question

2345
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,159
how about you do this last slide with a

2346
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:22,159
bat leave on that sort of

2347
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:23,520
phenomenological

2348
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,120
no if you want to otherwise we can

2349
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,639
return to the panel

2350
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:28,719
yeah perfect yep sounds good so all the

2351
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:30,639
panel prepare a question or a thought

2352
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:31,600
and then raise your hand when you're

2353
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,239
ready

2354
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:33,600
and give a last thought here thanks

2355
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,600
christopher okay so

2356
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,440
just like a brief aside on phenomenal

2357
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,520
consciousness so

2358
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:42,080
we associate that so i'll just back up a

2359
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:42,880
little bit sorry

2360
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,120
there might be a puzzle in that we

2361
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,880
associate global broadcast and the

2362
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,480
availability of information for report

2363
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,800
with this second template deep level

2364
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,800
our experience although it's kind of

2365
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,040
like there is a depth to it

2366
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,760
in the sense that experience is kind of

2367
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,120
smeared over time

2368
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,520
right there is an integration window

2369
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:04,000
that's relevant for experience

2370
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,840
it certainly isn't doesn't occur at the

2371
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,320
level of whole sequences

2372
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,320
and so there's a puzzle here so where

2373
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,080
does experience live as it were or where

2374
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,080
is the content of experience

2375
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:16,880
and kind of brian i've been chatting

2376
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,080
about this and this is the view is still

2377
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,480
evolving but broadly speaking

2378
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:25,040
i think what's right about this or what

2379
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,719
what we should say is that the first

2380
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:28,480
level states

2381
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,080
that what's what the content that we are

2382
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:32,880
conscious of are the first level states

2383
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:36,080
that have a high enough precision

2384
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,159
um either through kind of bottom-up

2385
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:39,600
precision or because there's a really

2386
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,520
precise prior that comes down from the

2387
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,840
second level a matrix

2388
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,080
um so basically the message that's being

2389
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,920
passed back up to the second level

2390
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:51,440
has a high enough precision to influence

2391
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,199
policy selection or to pass the

2392
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:56,000
threshold the posterior belief threshold

2393
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,960
for conscious access and report and so

2394
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,560
this kind of has the nice consequence

2395
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,400
that it keeps experience at the relevant

2396
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:02,880
level

2397
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,960
so it's updated at each time step when

2398
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,239
we get new stimulus in

2399
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:08,960
stimuli in and yet it has a distinct

2400
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:09,440
kind of

2401
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:15,199
link to report and behavior

2402
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,239
yeah so i mean just to expand on

2403
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:19,679
expanding that a little bit i mean the

2404
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:21,520
kind of idea is just that

2405
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,840
as opposed to and again chris partially

2406
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,760
said this but just kind of reiterate

2407
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,960
um the idea is that um

2408
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:32,400
what you consciously experience um

2409
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:35,040
is is a consequence of both the

2410
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,679
posterior states at the first level

2411
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,000
and whatever the second level likelihood

2412
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,840
is right so it's a function of both the

2413
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:42,880
posterior there

2414
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:47,120
s1 and what the structure is of a2

2415
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:50,400
there and you know way to think about

2416
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,280
that is

2417
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:54,080
if you were to rearrange a2 so the

2418
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,840
mapping was different

2419
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:59,920
um and s1 had the same posterior

2420
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:02,000
then that would update the beliefs at

2421
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,880
level two in a different way

2422
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:08,000
right so you know if i arrange a2 one

2423
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:08,719
way

2424
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:11,679
even though s1 there is still sensitive

2425
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:13,360
to the same stimulus

2426
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:16,239
um then if i rearrange a2 one way then

2427
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:18,159
the posterior at s1

2428
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:21,920
is going to lead to um awareness

2429
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:24,719
of one thing whereas if a2 is set up a

2430
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:26,000
different way

2431
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,679
then the second level will gain

2432
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:29,679
awareness of a different thing

2433
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:31,679
right so so in some way the phenomenal

2434
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:34,080
content that you become aware of

2435
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,719
depends on the nature of this link

2436
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:37,520
between

2437
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,000
what messages the way that the messages

2438
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,920
at the second level are kind of decoded

2439
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:44,080
in a sense right what the second level

2440
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,600
takes to be the meaning

2441
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,280
of the messages that get passed off from

2442
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:48,639
the first level

2443
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:51,920
um so so this kind of nice thing like

2444
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,120
chris mentioned where

2445
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:56,800
it's the updates um that the first level

2446
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,480
gives to the second level at each time

2447
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,800
point so phenomenology kind of stays

2448
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:04,480
at the temporal scale of experience but

2449
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:07,199
uh phenomenal content still depends on a

2450
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:09,280
certain type of access right it depends

2451
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:09,920
on

2452
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,679
the first level having a specific type

2453
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:15,280
of influence on the second level

2454
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:17,360
brian thanks a lot it's really

2455
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,920
interesting so let's return to the guest

2456
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:20,719
the panel mode

2457
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:23,120
christopher awesome presentation and the

2458
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:24,560
first question is going to be from

2459
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,440
dave and then anyone else can raise

2460
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,600
their hand

2461
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:33,199
so dave go ahead my question is about

2462
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:35,719
possible involvement of the air toss the

2463
01:25:35,719 --> 01:25:37,120
reticulothalamic

2464
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:40,000
activating system either in your data or

2465
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:40,800
the data that

2466
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,600
are uh drawn on neurological data in the

2467
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,239
other

2468
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,560
relevant studies is there any

2469
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:50,159
representation of possible contributions

2470
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:53,440
by the air toss by the midbrain

2471
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,760
and is there any accommodation in your

2472
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:56,639
model

2473
01:25:56,639 --> 01:25:58,480
of something maybe not explicit with the

2474
01:25:58,480 --> 01:25:59,920
air trust but

2475
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,960
uh data uh that

2476
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:06,840
might originate there say the endogenous

2477
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,880
attention

2478
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:12,000
um so

2479
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,199
subcortical structures are really

2480
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:15,199
interesting and as for the reticular

2481
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:16,880
thymic activating system

2482
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,880
i'm curious did you did you get that

2483
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,480
from this book by bernard barz

2484
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,480
so a cognitive theory of consciousness

2485
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:23,520
where he first introduced

2486
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,120
global workspace theory and he has a

2487
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,199
whole chapter devoted to

2488
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:29,280
the reticulophalamic activating system

2489
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,960
oh that's great i will definitely have

2490
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:31,760
to get that no

2491
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:34,560
actually i got that this from uh the

2492
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:34,960
work

2493
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:38,000
that uh yak punk sepp and uh mark

2494
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,840
solms did especially the 2013

2495
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:45,679
thesis of the the conscious id

2496
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:47,120
he is of course a very close

2497
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,360
collaborator with carl frist and he just

2498
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:50,480
brought out

2499
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:53,840
a full-length book on

2500
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:57,600
the conscious id especially as

2501
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,520
um active inference interacts with that

2502
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:04,080
so so my my actual main focus of

2503
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:04,880
research is

2504
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,480
on um emotions um you know so applying

2505
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,320
computational models to emotions

2506
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,120
and um i'll just say that i am i have

2507
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:13,840
very strong

2508
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:16,639
disagreements with the um the kind of

2509
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:18,800
theory proposed by jack and mark

2510
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,480
we actually published kind of a joint

2511
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,639
like on paper debate

2512
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:25,440
where me and um a colleague richard lane

2513
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,000
kind of

2514
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,920
debated back and forth with jack and

2515
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:30,239
mark about the right way to think

2516
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:32,719
of um the way consciousness works and

2517
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:33,679
i'll just say that

2518
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:35,600
you know their view places this really

2519
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:36,880
strong role of

2520
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,120
affect where they they more or less say

2521
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:40,800
that these midbrain

2522
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,920
you know structures um like the pag

2523
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:47,840
right the um

2524
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,639
gray um send these afferent signals up

2525
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:51,920
to kind of activate the rest of the

2526
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,199
brain and that somehow

2527
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:55,440
permeates it with this kind of necessary

2528
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:56,480
emotion

2529
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:00,159
um and that's kind of primary um whereas

2530
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:02,880
whereas kind of the way that um the way

2531
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:03,600
that we've

2532
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,840
the kind of structure of the sort of

2533
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,440
thing that we've defended is just that

2534
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:07,760
no

2535
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,800
like the global broadcasting ish kind of

2536
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:11,679
thing

2537
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:14,159
applies to all types of information

2538
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:16,080
right so if you have a representation

2539
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:18,080
of your beliefs about your emotional

2540
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:20,480
state that has to be attended to

2541
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,239
and sort of sent into the workspace just

2542
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:23,840
like any other stimulus

2543
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,960
for you to become aware of it um and so

2544
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,159
i mean these sorts of midbrain

2545
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:29,679
structures they do a lot of really

2546
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,520
interesting like interreceptive and

2547
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,679
visceral regulation processes

2548
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:35,600
um and you know they do have this sort

2549
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:36,960
of general

2550
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,800
like upward modulation rule while they

2551
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,080
well they kind of

2552
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,440
you know my view is they kind of keep

2553
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,520
the cortex in general

2554
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:47,040
in a state where it's capable of of

2555
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,800
representing things being sensitive to

2556
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,719
simulate holding different states active

2557
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:53,199
and other states not so it it

2558
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:55,040
essentially it allows things to be

2559
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:55,840
represented

2560
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,760
in general and then to become

2561
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,360
consciously accessible

2562
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:02,560
um but you know with respect to um

2563
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:05,199
the way that kind of emotions feed in

2564
01:29:05,199 --> 01:29:06,320
and whether the uh

2565
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:07,679
the midbrain structures actually

2566
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:10,320
contribute content in and of themselves

2567
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:11,840
we just have theoretical disagreements

2568
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,360
about that can i

2569
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:17,280
also briefly follow up on that so

2570
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,920
the contrast the reason i think that

2571
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:22,639
fronto-parietal regions in cortex

2572
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:25,679
are so important is because

2573
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:29,120
there are a huge just amount of

2574
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,760
empirical literature now in neuroimaging

2575
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:32,320
and

2576
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:35,600
also very recently data from kind of

2577
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,280
invasive neurophysiology

2578
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,800
in monkeys and most recently in mice

2579
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,880
showing that yes when there is this

2580
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,400
contrast between

2581
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,719
conscious versus unconscious these are

2582
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:49,199
the things that differentially modulated

2583
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:52,159
now you can't there are some very

2584
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:54,000
impressive

2585
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,560
findings very recently coming from

2586
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,080
matthew larkham's group

2587
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:01,600
showing basically that you can wake

2588
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,920
creatures up from general anesthesia

2589
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:06,560
by stimulating the medial dorsal nucleus

2590
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:07,600
and the thalamus

2591
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,159
and there are these crucial connect like

2592
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:11,920
reciprocal connections between layer

2593
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,679
five of the cortex

2594
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:16,719
and the medial dorso and the thalamus

2595
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:20,159
and when those goes out basically uh

2596
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:20,719
general

2597
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:23,120
they go out under general anesthesia and

2598
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,400
when you are awake

2599
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,400
or when like whiskers are stimulated in

2600
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:27,600
barrel cortex

2601
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,520
when they report see when the mouse kind

2602
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,040
of reports as in it says its whiskers

2603
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,159
were stimulated

2604
01:30:32,159 --> 01:30:34,800
this circuit goes off essentially so i

2605
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,960
think the thalamus is crucial

2606
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,920
but uh kind of allah dehaan and every

2607
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:40,639
everyone else

2608
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:43,040
i think the reticulophamic activating

2609
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,320
system and all those sort of cortical

2610
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:45,120
structures

2611
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:48,080
these are background conditions similar

2612
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:49,760
to what ryan said it puts the cortex in

2613
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:50,960
kind of the state where it could be

2614
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:53,120
aware of something

2615
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,760
but the actual contrast between

2616
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:57,360
something being broadcast or

2617
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:59,679
broadcast first not broadcast or being

2618
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:01,040
reported but not reported

2619
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,760
does not rely on those structures um and

2620
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,120
i would just want to see

2621
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:08,639
from those authors i i would actually

2622
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:09,840
just want to see them engage with

2623
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:10,800
something like

2624
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,560
the visual awareness literature and show

2625
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,840
that those structures are differentially

2626
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:17,840
involved

2627
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:21,280
thanks for that uh steven go for it and

2628
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,080
then dean

2629
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,840
blue oh actually then scott then dean or

2630
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,120
blue if you want but stephen with a

2631
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:25,600
question

2632
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:28,159
then scott

2633
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:32,719
yes so thanks um just a question

2634
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:35,120
you you just to be clear so effectively

2635
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,239
you

2636
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:39,760
you tagged the degree in prediction

2637
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:43,920
confidence and that mapped against the

2638
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,679
the data that's empirical

2639
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:48,719
if i'm writing understanding so you like

2640
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:49,280
as

2641
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,800
the model showed a difference in

2642
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,320
confidence that was

2643
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:56,080
showing a correlation to how firing

2644
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:56,960
happens

2645
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:00,560
and i'll just be curious to know if

2646
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:03,600
um you think that this this sort of

2647
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,320
key level or something where this firing

2648
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:07,760
or deductive

2649
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:10,880
piece can happen um where there's this

2650
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:11,360
is that

2651
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,440
where there's a shift between and maybe

2652
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,560
a more

2653
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:17,840
markovian ergodic process to something

2654
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:20,960
more semi-markovian um

2655
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:23,679
and less ergodic and you so that an

2656
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:25,520
organism can make

2657
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,080
non-ergodic choices in conscious

2658
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:29,360
awareness

2659
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:31,440
uh so i mean a couple of things so i'm

2660
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,840
not sure about the ergodicity comment so

2661
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,960
i think you can probably have i'm not

2662
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,960
sure how semi-markovian systems relate

2663
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,000
to ergodicity i

2664
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:40,960
assume that you can have a

2665
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,360
semi-markovian system in a

2666
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:45,840
godix system that doesn't like that

2667
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:46,400
wouldn't

2668
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:49,840
surprise me um yeah so basically when

2669
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,360
you move from uh

2670
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:53,040
i just don't know actually just to flag

2671
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:54,880
that but if you

2672
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,960
i'm not particularly up on a lot of the

2673
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,960
physics cisco physics that relates to

2674
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,840
how these models work

2675
01:33:02,530 --> 01:33:03,760
[Applause]

2676
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:06,639
but yes when you move from a first level

2677
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:08,400
model to a second level model

2678
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:11,199
they are sammy markovian and can you

2679
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:13,040
just maybe define that a little more

2680
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,320
what does that mean to you

2681
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,320
what does that enable and maybe that

2682
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:19,199
will get at what stephen was asking too

2683
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:21,920
um basically the model is no longer just

2684
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:24,719
purely dependent upon the previous state

2685
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:28,080
at the first level of the model um there

2686
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:29,280
is more information

2687
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:30,960
that is determined at the second level

2688
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,960
than what is just goes on at each time

2689
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:34,159
step of the first level

2690
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:38,080
that's basically it uh yeah so i think

2691
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,360
we we have a sentence about this

2692
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:41,520
somewhere yes uh you

2693
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,440
what what the temporally deep scale buys

2694
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,280
you is essentially

2695
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,120
what we were saying before all of those

2696
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:48,719
cognitive actions

2697
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:52,480
that allow you to

2698
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:55,280
do things like construct reports make

2699
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:56,320
plans

2700
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,800
etc etc and kind of abstract away from

2701
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,639
moment by moment sensory flux

2702
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:02,159
all of these things depend upon there

2703
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:04,960
being a second level

2704
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,880
and that might be reflected in the brain

2705
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:08,400
there's some from the ground yeah yeah

2706
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:08,800
yeah

2707
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:12,960
so smooth uh

2708
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:15,679
no it's a great grand depressor granular

2709
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:19,840
cortex is generally speaking like

2710
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,639
so the cortex has six layers roughly

2711
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:23,920
speaking

2712
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:27,040
across and as you kind of move

2713
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:29,600
up or move towards the center of some

2714
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:31,520
centrifugal hierarchy

2715
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:34,159
depending on who you talk to and what

2716
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:36,000
kind of anatomical maps you believe that

2717
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,760
type of thing

2718
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:41,520
layer four of that the granular cortex

2719
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:42,800
which is essentially the input layer

2720
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,239
from the thalamus and the feed forward

2721
01:34:44,239 --> 01:34:45,119
layer

2722
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:46,480
that gets smaller and smaller and

2723
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,239
smaller until when you're at kind of the

2724
01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:49,760
center of this hierarchy or this

2725
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,360
centrifuge

2726
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:53,920
um you essentially have no granular

2727
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:56,080
cortex at all

2728
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:58,560
uh this is kind of ties in lisafeld and

2729
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,960
barrett's done a lot of stuff with this

2730
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:02,320
i have problems with that view to be

2731
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,840
honest they kind of say the top of the

2732
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:04,639
hierarchy

2733
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:10,400
is where they think consciousness lives

2734
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:14,239
i have a rather vehement disagreement in

2735
01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:15,679
that i just think there's absolutely no

2736
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:18,560
evidence that that's true

2737
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,360
in terms of neuroimaging evidence uh the

2738
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,280
areas of the relevant seem to be these

2739
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:24,800
fronto parietal regions

2740
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,520
uh they do have a layer they do have a

2741
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,280
somewhat well-defined layer for

2742
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:32,639
it's not completely a granular it's not

2743
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:33,199
granular

2744
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:36,639
somewhere in between um yeah i don't

2745
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:37,600
know i think they

2746
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:39,360
what one thing to say about i know ryan

2747
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:40,880
has very specific views about this and i

2748
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,159
should say that i really love

2749
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:43,520
lisa from barrett's work i think she's

2750
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:46,800
wrong about this um

2751
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:51,280
i i i just want to go with kind of the

2752
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:52,960
empirical contrasts right

2753
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:55,840
and not speculate too much about very

2754
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,480
specific implementation details

2755
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,880
so look they kind of go from a very

2756
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,960
loose model of kind of predictive coding

2757
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:06,000
and then map it to these like

2758
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,080
cellular uh kind of details about the

2759
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:10,560
structure of neurons um

2760
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,080
i'm more interested in going from these

2761
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:13,679
computational properties

2762
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:15,840
to basically what would measure the

2763
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,199
level of neural imaging because i think

2764
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:18,560
that's what is most tractable

2765
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:19,679
experimentally

2766
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:21,040
and then if we're and there's still a

2767
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,639
lot of debates about that neuroimaging

2768
01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:23,520
level right

2769
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:25,760
if we kind of hammer it out and decide

2770
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:26,639
what's going on

2771
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:29,360
at the neuro imaging level of analysis

2772
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:30,400
then good

2773
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,080
then then we can start having more

2774
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:34,000
serious discussions about

2775
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,920
particular invo involvement particular

2776
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,360
types of cortex but i don't think we're

2777
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:38,560
there yet empirically

2778
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,639
yeah i mean i i would say yeah just to

2779
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:42,239
kind of echo that a little bit

2780
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:44,719
um you know it's it's important to

2781
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:45,360
realize

2782
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:48,800
that um it's not as though

2783
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:51,679
you know the particular sets of you know

2784
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:53,199
little node neurons and synaptic

2785
01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:54,320
connections

2786
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,560
um in the kind of like you know

2787
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:57,920
hypothetical

2788
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:00,159
columns um you know that chris showed

2789
01:37:00,159 --> 01:37:01,679
earlier in terms of the neural process

2790
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:02,639
theory

2791
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:05,040
um that's just kind of one example of a

2792
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,639
way you could set it up

2793
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:08,719
there's there's a very very large number

2794
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:10,080
of ways that you could connect up

2795
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,840
neurons together in different structures

2796
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,119
that would

2797
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:16,880
implement basically the same algorithm

2798
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,119
and in addition to that there are

2799
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:21,199
different message passing algorithms

2800
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:22,719
that you can use

2801
01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:26,000
um to solve the same graphs um

2802
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,560
an active inference isn't defined by

2803
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,159
some particular message passing

2804
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:31,280
algorithm

2805
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:33,440
right like thomas parr has shown this

2806
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,880
you know specifically in a paper where

2807
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:35,760
you can have different neural

2808
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,360
implementations

2809
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:40,400
that require more or less

2810
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:42,560
neuronal resources to implement it's

2811
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,560
kind of a trade-off between

2812
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:47,600
efficiency and accuracy

2813
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,520
where you know for instance like really

2814
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:50,800
really accurate

2815
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:53,440
um message passing algorithms like

2816
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:54,960
belief propagation

2817
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:58,080
they require more neurons to do um but

2818
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:00,239
they're a little more accurate

2819
01:38:00,239 --> 01:38:03,199
and the brain could use that right or

2820
01:38:03,199 --> 01:38:04,800
the brain could use variational message

2821
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:05,920
passing

2822
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,760
which is not quite as good of an

2823
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:09,520
approximation but

2824
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:12,480
requires less resources to do um so the

2825
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:13,920
point being is is that

2826
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:15,520
it's not really that strong of

2827
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:18,080
commitment to that level of kind of

2828
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:19,119
circuit detail

2829
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:20,960
in active inference it's more just a

2830
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:23,040
theory of you can have this pattern of

2831
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:24,719
synaptic connections

2832
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:27,199
that implement the matrices and we

2833
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:28,320
represent

2834
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:31,040
posterior beliefs over states with these

2835
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,800
firing rate functions

2836
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,639
um and then you take the rate of change

2837
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:36,639
in those to put the brps

2838
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:39,280
um but so this is this is kind of the

2839
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,320
the issue with

2840
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:43,199
it doesn't really make sense to me

2841
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:44,080
anyway at this

2842
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:47,199
point against echoing with what said um

2843
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:50,000
to start with hey let's assume that this

2844
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:50,560
one

2845
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:54,000
very specific way of setting up neurons

2846
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:54,639
to do this

2847
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:56,719
is the right one you know let's just

2848
01:38:56,719 --> 01:38:58,080
assume that

2849
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:00,480
and then figure out what must be true

2850
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,280
about

2851
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:03,840
different areas of cortex based on their

2852
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:04,800
uh

2853
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,560
layer based on their cortical column

2854
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:07,920
layer structure

2855
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:11,440
um so so then it's definitely

2856
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:12,719
i mean it's super interesting and

2857
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:14,719
probably has um

2858
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:16,400
you know a really meaningful interesting

2859
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:18,239
mapping between the differences between

2860
01:39:18,239 --> 01:39:18,960
granular and

2861
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:21,440
granular and a granular cortices um with

2862
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:23,679
respect to computational function

2863
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:26,239
um but um but again you know like i

2864
01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:27,199
don't think

2865
01:39:27,199 --> 01:39:29,440
um until we've really nailed down that

2866
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:31,600
there is this one particular circuit

2867
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:32,880
implementation

2868
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:35,040
um it doesn't really make sense um in my

2869
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,719
opinion anyway to kind of infer from

2870
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:37,840
that direction

2871
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:40,880
um to function um

2872
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:43,040
so i should say yeah just to kind of

2873
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:44,960
echo that i think

2874
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:46,320
if you work in your imaging it doesn't

2875
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,800
make sense if you worked in mouse

2876
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:51,280
as a in a mouse uh model and you were

2877
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:52,480
literally testing

2878
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:55,360
hypotheses at the circuit level then it

2879
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,040
would make sense something to do

2880
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,199
but well right but in that case but in

2881
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:00,639
that case you're literally

2882
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:02,719
testing like the predictions of specific

2883
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:04,159
message passing algorithms

2884
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:07,360
yeah exactly so that was kind of testing

2885
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:08,880
that's testing for message passing

2886
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,800
algorithms that's not

2887
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:13,040
assuming a particular one and inferring

2888
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:15,280
from that

2889
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:17,920
so anyway i mean but i mean if you i

2890
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:19,199
mean for people who are interested i

2891
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:19,520
mean

2892
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:22,480
i mean we you know so so i and some pre

2893
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:24,800
a couple previous papers have um

2894
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:27,920
you know kind of built um multi-level

2895
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:29,520
active inference models

2896
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:32,080
similar to this but specifically about

2897
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:34,320
um emotional awareness

2898
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:37,040
um you know the the sort of show how you

2899
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:38,159
can get

2900
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:41,440
um you know from simple kind of um

2901
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,520
lack of awareness of single emotional

2902
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:45,840
states all the way up to being aware of

2903
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,520
feeling multiple emotions at the same

2904
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:49,199
time and being able to report them and

2905
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:50,000
things like that

2906
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,040
that kind of show how a structure not

2907
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:54,719
too different from this one

2908
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:58,800
can can generalize to um to emotions or

2909
01:40:58,800 --> 01:40:59,679
really to

2910
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:03,119
to any other sort of thing that you

2911
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:04,000
could experience

2912
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,560
and be aware of um whether that's coming

2913
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:07,040
from

2914
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:09,199
inferring things about your own kind of

2915
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:10,800
bodily state and its emotional meaning

2916
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,400
from interception or whether it's

2917
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,480
something like vision

2918
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:17,440
so i mean we we haven't covered that

2919
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,080
stuff in

2920
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,920
any of these sorts of things before but

2921
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:22,080
but um that stuff is also out there um

2922
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:22,800
that might

2923
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:24,960
kind of help at least show what kind of

2924
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:27,040
the view on our end is about how active

2925
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,320
inference can

2926
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:32,239
uh account for um emotional phenomena

2927
01:41:32,239 --> 01:41:34,320
and be consistent with

2928
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,080
the current literature on emotional

2929
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,159
awareness as well

2930
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:40,560
thanks for these awesome answers scott

2931
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,000
with a question and then i'll ask one

2932
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,679
from the chat and then dean or blue

2933
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:47,840
or someone else

2934
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:54,560
there we go um thanks great and

2935
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,239
fascinating presentation

2936
01:41:56,239 --> 01:41:59,360
i was wondering this book

2937
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:02,880
the intelligent movement machine

2938
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:07,679
yeah and um it's it it talks generally

2939
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:08,320
about the

2940
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:11,440
um cortical mapping being predicted

2941
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,920
by the movement repertoire in the motor

2942
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:16,159
cortex and kind of that embodiment

2943
01:42:16,159 --> 01:42:17,600
kind of element one of the things i

2944
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,280
wanted to ask about the reason

2945
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:20,880
i think it follows from that this most

2946
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:23,600
immediate prior part of the conversation

2947
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:26,840
is when we have an active inference

2948
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:30,080
setting and that model

2949
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:33,199
is being employed for multiple

2950
01:42:33,199 --> 01:42:36,080
um perception and i won't use the

2951
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:36,800
phrasing

2952
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,199
right because my active inference terms

2953
01:42:39,199 --> 01:42:41,679
aren't all up to stuff but

2954
01:42:41,679 --> 01:42:44,960
when the inputs into the

2955
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:47,440
individual who's performing the active

2956
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:48,960
inference that system

2957
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:52,239
are from various

2958
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:55,760
sensory inputs and various temporal

2959
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:56,400
distance

2960
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:58,880
so there's several inputs and then

2961
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:00,480
they're being synthesized

2962
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:05,679
into a an action or a

2963
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:07,280
an externality something's going to

2964
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:09,119
reach out and again my apologies for not

2965
01:43:09,119 --> 01:43:12,159
internalizing all the definitionals um

2966
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:14,320
what is what are some of the cortical

2967
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:16,320
mappings or have you found cortical

2968
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:18,239
mappings that embody

2969
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:21,119
that process of synthesizing multiple

2970
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:22,239
inputs

2971
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:25,920
into a single action what are the core

2972
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:28,400
what are the structural correlates of

2973
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:30,639
the process of synthesis

2974
01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:32,560
of multiple different strands of active

2975
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:35,440
inference into a single

2976
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:37,760
action potential again i'm using the

2977
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:38,560
wrong words but

2978
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:40,880
nice questions this is a question

2979
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:43,520
essentially about multimodal integration

2980
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:46,960
yes so yeah yeah um so i guess

2981
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,560
i i think active inference is probably

2982
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:51,600
you might be able to build a specific

2983
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:52,800
so i think there are two parts this

2984
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,239
question that's an interesting question

2985
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:54,960
um

2986
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,400
first part is i'll just kind of answer

2987
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:58,000
the active inference end of it

2988
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,159
uh the way i think about active

2989
01:44:00,159 --> 01:44:01,679
inference at least is just as a really

2990
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:02,639
useful modeling

2991
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:04,800
and mathematical framework and i think

2992
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,639
it's possible to build multiple active

2993
01:44:06,639 --> 01:44:07,520
inference models

2994
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:10,639
of any phenomena so

2995
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:12,320
i would want to hammer out an empirical

2996
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:13,760
paradigm

2997
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:16,880
um and then figure out okay what models

2998
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:18,000
could

2999
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,080
i build of this so that's kind of the

3000
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:21,280
first part the second part is about

3001
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:22,880
multi-modal integration are there kind

3002
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:23,280
of

3003
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:26,080
places that house moji mode i haven't

3004
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:27,520
looked at modi modal integration

3005
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:29,760
from since i was an undergrad i'm just

3006
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:32,480
trying to remember like my

3007
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:34,480
third year cog neuro courses i think

3008
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:35,920
there are places in like posterior

3009
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:37,520
parietal cortex

3010
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:41,440
where there is integration between

3011
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:42,719
multiple modal like v

3012
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:44,320
you might say like vision and one other

3013
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,320
thing or whatever it is and then that

3014
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:47,760
gets shot off to motor cortex

3015
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:50,719
implemented in actions um so i don't

3016
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:52,159
know i think you i would just say look

3017
01:44:52,159 --> 01:44:53,760
at the motor planning literature

3018
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:57,119
um there's lots of stuff about

3019
01:44:57,119 --> 01:45:01,360
uh bayesian um visual motor integration

3020
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,520
and one and just follow up one of the

3021
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:04,400
things that

3022
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:06,639
that leads to is i was wondering about

3023
01:45:06,639 --> 01:45:09,520
the situated cognition opportunities for

3024
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:11,360
those syntheses

3025
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:14,159
so for instance you have um hysteresis

3026
01:45:14,159 --> 01:45:16,639
or my son used to say stereotypes are

3027
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:17,760
real time saver

3028
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:20,560
he said it as a joke right so the idea

3029
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:22,080
is you have externalities that

3030
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:24,000
facilitate the synthesis

3031
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,440
so they're actually not cortical

3032
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,600
structures they're social and

3033
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:30,719
linguistic and rhetorical structures

3034
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:33,679
right i mean is that could those what

3035
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:35,040
i'm where i'm exploring is could those

3036
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:36,239
be described

3037
01:45:36,239 --> 01:45:38,080
with some of the same models as the

3038
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:39,520
cortical structures

3039
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:42,000
so you're actually able to have a scale

3040
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:42,960
independent

3041
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:45,679
description of the processes both in a

3042
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:47,760
social and a cortical

3043
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:51,600
cognitive context for the synthesis

3044
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:55,199
of multiple multimodal inputs

3045
01:45:55,199 --> 01:45:56,320
so i'm not sure about the scale

3046
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:58,239
independent part yeah

3047
01:45:58,239 --> 01:46:00,639
yeah i i i hear what you're you know

3048
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:02,320
scott it's a it's a beautiful question i

3049
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:03,360
see where you're coming from because

3050
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:05,040
we've been talking about the scale-free

3051
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:06,080
formulisms

3052
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:08,239
with crisp fields and others and then

3053
01:46:08,239 --> 01:46:10,000
this whole nested markov blankets like

3054
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,440
you could have the neuron

3055
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:13,040
and then the neural you could go within

3056
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:14,719
a model and just like you said

3057
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:16,320
um your model doesn't presuppose that

3058
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:18,080
awareness is actually at a higher level

3059
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:19,920
you're just saying there is a structure

3060
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,280
that's deep temporal structure and

3061
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:22,880
that's the state that's the timeline

3062
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:23,840
that you are at but

3063
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:25,679
there could be another level and then

3064
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:27,760
mechanistically or functionally how that

3065
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:28,639
level plays out

3066
01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:31,840
is going to come back to a task specific

3067
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:34,800
measurement which is and a plurality of

3068
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:35,520
models

3069
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:38,239
so still good points i mean part of part

3070
01:46:38,239 --> 01:46:40,080
of i mean i think you know timing to go

3071
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:41,840
back to i mean there's lots of like nice

3072
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,520
opportunities right to build active

3073
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:45,119
inference models would be very simple

3074
01:46:45,119 --> 01:46:47,119
you know for like multiple multi-modal

3075
01:46:47,119 --> 01:46:48,639
or a cross modal

3076
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:50,480
right integration task you know like for

3077
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:52,719
instance like um i haven't seen this

3078
01:46:52,719 --> 01:46:55,840
done um but maybe i have to look back

3079
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:57,199
but things like the double flash

3080
01:46:57,199 --> 01:46:59,280
illusion or the rubber hand illusion

3081
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:01,760
or you know any any of these kinds of

3082
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:03,520
yeah multi-modal things i mean like the

3083
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:05,199
like the double flash illusion is really

3084
01:47:05,199 --> 01:47:06,719
nice right because

3085
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:08,159
i mean more or less for people who are

3086
01:47:08,159 --> 01:47:09,760
familiar um

3087
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:12,960
you either play one or two tones

3088
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:15,040
and they are coincident with a single

3089
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:16,639
flash of light

3090
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:20,080
um and it just turns out that when you

3091
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:20,560
play

3092
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:22,800
two tones really quick then people

3093
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:24,880
perceived two flashes of light when

3094
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:26,800
there was really only one

3095
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:29,440
um and the reason for that is so there's

3096
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:30,880
just this kind of like friar

3097
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:34,560
in the mix presumably that coincident

3098
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:36,239
you know things that are coincident

3099
01:47:36,239 --> 01:47:39,920
temporarily have the same hidden cause

3100
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:42,480
but also at the same time um the

3101
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:44,159
temporal resolution

3102
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:47,280
of audition is just better um

3103
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:49,520
this is more trustable than the temporal

3104
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:51,280
resolution of vision

3105
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:54,560
um so so you can just say look like the

3106
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:55,360
system

3107
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:58,159
just trusts right it has beliefs that

3108
01:47:58,159 --> 01:48:00,639
the auditory system has higher precision

3109
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:02,239
and that there's a high probability of

3110
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:03,840
common causes of coincident

3111
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:06,239
input therefore there must have been two

3112
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:07,119
flashes

3113
01:48:07,119 --> 01:48:09,920
um given that there was two tones um you

3114
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:10,159
know

3115
01:48:10,159 --> 01:48:12,080
i mean that's just one example of like a

3116
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:14,639
really simple well-known empirical task

3117
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:17,600
of cross-modal integration that would be

3118
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:18,159
pretty

3119
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:20,400
easy i mean probably without a lot of

3120
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:22,560
without even a ton of tweaks to

3121
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:24,320
the kind of structure of the model um

3122
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:26,159
that we're using here you could um do

3123
01:48:26,159 --> 01:48:26,639
and

3124
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:28,080
all you'd really have to do probably is

3125
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:29,920
just assign the right precisions right

3126
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:32,000
to the auditory and visual input where

3127
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,440
those are jointly

3128
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:36,480
um generated by the same um

3129
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,960
hidden cause or hidden state in the

3130
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:39,840
model

3131
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:42,159
um and so basically it's either you're

3132
01:48:42,159 --> 01:48:43,360
just inferring one cause

3133
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:45,199
two causes and that either generates

3134
01:48:45,199 --> 01:48:47,679
receiving one flash or two flashes

3135
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:49,679
um i mean anyway it would be it would be

3136
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:50,800
simple to do

3137
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:54,159
um and uh i guess that i don't know if i

3138
01:48:54,159 --> 01:48:54,880
don't

3139
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:56,719
not aware of that having been done in

3140
01:48:56,719 --> 01:48:58,800
the kind of formal active inference mdp

3141
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,719
literature but um

3142
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:02,880
you know i mean there are known right

3143
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:05,199
like neural correlates of this stuff and

3144
01:49:05,199 --> 01:49:06,560
you know they're in part where you'd

3145
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:08,320
expect them to be right they're at like

3146
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:09,199
the borders

3147
01:49:09,199 --> 01:49:10,800
right of like auditory and visual

3148
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:13,599
processing and like association cortex

3149
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:17,280
um like posterior association cortex um

3150
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:19,280
and uh you know it'd be really really

3151
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:21,280
really cool project right to try to

3152
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:23,119
build a model of something like that and

3153
01:49:23,119 --> 01:49:24,239
then

3154
01:49:24,239 --> 01:49:27,280
just see right whether the predicted

3155
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:30,560
uh neural time courses um actually

3156
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:30,960
better

3157
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:33,840
kind of single out right the the areas

3158
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:35,520
uh the association areas where

3159
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:38,159
the kind of borders division it seems

3160
01:49:38,159 --> 01:49:38,800
like it's

3161
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:41,760
it's almost like a situated synesthesia

3162
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,440
where you have the gabor square where

3163
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:45,440
you have the frequency and time variance

3164
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,119
but it's being one of the variants is

3165
01:49:47,119 --> 01:49:49,520
being hijacked by another perception

3166
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:52,400
in the visual field right you know so

3167
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:52,800
the

3168
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:56,080
your your it that you it's crossing over

3169
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:58,080
to that other sense it's very

3170
01:49:58,080 --> 01:49:59,760
interesting thank you thanks

3171
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:01,199
um i'm gonna ask a question from the

3172
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:02,719
chat and then if anyone wants to give

3173
01:50:02,719 --> 01:50:04,159
probably a short final note but then

3174
01:50:04,159 --> 01:50:04,639
we'll

3175
01:50:04,639 --> 01:50:06,320
end around the hour so that we can have

3176
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:08,560
a whole second discussion next week

3177
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:10,400
the question the chat is um to the

3178
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:11,840
authors what would you say the main

3179
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:13,520
limitations of the model

3180
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:15,520
are or where are some next things you're

3181
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:16,639
building on but what are the main

3182
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:18,000
limitations of the current model and

3183
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,199
then how are you going to be building

3184
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:24,400
so i mean there's lots right uh

3185
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:27,440
so i'll just list them i think we list

3186
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:29,360
this in the paper somewhere too

3187
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:33,040
um for starters it's a discrete model

3188
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:34,719
we treat the whole visual system as

3189
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:37,199
basically like one discrete hidden state

3190
01:50:37,199 --> 01:50:38,880
to be inferred by the high level that's

3191
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:42,080
obviously like not true

3192
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:43,760
but it's a good enough approximation to

3193
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:45,040
actually think reproduce a bunch of

3194
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:46,560
findings

3195
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:48,080
it would be nice to have a multi-level

3196
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:49,599
model

3197
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:51,199
now with that multi-level model i think

3198
01:50:51,199 --> 01:50:52,800
there are some empirical cases there's

3199
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:54,080
this thing called the partial awareness

3200
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:56,480
hypothesis

3201
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:59,679
by sid cuda where they talk about having

3202
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:00,239
partial

3203
01:51:00,239 --> 01:51:02,400
access or the global workspace having

3204
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:03,360
partial

3205
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:04,719
access to different parts of the

3206
01:51:04,719 --> 01:51:06,880
hierarchy and that giving rise to kind

3207
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:07,760
of

3208
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:10,000
odd experiences so you might have

3209
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,040
something like you might have

3210
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:13,840
really good access to the fact that uh

3211
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,599
the color of ryan's shirt

3212
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:17,280
but not to the fact that it's a shirt or

3213
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:18,840
vice versa

3214
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:21,920
um so that would be nice i'm not sure

3215
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:23,119
quite how to do that in

3216
01:51:23,119 --> 01:51:25,679
a hidden kind of hidden markov model

3217
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:26,960
situation

3218
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:28,880
um but that would be nice second thing

3219
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,159
is

3220
01:51:30,159 --> 01:51:32,480
um we really just model kind of report

3221
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:34,080
paradigms here so where where we're

3222
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:35,280
going with this is we're

3223
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,119
trying to extend this explicitly to

3224
01:51:37,119 --> 01:51:38,960
model some no report paradigms and

3225
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:40,800
actually casting kind of

3226
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:43,520
thinking about that in a more precise

3227
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:44,159
way

3228
01:51:44,159 --> 01:51:46,159
and so we've actually built another

3229
01:51:46,159 --> 01:51:47,760
model and we're kind of writing it up at

3230
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:48,800
the moment um

3231
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:51,119
i mean it's not it's kind of a side

3232
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:51,920
project

3233
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:53,440
because it's not a part of my phd thesis

3234
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:55,119
but

3235
01:51:55,119 --> 01:51:58,000
the idea is roughly speaking to actually

3236
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:58,960
have a model that

3237
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:00,880
is able to explain a lot of the weird

3238
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:03,199
findings in the no report literature

3239
01:52:03,199 --> 01:52:04,719
and also i think we have a much more

3240
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:07,199
principled we now have a much more

3241
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:08,320
principled

3242
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:11,679
account of report that i'm really quite

3243
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:12,800
excited about

3244
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:15,520
um then just like i guess on a last

3245
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:16,159
limitation

3246
01:52:16,159 --> 01:52:19,760
would just be uh and this isn't really a

3247
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:21,760
limitation because ryan has got

3248
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:23,280
a lot of work in emotion and

3249
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:24,960
interception on this and you know that's

3250
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:26,400
somewhere that his lab is like really

3251
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:27,199
pushing

3252
01:52:27,199 --> 01:52:29,920
um but it would just be nice if we could

3253
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:32,000
use these very similar architectures and

3254
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:32,480
apply

3255
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:34,320
them to something like intraoceptive

3256
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:36,320
awareness

3257
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:38,000
and i would be i would find it

3258
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,320
personally very compelling if you had

3259
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,800
one i think it's too demanding to have

3260
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:43,679
one model

3261
01:52:43,679 --> 01:52:46,159
but one mod very general model structure

3262
01:52:46,159 --> 01:52:47,280
that generalizes

3263
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:49,760
across visual consciousness to

3264
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:51,760
intraceptive awareness to like auditory

3265
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:52,480
awareness

3266
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:54,719
to smarter sensory awareness that would

3267
01:52:54,719 --> 01:52:57,360
be really nice

3268
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:59,760
awesome answer ryan do you want to add

3269
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:01,840
anything and then we'll have any final

3270
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:03,760
comments

3271
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:05,520
um you know i mean i think i think chris

3272
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:06,800
covered most of the

3273
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:09,679
the kinds of limitations or i mean i

3274
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:11,360
don't know i mean i would just say

3275
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:13,360
like like yes i mean it would be it

3276
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:14,800
would definitely be nice to

3277
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,800
do something like have a so they're what

3278
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,400
are called mixed models

3279
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:20,960
um where you have kind of a discreet

3280
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:22,560
model like ours on the top

3281
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:26,800
but then the um the kind of posteriors

3282
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:29,280
some predictions downward that

3283
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:31,040
essentially set set points

3284
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:34,480
for a continuous level below it um so so

3285
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:35,760
then you can have a continuous state

3286
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:36,800
space where

3287
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:38,560
where for instance you know it's a lot

3288
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:40,880
more plausible right to think that

3289
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:43,679
um these sorts of inferences that are

3290
01:53:43,679 --> 01:53:45,360
being made in kind of like

3291
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:48,239
early visual processing or on a you know

3292
01:53:48,239 --> 01:53:49,440
on a continuous

3293
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:51,199
continuous state space rate it doesn't

3294
01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:53,679
have to be like motion speed 1 motion

3295
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:54,159
speed

3296
01:53:54,159 --> 01:53:56,800
2 right it can be it can be continuous

3297
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:57,840
values

3298
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:00,880
and for for things like that um

3299
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:02,719
but um like another thing that i you

3300
01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:04,080
know i mean you know perspective

3301
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:05,440
interception and

3302
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:07,520
emotion i mean that's something like i

3303
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:08,960
said i mean we have empirical paradigms

3304
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:10,080
that we've been setting up to

3305
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:12,800
to test just this kind of thing in uh in

3306
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:14,239
interception

3307
01:54:14,239 --> 01:54:16,159
um and we have a we have a paper under

3308
01:54:16,159 --> 01:54:17,440
review right now where we apply a

3309
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:19,520
computational model to um

3310
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,920
interreceptive uh perception and like a

3311
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:24,880
gastrointestinal interception task

3312
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:27,040
that's not a multi-level model at the

3313
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:28,400
moment um

3314
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:31,679
and that paradigm doesn't have

3315
01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:33,920
um probably doesn't have enough trials

3316
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:34,960
to do contrast

3317
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:38,639
between um conscious versus unconscious

3318
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:40,560
um stimulations but we're kind of

3319
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:42,159
working on that

3320
01:54:42,159 --> 01:54:44,639
um so that would be nice um another

3321
01:54:44,639 --> 01:54:45,599
thing

3322
01:54:45,599 --> 01:54:47,119
that um you know chris kind of mentioned

3323
01:54:47,119 --> 01:54:48,639
the example of like being aware that

3324
01:54:48,639 --> 01:54:50,480
shirt is red but not a shirt

3325
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:52,320
right that kind of thing also is really

3326
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:53,840
important for modeling emotional

3327
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:55,440
awareness because

3328
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:57,760
um a lot of times right people might

3329
01:54:57,760 --> 01:54:59,760
feel right some kind of bodily

3330
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:01,760
sensations you know kind of like a

3331
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,920
pit in their stomach or like fast heart

3332
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:05,360
rate or something like that right they

3333
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:06,880
might be conscious of that

3334
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:10,400
but not infer one step above um

3335
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:12,639
and be conscious of the fact that that's

3336
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:14,000
associated say with like

3337
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,960
feeling fear right like like uh people

3338
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:18,800
with like panic disorder for example

3339
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:20,080
right they might

3340
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:22,400
feel like a strong heartbeat but they

3341
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:24,320
might instead infer oh that means i'm

3342
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:25,199
having a panic

3343
01:55:25,199 --> 01:55:26,800
attack or something like that or they

3344
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:29,199
might infer oh i'm having a heart attack

3345
01:55:29,199 --> 01:55:30,840
right so there are different kind of

3346
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:32,719
conceptualizations that you can you can

3347
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:33,280
infer

3348
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:35,520
from right patterns in lower level

3349
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:37,119
interceptive experience

3350
01:55:37,119 --> 01:55:38,719
some of which are emotional and some of

3351
01:55:38,719 --> 01:55:41,040
which are not um

3352
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:43,280
but and this is where it becomes you

3353
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:44,320
know interesting is

3354
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:47,679
that um you might also prime

3355
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:50,960
right an emotion category right like

3356
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:53,040
like i mentioned with the guilt example

3357
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:54,880
right i could prime guilt so that higher

3358
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:56,960
level concept representation

3359
01:55:56,960 --> 01:56:00,560
um is activated but also but does not

3360
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:02,960
enter into awareness right so you can

3361
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:04,239
kind of have multiple levels in a

3362
01:56:04,239 --> 01:56:05,280
hierarchy

3363
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:08,159
where each level can independently or

3364
01:56:08,159 --> 01:56:09,199
compete

3365
01:56:09,199 --> 01:56:12,719
for broadcasting um you know so

3366
01:56:12,719 --> 01:56:13,679
you know i've been thinking about ways

3367
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:15,520
to do this model wise and the the best

3368
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:17,199
thing we've come up with right now just

3369
01:56:17,199 --> 01:56:18,159
in terms of the practical

3370
01:56:18,159 --> 01:56:20,480
implementations we have would be to for

3371
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:23,040
instance like have an intercepted level

3372
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:24,719
um and then have the emotional level

3373
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:27,199
above that but have the interception

3374
01:56:27,199 --> 01:56:28,800
representations also get kind of like

3375
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,639
duplicated and passed up

3376
01:56:30,639 --> 01:56:32,639
to the second level so then they can

3377
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:34,159
also kind of equally compete

3378
01:56:34,159 --> 01:56:36,239
right for access to like a third level

3379
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:37,920
that would be like the the workspace

3380
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:38,800
level

3381
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:40,480
um but anyways i mean these are all

3382
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:42,000
things that are kind of in progress but

3383
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,480
just by way of saying um this additional

3384
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:45,840
limitation is

3385
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:47,599
you can only be in our model you could

3386
01:56:47,599 --> 01:56:49,679
only be conscious and of

3387
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:52,719
conscious or unconscious of one type of

3388
01:56:52,719 --> 01:56:53,520
processing or

3389
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:56,480
love one level of abstraction um which

3390
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:57,360
is

3391
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:59,920
not you know the case in the which is

3392
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:01,599
not the case in the

3393
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:04,480
it's not the true case

3394
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:07,760
thanks a lot for these awesome answers

3395
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:09,760
always a great time with the two of you

3396
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:10,960
on the stream

3397
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:13,599
so just thank all the participants who

3398
01:57:13,599 --> 01:57:14,159
joined us

3399
01:57:14,159 --> 01:57:16,719
live and in the calendar event there's a

3400
01:57:16,719 --> 01:57:18,480
forum so be helpful if you want to add

3401
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:20,239
feedback on the form

3402
01:57:20,239 --> 01:57:23,119
and then we're going to be having 18.2

3403
01:57:23,119 --> 01:57:24,719
next week at the same time it's going to

3404
01:57:24,719 --> 01:57:26,080
be the same paper

3405
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:27,760
so hopefully we'll all get another

3406
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:29,760
chance to reread the paper

3407
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:31,520
listen to this stream because

3408
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:33,199
christopher what you said was really

3409
01:57:33,199 --> 01:57:36,639
deep so again much appreciated to all

3410
01:57:36,639 --> 01:57:39,440
and we'll see everyone next week thanks

3411
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:41,839
guys
