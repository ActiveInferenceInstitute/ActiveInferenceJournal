1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,320
hello and welcome

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,040
to the active inference live stream this

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,040
is the active inference lab and we are

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,679
here in

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,400
active inference live stream 18.2 on

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:18,960
march

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,720
30th 2021 welcome everyone

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,599
to the active inference lab this is a

9
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,840
recorded in an archived live stream so

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,199
please provide us with feedback so that

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,840
we can improve on our work

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,000
sorry the video just changed a little

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,680
bit there we go

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,239
um all backgrounds and perspectives are

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:38,800
welcome

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,040
here and we'll all be following good

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,360
video etiquette for live streams

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,760
today we're here in session 18.2 on

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,879
march 30th

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,879
having the follow-up discussion with the

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,640
authors and other participants

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,559
on this predictive global neuronal

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,480
workspace paper

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,719
and today the goal is really to follow

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,480
up on the last

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,199
week's discussion continue discussing

27
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,520
and learning about this very cool paper

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,400
and why the authors did what they did

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,680
and what are the implications for

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,799
different areas

31
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,040
so today we're just going to go through

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,240
some introductions

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,479
and warm-up questions and then we'll be

34
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,000
able to walk through

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,360
the paper and the slides and ask a few

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,119
questions to the authors and get a few

37
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,040
different perspectives

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,799
so for the introductions we'll just go

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,280
around and introduce ourselves

40
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,200
and then pass it to somebody who hasn't

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,320
spoken yet

42
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,280
i'm daniel i'm a postdoc in california

43
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,400
and i'll pass it to

44
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,799

of co-organizer for active inference lab

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,439
and i pass it to steven

51
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,360
hello i'm stephen i'm based in toronto

and i do a lot of work with social

53
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,960
topographies

54
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,840
and landscapes for social drama

55
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,160
and i will pass it over

56
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,440

um i'm a investigator at the laureate

64
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,959
institute for

65
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,000
brain research i'm in tulsa oklahoma

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,640
um yeah i mainly work on computational

67
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,360
modeling

68
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,480
of uh empirical behavior and different

69
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,599
psychiatric

70
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,400
disorders um as well as some theoretical

71
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,120
work on

72
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,800
emotions and emotional awareness and

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,640
interception

74
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,879
and i guess um i guess i'll send it to

75
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,120
chris

76
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,840
hi i'm christopher white i'm a phd

77
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,480
student

78
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,560
at the university of cambridge in

79
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,959
england um and i mostly work

80
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,440
on active inference or computation using

81
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,720
active inference with computational

82
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,840
models of

83
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,879
cognitive control but

84
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,560
a lot of my previous workers kind of

85
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,280
focused on visual awareness

86
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,720
so i'll pass it to adam

87
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,159
hi uh i'm adam i'm a

88
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,519
post-doc at johns hopkins school of

89
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,400
medicine

90
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,519
um center for uh psychedelic and

91
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,239
consciousness

92
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,519
research i'm also a research fellow at

93
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,280
the kinsey institute

94
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,440
and i'm in consciousness free will too

95
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,360
that everyone cool does anyone want to

96
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,319
raise their hand

97
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,159
and give a thought on one of these

98
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,519
warm-up questions

99
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,360
which are just what are something

100
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,400
they're excited or curious about today

101
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,680
or something that they liked or

102
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,519
remembered about the paper or

103
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,080
last week's discussion to sort of

104
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,360
jumpstart where

105
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,720
we were at um or maybe

106
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,560
really quickly at the beginning

107
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,599
christopher wanted to clear up something

108
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,199
so yeah and then we'll kind of go into

109
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,399
questions so maybe everyone could write

110
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,399
down a question and then christopher go

111
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,680
for it

112
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,080
yeah sure so i said two things that like

113
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,960
just false

114
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,680
um last time i just made mistakes i kind

115
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,120
of wanted to correct them so the first

116
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,560
one i was in specifically referenced

117
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,520
someone asked a question about the

118
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,560
thalamus

119
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,919
and its involvement in consciousness and

120
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,360
i kind of referenced a whole body of

121
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,840
work

122
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,160
from matthew larkham's group and i think

123
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,759
i said the medial dorsal nucleus and

124
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,720
it's not it's

125
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,840
central lateral nucleus and thalamus um

126
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,160
i think like 99 people wouldn't care but

127
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,199
anyone who knows anything about the

128
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,560
thalamus would have been like pained by

129
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,440
that

130
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,840
um and the second thing was i was

131
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,040
talking about king and

132
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,160
hans like uh

133
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,160
bayesian model of conscious access i

134
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,360
think i described the model as

135
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,039
univariate gaussian

136
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,880
that's also not correct it's a

137
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,240
multivariate

138
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,280
um like gaussian although you can

139
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,479
extend the same model um

140
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,720
to a univariate case anyway doesn't

141
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,840
matter

142
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,199
but i just wanted to kind of correct

143
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,840
those two things

144
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,199
thanks for the correction so if everyone

145
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,039
could raise their hand and first

146
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,280
um we'll go with adam and then stephen

147
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,240
um i was uh curious about uh

148
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,639
what chris just just said so like medial

149
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,840
door so that would be

150
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,919
what thalamus for interior singular in

151
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,360
the frontal lobes

152
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,320
kind of like the gateway to um like

153
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,840
amygdala at all

154
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,479
would that be right and then like so the

155
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,759
central ladder like who's that looping

156
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,919
with i forget

157
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,720
i think central lateral would be looping

158
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,199
i was specifically thinking that like a

159
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,360
loop between layer five pyramidal

160
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,319
neurons

161
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,800
and um central lateral thalamus

162
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,840
so if i could ask a question there just

163
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,160
why

164
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,319
are we identifying brain regions or what

165
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,520
would it mean to be

166
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,520
identifying brain regions one way or the

167
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,680
other in humans or some other species

168
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,880
um so this particular body of work

169
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,479
not to go too far on a tangent but

170
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,840
there's this really impressive body of

171
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,160
work that basically has identified

172
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,560
both level of consciousness and content

173
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,360
of consciousness

174
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,120
with burst mode firing in layer five

175
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,720
of cortex i think most of this at most

176
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,479
of this evidence is from a mouse model

177
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,120
though so interpret that as you will

178
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,759
yeah adam or you can use the actual

179
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,160
jitsi bracelet

180
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,680
but yeah go on um i mean for me

181
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,280
um it would partially be

182
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,799
what systems might contribute to

183
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,000
wakefulness or different aspects of

184
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,199
consciousness depending how we want to

185
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,039
carve the joints on it

186
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,639
in different respects so um let's say

187
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,360
uh stimulating the medial dorsal was

188
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,800
like more important

189
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,360
well then that might implicate like the

190
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,880
specific relays

191
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,199
um its ability to form phlegma cortical

192
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,160
loops or

193
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,560
flammable striatal core like the whole

194
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,800
uh

195
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,520
what it helps to bind together

196
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,479
functionally

197
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,680
and other functions uh it would tell you

198
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,720
what processes

199
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,919
might be involved so um maybe action or

200
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,360
salience that might be important or

201
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,240
maybe it's like

202
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,319
frontal lobes as hub but like which part

203
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,280
of the frontal lobes

204
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,840
is it the parts that are like a general

205
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,360
topologically central hub or does it

206
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,479
look kind of like

207
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,319
a motor bits or does it look like

208
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,919
something else so

209
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,280
i'd be trying to look for like fish

210
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,199
around for clues about what's important

211
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,479
in what ways

212
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,599
but it might mean but it's easy to tell

213
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,000
stories

214
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,879
okay cool so stephen and then anyone

215
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,759
else who has a question

216
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,120
so yeah i'm just uh really excited about

217
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,240
the

218
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,960
when i when i listened uh last week you

219
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,240
talked about temperature

220
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
being used in the models and like you

221
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,400
had different places where you used

222
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,680
different amounts of temperature

223
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,520
in i think it's in the soft map function

224
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,199
to to show

225
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,639
um different types of

226
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,799
model scenarios so i'll just be curious

227
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,320
i'm just excited about

228
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,599
maybe um just the general way that you

229
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,719
use your thinking to build the models

230
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,000
to inform how you start to look at

231
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,519
consciousness and the way the brain

232
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,120
works as much as

233
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,920
the way that you find the results from

234
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,800
the models

235
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,279
so that i'd be interested in that those

236
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,360
sort of two sides

237
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,680
so so i mean one one thing i just want

238
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,399
to make sure this

239
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,640
is clear is that you know like

240
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,720
computational neuroscience

241
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,600
borrows or has been historically ended

242
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,800
up borrowing a lot

243
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,880
from um terminology and physics and

244
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,640
engineering and things like that

245
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,000
um you know so there's some of these

246
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,080
sorts of terms that can be a little

247
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,800
um a little funny right so so like

248
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,560
temperature like a temperature parameter

249
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,160
or typically an inverse temperature

250
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,959
parameter

251
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,080
um there's something that's borrowed

252
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,560
from physics that just kind of has to do

253
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,839
within the physics set

254
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,720
in the physics sense kind of how how

255
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,120
much

256
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120
uh you know with how much energy

257
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,480
particles are kind of bouncing around

258
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,320
against each other um

259
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,720
and um you know in a very oversimplified

260
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,760
way of putting it

261
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,320
um but but so it just means essentially

262
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,440
there's more kind of

263
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,320
randomness right in the in the system so

264
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,720
in the context of um

265
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,200
of this um you're just applying that

266
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,240
same equation

267
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,839
to describe essentially the amount of

268
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,160
noise in decision making

269
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,360
so uh a higher temperature in this case

270
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,320
just

271
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,760
is just a parameter in an equation that

272
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,640
controls how deterministic versus

273
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,279
stochastic decision making processes are

274
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,600
so i just want to make sure that it has

275
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,800
i just want to make sure it's clear to

276
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,320
anyone listening that it has nothing to

277
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,640
do

278
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,040
with actual like physical temperature

279
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,560
like being hot or cold it's just a

280
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,760
parameter that

281
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,600
just that kind of modulates how random

282
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,120
decision making is

283
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,079
um so i just wanted to make that make

284
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:26,880
that clear so

285
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,880
in this case it's just it's just

286
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,240
controlling

287
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,839
so so for example if if the temperature

288
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,079
parameter is really low or the inverse

289
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,399
temperature has a really high value

290
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,279
then that just means that say even if

291
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,000
the model was only like 51

292
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,959
versus 49 confident in one thing over

293
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,240
another it would always

294
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,279
choose the action associated with the 51

295
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,160
um whereas if the temperature value

296
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,000
temperature parameter value is high or

297
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,120
is low

298
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,760
um or is high or the inverse temperature

299
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,279
parameter is low

300
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,560
then um that means that the

301
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,360
like for instance uh that with 51 of the

302
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,240
time

303
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,360
it would choose the um

304
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,920
the action associated with 51 percent

305
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,320
proper with 0.51 probability

306
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,240
you would choose that one less often

307
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,760
than it would if the probability would

308
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,200
say 0.7

309
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
um you know and less probability than

310
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,120
that than if it was

311
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
if the probability was 0.9 so

312
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,399
essentially just

313
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,839
um having a a low inverse temperature

314
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,040
parameter

315
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,640
value just allows the probability of

316
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,680
choice

317
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,880
um the actual choices uh that's our

318
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,160
frequency of choice

319
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,240
um to kind of scale in some sense with

320
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,279
the actual

321
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,000
probabilistic beliefs over the different

322
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,120
um states in the model

323
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,000
thank you ryan we'll have christopher

324
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,959
then adam and

325
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,160
anyone else who raises their hand

326
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,160
so just to kind of contextualize that a

327
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,079
little bit um

328
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,560
so a soft max function is exactly the

329
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,600
same function as a boltzmann

330
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,519
distribution from statistical physics

331
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,160
so often if you have a you'll just use

332
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,000
the same terminology because it has

333
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,839
and in the physics case it has like a

334
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,760
literal physical interpretation

335
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,480
in this case it doesn't um so that's

336
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,120
kind of why

337
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,000
there's that overlapping technology um

338
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,360
in terms of deciding

339
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,600
why or on those parameters or actually

340
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,480
building them in

341
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,200
it was really just kind of came from

342
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,959
thinking about what perce what attention

343
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:35,360
does

344
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,040
so what we're trying to modulate there

345
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,720
was a tension and

346
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,000
signal strength and both of those things

347
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,160
in some way modulate the strength of

348
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,360
feed forward input

349
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,760
so when you think about that you then

350
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,959
kind of think okay what part of the

351
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,720
model corresponds to that well

352
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,200
it's the likelihood matrix that maps but

353
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,560
that decides the precision of the

354
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,360
mapping between external observations

355
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,959
and first level hidden states and so

356
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,719
both the idea is is that both

357
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,880
attention and kind of external signal

358
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,320
strength where or

359
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,399
it might be something like contrast

360
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,600
whatever

361
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,040
um will jointly determine the precision

362
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,560
of that mapping

363
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,000
um and then there's lots of different

364
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,079
ways where you can kind of cash that

365
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,920
out if you actually want to get into

366
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,680
kind of the neurobiology of it like the

367
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,600
normalization model of attention or bias

368
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,519
competition or something like that but

369
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,160
kind of extracting away from that detail

370
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,000
basically it just modulates the a matrix

371
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,160
the computational level of analysis

372
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,440
so that was kind of the thinking that

373
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,000
went into it

374
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,040
very interesting adam then stephen than

375
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:49,839
anyone else

376
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,760
okay adam can you be ready to speak but

377
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,160
go for it yeah sorry about that

378
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,320
oh um it's kind of off the current topic

379
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,760
but from before

380
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,160
so some quick googling uh turned out the

381
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,040
central

382
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,399
lateral um seems to be looping largely

383
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,800
with parietal and temporal association

384
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,600
areas

385
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,839
so that's potentially interesting in

386
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:10,800
ways that

387
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
indirectly could like speak to debates

388
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,920
on the physical substrates of

389
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,279
consciousness like

390
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,040
the the brouhaha between iit and gnwt

391
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,199
said more like the front of the brain or

392
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,560
the back of the brain and

393
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,760
in which senses do they mean

394
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,319
consciousness

395
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,160
but it's interesting i actually i'm

396
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,320
having trouble finding an image

397
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,839
of like a diagram of the thalamus

398
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,600
actually shows the centro

399
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,760
uh lateral nucleus it's all just like i

400
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,120
see central medial but not central

401
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,839
lateral

402
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:38,959
it seems like they might be kind of like

403
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,079
tucking it in with the pulvinar

404
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,800
whatever that means stephen

405
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,480
yeah just say thanks for that that

406
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,160
feedback that was really useful i think

407
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,880
also i because i've got a background in

408
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,160
chemistry i keep thinking about the

409
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
gibbs free energy where it talks about

410
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,360
um temperature times change in

411
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,880
entropy in that term so it's like um

412
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,600
that that the temperature is multiplied

413
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,120
into the amount of entropy

414
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,560
change there is to make it more

415
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,480
significant so that would

416
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,120
kind of mirror why it's a bit like

417
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,760
you're putting in noise or entropy so

418
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,040
uh that that's quite useful um so yeah

419
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,000
thanks

420
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,600
yeah welcome blue you you um

421
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,440
you or anyone else can raise their hand

422
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
but one chemistry

423
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,399
metaphor and again ryan as you brought

424
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,360
up it's not

425
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,480
always like a literal uh meaning but

426
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,480
thermodynamic versus the kinetic

427
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,560
alternative for a reaction

428
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,880
so like the thermodynamic outcome for

429
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,240
the candle is to burn

430
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,839
because it has all this pent-up energy

431
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,560
but it doesn't spontaneously combust

432
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,480
because the kinetic barrier the

433
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,480
activation barrier is too high

434
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,480
and then when there's like an enzyme or

435
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,000
a spark of energy

436
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,399
then at in the right situation the

437
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,800
product can go all the way down

438
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,000
the big delta g to the kind of ultimate

439
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,360
thermodynamic

440
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,680
least energy versus the more kinetically

441
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,560
accessible

442
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,079
and so that's kind of like information

443
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,079
foraging there's sort of the perfect

444
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,000
citation you would find

445
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,920
if you had the right search and it was

446
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,519
that low temperature or

447
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,720
something analogous but then if it's too

448
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,120
um kinetically constrained then it's the

449
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,000
attention is drawn

450
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,399
away i'm not sure if that will map

451
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,519
directly

452
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,720
in this whole active inference mode but

453
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,800
it's just kind of another

454
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,120
chemical informational distinction

455
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,800
well i mean it depends i mean it depends

456
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,720
how you're using it like in this in this

457
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,120
case

458
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,880
there's not really much of a connection

459
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,560
because we're just essentially we're

460
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,360
just using

461
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,040
a temperature parameter and a softmax

462
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,440
function to control

463
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,040
the precision of a mapping well in a few

464
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,000
different places

465
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,759
for attention and for stimulus strength

466
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,399
we're just using it to change the

467
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,440
precision of the mapping between

468
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,160
states and observations at the first

469
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,959
level

470
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,480
um so it just it just controls

471
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,079
essentially how how

472
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,119
strong a sensory signal ends up updating

473
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,079
beliefs

474
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,039
um posterior states at the first level

475
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:13,599
um

476
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,199
and then modulated by a second

477
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,559
temperature parameter that does the same

478
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,119
thing

479
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,839
but that accounts for attention so these

480
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,559
sorts of things

481
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,839
jointly um control um

482
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,160
essentially how much evidence sensory

483
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
input provides for posteriors over

484
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,880
states at the

485
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,200
at the first level um you just we're

486
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,720
using it for that kind of thing and then

487
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,160
we also use it for

488
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,120
controlling deterministicness or the uh

489
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,000
choice

490
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,440
at the second level of the model in

491
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,280
terms of in terms of uh

492
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,400
action selection um so in in all those

493
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,160
cases i i don't personally see a

494
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,200
direct relationship between that and the

495
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,880
kind of thermodynamic

496
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,679
um thermodynamic aspect of temperature

497
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:54,880
of getting over

498
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,960
um you know energy barriers and things

499
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,160
like that um but

500
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,440
i mean it could be i could be uh i could

501
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,480
be just not thinking through it all the

502
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,160
way

503
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,080
stephen then anyone else

504
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,600
yeah i think that makes a lot of sense

505
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,960
what you're saying and i suppose the

506
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,400
nice thing with the modeling

507
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,880
is that you've got this potential to i

508
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,320
know you're using it like you say is

509
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:16,880
this

510
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
way to bring in noise or soft max but it

511
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,160
gives you that way to

512
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,480
increase and decrease it which in real

513
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,240
life when you do empirical work it's

514
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,640
hard

515
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,200
to to do that so it's it's one of the

516
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,320
strengths of

517
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,640
the modeling that you can change that

518
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
parameter and see

519
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,240
it seems to be one way that you really

520
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,400
get insights into

521
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,760
the dynamics of the system

522
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,000
um yeah i mean in terms of just being

523
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,280
able to modulate

524
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,480
modulate the uh or mimic the influences

525
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,160
of attention on modulating the

526
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,679
background perception of the signal

527
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,840
yes stephen or uh dean and then stephen

528
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,559
yeah i just have a quick question here

529
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,520
um

530
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,520
and maybe this is far too oversimplified

531
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,160
but

532
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,320
when you guys were doing this work i i

533
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,840
started also looking at the uh

534
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,520
um the effect paper that i think the two

535
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,960
the two together gave me a better sense

536
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,760
of

537
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,000
some of the work that i was doing around

538
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,840
helping people walk into these

539
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,679
novel situations pre-reflectively and

540
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,840
there is a tendency to want to commit to

541
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,679
want to pay attention to

542
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,720
want to give over whatever you have in

543
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,640
terms of processing power to

544
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,280
figuring out what's going on but we had

545
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,919
to spend quite a bit of time on

546
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,960
helping people get the idea that there

547
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,880
is this channel there's this kind of

548
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,400
sweet spot and when you were talking

549
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,840
about degrees

550
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,840
it brought it up for me again the idea

551
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,039
of

552
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,640
how to help a person know when they're

553
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,160
over committing

554
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,600
when they're over correcting and when

555
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,360
they're over compensating

556
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,720
so when they're trying to do this

557
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,120
estimation

558
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,640
how do they know that they're not seeing

559
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,000
the moon walking bear because

560
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,679
they're so committed to counting up the

561
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,320
number of basketball passes i wonder if

562
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,480
you guys had spent a little bit of time

563
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,360
looking at the other end of the of the

564
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:15,919
channel

565
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,480
when people can actually readjust back

566
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,080
in and i know that's that's probably

567
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,240
where the degrees part comes in but i

568
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
was just wondering about that

569
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,600
so i mean are you imagining are you

570
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,039
imagining in some kind of like clinical

571
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,880
scenario where a person yeah

572
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,039
like biased attention away from

573
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,240
something that could be

574
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,640
say aversive if they were to focus on it

575
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,080
yeah exactly

576
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,720
um yeah so i mean i mean there's there's

577
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,440
probably

578
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,679
a mechanistic relation in a sense just

579
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,039
in the broad sense of

580
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,880
you know how we think uh attention is

581
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,159
implemented

582
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,440
right so so for example if you if you

583
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,240
think that

584
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,440
you know a person um is avoiding paying

585
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,720
attention to something

586
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,240
because it would be aversive right

587
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,400
then then you can end up with this kind

588
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,320
of implicit reinforcement of

589
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,480
attentional policy selection which we

590
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,679
don't directly have

591
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,919
in in this model right the agent is

592
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,679
choosing what the precision is

593
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,960
associated with the tension in this

594
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,760
model

595
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,120
but but that's something that can be

596
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,320
added and something that we have

597
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,840
actually added in some more recent work

598
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,360
that we're doing right now

599
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,159
um but the idea the idea there or one

600
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,320
way to think about that would be that

601
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,039
when uh whenever a person essentially

602
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:25,919
starts

603
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,520
to pay attention to the thing that would

604
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,440
be aversive then

605
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,200
they start to feel it starts to feel

606
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,280
aversive right so then if they pay

607
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:33,840
attention

608
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,200
away again then the the choice of paying

609
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,559
attention away

610
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,840
actually ends up being negatively

611
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,840
reinforcing because the bad feeling goes

612
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,799
away

613
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,280
right so then what that ends up doing at

614
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,240
least according to this kind of

615
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,000
reinforcement learning account

616
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,559
is that that ends up assigning higher

617
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,919
value to the

618
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,960
policy of attending a way right so over

619
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,360
time the probability of attending a way

620
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,520
just ends up getting higher and higher

621
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,799
because it makes you feel better every

622
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,919
time you do

623
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,240
um so then this sort of avoidant

624
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,679
attention can become really kind of

625
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:06,960
habitized

626
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,080
um and and uh so you know

627
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,760
that's one way of thinking about it and

628
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,200
so you know and like in like

629
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,440
you know in in the clinical setting

630
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,200
right you you want to help people

631
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,240
potentially

632
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,960
you know like start to you know

633
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,760
gradually

634
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,840
you know expose themselves to to you

635
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,200
know pay attention to this thing that's

636
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,400
aversive

637
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,880
um in hopes that if they're able to kind

638
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,679
of do that

639
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,240
in a sustained way then over the long

640
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,720
run

641
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,520
the aversiveness will go down as they

642
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,880
kind of learned a better deal with the

643
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,159
thing that they've been

644
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,280
avoiding intentionally um you know so so

645
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,799
that's um that's

646
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,000
um yeah fairly tangential to right the

647
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,120
kind of thing we're trying to do

648
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,240
here but um you know but there's a

649
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,720
there's a connection in this very kind

650
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,559
of broad sense in that if you can

651
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,240
control attention

652
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,640
and choices of what to pay attention to

653
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,520
can be

654
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,919
reinforced then that's one way you can

655
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,200
kind of end up with this

656
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,640
this kind of thing where person might

657
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,720
not even know right that they've

658
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,320
developed this strong

659
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,080
habit you know not to pay attention to

660
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,240
something it just becomes very automated

661
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,480
um you know the same way the same way

662
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,640
any other behavior can be habitized via

663
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,000
repeated reinforcement um but here just

664
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,039
it would be a

665
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,520
kind of a cognitive action as opposed to

666
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,039
a a

667
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,799
a more overt behavioral action okay

668
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,360
very interesting thanks for that

669
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,400
question response

670
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,720
adam and then anyone else who raises

671
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,840
their hand

672
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,640
i guess to come out of left field um

673
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,640
and what you're just describing it seems

674
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,760
like

675
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,159
that could have um some relation to

676
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:48,960
maybe

677
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,960
grounding like psychodynamic-like

678
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,159
concepts

679
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,600
in terms of if these patterns of

680
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,080
attentional approach and avoidance can

681
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,799
move from your c matrix to your e matrix

682
00:23:58,799 --> 00:23:59,360
you can

683
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,960
end up finding yourself in these sort of

684
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,000
like garden paths of attending

685
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,200
and coming to uh inferences for reasons

686
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,120
that you might not even understand just

687
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:09,600
on

688
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,039
the way your policy selections of

689
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,039
attention have been shaped for

690
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,360
conditions that are might be too uh

691
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,000
numerous and varied for you to track and

692
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,880
so

693
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,720
yeah yeah i mean there's i mean we've

694
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,159
written you know we've written a few

695
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,120
papers on this

696
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,120
right like or i have with some

697
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,720
colleagues i mean again you know my

698
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,679
focus

699
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,480
um you know is largely in you know in

700
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,120
terms of

701
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,279
and psychiatric conditions right and i

702
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,480
wouldn't um

703
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,559
i would say it's a way of of recasting

704
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,440
the sorts of behaviors that

705
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
psychodynamic approaches

706
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,760
are trying to capture but to do it in a

707
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,919
way that doesn't um

708
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,400
actually posit the existence of these

709
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:50,960
sorts of

710
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,159
repressive right like you know like

711
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,840
unconscious like there's no unconscious

712
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,480
agent

713
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,320
right there's no id right that's being

714
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,520
positive that's

715
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,200
sitting there keeping these things out

716
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,640
of awareness but somehow they're

717
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,799
still present unconsciously right

718
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,000
there's nothing like that

719
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,240
right it's just a very simple story of

720
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,039
um

721
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,320
having reinforced patterns of attention

722
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,360
that um you know so it it's a it's a way

723
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,520
of capturing the the phenomena that that

724
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,880
i think psychodynamic approaches are

725
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,400
often trying to capture but

726
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
it doesn't posit a lot of the kind of

727
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,919
like ontological

728
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,600
um a lot of the entities that are

729
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,840
positive in psychodynamic

730
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,200
um so yeah it's like yeah i'm

731
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,640
not saying like you're freudian but like

732
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,840
yeah you're actually finding like the

733
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,279
baby in the bath water

734
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,279
rescue eyes rescuing it cleaning it up

735
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,720
contextualizing it

736
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,840
like why did people have these

737
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,279
intuitions to begin with like what was

738
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,720
the grains of truth

739
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,600
um i'm wondering if through this this

740
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,559
could lead to

741
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,279
um like this kind of uh patterns of

742
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,080
attending

743
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,240
some of which you're not tracking this

744
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,919
could be like an account of what would

745
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,320
lead to potentially uh mismatch or

746
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,760
discrepancies

747
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,000
between things like stated and revealed

748
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,360
preferences

749
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,240
or a thing like um your actual affective

750
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,520
disposition with respect to thing and

751
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,559
then what you

752
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,919
think is going on and then those

753
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,559
potentially go across purposes in ways

754
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,919
that could be different difficult to

755
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,320
explicitly model and potentially have

756
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,039
like

757
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,760
problematic sequela or not but i'm

758
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,880
wondering if like this could lead to

759
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,559
like a mismatch or across

760
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,640
purposes of uh

761
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,159
attracting states at different levels

762
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,919
um i mean i probably need more concrete

763
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,520
examples to try to figure that out i

764
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,640
mean that's probably something i'd have

765
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,919
to think about more

766
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,000
i i guess one quickly would be like um

767
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,919
implicit affect tests or something like

768
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:46,799
that like

769
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,400
you say like um uh i'm not racist

770
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,440
but then it turns out no no you are and

771
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,799
like if you actually look at the

772
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,559
reaction or something like that or

773
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,720
i am really happy in this relationship

774
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,720
but then like i measure your heart rate

775
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,480
variability and its crap or

776
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,200
things like that um just this your

777
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,880
actual affective state

778
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,559
might end up being different than what

779
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,039
you think it isn't there could be like a

780
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,880
lack of self-awareness

781
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,840
like a difficulty coming to coherent

782
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,559
modeling of yourself because of these

783
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,000
like

784
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,760
shaped paths of attention like you might

785
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,440
like miss the mark about you because it

786
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,200
was like difficult to see

787
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,120
something like that i mean i mean i i

788
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,200
would i would think that you know

789
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,360
i mean perhaps there are sort of some

790
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,720
instances of the sort of thing you're

791
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,520
talking about

792
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,080
to be captured by the um the kind of

793
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,279
mechanisms that

794
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,440
you know we're talking about here or the

795
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,520
kind of tangential extension of them

796
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,159
that we're talking about here um but i'm

797
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,320
not confident that all of them

798
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,520
could i imagine there's a number of

799
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,960
mechanisms that you might feel to

800
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,279
describe some of those things like

801
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,600
um you know implicit yeah like i mean if

802
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,880
you're talking about like implicit

803
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,320
associations on like

804
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,799
like an iat right or something or

805
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,480
something like that that's probably

806
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,840
my intuition is that's probably

807
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,159
different from um yeah it's more kind of

808
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,760
like a

809
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,279
like like uh like us right which i know

810
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,559
chris has actually been working on

811
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,880
models of street tasks um

812
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,159
but um right which is which is probably

813
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,039
pretty different

814
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,320
from um um some of the other examples

815
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,200
you were given

816
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,600
but but yeah i mean like i said i'd have

817
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,919
to taking a particular example i

818
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:28,880
probably have to think it through a

819
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,520
little more

820
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,559
um to see think about what sorts of what

821
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:33,840
kind of generative model would be able

822
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,039
to reproduce what kind of behavior

823
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,399
you're talking about

824
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,200
um or or you know most likely there

825
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,559
would be multiple generative models that

826
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,760
could reproduce it and then you'd have

827
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,240
to

828
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,840
do some kind of experiment right to do

829
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,120
model comparison and see which one

830
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,799
actually best accounts for it

831
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,559
um but again i wouldn't feel really

832
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,240
confident um

833
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,080
you know saying what that might look

834
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,520
like um

835
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,919
you know just just in the very kind of

836
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,039
abstract general

837
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,240
you know description we're talking about

838
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,399
right now

839
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,960
nice nice thank you for the response

840
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,440
stephen

841
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,919
yeah i'll just bring in this sort of

842
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,080
this point with this model that's now

843
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,440
sort of maybe getting into the model in

844
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,919
part is i think that's interesting with

845
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,679
the awareness base there's a lot of work

846
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,919
with awareness-based systems change and

847
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,679
looking at awareness

848
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,640
and i i like the um i'd be interested in

849
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,600
your thoughts on

850
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,720
how we can move beyond being trapped

851
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,919
in a psychology of the individual and

852
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:30,320
you know

853
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,399
pathology of the individual and it moves

854
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,760
into the inter-subjective

855
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,000
multi-scale so like you talk about tasks

856
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,559
but you it also could be used in

857
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,799
task scapes you know organizational

858
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,320
contexts or

859
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,200
groups of people so i just think that

860
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:45,840
there's um

861
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,799
because the the it's not nailed down to

862
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,320
like a psychological model of the

863
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,600
person's

864
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,480
thoughts and feelings but more a general

865
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,320
model of the attentional

866
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,000
structure it has like a you know ability

867
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,039
to move beyond

868
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,399
between scales and context so um

869
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,000
i just think i'll put that out there as

870
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,120
something that seems quite interesting

871
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,719
um i mean there's more i mean

872
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,440
um so

873
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,559
i think the utility of models like these

874
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,200
is to identify a very specific

875
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,720
phenomenon

876
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,000
and that namely having conscious access

877
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,159
to some content and not others

878
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,799
um so i have conscious access to what's

879
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,080
in front of me my visual field at the

880
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,799
moment

881
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,799
if i direct my tension around my body i

882
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:39,919
can bring up

883
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,440
all sorts of like i can suddenly become

884
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,520
aware of different kind of

885
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,720
some other sensory bits of information

886
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,120
and all of these have very specific kind

887
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,600
of

888
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,159
neural signatures as it were what we're

889
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:54,880
trying to do

890
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,640
is really propose a model at a

891
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,039
computational level of analysis

892
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,159
and algorithmic level of analysis that

893
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,279
explains these

894
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,200
and i outside of that

895
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,000
i'm not sure to what extent

896
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,919
actually talking about awareness

897
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,919
into subjective awareness is at all the

898
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,919
same thing

899
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,440
as talking about awareness

900
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,720
as someone who works in like

901
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,080
neuroscience of consciousness for

902
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,200
example

903
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,760
they might be but i don't see any

904
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,200
evidence that they are

905
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,640
pretty interesting because it's in the

906
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,720
title of the paper so

907
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,799
many people might think of it

908
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,000
differently

909
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,840
as i mean it's just an interesting

910
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,840
question right

911
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,000
sorry what's in the title of the paper

912
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,960
um just

913
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,000
the idea that the uh

914
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,919
visual consciousness is involved

915
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,640
well but i mean but again i mean this is

916
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,399
a model of a particular visual

917
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,440
consciousness

918
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,159
past right i mean so it it's meant to

919
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,679
account for things that are seen

920
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,799
in the visual consciousness literature

921
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,799
um you know there is the structure is

922
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,080
abstract enough that

923
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,519
you know we would and we say this in the

924
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,760
discussion that it ought to apply

925
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,600
to cases of having access to one

926
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,640
bit of information versus another um in

927
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,600
other domains

928
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,320
right like an auditory domain or you

929
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,000
know something that i've been working on

930
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,440
you know with a bunch of colleagues at

931
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,919
um you know at libra where i am

932
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,919
um you know it's trying to see if the

933
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,519
same sort of thing

934
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,000
it looks like it's present in the

935
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,640
interceptive domain for example

936
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,840
um you know so so i i think it's right

937
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,120
to say

938
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,720
that you know we would we would hope

939
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,559
anyway that it's abstract enough that it

940
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,080
can account for

941
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,440
any any piece of information

942
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,880
that you either gain access to or not

943
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,640
you know when it's being represented so

944
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,080
much so right so

945
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,320
whether it's you know right now as i'm

946
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,080
talking to you i'm not necessarily aware

947
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,679
of what my heart's doing

948
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,679
but now i choose to pay attention to it

949
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,679
and all of a sudden i can kind of

950
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,000
feel that it's beating at a certain rate

951
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,120
i believe i believe

952
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,640
i believe that i feel i wasn't conscious

953
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,440
of that before

954
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,880
despite the fact that my brain was

955
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,480
unconsciously tracking

956
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,919
you know what my heart was doing that

957
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,039
whole time right so it could apply to

958
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,960
being aware or not aware of any stimulus

959
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,919
so i mean to the so only to the extent

960
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:30,320
that

961
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,279
when we say something about

962
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,519
intersubjective awareness only

963
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,919
to the extent that that means something

964
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,480
about a piece of information

965
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,880
that you know before i was attending to

966
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,399
it i didn't know

967
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,080
you know was there but now that i'm

968
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,919
paying attention to it that i do so for

969
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,720
example like if i happen to

970
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,600
notice that a person's smiling or

971
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,000
something

972
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,080
like that um even though they were

973
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,600
smiling at me the whole time you know

974
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,720
maybe my brain had

975
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,919
picked up on the fact that they were

976
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,480
smiling but um i wasn't aware of it

977
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,880
until i focused my attention on it

978
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,799
or something like that right or even

979
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,559
maybe more abstract than that

980
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,560
you know when my brain sort of had

981
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,679
unconsciously

982
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,359
detected the smile there might even have

983
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,520
been some further inference that that

984
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,760
means something about them being happy

985
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,480
right so so there might even be a case

986
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,359
where

987
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,199
um i either do or do not gain access to

988
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,960
this unconscious inference

989
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,839
or this posterior belief that the person

990
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,679
is more likely happy than unhappy or

991
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,800
something like that right

992
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,879
but uh but i mean these are sorts of

993
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,560
cases they would have to be

994
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,879
tested in their own in their own right

995
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,719
my broad point is just that

996
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,040
it's an abstract structure where all it

997
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,159
is meant to account for

998
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,679
is when your brain is representing

999
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,440
something and you either become aware of

1000
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,079
it or not

1001
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,679
i mean i mean if i could just kind of

1002
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,359
build on that slightly

1003
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,918
so i think

1004
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,280
one it's very tempting when we've got

1005
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,040
computational models that are

1006
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,480
real when we've got lots of equations

1007
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,560
sitting in front of us to kind of think

1008
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,920
that i think it's easy to get an

1009
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,200
illusion of rigor where there is none

1010
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,520
um the thing that makes these models

1011
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,599
meaningful is that we can we're tracking

1012
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,839
some real world phenomenon

1013
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:18,000
um in terms of the abstract model

1014
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,960
structure

1015
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,240
it may be the case that say

1016
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,359
you have group dynamics where there's

1017
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,560
some group that some aspect

1018
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,280
of that maybe the individual behavior of

1019
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,800
individuals within a group evolves at a

1020
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,480
really quick time scale

1021
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,400
and then the decision that group

1022
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,240
decision making evolves as a slower time

1023
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,119
scale

1024
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,599
you may be able you you could in

1025
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,240
principle

1026
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,480
fit a two-level partially observable

1027
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,480
mark of decision process to this

1028
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,599
as a model of that behavior but that

1029
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,480
would be very very diff i think even in

1030
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,680
that case even when we're fitting the

1031
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,960
same model

1032
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,880
i don't think that those are at all the

1033
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,160
same phenomenon

1034
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,079
although there may be similarities

1035
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,520
across them

1036
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,520
um i would be extremely resistant to

1037
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,880
calling one visual awareness

1038
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,640
or but a group has visual awareness

1039
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,599
interesting and of course a parallel

1040
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,280
debate in the ant world

1041
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,079
is there a colony awareness or a single

1042
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:18,880
six-legged

1043
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,680
ant awareness or how should we think

1044
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,240
about

1045
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,160
distributed systems and aren't we all

1046
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,839
kind of just distributed systems all the

1047
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:26,880
way down

1048
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,720
so adam and then stephen

1049
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,320
um so this would be related to i guess

1050
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,000
uh different types of uh

1051
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,079
interest subjective or yeah interest

1052
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,280
objective awareness that you might

1053
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,880
believe is a model for

1054
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,640
um i recently um uploaded a preprint

1055
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,320
after some conversations with people

1056
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,560
from the brain institute at chapman

1057
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,839
university

1058
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,920
basically trying to do the beginnings of

1059
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,839
like an active inference account

1060
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,760
of la bay phenomena and readiness

1061
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,520
potentials that are

1062
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,760
a little bit less deflationary with

1063
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,640
respect to

1064
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,760
uh volition and uh conscious causation

1065
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,720
and so like in like essence i was

1066
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,760
thinking of like

1067
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,880
um the actual uh

1068
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,640
moving your hand being like an

1069
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,320
accumulation of

1070
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,320
model evidence model evidence with

1071
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,520
respect to

1072
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,160
a proprioceptive pose and it might be

1073
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,480
some sort of like conjunction of like

1074
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,920
um also like and hum like

1075
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,160
whether or not your like will or feeling

1076
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,520
of urge was part of it you could think

1077
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,119
of that as like

1078
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,920
um inference over your affective state

1079
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,200
and that if these things are in

1080
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,520
what kind of alignments could help to

1081
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,200
explain whether you're like aware

1082
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,119
of readiness potential activity or

1083
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,560
whether this awareness is actually

1084
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,640
feeding back and contributing to it

1085
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,320
and so i feel like your model could

1086
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,160
potentially like

1087
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,760
provide like a very precise

1088
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,599
contextualization of this

1089
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,599
really subtle what's going on uh then

1090
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,119
i would like to collaborate so so i mean

1091
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,560
just just just again

1092
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,280
brad just to make it really maybe that

1093
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,960
could be the case i have no idea

1094
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,560
but it could only potentially be the

1095
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,240
case if

1096
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,079
what you're talking about right like

1097
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,240
what you're you know motivated to

1098
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,640
do or what you're you know in the

1099
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,480
process of about you know being about to

1100
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,720
do or you know whatever aspect of

1101
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,920
um you know action or action tendency or

1102
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,680
you know anything like that

1103
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,480
um the only way this could apply is if

1104
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,520
you think that

1105
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,800
that information about what your

1106
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,880
you know what you're motivated to do or

1107
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,880
or something like that you know whatever

1108
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,680
it is

1109
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,560
and only if it's the case you think that

1110
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,280
is

1111
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,400
a represented piece of information um

1112
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,040
that you can attend to or not um and

1113
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,040
that then you could sort of

1114
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,320
um gate into the higher kind of people

1115
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,320
deeper temporal level of the model

1116
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,119
that would inform um verbal reporting

1117
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,839
and sort of other goal directed

1118
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,000
uses um so it'd only be the case i guess

1119
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,800
my point is this

1120
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,680
is if the the representation associated

1121
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,240
with action that you're talking about is

1122
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,720
in some sense formally equivalent to a

1123
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,359
representation of something visual

1124
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,440
um that that you can attend to

1125
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,280
that makes sense so it's um so the

1126
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,079
preprint is like

1127
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,920
it's like a three i think like a three

1128
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,000
page more of a promissory note

1129
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,160
but if i could uh like pick your brain

1130
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,440
later about like

1131
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,720
if you think there's like a way we could

1132
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,000
actually get some like empirical

1133
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,040
traction and like

1134
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,560
nailing down the specifics along the

1135
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,480
lines you're saying so well if you

1136
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:36,800
haven't

1137
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,800
i mean if you have a task and that task

1138
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,040
involves people paying attention to

1139
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,960
the aspect of action that you're talking

1140
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,640
about um

1141
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,760
then in principle you could have people

1142
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,000
you could have people you know in some

1143
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,440
sense cue them

1144
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,839
or prime them or something like that

1145
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,000
that that engages that

1146
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,280
sort of action bias or action motivation

1147
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,880
um and again you can they can either

1148
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,720
attend to it or not or report on it or

1149
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,440
not

1150
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,119
in that case yes but otherwise probably

1151
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,920
not it's a little tricky i think in

1152
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,040
terms of like

1153
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,200
the action that would be attended to

1154
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,880
would be of a couple varieties but

1155
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,760
none of them through them would be um

1156
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,520
directly observable so it's like

1157
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,359
you could say like it's the action of

1158
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:20,720
the neural activity in terms of like the

1159
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,079
ramping activity like do they have

1160
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,520
access to that but the

1161
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,880
i was thinking it could also be like um

1162
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,440
the action of like mental acts and like

1163
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,640
rehearsing like

1164
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,720
imagining a kind of sophisticated effect

1165
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,000
of infant sense like

1166
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,680
am i gonna move my hand or not what

1167
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,119
would that be like

1168
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,160
and then that being contributing to

1169
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,680
that signal um but and where like

1170
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,200
actual awareness of this like fictive

1171
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,160
meant this fictive action could be part

1172
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,000
of what would contribute to

1173
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,400
uh whether or not you feel ownership of

1174
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,200
it like it's

1175
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,200
it's interesting like some people don't

1176
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,640
show readiness potentials they just act

1177
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,920
other people do

1178
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,319
um like schizophrenic patients they tend

1179
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:03,920
not to show readiness potentials before

1180
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,560
they

1181
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,560
spontaneously raise their hand but it

1182
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,920
would be hard to get this

1183
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,200
um the action is internal

1184
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,640
and so i don't know what you should do

1185
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,280
with that yeah it just seems it just

1186
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,440
seems like you have to have some kind of

1187
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,640
behavioral readout that can be fit um

1188
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,520
to unlock to to a model of this to be

1189
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,240
able to say

1190
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,800
that this explains the ability to

1191
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,599
consciously

1192
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,119
report on it or not right so

1193
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,160
i guess could you use like like

1194
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,680
right before leading to like the action

1195
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,280
there tends to be like it starts out

1196
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,000
like

1197
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,760
more bilateral and then the ramp

1198
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,520
activation tends to go lateral and then

1199
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,720
the hand moves

1200
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,079
could you use like that sort of signal

1201
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,720
as the readout like the ensemble

1202
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,839
activity

1203
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,000
so in principle you can use you know you

1204
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,319
can fit models to neurologic neural

1205
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:55,119
activity

1206
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,400
and you can fit models to anything that

1207
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,440
the

1208
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,960
generative model generates but

1209
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,720
but i'm not necessarily all that

1210
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,000
confident that

1211
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,800
you'd be able to justify the claim that

1212
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,760
um

1213
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,480
because the because the model in one

1214
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,079
case

1215
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:16,960
generates you know like a readiness

1216
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,480
potential signal

1217
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,359
that that has anything to do with having

1218
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,680
conscious access to something

1219
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,960
any of the other problem like if you're

1220
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,560
using like the ensemble activity it's

1221
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,760
still the interpretation like

1222
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,040
awareness of what like what

1223
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,079
what are we even talking about with the

1224
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,760
awareness the whole point is to try to

1225
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,359
like contextualize what those signals

1226
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:36,319
mean

1227
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,359
and so yeah yeah i mean i mean

1228
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,760
in the majority of cases you know either

1229
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,599
directly or indirectly

1230
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,160
you know like verbal report right is

1231
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,040
still

1232
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,800
kind of gold standard for whether

1233
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,800
someone has access to something

1234
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,200
right even in no report paradigms you're

1235
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,880
still later

1236
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,040
right asking them to report what they

1237
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,800
were experiencing at the time

1238
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,640
um and so it's i mean in the yeah the

1239
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,760
issue is that in some sense all

1240
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,200
kind of supportable or accepted

1241
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,680
sort of evidence for being consciously

1242
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,119
aware of something

1243
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,920
um is always ultimately and chris you

1244
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,440
can correct me if he thinks is wrong but

1245
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,640
but i mean

1246
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,800
i think that it always ultimately comes

1247
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,280
down to verbal report or some reliable

1248
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,280
correlate of verbal report

1249
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,400
whether or not yeah i agree with that so

1250
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,200
i think

1251
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,960
i'm not an expert no report paradigms

1252
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,440
but to my to my knowledge

1253
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,119
all of them the reason we trust no

1254
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,599
report paradigms is because our

1255
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,160
measure whether that is a particular

1256
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,920
mode of eye tracking

1257
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,640
or it is just like incidental memory

1258
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,680
afterwards

1259
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,839
um all of those things correlate really

1260
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,520
really well with report and that's the

1261
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,960
thing that kind of like

1262
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,920
makes us trust them as measures of

1263
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,560
conscious access independent of report

1264
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,200
um yeah i think it's always reports are

1265
00:43:59,200 --> 00:43:59,920
foundational

1266
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,000
unless we have really really good

1267
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,280
evidence otherwise i think we have to

1268
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,480
take them kind of at face value

1269
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,000
cool we'll return to the stack so blue

1270
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,760
and then stephen and then anyone else

1271
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,640
who raises their hand

1272
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,400
so adam always brings me into this like

1273
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,440
metaphysical

1274
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,640
like thought space whenever he talks um

1275
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,720
and i just was wondering uh you know in

1276
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,680
terms of this like

1277
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,960
visual model there's you hear the

1278
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,480
expression that people see what they

1279
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,440
want to see

1280
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,200
right and so have you thought about

1281
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,800
maybe testing

1282
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,839
like you know like there's the the idea

1283
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,280
of paying attention to something

1284
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,800
and so we thought about testing like

1285
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,400
whether you know people

1286
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,480
can deceive themselves in this visual

1287
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,480
process right like some self-deception

1288
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,640
or even like the you hear of like the

1289
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,560
power of manifestation like can people

1290
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,160
bring into their awareness something

1291
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:52,720
because

1292
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,560
they simply want it to be there i mean

1293
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,240
have you thought about this or testing

1294
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,319
the model in this way

1295
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,880
yeah i mean if you go to a figure um

1296
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,599
maybe

1297
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,920
scroll down is it which one so we have

1298
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,800
it we have us

1299
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,520
actually i'm not sure uh so that's the

1300
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,319
erps

1301
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:10,800
yeah that the tax of the extended

1302
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,599
taxonomy

1303
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,040
so we start with this kind of four-way

1304
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,720
taxonomy between which tahan proposed

1305
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,520
um along with some other colleagues of

1306
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,280
the kind of factors underlying

1307
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,640
whether you'll have conscious access to

1308
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,400
a stimulus and you kind of broke it down

1309
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,680
into

1310
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,040
whether attention was weak or absent

1311
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,720
present or absent

1312
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,400
or whether kind of just how strong the

1313
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,079
signal strength was with the streak

1314
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,440
um weak or strong and then we extended

1315
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,640
this by adding in

1316
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,680
prior expectations so the extent to

1317
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,640
which you expect a stimulus to appear

1318
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,640
um and there is now like a one of the

1319
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,319
big motivations this work is that there

1320
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,079
is an enormous body of work

1321
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,040
now showing that expectation does play a

1322
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,160
fairly fundamental role

1323
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,200
i think in determining the contents of

1324
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,079
visual awareness

1325
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,960
um so as for whether you can voluntarily

1326
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,079
bring something into awareness i'm not

1327
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,040
the answer is i think that's more to do

1328
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,319
with attention

1329
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:15,839
i suspect but say for example if you

1330
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,960
are looking at a bi-stable image

1331
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,000
you can attend to one part of that image

1332
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,240
and then have the if it's a i think it's

1333
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,680
called a neca cube

1334
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,160
you can have the cube flip versus if you

1335
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,440
attend to another part it'll flip back

1336
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,880
and you can do kind of similar

1337
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,720
deliberate moves of attention with a lot

1338
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,720
of bi-stable images

1339
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,359
um so also i think there's some really

1340
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,000
cool there is some interesting kind of

1341
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,599
back to the

1342
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,599
expectation thing expecting seeing what

1343
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:48,720
you expect to see

1344
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,680
a lot of that depends upon how strong

1345
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,920
your bottom up evidence is

1346
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,160
if you are much more likely so there are

1347
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,560
paradigms that kind of distract people

1348
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,960
but basically condition them into

1349
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,760
expecting

1350
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,040
a stimulus to appear um

1351
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,760
and you can get kind of accidental

1352
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,119
hallucinate or you can basically

1353
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,960
induce people's blood what is

1354
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,480
essentially a hallucination in those

1355
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:12,960
cases

1356
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,200
or mistakenly report something that we

1357
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,000
know as a fact

1358
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
the experimental as experimental as they

1359
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,680
weren't there i think there are two

1360
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,119
examples that what i have in mind at the

1361
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,839
moment is a really clever set of studies

1362
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,760
by john aru but i know ryan and maybe

1363
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,880
you can talk about this

1364
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,400
there's also a lot of work on

1365
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,119
conditioned hallucinations from

1366
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,480
a group at yale who i know you

1367
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,319
collaborate with

1368
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,800
yeah so yeah i know that was yeah

1369
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,160
something i was actually going to bring

1370
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:38,400
up

1371
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,119
is and this is this is not yeah because

1372
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,559
i mean i agree with chris and in most

1373
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:43,839
cases i think it's going to have to do

1374
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,119
with some kind of like motivated

1375
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,640
selective attention

1376
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,680
um that kind of like biases say

1377
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,119
different possible uh interpretations

1378
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,880
that you have posteriors over states

1379
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,160
for the posterior to the first level um

1380
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,800
but um but yeah definitely you can have

1381
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,240
these expectation effects although i

1382
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,599
don't necessarily

1383
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,960
think of those as being um voluntary

1384
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,559
right i'm not sure that

1385
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,960
um like like selective attention is

1386
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,160
definitely a kind of

1387
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,480
controllable cognitive action whereas

1388
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,520
shifting

1389
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,760
uh prior expectations i'm less confident

1390
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,359
that can be cast that way

1391
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:23,200
um but but um priors definitely have a

1392
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,880
an influence right on what your

1393
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,400
posteriors of our states are

1394
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,240
given some stimulus especially like

1395
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,319
chris said when the stimulus strength is

1396
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:30,800
fairly

1397
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,480
low or noisy um you know so so some of

1398
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,880
the work that um yeah al powers and

1399
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,960
his group at yale and then that i've

1400
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,119
been we've been collaborating to build

1401
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,280
active inference models for this stuff

1402
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,760
um is uh yeah these sorts of condition

1403
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,599
hallucination paradigms in people's

1404
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:48,880
psychosis

1405
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,839
so the way these paradigms work is that

1406
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,760
you um you start out

1407
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,800
always showing people a light um and

1408
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,359
that

1409
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,839
is always coincident with a tone that

1410
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,880
appears in some white noise um

1411
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,040
and so on the first several trials

1412
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,440
there's a fairly strong tone

1413
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,760
that plays in the white noise every time

1414
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,160
they hear a light or every time i see a

1415
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,440
light

1416
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,160
and it's thresholded so that they would

1417
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,599
perceive that tone

1418
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,280
uh 75 of the time um and then

1419
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,599
and then after several of those trials

1420
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,319
um there starts to be cases where

1421
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,960
um the the tone is still present but

1422
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,359
it's

1423
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,200
weaker so they only would detect at 50

1424
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,960
or 25 of the time

1425
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,720
and then there are trials where the

1426
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,240
light comes on but

1427
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,839
no tone is played and there's just white

1428
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:39,520
noise um

1429
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,119
and what um what they have found

1430
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,400
is that um people with psychosis um have

1431
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,079
a higher probability of reporting

1432
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,920
hearing tones when the light shows up

1433
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,680
even when there was no tone

1434
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,079
um so let's just say kind of expect so

1435
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,599
they build up this expectation to hear a

1436
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,280
tone of every single light

1437
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,280
and somehow those prior expectation that

1438
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,119
those prior expectations that the tone

1439
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,040
will be there um have a stronger

1440
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,079
influence over

1441
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,880
whether they hallucinate the tone or not

1442
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,280
um

1443
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,280
that influence is stronger in people

1444
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,520
that have hallucinations

1445
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,559
than in people that don't have

1446
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,240
hallucinations which has kind of

1447
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,800
led to this idea that what's what's

1448
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,280
going

1449
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,599
you know part of the computational issue

1450
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:24,960
and people with psychosis that are more

1451
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,200
likely to have hallucinations

1452
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,160
is that um prior expectations are in

1453
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:30,800
some way

1454
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,319
really precise and therefore going to

1455
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,040
dominate um perception

1456
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,880
um and that could be that could be

1457
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,040
either because the prior expectations

1458
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,000
themselves are really

1459
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,880
precise or because beliefs about the

1460
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,240
actual sensory signal

1461
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,280
are those are believed to be uh very

1462
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,160
imprecise

1463
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,160
um but in either case the relative

1464
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,280
precisions

1465
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,280
um are supposed to are thought to kind

1466
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,440
of favor prior expectations and

1467
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,520
psychosis to a greater degree than

1468
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,559
people without psychosis thank you

1469
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,640
can i just follow up really quick yep

1470
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,559
yeah so it's interesting that you

1471
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,079
brought the auditory

1472
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:08,880
um thing into this but the auditory

1473
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,720
hallucinations and i wonder if

1474
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,839
it's a visual cortex thing or if it's

1475
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:15,520
involved more with the auditory cortex

1476
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,760
because even when chris was talking

1477
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,839
you know you think about like people

1478
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:21,839
have seen like when you have two things

1479
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:24,240
played simultaneously auditory tracks

1480
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,000
that like it's like listen for the phone

1481
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,960
number and then you hear the phone

1482
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,240
number but then if you're not listening

1483
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,200
for the phone number

1484
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,680
you're hearing something else so it's

1485
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,680
interesting that the auditory system

1486
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,160
like the

1487
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,400
the selective attention in the auditory

1488
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,359
track really is

1489
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:39,040
is much more apparent like where you see

1490
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,400
the blue dress versus the

1491
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,920
white dress or the gold dress or

1492
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,440
whatever color it was like the two

1493
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,240
dresses

1494
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,000
is not so selective it's like look for

1495
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,440
the blue dress or look for the white

1496
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:47,839
dress

1497
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,680
if you set up that expectation in the

1498
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,280
visual system it's not as

1499
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,319
um prevalent i think

1500
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,520
yeah i mean i will agree that

1501
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,760
it's definitely harder to switch the uh

1502
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,200
interpretation from the blue to the

1503
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,880
yellow when i've tried that

1504
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,800
i can i can get myself to do it but it's

1505
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,559
way more effort for you right

1506
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,599
um and uh yeah i mean i don't know

1507
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,200
chris if you have any ideas about why

1508
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,280
exactly that would that would be

1509
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,440
i mean i know cases of like you know

1510
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,640
attention

1511
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,319
playing binocular rivalry and things

1512
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:20,000
like that in those cases i think

1513
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,359
there are cases where i think selective

1514
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,280
attention can play a bigger role

1515
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,599
like the neckercube for example um

1516
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,200
that's maybe a little more analogous to

1517
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:27,599
the

1518
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,720
kind of like uh multi uh

1519
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,440
channel auditory input i think it just

1520
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,440
depends on how you set the task up i'm

1521
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,079
not sure

1522
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:38,640
if the comparison is really a fair one i

1523
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,720
suppose i think you can very i think you

1524
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,319
definitely can

1525
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:46,000
set up a lot of

1526
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
expectations play a huge role in the

1527
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,520
visual system i think is one thing to

1528
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,079
say

1529
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,800
um whether you have voluntary control

1530
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,480
whether those things come under the

1531
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,240
purview of like voluntary attention is

1532
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,040
another thing um

1533
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,240
but i still think there are lots of

1534
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,920
cases depending on how you set up the

1535
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,680
problems i think binocular rivalry is a

1536
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,319
good one

1537
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,000
or even something like actually

1538
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,040
literally like where you move your eyes

1539
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,839
i know that sounds trivial but whether

1540
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:15,119
your eyes are moving around

1541
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,040
a page or not kind of determine

1542
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,359
determines uh some

1543
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:21,040
different types of visual illusions so

1544
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,960
if you think about um

1545
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,880
maybe illusion isn't even the right word

1546
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,119
but what's the where sorry we're working

1547
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:30,160
on the project about this right now

1548
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,119
what's it called again

1549
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:32,800
tom's power is a paper on this run do

1550
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,480
you remember what's trucks were fading

1551
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,680
yeah yeah yeah if you google troxler

1552
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,119
fading i think that's a really powerful

1553
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,960
example of where just kind of

1554
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,040
selective attention has a really major

1555
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,480
role

1556
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,960
on whether you perceive something as

1557
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,920
present or absent

1558
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,400
yep very interesting it's almost like

1559
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,400
there's ambiguous and non-ambiguous

1560
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,000
stimuli in different domains

1561
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,280
and maybe even interpersonal variation

1562
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,880
one person being really good at picking

1563
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,040
up on something subtle in one domain or

1564
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:05,680
not

1565
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:11,200
so we'll do steven then dean then adam

1566
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,839
i think this ties in actually to what we

1567
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:14,960
was mentioning earlier

1568
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,119
um about you know when you scale things

1569
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:18,559
up and like and i agree with what you're

1570
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,000
saying when you scale things up

1571
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,160
it may be useful to think about how

1572
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,000
someone facilitates the attention

1573
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,800
of people in a group and how you take

1574
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,119
them

1575
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,040
and how they you think about taking

1576
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,559
their attention it doesn't mean that

1577
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:31,280
whatever they

1578
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,720
consciously have inter-subject together

1579
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,839
is now read by the model you know so

1580
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:39,359
it's usefulness may be

1581
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,160
in how people's attention is taken and i

1582
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:42,640
think

1583
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,480
it ties to this hypnosis thing as well

1584
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,079
because i think your your model speaks

1585
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:47,760
to top down and bottom up

1586
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,440
happen at different level there are

1587
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,760
different scales because often we think

1588
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,079
top

1589
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:54,720
down we think executive function and

1590
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,040
like executive functions telling me what

1591
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,160
i think

1592
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,280
but like you say you can have a

1593
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,200
subconscious level

1594
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,119
of trying to think what something is

1595
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,880
even if it's in the subconscious you can

1596
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,319
and hypnosis is doing that hypnosis is

1597
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:11,839
playing the game with someone um so they

1598
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:14,079
they um or with these optical illusions

1599
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,280
you say to someone

1600
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,720
this you're looking at this cube from

1601
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,040
above or below and it flips

1602
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,880
but it's not that you you're being told

1603
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,799
it's this type of cube

1604
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:25,280
and your executive function's pushing it

1605
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:25,839
it's it

1606
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:27,760
it's still top down but it's it's

1607
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,200
happening at

1608
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,559
a um a more subconscious what we might

1609
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:33,920
call a subconscious level and i think

1610
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,000
that's quite interesting

1611
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,680
so if i could just speak to that i think

1612
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,280
there are a couple of things going on

1613
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,240
there so

1614
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,119
i would talk about executive function

1615
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:46,000
well i mean i think it

1616
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,559
one thing that this is a bit of a try

1617
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:49,839
point but

1618
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:52,319
top down is a very ambiguous term um i

1619
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,440
think what where

1620
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,200
so you can mean kind of that can mean

1621
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,799
anything from basically like recurrent

1622
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:57,520
loops

1623
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,000
from higher chords from cortices that

1624
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,720
are higher up the cortical hierarchy

1625
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,000
um to something like top-down attempt

1626
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,240
like a voluntary control of attention

1627
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,240
via executive like fronto-parietal

1628
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,319
networks or something like that

1629
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:13,839
um so those are just different different

1630
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:17,200
phenomena um

1631
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,640
i think in our model control of

1632
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,440
attention

1633
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,880
would presumably be at if if we were to

1634
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,760
build a model of this would be at this

1635
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,240
you you would put the dorsal attention

1636
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:30,799
network

1637
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:32,799
at the second slower time scale of the

1638
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:34,000
model i think

1639
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,480
maybe ryan you can we can speak this as

1640
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,599
well i haven't really thought about this

1641
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:38,640
much

1642
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,720
um i would have been a little more uh

1643
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,440
like executive control network um sort

1644
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,400
of thing i guess

1645
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,839
would have been a little bit more what i

1646
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:49,599
would have um thought about just kind of

1647
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,119
off the top but

1648
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:53,760
um yeah you're probably right i mean

1649
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,440
visual i mean visual attention

1650
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,280
right i mean obviously right the dorsal

1651
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,720
attention network is

1652
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,559
you know kind of defined or originally

1653
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,319
yeah like linked specifically to

1654
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:05,839
uh uh yeah like visual attention and

1655
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:06,640
things like that or

1656
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,200
or kind of quote unquote top-down visual

1657
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,480
attention but

1658
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,920
um in terms of the kind of directing

1659
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,119
right visual attention in a

1660
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,040
goal-directed way um

1661
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,839
then i think i think that would be um

1662
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:23,119
more executive control network for that

1663
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:25,359
i mean on the hallucination point i i

1664
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,960
did my undergrad at macquarie university

1665
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,319
and they have a whole

1666
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,559
hallucination group there within the

1667
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:32,400
cognitive science department and so

1668
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,559
i i just feel like acutely aware of the

1669
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:35,440
fact that i don't know

1670
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,799
anything about it um and it's also an

1671
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:40,880
extremely complicated phenomenon you can

1672
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:41,520
use

1673
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,640
hallucination to like as a model of

1674
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,480
various delusions like you can uh induce

1675
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,240
is it called like mirror basic like

1676
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,760
mirror agnosia where you don't

1677
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,359
no longer recognize yourself mirror

1678
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:54,640
self-agnosia or something where you no

1679
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,240
longer recognize yourself in a mirror

1680
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,720
like it's a really powerful tool but i

1681
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,720
have absolutely no idea how it works and

1682
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,760
so i would be very

1683
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,119
kind of i think it's very tempting

1684
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,319
as kind of modelers and theorists to

1685
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:09,920
kind of go into various experimentalist

1686
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,480
domains

1687
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,480
like hey here's how my overarching

1688
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,799
framework explains your thing

1689
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:19,440
um and i i kind of want to resist that

1690
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,280
um i know a little bit about visual

1691
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,799
consciousness and how expectation all

1692
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,880
that stuff works there but

1693
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,720
hallucination is such a hairy topic i

1694
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,480
just don't know

1695
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,079
yeah i mean i would also i would also

1696
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:31,920
say i mean i mean a few different things

1697
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,520
have been brought up here right but

1698
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,880
i mean in terms of uh it's not it's not

1699
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,480
clear for example but

1700
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,680
the um kind of auditory hallucination

1701
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,079
um story that i was talking about

1702
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:44,960
earlier

1703
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,000
with um um in terms of having

1704
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,240
relatively you know more precise prior

1705
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,520
expectations

1706
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,799
um you know creating a stronger tendency

1707
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:56,559
for auditory hallucinations

1708
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,720
and it's not it's not clear at all that

1709
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,760
that kind of story

1710
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,000
mechanistically is generalizes to other

1711
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,119
domains

1712
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,960
so i mean actually in the individual

1713
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,400
domain there's this whole other body of

1714
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,200
work

1715
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,880
where it looks like people that have

1716
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,359
delusions um

1717
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:13,599
again as part of the sort of as part of

1718
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:14,720
psychosis

1719
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,839
right actually show the opposite

1720
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:18,400
weighting

1721
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,960
in the visual system right so where they

1722
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,680
actually

1723
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,359
um assign too much

1724
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:28,559
precision to low-level bottom-up sensors

1725
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:31,040
bottom-up visual signals you know so

1726
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,720
they end up as these interesting cases

1727
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,559
where they end up um

1728
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:36,000
if you look at eye tracking they end up

1729
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,119
doing um people with uh delusions

1730
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:41,359
um end up actually or psychosis

1731
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:42,400
schizophrenia um

1732
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,760
end up doing uh better at certain

1733
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,200
tasks than healthy people um but worse

1734
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,240
at others

1735
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,440
so like one example of this is um if you

1736
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,880
have people

1737
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,599
just kind of try to follow just visual

1738
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,599
tracking fall a little kind of moving

1739
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:03,200
target um then if that target switches

1740
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:03,839
directions

1741
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:06,280
really quickly um then

1742
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,359
[Music]

1743
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:10,240
the people with psychosis end up

1744
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,119
actually

1745
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:14,400
following uh following it better

1746
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,119
um than healthy people um because

1747
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:18,640
healthy people kind of continue to

1748
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,160
follow it for a little bit

1749
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,760
um after the turn and the kind of

1750
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,440
predicted direction

1751
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,440
um right so prior expectations are kind

1752
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,799
of playing a stronger role

1753
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:28,559
um so they actually do a little better

1754
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,799
whereas if instead you have something

1755
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:31,920
where the um

1756
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,079
where the target temporarily kind of

1757
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:35,040
moves behind

1758
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,599
some kind of barrier um then healthy

1759
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:38,319
people do better

1760
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:39,760
whereas people with schizophrenia kind

1761
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,280
of you know lose it because prior

1762
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,000
expectations

1763
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,040
don't do enough um to keep them kind of

1764
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:45,680
following

1765
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,359
what the trajectory would have been

1766
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:48,799
right as it goes behind the

1767
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:51,119
visual occlusion and there's there's

1768
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:52,799
lots of other cases

1769
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:54,000
um for instance in like the

1770
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,839
proprioceptive domain where people talk

1771
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:57,280
about the same kind of thing where

1772
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,760
people with um schizophrenia actually do

1773
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,680
um better for things like force matching

1774
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:02,799
illusions

1775
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:05,680
and stuff or yeah um force matching

1776
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,319
tasks

1777
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:10,400
um um and i made it this more to the

1778
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,440
story there um but but um but people

1779
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,880
have tried to link that to like um

1780
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,319
delusions about agency

1781
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,319
um and things like that so that's a just

1782
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:19,520
general point being that

1783
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:23,119
um that the the way that uh kind of

1784
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:25,839
computational mechanism is um you know

1785
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:27,599
looks like it happens in in one say

1786
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:28,880
sensory domain

1787
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,119
um can still operate very differently in

1788
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,799
the other sensory domain even

1789
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,440
in the same um in the same disorder

1790
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,960
right in the context of the same like

1791
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,160
psychosis

1792
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,760
um so so these things don't

1793
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,079
don't necessarily they shouldn't be

1794
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:45,760
expected to to generalize

1795
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,200
across the cross domains um is one

1796
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,760
one point and the other the other point

1797
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,480
was um

1798
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,720
you know in relation to you know things

1799
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,400
like hypnosis which

1800
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,440
um i don't know a lot about um as part

1801
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:00,559
of a

1802
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:03,599
textbook chapter um i was

1803
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,440
asked to write a paragraph or two on

1804
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,880
hypnosis so i kind of

1805
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,039
looked into that literature a little bit

1806
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:10,640
um and it's actually pretty messy

1807
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:10,960
they're

1808
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,559
very different there are multiple

1809
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,880
different theories about hypnosis work

1810
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,680
um and i mean one of them you know can

1811
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,640
relate to this idea that um

1812
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,480
that um you know if if the

1813
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,799
hypnotist repeatedly like gives

1814
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:27,839
suggestions

1815
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,960
that are set up such that um

1816
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,599
they will be confirmed right so it's

1817
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:34,160
like

1818
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,839
hold out your the hypnotist says hold

1819
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:38,480
out your arms and then he says

1820
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,079
um your arms are going to start to feel

1821
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:42,319
heavy and then they'll start to fall

1822
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:44,079
right obviously anybody who holds out

1823
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:45,520
their arms they'll eventually start to

1824
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,880
feel heavy and they're they'll you know

1825
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,240
heavier and they'll start to drop just

1826
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,359
as a result of your muscles your

1827
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:51,119
shoulder muscles getting tired

1828
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:52,720
right so if you do a number of those

1829
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,960
things and the kind of uh

1830
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,559
things the hypnotist the predictions

1831
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:58,880
made by the hypnotist are confirmed then

1832
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,359
you know it could be that you're just

1833
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:02,480
coming to assign

1834
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,520
a really high reliability to whatever

1835
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,880
the hypnotist

1836
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,079
says right so so in that case

1837
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:13,039
um if if the hypnotist just comes to be

1838
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,480
assigned really high precision then you

1839
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,000
can just prior expectation

1840
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,480
adjust prior expectations in a way that

1841
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,760
just kind of dominate

1842
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,400
um or can end up having a much stronger

1843
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,000
influence on what you

1844
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,799
do and that's that's kind of one you

1845
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,960
know one idea but again there's there's

1846
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:29,440
um

1847
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,039
several other theories of hypnosis that

1848
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:32,240
just have to do with kind of like

1849
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,520
conforming to

1850
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,520
um kind of social roles and things like

1851
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,680
that that you're told to um

1852
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,760
that you're kind of told to do and i

1853
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,039
mean anyway so

1854
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:42,160
i wouldn't necessarily feel that

1855
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,039
confident um saying much about

1856
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:47,039
about how this relates to hypnosis other

1857
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:49,359
than that in a broad sense

1858
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:52,400
it can involve manipulating um sort of

1859
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,839
tricky ways of manipulating for our

1860
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:55,520
expectations in other in other people

1861
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:56,839
but again i mean even that is pretty

1862
01:03:56,839 --> 01:03:58,400
speculative

1863
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,839
i mean so if i could just quickly throw

1864
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:02,559
something in another complicating factor

1865
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,839
so even within the visual system

1866
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:08,559
having a strong prior in one domain or

1867
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:10,160
doesn't generalize to others this is

1868
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,520
really great paper that just came that

1869
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,960
came out i think last year

1870
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,400
in cognition where they looked at

1871
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,319
representational momentum

1872
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:19,760
moony images and um

1873
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,520
goodness i think there was one other i

1874
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,119
think was illusory contours

1875
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:26,240
and they had one other

1876
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:29,039
top-down expectation kind of paradigm

1877
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:30,079
and

1878
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:31,839
there were large individual differences

1879
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:33,680
between all of them and there were also

1880
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,359
large individual differences in kind of

1881
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:37,680
the effect of prior expectation

1882
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:41,039
across those different tasks um

1883
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:43,839
so i think there's just kind of a lot of

1884
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:44,720
complicating fact

1885
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,559
like moving parts and a lot of this

1886
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:48,000
stuff that we have to deal with when we

1887
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,400
talk about these things

1888
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,319
okay we're going to return to the stack

1889
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:54,799
and go to dean and then a question from

1890
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:57,760
the chat and then adam

1891
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,880
so i'll go back and be ambiguous um so

1892
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,319
when i was looking at your

1893
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:04,160
diagrams and one of the things that

1894
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,240
really i wanted to ask this question but

1895
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,720
we ran out of time last week

1896
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:12,240
um do you think we can say that if a

1897
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,440
person says

1898
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,559
i see this or i do not see that

1899
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:19,760
see this the or yes or no

1900
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,039
um can we can we apply

1901
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:24,960
an idea that there's a certain amount of

1902
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,400
acceptance

1903
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,799
and a certain amount of letting go and i

1904
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:29,599
i kind of

1905
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,480
bundle that under we reconcile or is it

1906
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,079
something completely different i mean

1907
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:36,000
how do you

1908
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,240
how do you look at this now when a

1909
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,960
person's actually

1910
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,280
looking at something and going okay i do

1911
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,640
not see the box

1912
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,200
is it just is it that simple it's a

1913
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,559
simple yes no or do you think there's

1914
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:51,839
something more built into it

1915
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:54,640
um so

1916
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:59,280
how to there is a whole cottage in this

1917
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,559
cottage industry i feel like college

1918
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:02,079
industry might even be an understatement

1919
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:03,119
on how to collect

1920
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:05,839
verbal reports um and the proper ways of

1921
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:06,720
doing it so

1922
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,079
there's like a perceptual awareness

1923
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:10,799
scale where you in some sense have

1924
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:12,480
a description of the content so you have

1925
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,079
i didn't see anything

1926
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:16,160
i maybe saw something but there was no

1927
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,200
specific content

1928
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,359
like you have a vague feeling you saw

1929
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:20,799
something but it was a bit blurry and

1930
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,920
then you had like a full lived

1931
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,440
experience that's one way

1932
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:26,799
you can have people place bets

1933
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:28,000
that's another way you can have people

1934
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,400
do confidence ratings

1935
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,079
lately there's been some incredibly

1936
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:33,839
clever work basically looking

1937
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:36,079
at so just give a shout out to people

1938
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,920
who whose work i really admire like

1939
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:38,880
hakun lao

1940
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,760
and um megan peters have a really great

1941
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,119
paper in e-life

1942
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:45,200
where they basically look show that

1943
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,640
people seem to have

1944
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,559
optimal in the sense of like bayes

1945
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,960
optimal introspective access

1946
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,960
to their own performance so basically

1947
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:58,160
when they are they will

1948
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:02,079
people never behave correctly um

1949
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:03,520
without kind of knowing that they

1950
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,760
behaved correctly as it were if you

1951
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,839
do these like very tightly controlled

1952
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:10,319
experimental situations

1953
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:13,599
um so yeah i think maybe i was a bit

1954
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:14,000
flippant

1955
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,039
before when i said you have to take

1956
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:16,799
reports as foundational i stand by that

1957
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,799
statement but um

1958
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:22,000
there is like years and years and years

1959
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,520
of like careful psychophysics they've

1960
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,119
gone into being like yeah these things

1961
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:27,119
are reliable

1962
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:31,119
um and basically it comes down to

1963
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:33,119
i wouldn't believe some if if someone

1964
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,559
said yeah i see something

1965
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:37,760
but they were getting like 51 like 50

1966
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,440
on a forced choice task about the

1967
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,200
orientation of gabor patch but they were

1968
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:41,920
claiming they would say

1969
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:44,640
i wouldn't believe them generally

1970
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,559
speaking you would expect if you see

1971
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,160
something your performance should

1972
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:52,640
also go up that is not to say however

1973
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:56,400
that you can't have um before

1974
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,720
increased performance without awareness

1975
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,160
there is some convincing evidence

1976
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,760
showing that those two things dissociate

1977
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:02,559
and that's kind of

1978
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:04,880
what we were trying to show here right

1979
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,839
right yeah

1980
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:07,119
okay so hopefully that answers the

1981
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:08,960
question yeah it does

1982
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,359
nice yeah i noticed on this extended

1983
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:13,200
taxonomy the bottom right it's like

1984
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,400
consistent prior

1985
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,799
high attention strong signal it's the

1986
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:17,920
perfect storm

1987
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,960
and then it's 100 seen 100 correct and

1988
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:21,600
then

1989
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,158
again kind of taking it loosely mapping

1990
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:25,920
to our experiences with other

1991
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,799
attention phenomena like if you're sure

1992
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,520
about seeing

1993
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,198
in it of course the way that you tuned

1994
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:32,799
prior or inconsistent

1995
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:35,359
prior uh these are variables that are in

1996
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:36,960
the model so people can play around this

1997
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,000
isn't like a specific

1998
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,198
yes no but just examples of how

1999
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:43,920
rich the phase space is in terms of what

2000
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,120
the model

2001
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,359
can do and what it can capture so here's

2002
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:48,640
the question from the chat

2003
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,399
and then it will go to adam so the

2004
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:52,479
question from the chat is

2005
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:54,560
any thought about the possibility of

2006
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:55,600
using this model

2007
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,399
to investigate lucid dreaming related

2008
01:08:58,399 --> 01:08:59,120
phenomena

2009
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,560
like the failure of implicit

2010
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,158
metacognition while dreaming

2011
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:06,399
thank you so how about dreaming or

2012
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:09,520
lucid dreaming so that stuff is super

2013
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,158
interesting

2014
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:11,600
i mean i don't think this model captures

2015
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,600
that at all except in like the very

2016
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,359
in like a computational sense i don't

2017
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,960
know what task would be modeling

2018
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,640
specifically but like we can

2019
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,080
if we're being a bit metaphorical about

2020
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,600
it um

2021
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:25,439
so presumably i don't know anything

2022
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:27,359
about lucid dreaming i presume it's a

2023
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:28,719
case where basically you

2024
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:30,719
are dreamings you have kind of you're

2025
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:33,279
not just asleep you have kind of a

2026
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:35,120
experience that goes along with it and

2027
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,198
also you are aware of the fact that you

2028
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:39,759
are dreaming

2029
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,719
um that's really interesting i think it

2030
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:43,040
would

2031
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,399
have to come back to the

2032
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,920
i don't know how we one would capture

2033
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,920
metacognition in this framework

2034
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,439
i think that's one thing to say i don't

2035
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,199
know what it would be maybe ryan you

2036
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:56,320
have some thoughts on this but it would

2037
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,080
relate to basically

2038
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:02,719
how how one thinks about metacognition

2039
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:06,080
in these deep temporal models

2040
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:11,440
yeah i mean i mean i mean metacognitive

2041
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,880
itself comes in a bunch of different

2042
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,000
flavors right

2043
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,080
i mean so there's kind of you know

2044
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,840
beliefs about

2045
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,800
uh how good your memory is for example

2046
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:21,520
right it can be

2047
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,520
kind of metacognition it's you know it's

2048
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,280
like beliefs about your beliefs or

2049
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,159
beliefs about

2050
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:28,640
patterns in your attention or there's a

2051
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:29,520
bunch of

2052
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,640
bunch of different types of

2053
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:32,880
metacognition

2054
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,640
right it's just sort of beliefs or

2055
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,920
operations over

2056
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,080
representations of your own cognitive

2057
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,440
processes

2058
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:43,040
so i mean the the tricky part is that

2059
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,040
you kind of have to have a higher level

2060
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,560
that's treating

2061
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,920
what you chose to do uh you know in

2062
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,280
terms of a cognitive

2063
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,840
voluntary cognitive process that

2064
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:54,719
observes that

2065
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:57,760
and then infers

2066
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,120
something about it um and um you know

2067
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,239
the way that that

2068
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:05,760
ends up influencing the

2069
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,000
the the cognitive the cognitive

2070
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,120
operation level

2071
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:11,199
below right the way that that higher

2072
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:13,199
metacognitive level ends up

2073
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:16,719
um setting priors on the lower level um

2074
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:18,640
i'm not sure the right way to think

2075
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,920
about

2076
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,760
that i mean you'd have to look at

2077
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,360
literature on the way metacognition

2078
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:24,159
affects

2079
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:26,480
you know performance and cognitive tasks

2080
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,440
um

2081
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:31,280
which i'm not um i'm definitely not

2082
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,199
one thing to say just very briefly would

2083
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:35,280
just be in the discussion section of our

2084
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,360
paper we discuss alternative models

2085
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,960
um i think probably the model that's

2086
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,640
closest to ours in the literature would

2087
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:40,960
be

2088
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,040
steve fleming's higher or the state

2089
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,719
space model

2090
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:48,480
um and i think there he explicitly

2091
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:49,679
discusses

2092
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:53,600
ignition related phenomena and

2093
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,360
kind of metacognitive inferences about

2094
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,199
the presence or absence of stimuli so i

2095
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:58,400
would say if you're interested in that

2096
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,760
kind of stuff and how to think about it

2097
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,280
in a basic framework look there it's a

2098
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,480
really great paper

2099
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,159
yeah i mean another another one i mean

2100
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:06,880
that comes to mind i know is that um

2101
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,040
there's a paper by um where the first

2102
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,560
author is claus stefan

2103
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,760
um from 2016

2104
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,080
where he talks about um the way you can

2105
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:16,880
apply

2106
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,760
um active inference models to model um

2107
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,159
homeostatic and allostatic

2108
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:24,480
control processes so basically like

2109
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,640
anticipating for example that

2110
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,719
your temperature is going to drop and

2111
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,400
therefore

2112
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,560
increasing temperature body temperature

2113
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,800
a little in advance so that when it

2114
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,199
subsequently drops you stay in a um

2115
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:39,120
within a kind of survivable homeostatic

2116
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,080
range

2117
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,159
um i'm just using temperature here as an

2118
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:45,679
arbitrary example of any kind of

2119
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,239
variable internal bodily variable by

2120
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:50,560
like glucose levels or or hormone levels

2121
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:51,760
or anything like that

2122
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,960
um but um they do

2123
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,360
talk about this level a metacognitive

2124
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,800
level that you can add

2125
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,440
above the allostatic regulation level

2126
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,120
that more or less tracks the

2127
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:06,560
the efficacy or the kind of success

2128
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:10,000
of the allostatic level um and how

2129
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,840
if the allostatic level repeatedly fails

2130
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,040
to keep homeostatic variable or keep

2131
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,880
bodily variables within homeostatic

2132
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,400
ranges then

2133
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,280
the higher level can basically infer

2134
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,600
that allostasis will fail

2135
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,880
um and they show how that can possibly

2136
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,640
lead to certain sorts of symptoms of

2137
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:31,280
depression

2138
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,040
and you have low beliefs about the

2139
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,440
efficacy of your own allostatic

2140
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,560
uh processes um so i mean that's a

2141
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,000
that's a paper that i'd recommend

2142
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,840
looking at for one example of the way

2143
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,679
that you might might apply

2144
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,679
one type of metacognition on top of the

2145
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:47,040
basement

2146
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,600
i also just remember the paper came out

2147
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:50,320
yesterday

2148
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,239
i shared i i sorry i forgot about this i

2149
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:53,440
just shared it i shared it on twitter

2150
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,480
yesterday if you want to

2151
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,239
look um it came out of mike allen's

2152
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:58,560
group um

2153
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,920
i've gotten the first author's name i'm

2154
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,800
really sorry about that um

2155
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,800
but uh they explicitly discuss

2156
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,320
like predictive processing and active

2157
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,640
inference theories of consciousness in

2158
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,080
relation to introception

2159
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,239
and metacognition and they have a whole

2160
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:15,600
discussion of this type of thing so if

2161
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,560
you're interested

2162
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,679
maybe just like check my twitter page

2163
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:23,040
or at mike allen's twitter page

2164
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,080
sounds good um we'll go to adam and then

2165
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,840
anyone else who raises their hands

2166
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,280
hi um perhaps tying a few of these uh

2167
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,719
things together

2168
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:39,840
um i was wondering if with respect to

2169
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,440
hallucinations and

2170
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:44,400
psychosis and forms of delusions if

2171
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:44,960
maybe

2172
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,480
um some of it you could potentially

2173
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,640
model it in terms of um

2174
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:54,640
not having access to

2175
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,280
mental acts so which might have like

2176
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,040
associated efforts copies

2177
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,360
that could potentially like be adjusting

2178
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:02,640
precision

2179
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,120
and or also having uh different

2180
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,320
components of

2181
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,080
the associated mental act which you may

2182
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,920
or may not attribute to you like some so

2183
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:10,480
like

2184
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,960
aspects of enteroceptive inference that

2185
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,199
could lead to senses of like

2186
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:18,320
willing or ownership but then

2187
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,880
by not having access this potentially

2188
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,400
where the access itself

2189
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:26,000
uh of the action generation

2190
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,080
could um basically adjust what you're

2191
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,520
how you're attributing um

2192
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,679
what sense you're making of the

2193
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:38,159
associated perceptual

2194
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,880
events so it's like um how did i say

2195
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:41,520
this so it's like

2196
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,920
if you're uh talking to yourself in

2197
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,520
thought or something like like thought

2198
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:47,199
is in her speech like vygotsky

2199
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:49,600
uh let's talk about like well if you

2200
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,880
don't have access to like

2201
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,920
the generation part and for some reason

2202
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:54,960
i don't know how much it can be

2203
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,880
separated but then like the voice might

2204
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,480
just like appear to you

2205
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,760
in a way where you don't have a sense of

2206
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,600
ownership if there's not like the right

2207
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,719
type of like

2208
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:04,400
maybe intercept of coupling to the

2209
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,800
genera generation process or just like

2210
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,040
a lack of metacognition to contextualize

2211
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,640
it um

2212
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,440
anyways yeah i really like this idea i

2213
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,480
mean one thing

2214
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,320
and one thing to keep keep in mind here

2215
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:19,280
is that you know the

2216
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,520
the the sort of thing that you're

2217
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,480
talking about

2218
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,640
when people have sort of different

2219
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,760
experiences

2220
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,560
of or were there a different contents

2221
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:29,840
and experience i mean basically that's

2222
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:30,880
where you're talking right different

2223
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:31,520
contents

2224
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,560
that can be inexperienced those

2225
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,320
those are just in a model like this

2226
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,840
going to amount to different sorts of

2227
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,040
state spaces

2228
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:42,320
that you can infer posteriors over

2229
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,199
right so you know you can have beliefs

2230
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:46,000
about

2231
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,600
how much ownership you have over your

2232
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,080
body or you can have beliefs about

2233
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:51,679
something going on in your body

2234
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:53,120
interreceptively

2235
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,120
and all those things are just gonna be

2236
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,400
you're gonna have

2237
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:59,520
some sort of afferent signal and you're

2238
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:00,080
gonna

2239
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,159
have some prior expectations obviously

2240
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,199
and then you're going to infer some

2241
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:06,000
posterior over whatever the contents are

2242
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,280
of the thing in question right so so

2243
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:12,159
anything along the lines of what is the

2244
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:13,600
what is the

2245
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,920
content of one thing versus another is

2246
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,600
just going to amount to a particular

2247
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,199
level in a model

2248
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:21,760
that infers posteriors over particular

2249
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:22,960
contents

2250
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,640
right so none of that is going to have

2251
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,719
to do directly with

2252
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:29,840
our model other than the fact that given

2253
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,239
posteriors over any content

2254
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:35,199
um you know if our model were applicable

2255
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:36,000
to that

2256
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,600
you could just treat those contents as

2257
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,920
the lower level right so you'd have

2258
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:40,719
inference over

2259
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:43,120
some content and then our model would

2260
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,640
say something about

2261
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:47,360
um the processes that make that content

2262
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,960
conscious or not

2263
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:52,239
right or consciously accessible or not

2264
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:54,239
so so the only thing that our model

2265
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:56,000
might be able to say is

2266
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,199
if you swap out the you know

2267
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:01,440
square versus squares versus lines in

2268
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,360
our model right uh whatever the beliefs

2269
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:03,840
are

2270
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,520
at the lower level you swap that out

2271
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,040
with representations of some other

2272
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,000
content

2273
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,199
whatever whatever it is you're

2274
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:11,199
interested in you know something about

2275
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:15,040
the body or something about um what uh

2276
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,440
you know what a pattern of what sequence

2277
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,239
of the

2278
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:20,400
speech right that you're hearing or

2279
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,239
anything like that right what

2280
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:25,199
what word you just heard um you know

2281
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:26,880
swap that out as the content of the

2282
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,159
lower level and our

2283
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:29,920
our model might be able to say something

2284
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,360
about the processes that determine

2285
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,320
whether you

2286
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,920
whether those contents become accessible

2287
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,480
or not but beyond that our model doesn't

2288
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,480
have much just that

2289
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,159
yeah i mean if i could say something on

2290
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:42,480
that as well i i really like the idea i

2291
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,120
think just

2292
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,199
along similar lines to ryan because it

2293
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:46,880
just casts like

2294
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,480
decisions about ownership is just having

2295
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,560
access to some content or another and so

2296
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,040
for me

2297
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:54,239
like the essence of any type of

2298
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:55,280
conscious access

2299
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,920
or awareness process is basically

2300
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:58,480
whether it's

2301
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,560
integrated into this temporally deep

2302
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,000
representation

2303
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,800
and in doing so available to all of

2304
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,239
these sub-processes

2305
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:11,040
our global workspace theory um

2306
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:13,760
and so i think this kind of relating

2307
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,679
this to kind of the metacognitive point

2308
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:18,000
i think this is actually a spot where

2309
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,880
maybe this is a difference between

2310
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:24,320
owl theory versus an active inference

2311
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:24,880
theory

2312
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,320
that gave an explicit role for

2313
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,800
metacognition

2314
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,840
um so for me it's just the fact that you

2315
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,360
can be aware that

2316
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,679
it is you're aware of it because it's

2317
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,120
integrated into this representation

2318
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,000
right

2319
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
um whereas maybe higher order person b

2320
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,239
no you have to also infer

2321
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:44,960
that you are seeing it or that i am

2322
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,199
seeing it or something like that

2323
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,400
um and so i i

2324
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:54,400
um i think there's actually like really

2325
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,920
interesting empirical questions that

2326
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:56,400
you're

2327
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,440
what i'm going to say um but i i hope

2328
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,400
that we can kind of

2329
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:03,040
i don't know maybe it would be nice to

2330
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:03,760
see

2331
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:07,280
a discussion of kind of active inference

2332
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,400
theories of visual

2333
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,480
of metacognition versus active inference

2334
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,000
theories of like visual awareness in

2335
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,280
general

2336
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,719
yeah i know if you i know you've written

2337
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:15,840
a lot about kind of different theories

2338
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,040
of consciousness adam so i know if you

2339
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,840
have any thoughts about that

2340
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,199
i mean i know that um you know there's

2341
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:25,520
this preprint um

2342
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,480
by um the first the first authorism is

2343
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,360
smith

2344
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:32,719
lars um well i can't remember

2345
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:36,239
uh uh his first first name but

2346
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:39,040
but uh but his last name is smith um

2347
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:39,440
that

2348
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:43,280
that um does propose a a type of

2349
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:46,159
model of medic dog mission cognition

2350
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:46,719
there's

2351
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:48,480
in theirs attention works a little

2352
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,480
differently than in ours but

2353
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,560
essentially you do have a second level

2354
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,880
that controls a precision parameter

2355
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,760
on the um on the first level and then

2356
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,520
there's a third level in there

2357
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:03,199
that infers things uh about um

2358
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:05,920
control of uh the control of the

2359
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,520
temperature parameter at the first level

2360
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,760
um if i'm remembering right um and they

2361
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:10,719
use it

2362
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:12,400
as a way of the way they talk about it

2363
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,080
is a way to think of um

2364
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,679
like meditation and mindfulness and

2365
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:17,360
things like and things like that

2366
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,920
um which i'm not you know i don't

2367
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:21,120
remember enough detail to

2368
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,800
to say a lot about you know my my

2369
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,560
specific feelings on that but

2370
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,679
that is a an example that i'm aware of

2371
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:28,080
uh

2372
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,000
again it's just a preprint at this point

2373
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,120
but um

2374
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,920
of another attempt to try to model um

2375
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:37,280
something like metacognition

2376
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,560
cool interesting questions adam did you

2377
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,800
want to say something else yep go ahead

2378
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:46,159
um yeah so um

2379
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:47,600
i basically want to throw your model at

2380
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,600
everything

2381
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,280
but um in terms of uh metacognition and

2382
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,280
what i've worked on in the past mostly

2383
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:56,400
i've been focusing

2384
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,560
on like trying to cross-reference

2385
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,239
various theories to see the points of

2386
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:02,239
like overlap and non-overlap

2387
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:04,400
mostly considering like accounts of

2388
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:07,199
dynamic modularity that might apply to

2389
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:09,440
a global neural workspace architecture

2390
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,960
or like integrated information theory

2391
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,159
where you can think of their

2392
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:14,000
complexes of integration those modules

2393
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,159
as themselves being like

2394
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:17,840
do an iit handling of those and seeing

2395
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,000
like where's the overlap basically

2396
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,719
trying to give semantic content to iit

2397
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:23,679
um

2398
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:26,239
via like gnwt is like an architecture

2399
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:27,920
for bayesian model selection

2400
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,040
and the whole thing kind of being

2401
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,120
adjudicated by energy principle

2402
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:34,239
and mostly an active inference not

2403
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:36,320
nearly the technical depth that you have

2404
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,800
i'm only beginning to move into things

2405
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,800
like metacognition

2406
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,760
and uh like higher order forms of

2407
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:44,960
consciousness

2408
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,239
and the ideas are like really uh

2409
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:50,560
speculative like so like one idea is

2410
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:51,520
that like

2411
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:55,040
as you're like um let's say

2412
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:59,199
um imagining like enacting something

2413
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:02,639
you might start out from like generating

2414
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:05,280
like experience from an egocentric

2415
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,639
perspective

2416
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:08,520
but then this enactment would

2417
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,320
auto-associatively

2418
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:13,440
also have third-person allocentric

2419
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,360
representations like

2420
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:16,880
from like the ventral visual stream or

2421
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,800
something like this like you've seen

2422
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:21,280
people or yourself doing similar things

2423
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,199
and so you might then like be able to

2424
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:25,440
get access to in the mind's eye this

2425
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,199
like third person point of view on you

2426
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:28,560
with some unfolding

2427
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,880
like some sort of like moving back and

2428
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,159
forth between

2429
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:34,800
a first person like i guess and the

2430
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,239
models i'm working with like

2431
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:38,800
phenomenal consciousnesses all and and

2432
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,000
accessible consciousness

2433
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,120
there's a sense in which like in a

2434
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,120
rudroff um uh

2435
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,360
projected geometric modeling it's always

2436
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:46,880
from this first person essential point

2437
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,239
of view but then the idea is

2438
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:51,120
you then are looking at an objectified

2439
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:51,920
you

2440
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,159
and this would be part of metacognitive

2441
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:56,480
awareness and contextualizing you

2442
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,480
in terms of like you doing actions and

2443
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,840
then this third-person

2444
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,520
little homunculus doing actions that

2445
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,199
you're seeing in your mind's eye and

2446
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:04,639
moving back and forth

2447
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:06,960
that's like the basic space i'm moving

2448
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,239
into i don't know how much of that's

2449
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:09,120
going to work or

2450
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,520
or how you would model that well i mean

2451
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,320
like one thing

2452
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,520
just kind of kind of kind of um i mean i

2453
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,199
mean again just to just uh i mean when

2454
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:18,159
you think about this

2455
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:20,960
kind of informal terms right then then

2456
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:21,840
and

2457
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:25,120
if you're in some sense um

2458
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:28,239
if you are the content you're describing

2459
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:29,520
as a belief

2460
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:32,560
that you are doing something right

2461
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,280
um so that's just the content in the

2462
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,320
state space right

2463
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,800
so same kind of thing right swap out our

2464
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:39,760
lower level

2465
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,440
with the state space that is beliefs

2466
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:44,800
about what i am doing right

2467
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,800
then it's just the same thing right you

2468
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,320
have a representation about what you are

2469
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:48,880
doing

2470
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,239
and in our model you would either

2471
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:55,040
um you would either gain access to the

2472
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,600
representation of that content or not

2473
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,679
via its integration with this deeper

2474
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:01,120
temporal level

2475
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:04,880
um granted beliefs about what i am doing

2476
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:08,239
you know or not is already right pretty

2477
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:12,000
pretty temporally deep um but were

2478
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,760
those sorts of contents to apply to our

2479
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,440
models and that's what it would say

2480
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:18,639
it would say that um those contents

2481
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:21,920
need to be integrated with this deeper

2482
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:22,800
temporal

2483
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:26,880
uh model that is able to form

2484
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,639
posteriors over something that

2485
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:30,000
incorporates that

2486
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,600
um and uh so again i mean at the end of

2487
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:34,960
the day really it really just comes down

2488
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,400
to this distinction about the content

2489
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,760
being represented

2490
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:40,480
and whether or not the posteriors

2491
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,400
associated with that content

2492
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:45,199
get integrated with the with the higher

2493
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:46,320
with the higher level

2494
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,639
that does the sorts of things that the

2495
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:49,440
higher level

2496
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:53,280
described here can do

2497
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,760
so so it's just a question about whether

2498
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:57,840
something like that is the content

2499
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:00,639
that you want to be uh using in a goal

2500
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:02,000
director we are recording

2501
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,040
um or or or whether

2502
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:08,000
just uh just representations of the of

2503
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,199
the lower level kind of

2504
01:26:09,199 --> 01:26:11,280
visual content right and that being

2505
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:12,639
integrated with this level is

2506
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:14,800
is what's is what's involved so it's me

2507
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,239
again this just has to do with different

2508
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:17,760
levels of representation and what the

2509
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:18,560
contents are

2510
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:21,840
that you're becoming conscious of um so

2511
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,600
oh and by the way i just just uh

2512
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,440
um i just mentioned i looked up the

2513
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:26,639
paper i was mentioning

2514
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:29,360
um so it's it's called towards the

2515
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:30,719
formal neurophenomenology of

2516
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:32,560
metacognition and i'm the first author

2517
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:33,920
is lars sanbed

2518
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,280
smith um just to um

2519
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,840
do justice to uh uh remembering who the

2520
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,280
first author's full name was in the name

2521
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,120
of the paper i was talking about so

2522
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,040
um sorry i think i think you started

2523
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,120
saying something at the same time chris

2524
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:51,199
yeah christopher's then adam

2525
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:52,560
i was going to change the topic very

2526
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,120
slightly but i i was wondering

2527
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:59,120
so how you think about phenomenology or

2528
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,639
phenomenal consciousness because to me

2529
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:02,400
it comes down to the nature of

2530
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,080
the representation that you're gaining

2531
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:07,360
access to so to talk about like

2532
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,400
you talk about the projective

2533
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:09,679
consciousness model which is really cool

2534
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:10,400
work

2535
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:12,480
there this perspectival nature of

2536
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:14,320
consciousness comes from

2537
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,560
the structure of the generative model

2538
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,000
and the fact that they're using this

2539
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,719
projective geometry and that's built

2540
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:22,159
into the structure of the generative

2541
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:23,840
model

2542
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,280
i'm just curious about how you think

2543
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:28,080
about this and how that kind of maps on

2544
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:31,360
to iit because at least as i understand

2545
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:32,719
iit like phenomenal consciousness is

2546
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:34,880
kind of a

2547
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,800
i i've never really been clear how the

2548
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,719
content of consciousness fits into iot

2549
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:39,280
for me

2550
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:42,880
like it's all uh

2551
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,880
um anyway yeah i'm just be interested to

2552
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,159
hear your thoughts how it all fits

2553
01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:47,440
together with like global workspace

2554
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,839
theory

2555
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:53,199
like um yeah i would say there's some

2556
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:55,760
kind of giant begged questions in iot

2557
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:59,120
um i think though it's not nothing

2558
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,760
that they start from um axioms of what

2559
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:02,560
they think should be part of

2560
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,760
phenomenology

2561
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,239
and then work their way to this sort of

2562
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:07,840
way of handling systems

2563
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,920
in terms of i think it's a decent prior

2564
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:11,840
for like what we should look for in like

2565
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,760
physical substrates

2566
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,120
i wouldn't like completely like throw it

2567
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:17,440
off but they then would say

2568
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:20,000
if you have these axioms that

2569
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,400
characterize experience some

2570
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,679
intrinsic existence uh composition

2571
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:28,960
information uh integration exclusion if

2572
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:29,840
you have these uh

2573
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:32,000
different properties then it is

2574
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:32,960
sufficient

2575
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:35,840
to bring about phenomenality because

2576
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,440
they started from phenomenality

2577
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,520
oh no i don't think that follows at all

2578
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,199
um that being said

2579
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:44,239
um i think it does potentially like give

2580
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:45,679
us some prizes and trying to think about

2581
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:47,199
physical and computational

2582
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:48,560
substrates of consciousness so that

2583
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,320
would be like the cross-referencing

2584
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,760
and then the other part would be like

2585
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,440
how do you think so if you're thinking

2586
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:54,080
of

2587
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:56,080
global neural workspace as like

2588
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:58,000
potentially like a trading off

2589
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,560
of modularity as being part of the

2590
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:01,920
physical implementation

2591
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,360
well then the question's like so when do

2592
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,360
you have like larger big modules

2593
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:06,560
functioning as like

2594
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,800
dynamic cores or workspaces and when do

2595
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:10,960
you have like more fragmented like

2596
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,480
local processing so like in theory you

2597
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,239
could get like um

2598
01:29:14,239 --> 01:29:16,239
bayesian model selection with like

2599
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:17,840
discrete updating with like a bunch of

2600
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:18,320
like

2601
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,880
small beta complexes close to the

2602
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:21,840
modalities

2603
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,920
or it could be like this big sprawling

2604
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:25,679
alpha complex that's like

2605
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:28,080
going that's multimodal and all these

2606
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:28,719
different ways

2607
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:30,320
but then like you're moving back and

2608
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:32,000
forth between these like degrees of

2609
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:32,800
synchrony

2610
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,560
seems like iit could potentially be

2611
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:36,320
useful there for

2612
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:38,080
describing that so that was one of the

2613
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:40,320
ideas of that in a relation

2614
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,960
um in terms of like kind of bringing it

2615
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,480
to rudroth

2616
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,159
like for me like the object i would want

2617
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:48,320
that would be like potentially a

2618
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,480
minimal condition for phenomenality

2619
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,239
would be some sort of

2620
01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:56,639
um joint uh distribution over

2621
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:59,280
your body pose and visual spatial

2622
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:00,639
awareness

2623
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:03,520
um as like the minimal thing for me at

2624
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,120
least for human-like consciousness and

2625
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:05,760
like

2626
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:10,560
a series of um basically

2627
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,120
roughly at alpha frequencies a series of

2628
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,600
estimates of that

2629
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,760
and and and then and thinking of this as

2630
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:19,920
iterative bayesian model selection

2631
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:22,239
via a global workspace architecture but

2632
01:30:22,239 --> 01:30:23,840
not necessarily one where there's like

2633
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:24,880
access

2634
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,560
that's like a more sophisticated kind of

2635
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,080
consciousness in terms of you wouldn't

2636
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:28,800
necessarily

2637
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,320
i would call it like it's pretty darn

2638
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:32,080
global you have something like spanning

2639
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:33,600
all the posterior cortex

2640
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,960
but it's not the kind of work space

2641
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:35,920
you're dealing with where you're

2642
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:37,600
actually having knowledge

2643
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,719
and access

2644
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,560
thanks adam so if anyone else

2645
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,320
wants to they can raise their hand

2646
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:47,600
otherwise

2647
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:50,000
i think there was a very good request

2648
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,159
just you did just ask them so let's

2649
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:54,480
mix it up but um there was a very good

2650
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:55,840
request actually if

2651
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:59,040
uh ryan or christopher you could just

2652
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:01,360
look at this part of the figure which i

2653
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,280
know is a structure we walk through in

2654
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:05,120
the model stream as well

2655
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,800
and just kind of map some of these

2656
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,639
bigger ideas that we've been talking

2657
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:09,520
about

2658
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:12,000
to some of the letters just in a way

2659
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,080
where people can now look at this

2660
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:16,000
outline say okay the experiment i'm kind

2661
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,760
of on the page we talked about a bunch

2662
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,760
of visual and interreceptive

2663
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:22,159
kinds of experiments just where did it

2664
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:23,280
map in this

2665
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,600
paper so that people will always be able

2666
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:26,800
to go back to this paper

2667
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:29,520
look at the code and then kind of map

2668
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:30,000
some of these

2669
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,920
bigger metaphors to the experiment that

2670
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:34,719
you did here

2671
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:38,480
um do you want to take this ryan or john

2672
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:39,199
i don't

2673
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:41,199
mean either either way it doesn't

2674
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:42,600
doesn't matter to me

2675
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:43,760
[Music]

2676
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:48,400
go for it um so

2677
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,239
how how detailed you'd like me to go do

2678
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:52,239
you like me to explain what the little

2679
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:54,400
square what the d's and a's and b's and

2680
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,840
s's are and all that stuff

2681
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,360
let's go for all the letters on the

2682
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:58,880
right side and maybe even some on the

2683
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,719
left

2684
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:03,760
all right so this is a

2685
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:05,440
partially observable markov decision

2686
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:09,519
process and it's a hierarchical one

2687
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,560
so at the let's just focus on

2688
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,440
essentially

2689
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,560
let's start at the bottom

2690
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:19,760
o's are observations

2691
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:23,199
and s's are hidden or latent states

2692
01:32:23,199 --> 01:32:25,120
and what the a matrix does is it

2693
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:26,800
provides a mapping

2694
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:29,920
between those two things so circles are

2695
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,360
random variables

2696
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:34,080
and the squares are essentially fac uh

2697
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:34,800
functions

2698
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,960
in this case probability distributions

2699
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,600
that map between those two things so

2700
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,840
the a little arrow going down just says

2701
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:44,320
that that's essentially a

2702
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,800
with that little a superimposed on arrow

2703
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,000
is basically saying

2704
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,760
this that's expressing a conditional

2705
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:51,840
probability distribution saying that

2706
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,719
o observations depends upon the hidden

2707
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:56,400
state

2708
01:32:56,400 --> 01:33:00,080
now as we start to evolve through time

2709
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,400
we need transitions between discrete

2710
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,719
hidden latent states in the world

2711
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:06,800
and those are what's described by b so

2712
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,000
this is something like

2713
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,400
what is the probability that at time one

2714
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,800
uh what's the probability of each hidden

2715
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,679
state at the next time step

2716
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:20,159
and it will describe kind of s at t

2717
01:33:20,159 --> 01:33:23,760
conditioned on s at t minus one

2718
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:26,880
now then what's special about

2719
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:29,440
the hierarchical models is that you have

2720
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:30,400
another layer

2721
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:34,080
on top of that um where

2722
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:36,800
state hidden states at the first level

2723
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:38,480
are now being treated

2724
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:42,159
as observations by the second level

2725
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:44,159
and so the posterior probability at the

2726
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:45,280
first level

2727
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:48,560
is basically acts as an observation

2728
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:52,719
um for the second level a matrix

2729
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:54,960
um and then kind of at the second level

2730
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,400
there should be a d at the first level

2731
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:56,960
too but

2732
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,840
that's fine um basically what this prior

2733
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:00,400
what this

2734
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,880
second level hidden state does is it

2735
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,159
provides

2736
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:09,120
a prior over that first level

2737
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:10,960
and then at the first level you can then

2738
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:13,520
have basically we just have one time

2739
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,360
step at the first level

2740
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,920
um but you can have any amount of time

2741
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:19,120
steps as you want

2742
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:21,040
so if you imagine the metaphor that's

2743
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:22,480
often used is like

2744
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,639
uh the minute versus the hour clock on

2745
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:25,600
the hand

2746
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,040
they're evolving at different time

2747
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:29,920
scales um so you could in this diagram

2748
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:32,159
we show that the second level evolves at

2749
01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:34,080
two time steps for every one time step

2750
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,040
at the first level

2751
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:38,400
at the second level sorry um

2752
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,560
at the second level there are again

2753
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,880
transitions between these latent states

2754
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,480
and that's also where we have policy

2755
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,880
selections that's why we put it up there

2756
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:49,840
so policy selection is essentially if

2757
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:50,719
you imagine

2758
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:53,760
a whole series of hidden markov models

2759
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,119
this is my favorite way of describing

2760
01:34:55,119 --> 01:34:56,880
policy selection so these hidden markov

2761
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,239
models are basically just

2762
01:34:58,239 --> 01:34:59,679
a partial observable markup decision

2763
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:01,520
process without the decision

2764
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:04,480
aspect if you imagine a whole series of

2765
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,560
basically these graphs

2766
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:09,119
and you are deciding what graph kind of

2767
01:35:09,119 --> 01:35:11,199
is going to be my future

2768
01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:13,520
you are trying to find the graph with

2769
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:16,639
the highest model evidence

2770
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,280
that is what computing doing policy

2771
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,719
selection does

2772
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:24,000
so you are choosing the transitions

2773
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,159
that will take you to basically the

2774
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:29,839
graphs of the highest model evidence

2775
01:35:30,159 --> 01:35:32,880
uh i know that brian you want to kind of

2776
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,560
clean up some of that explanation

2777
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:37,760
we're at the shoulders let's

2778
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,880
go to the last few variables yeah

2779
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,960
i

2780
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:50,400
just like chris said right close it's

2781
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:52,080
just your distribution over

2782
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:55,600
policies um g is the um

2783
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:58,639
expected free energy um so that's the

2784
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:00,960
essentially the the function that

2785
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:01,840
decides

2786
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:04,960
right which um what the value is you can

2787
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:05,920
think about it about each

2788
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:09,199
each policy and that is with respect to

2789
01:36:09,199 --> 01:36:12,000
c which is um your preference

2790
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,199
distribution

2791
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:15,119
which is which is essentially the the

2792
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:17,679
thing that specifies which observations

2793
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:19,840
you want and which observations you

2794
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:20,800
don't

2795
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:24,000
um now um somehow i see

2796
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,880
that an e has been placed with an arrow

2797
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,600
down to g

2798
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:31,040
um and that's not correct um e should be

2799
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:33,280
e should be going you should be going

2800
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,119
straight to pi

2801
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:38,400
um if you're going to include e

2802
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:41,040
um i don't think we did anything with e

2803
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,880
in our model so i don't think e needs to

2804
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:43,840
be there

2805
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:47,199
um but um but e if it's

2806
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:50,800
used is just a kind of separate prior

2807
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,560
policies that can encode something like

2808
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,000
habits um

2809
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,159
so it competes with the expected free

2810
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:57,280
energy g

2811
01:36:57,280 --> 01:37:00,400
over policies um to infer what to when

2812
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:01,520
you're inferring what the posterior

2813
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:02,560
river policies

2814
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:06,080
is um so uh

2815
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:07,679
so yeah i mean otherwise i feel like

2816
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:10,560
chris uh i feel like chris described it

2817
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,400
well i mean you know it'd be a little

2818
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:13,840
it's always a little easier if you have

2819
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:14,400
like a

2820
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,400
you know the if you're in control of the

2821
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:17,679
pointers you can actually

2822
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:21,520
you know point to uh

2823
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:23,199
i think you also asked us to relate this

2824
01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:25,119
to an experiment to her paradigm

2825
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:28,719
so if we maybe briefly click down to

2826
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:30,639
figure two what you've labeled as figure

2827
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:32,480
2 there so we can just look at that so

2828
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,000
the idea here is that there was

2829
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,840
a forwards mask

2830
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,199
at the beginning of the paradigm this

2831
01:37:39,199 --> 01:37:40,880
was just a series of lines and there

2832
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,000
were these kind of stimuli on the

2833
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,199
outside

2834
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:45,840
at the second time step in the task the

2835
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:48,239
original like simulated task

2836
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:51,440
they on some trials the square kind of

2837
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:51,760
was

2838
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:53,520
self-organized the sum of the lines kind

2839
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:55,920
of self-organized into a square

2840
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:58,159
so i either in our discrete state space

2841
01:37:58,159 --> 01:38:00,880
model a square was present or it wasn't

2842
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,719
and in the third time step it was just

2843
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:04,480
replaced by more lines

2844
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:06,320
and then afterwards we asked the agent

2845
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,400
to construct a report

2846
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:11,840
of that so basically at

2847
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,920
you can think of the first level of the

2848
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:15,520
model as

2849
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:17,920
being all the features of the stimulus

2850
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:19,440
and also the location

2851
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,840
of attention so this might be something

2852
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:24,000
like saliency maps in posterior parietal

2853
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,679
cortex which are directing where

2854
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:29,040
attention is being pointed to

2855
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:30,719
you might have and then you might have

2856
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:32,080
the features of the stimulus which are

2857
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:34,560
represented in various places

2858
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:38,080
at the second level we now have our this

2859
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,520
is basically our fronto-parietal

2860
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,199
cortices

2861
01:38:41,199 --> 01:38:45,119
this is tracking the evolution of states

2862
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:46,639
at the first level so it's

2863
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:49,360
tracking that at the first time step

2864
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:50,080
there was

2865
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:52,239
lines presented at the second time step

2866
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:53,199
there was

2867
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:55,280
a square presented maybe it maybe it was

2868
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:56,719
maybe it was present maybe it wasn't

2869
01:38:56,719 --> 01:38:58,080
and at the third time step there was

2870
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:59,920
more lines and you can imagine in like a

2871
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:02,000
real task all of that unfolds in a space

2872
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,800
of about a second

2873
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,760
yeah so you can think about it i mean

2874
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:08,560
like

2875
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:11,199
yeah the second level is really the the

2876
01:39:11,199 --> 01:39:13,040
content in question that it's inferring

2877
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:13,360
is

2878
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,920
is the sequence right it's not whether

2879
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:16,719
the square

2880
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:19,119
it's whether it was lines square lines

2881
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:21,440
or just lines lines lines

2882
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:26,080
um and so it's another

2883
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,239
and so if you're thinking about where

2884
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:30,080
experience lives obviously we don't

2885
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:32,080
experience a sequence right

2886
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:33,520
i think and i think ryan i've been

2887
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:34,719
chatting about this a lot lately because

2888
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:36,560
it relates to work we're currently doing

2889
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:38,719
but i think what's going on is that what

2890
01:39:38,719 --> 01:39:40,159
we experience are essentially like

2891
01:39:40,159 --> 01:39:43,360
the updates to our second level beliefs

2892
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:46,159
and that's really crucial so the reason

2893
01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:47,840
why it's crucial is because

2894
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,560
we know empirically that kind of what

2895
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:51,360
could be

2896
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,960
we might describe as brain processes

2897
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,560
they're at the first level

2898
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:56,159
of the model these can be either

2899
01:39:56,159 --> 01:39:59,280
conscious or they or not

2900
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:03,199
um and contents that are

2901
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:05,040
conscious when you are conscious of

2902
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:06,719
something it has all of these really

2903
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:08,560
important functional consequences

2904
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:10,800
so here it might be kind of being able

2905
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,159
to see it for report

2906
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:14,320
maintain its report but also if i see

2907
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:16,159
something i can then voluntarily

2908
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:17,760
maintain it in memory for as long as i

2909
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:20,239
want as long as i don't get distracted

2910
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:21,760
like there are limits on like human

2911
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:25,040
psychology um

2912
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:26,159
but that that's kind of a really

2913
01:40:26,159 --> 01:40:27,760
important function that's enabled by

2914
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:30,159
being conscious of something

2915
01:40:30,159 --> 01:40:32,800
right and that allows us to do things

2916
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:35,280
like construct reports of our experience

2917
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:37,440
or even i i think by report i just mean

2918
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:38,639
something very general

2919
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:40,239
it could be in this model we kind of

2920
01:40:40,239 --> 01:40:41,520
have the toy thing of being able to like

2921
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:42,719
put a sentence together

2922
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:44,800
but it could also be more more

2923
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:45,760
empirically real

2924
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,600
um in terms of empirical paradigm will

2925
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:49,440
just be like hitting a button

2926
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:51,440
or doing a confidence tar doing a

2927
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:52,880
confidence interval or something like

2928
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,040
that

2929
01:40:56,639 --> 01:40:59,199
cool thank you for that interesting

2930
01:40:59,199 --> 01:40:59,840
answer

2931
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:02,639
we'll have um stephen and then adam and

2932
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:03,920
then anyone else who wants to raise

2933
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:04,480
their hand

2934
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:06,800
and also any last questions from a live

2935
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:08,400
chat as we kind of

2936
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:11,440
slowly land the plane

2937
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:15,360
yeah um i was just going to ask in

2938
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:17,360
relation to those lines and the way that

2939
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:18,000
the square

2940
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,280
appears like you said so this this is

2941
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,440
actually like a graphic representation

2942
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:24,880
but when someone looks at it

2943
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:26,480
there's probably some special device

2944
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:28,480
that you've got that represents this is

2945
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:29,679
it like

2946
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:32,960
that the lines rotate um to be

2947
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:34,800
and at some point and it just happens

2948
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:36,400
they rotate such that they line up and

2949
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:38,000
then they un-rotate or

2950
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,600
and just one other question is why

2951
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,360
didn't you use negative space

2952
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:43,840
like you like say they line up to make

2953
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:44,960
you know like a

2954
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:46,960
a negative space square i just wondered

2955
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:48,080
whether that

2956
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:51,040
relates to the choice of how it pops in

2957
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:52,320
and out of

2958
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:54,800
perceptual punch sorry phenomenological

2959
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:55,679
awareness

2960
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:58,840
phenomenological consciousness or access

2961
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:00,560
consciousness

2962
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:03,199
um so basically this is just a very in

2963
01:42:03,199 --> 01:42:04,159
our model

2964
01:42:04,159 --> 01:42:07,280
we have discrete hidden states which are

2965
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:09,119
categorical distributions

2966
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:12,159
which are lines or squares

2967
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:15,280
and external states which are red and so

2968
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:16,719
this is kind of just a graphical

2969
01:42:16,719 --> 01:42:18,239
representation of a way to think about

2970
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:19,119
that but it has

2971
01:42:19,119 --> 01:42:20,400
really nothing to do with how it works

2972
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:23,760
mathematically um

2973
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:25,840
then in terms of actually the empirical

2974
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:26,960
task

2975
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:28,480
like this is this is a task that we

2976
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:30,480
basically like borrowed from michael

2977
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:31,360
pitts

2978
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:34,560
um who's a really done he's a cognitive

2979
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:36,239
neuroscientist on a really important

2980
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:40,080
work in the area of visual consciousness

2981
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:42,320
and as for why they chose to kind of

2982
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:44,560
have these i guess the i think

2983
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:46,560
from memory there are videos attached to

2984
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:48,960
this paper from memory i think the lines

2985
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:49,679
just kind of

2986
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:52,159
they jitter around and then occasionally

2987
01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:53,360
a subset of them

2988
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:55,360
will all line up into a square and then

2989
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:57,920
go back to like jittering

2990
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:01,199
um as to why they did that versus other

2991
01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:02,960
methods like

2992
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:05,520
i don't know really they definitely are

2993
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:07,280
subtle things you can do to a stimulus

2994
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:08,880
which have major impacts on whether

2995
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:09,360
you're

2996
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:10,960
conscious access to it or not but the

2997
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:12,159
phenomenon of the inattentional

2998
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:13,679
blindness is super general

2999
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:15,760
like these are you can have people so

3000
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:18,480
the really famous example is

3001
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:19,760
that everyone gets shown in like

3002
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,679
undergrad psych is the

3003
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:23,600
ever up there's you have your tracking

3004
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:24,960
whether a group people playing

3005
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,400
basketball and you ask how many

3006
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,080
how many times does someone like a white

3007
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:30,159
shirt get past a ball or something like

3008
01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:30,880
that

3009
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:33,119
and your attention is distracted so kind

3010
01:43:33,119 --> 01:43:34,480
of consumed with that

3011
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:38,239
that uh a bear or a gorilla

3012
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:39,920
can like walk into the middle of the

3013
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,360
screen being the dead center of your

3014
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:42,000
fovea

3015
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,159
wave at you and then walk away and then

3016
01:43:44,159 --> 01:43:45,199
about 50

3017
01:43:45,199 --> 01:43:48,080
of people don't see it at all um and

3018
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:49,600
that's really well replicated across a

3019
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:50,320
bunch of

3020
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,400
um or they don't report seeing and i

3021
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:54,000
think i should say i think there's some

3022
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,360
there's some debate about whether this

3023
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,280
is a memory phenomenon or any of that

3024
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:59,360
there's lots of subtleties there but

3025
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:00,719
um so hopefully that answers the

3026
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:02,560
question yep oh

3027
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:05,440
also one advantage and one rationale for

3028
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:06,239
these pure

3029
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:08,560
modeling papers that we're discussing

3030
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:09,440
today is

3031
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:10,960
the space of the possible human

3032
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:13,040
experiments or even any other kind of

3033
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:14,400
real world experiments

3034
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,719
is very limited it's very limited what

3035
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:17,920
you can actually have

3036
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:21,360
a real set of humans do and so

3037
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:23,520
it's great to have tools that help us

3038
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:24,639
explore

3039
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:26,320
some of the patterns that we're looking

3040
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:27,760
for and understand

3041
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:30,800
how variability and do statistical

3042
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,480
uh calculations like how many

3043
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:34,719
participants might we need of a given

3044
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:36,400
uh variability range if we want to

3045
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:38,320
capture such and such an effect without

3046
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:40,560
distorting it this way that's critical

3047
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:42,239
information and if you don't have the

3048
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:42,800
model

3049
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:44,719
then the experimental design phase is

3050
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:46,000
totally blind

3051
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,040
and it's a very um shot in the dark and

3052
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:49,840
so this helps

3053
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:52,159
inform structures for even thinking

3054
01:44:52,159 --> 01:44:52,960
about

3055
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:55,520
how to design human experiments for

3056
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:56,560
example

3057
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:58,000
as we're talking about here with visual

3058
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,679
awareness but it could be for other

3059
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:00,960
kinds of experiments

3060
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:03,600
so adam and then anyone else who wants

3061
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,679
to make a comment

3062
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:08,880
see you later alex bye adam

3063
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:11,920
uh hi um i'd be curious in uh

3064
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:14,320
knowing more of your thoughts on the

3065
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:16,080
potential i guess uh

3066
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:18,480
richness or lack thereof of experience

3067
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:20,239
so like at one point like

3068
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:23,679
could consciousness be phenomenal or

3069
01:45:23,679 --> 01:45:24,800
access

3070
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:28,880
more experience as a series of snapshots

3071
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:30,800
that are like static sequential but we

3072
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,880
don't know it like a flip book

3073
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:35,520
or is it more like a continuous stream

3074
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:35,920
like

3075
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:37,600
if you're getting this discreet updating

3076
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:39,600
are these updates over like

3077
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:42,080
like the agent and like motion like if

3078
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:43,520
you take like a camera sometimes in your

3079
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:45,440
phone there's like a little brief like

3080
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:47,280
forward head like look ahead and back

3081
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:48,639
but like

3082
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:50,800
what would be the nature of these uh

3083
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:53,520
discrete updates

3084
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:56,719
yeah i mean i know the like i'm trying

3085
01:45:56,719 --> 01:45:57,600
to remember

3086
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:00,880
i know um and i remember reading um

3087
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:05,520
dana hans uh book um a few years ago

3088
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:07,840
and there is there is some work i think

3089
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:08,639
showing

3090
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:10,000
you know there are kind of there's like

3091
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,679
a minimal time for like

3092
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:14,400
essentially updates to the um to the

3093
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,040
content

3094
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:16,400
of consciousness to have some kind of

3095
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:18,719
discrete character to them i don't um

3096
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:20,159
i don't remember what psychological

3097
01:46:20,159 --> 01:46:21,920
refractory period

3098
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:22,880
yeah do you know what that do you

3099
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:24,800
remember the actual like milliseconds i

3100
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:25,440
can't remember

3101
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:27,360
like 50 milliseconds or something like

3102
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,280
that yeah i don't i don't remember a fan

3103
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:30,159
but there is

3104
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:32,639
there is something you know like that

3105
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:33,760
maybe might be

3106
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:36,159
you know like similar to like a refresh

3107
01:46:36,159 --> 01:46:37,520
rate or something like that

3108
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:39,600
um but i yeah i don't remember too much

3109
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:41,119
about that off hand

3110
01:46:41,119 --> 01:46:43,440
um but but i mean one thing you know one

3111
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:44,320
thing to say

3112
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:46,800
is that um you know because you know

3113
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,960
there are these sorts of discrete

3114
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,199
updates in our model but i mean it's

3115
01:46:51,199 --> 01:46:53,440
also good to remember that the

3116
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:55,199
the higher level representation is

3117
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:56,800
specifically about this

3118
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:00,400
um sequence right um which is

3119
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:02,320
integrated in a sense that the

3120
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:04,719
hypothesis is about a whole sequence

3121
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:06,719
that doesn't necessarily need to be

3122
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:08,320
thought about as having sort of discrete

3123
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:10,800
chunks to it right it's just this tingle

3124
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,800
uh just a single hypothesis about what

3125
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,480
the what the

3126
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:16,560
whole sequence was and so you might

3127
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:17,600
think about that

3128
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:18,800
right as having a more kind of

3129
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:21,280
continuous character to it despite the

3130
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:22,239
fact that

3131
01:47:22,239 --> 01:47:25,280
it's it is updated in some ultimately

3132
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:26,159
discrete

3133
01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:27,440
fashion you know and kind of these

3134
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:30,320
really fast bins um

3135
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:33,040
you can think about it that way um but

3136
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:33,600
uh

3137
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:35,600
but and in terms of richness i mean to

3138
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:38,159
me i mean i just think of

3139
01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:40,639
i i just tend to think of rich as

3140
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:41,520
meaning

3141
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:44,480
there are more precise features right

3142
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:45,679
there's more features that are more

3143
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:46,880
precise

3144
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:50,320
um at the at the lower level right

3145
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:53,600
so instead of just you know a lines or a

3146
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:54,400
square

3147
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:57,760
right at our you know in our example

3148
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:00,800
um there could be a ton of different

3149
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,880
lower level representations

3150
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:05,600
about color and shape and size and you

3151
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:07,280
know all these sorts of things

3152
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:10,400
um that are represented

3153
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,560
in some sort of joint way right and

3154
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:14,080
become accessible

3155
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:16,080
um and and so i mean that's one way to

3156
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:18,639
think about richness is just what

3157
01:48:18,639 --> 01:48:20,239
what are all the things being

3158
01:48:20,239 --> 01:48:22,719
represented that become access

3159
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:26,800
that become accessible um together um

3160
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:29,440
but i don't know they used to ask a

3161
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:30,880
question actually there about the

3162
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:32,480
continuous modeling

3163
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:34,159
is it possible that active inference

3164
01:48:34,159 --> 01:48:36,000
could have a continuous

3165
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,880
mode um i know that it would get rid of

3166
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,400
a lot of the discrete benefits and the

3167
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,000
sequential message passing or maybe

3168
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:42,320
other

3169
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:43,600
heuristics but could there be a

3170
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:47,199
continuous format continuous timer space

3171
01:48:47,199 --> 01:48:49,840
yeah there are continuous state space

3172
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:52,320
models and there are also mixed models

3173
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:54,480
um you know mixed models are kind of

3174
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:56,320
especially nice and probably a lot more

3175
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:56,960
realistic

3176
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:00,239
here um you know because visual visual

3177
01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:01,199
input

3178
01:49:01,199 --> 01:49:02,639
a lot of the things that are represented

3179
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:04,320
by the visual system are continuous

3180
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:07,440
right like uh motion for example is

3181
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:08,159
continuous

3182
01:49:08,159 --> 01:49:10,400
brightness um you know all these all

3183
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:11,520
these sorts of things

3184
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:15,440
um and so those can be those can be

3185
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:18,480
um perceived and represented

3186
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:20,480
in a continuous scale at the lower level

3187
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:21,760
but still get

3188
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:24,400
passed up to dispute representations at

3189
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:25,520
the higher level

3190
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:27,440
um we didn't do that here for simplicity

3191
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:29,119
but you could

3192
01:49:29,119 --> 01:49:32,159
sorry um i was just to clarify

3193
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:34,159
i was in scaling active inference we did

3194
01:49:34,159 --> 01:49:36,000
talk about the continuous state space

3195
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,599
i was just wondering if it's possible to

3196
01:49:37,599 --> 01:49:39,679
have a continuous time

3197
01:49:39,679 --> 01:49:41,360
active inference model rather than a

3198
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:44,320
discrete time model of t123

3199
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:46,159
just just bringing it up okay but then

3200
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:47,599
christopher and then blue

3201
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:50,320
so yeah three things so just quickly to

3202
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:51,360
answer your question daniel

3203
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:53,520
um so hidden markov model is just like a

3204
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:54,880
super general thing it's basically just

3205
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:56,639
when you have a markov chain

3206
01:49:56,639 --> 01:49:59,760
and but you have but each state of the

3207
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:00,639
markov chain

3208
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:03,920
links to some outcome those outcomes can

3209
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:07,280
then both the outcomes

3210
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:10,159
and the latent states can be continuous

3211
01:50:10,159 --> 01:50:12,000
when you have a discrete latent state

3212
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,840
continuous outcome you end up with a

3213
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:14,880
gaussian mixed

3214
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:16,400
with like basically what ends up being a

3215
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,800
mixture of gaussian's model

3216
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:21,840
um and when you have if you have

3217
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:23,520
continuous states you end up with

3218
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:26,159
uh i think you basically end up with a

3219
01:50:26,159 --> 01:50:28,239
kalman filter

3220
01:50:28,239 --> 01:50:29,599
and you can stack those on top of each

3221
01:50:29,599 --> 01:50:30,880
other and do all the same things it's

3222
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:32,239
just

3223
01:50:32,239 --> 01:50:33,840
yeah for all the reasons you say things

3224
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:35,360
get really complicated when you start to

3225
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:36,880
move to continuous time

3226
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:40,880
and um

3227
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:42,560
but i completely agree with ryan i

3228
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,960
actually i think there are

3229
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:47,840
computational there are functional

3230
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:48,639
reasons

3231
01:50:48,639 --> 01:50:50,960
to think that decision making is

3232
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:52,960
discrete and so at the decision making

3233
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:54,159
the level of decision making

3234
01:50:54,159 --> 01:50:55,760
computationally speaking we should use

3235
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:57,440
discrete state space models

3236
01:50:57,440 --> 01:51:02,159
i also think that at a certain level

3237
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:04,080
we need continuous state spaces

3238
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:05,360
obviously we represent

3239
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:07,840
continuous quantities and i think thomas

3240
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:09,440
parr we've chatted about this before in

3241
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:10,800
the model stream but thomas par has a

3242
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:12,080
really nice paper on kind of the

3243
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:13,679
discrete continuous interface and that's

3244
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:14,960
something i'm actually really interested

3245
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:16,480
in i'm not sure

3246
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:17,920
i don't know to what extent we should

3247
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:20,320
take these things as

3248
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:23,520
idealizations or as um general kind of

3249
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:25,199
neurophysiological predictions i think

3250
01:51:25,199 --> 01:51:26,480
that's a really

3251
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:28,320
i'm super interested in that in other

3252
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,080
words but i don't know

3253
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:31,760
another thing to say though is that it's

3254
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:33,280
not as though

3255
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:36,400
only um only

3256
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:39,199
action you know only action selection

3257
01:51:39,199 --> 01:51:39,920
has to do with

3258
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:43,119
um discrete state spaces there there are

3259
01:51:43,119 --> 01:51:44,480
possibly a lot of

3260
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:47,360
higher level um representational things

3261
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:48,719
that are also industry so for instance

3262
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:50,159
like concepts

3263
01:51:50,159 --> 01:51:53,199
right like i can i can have a bunch of

3264
01:51:53,199 --> 01:51:55,119
continuously represented lower level

3265
01:51:55,119 --> 01:51:56,320
visual features

3266
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:58,080
but i can use those to infer something

3267
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:00,000
discrete as well like for instance

3268
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,679
that those features correspond to my

3269
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:03,280
concept of a dog

3270
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:05,679
right or my concept of a banana or you

3271
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:06,400
know whatever

3272
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,159
right because we do have these discrete

3273
01:52:08,159 --> 01:52:10,239
categories that we map on

3274
01:52:10,239 --> 01:52:14,159
patterns of continuous features too um

3275
01:52:14,159 --> 01:52:15,440
and i mean that's a that's a kind of

3276
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:16,480
whole another discussion i think we

3277
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:18,159
talked about abruptly last time right

3278
01:52:18,159 --> 01:52:20,159
gaining conscious access to the visual

3279
01:52:20,159 --> 01:52:22,000
features versus gaining conscious access

3280
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,159
to the fact that it is a dog

3281
01:52:24,159 --> 01:52:25,840
right so those are different levels of

3282
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:27,280
representation that

3283
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:30,719
can be attended to and you know may be

3284
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:31,920
able to kind of

3285
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:34,480
uh independently or semi-independently

3286
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:35,760
be accessible

3287
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:39,280
um separately um

3288
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:41,280
so but that's just i just want to point

3289
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:43,280
out that not everything

3290
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:45,679
not everything is going to be continuous

3291
01:52:45,679 --> 01:52:46,719
um

3292
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:49,199
in in perception when when sort of

3293
01:52:49,199 --> 01:52:50,560
passed probably

3294
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:52,880
and that's where yeah in fact as you can

3295
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:54,159
see that's where a lot of category

3296
01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:55,119
theory discussion

3297
01:52:55,119 --> 01:52:57,040
comes into play let's do blue then

3298
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:58,560
christopher for

3299
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:02,000
final thoughts so

3300
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,840
i i know like we operate under the

3301
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:06,159
assumption that uh the visual like we

3302
01:53:06,159 --> 01:53:06,800
perceive

3303
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:09,199
things continuously in visual space but

3304
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:11,520
i mean really the input is like 60 hertz

3305
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:12,880
right so

3306
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:15,360
i mean theoretically like this thing

3307
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:17,760
this object is consistently a dog but if

3308
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:19,199
it's like flashing back and forth to a

3309
01:53:19,199 --> 01:53:19,840
cat

3310
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:21,840
at sub-perceptible levels like we

3311
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:23,920
wouldn't know right so so i mean

3312
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:25,599
i think anything can be modeled in

3313
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:27,280
discrete um

3314
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:29,040
chunks if you break the chunks small

3315
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:31,760
enough pieces

3316
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:34,159
yeah yeah i've sometimes seen people

3317
01:53:34,159 --> 01:53:34,880
like

3318
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:37,599
make be a bit smarmy about this when

3319
01:53:37,599 --> 01:53:37,920
they

3320
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:39,679
um someone says like oh discreet state

3321
01:53:39,679 --> 01:53:41,920
space is unrealistic and the comeback is

3322
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:42,960
always like mate like

3323
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:45,199
you can always discretize things up to

3324
01:53:45,199 --> 01:53:46,719
some arbitrary level and then discrete

3325
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:48,800
state spaces work fine

3326
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:51,119
um i know i actually think that's a bit

3327
01:53:51,119 --> 01:53:52,880
of a dodge to be honest because the way

3328
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:54,560
we're using these discrete state space

3329
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:56,560
models is in like an ultra discrete kind

3330
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:57,440
of way right

3331
01:53:57,440 --> 01:54:00,320
so i think that if we had like if we had

3332
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,159
a hidden markov model

3333
01:54:02,159 --> 01:54:05,040
where we had like

3334
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:07,920
six a 60 hertz equivalent or something

3335
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:09,360
that would just be ridiculous like you

3336
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:10,800
should just work in continuous state

3337
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:12,239
spaces at that point like

3338
01:54:12,239 --> 01:54:14,800
the the the computational and conceptual

3339
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:16,719
advantages of working in a continuous

3340
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:20,000
discrete state space are gone it's

3341
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,560
so much it would be so difficult it's a

3342
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:23,280
really nice

3343
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:25,199
question though and it's like if you do

3344
01:54:25,199 --> 01:54:27,199
make it a finer and finer granularity

3345
01:54:27,199 --> 01:54:29,520
you keep some of the really big benefits

3346
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:32,480
of splitting and sometimes it's actually

3347
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:34,400
easier to even do like a protein folding

3348
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,480
they'll do a time step of the tiniest

3349
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:37,679
tiniest amount

3350
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:39,920
and do millions of time steps are tiny

3351
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:40,800
because it's still

3352
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:43,920
easier to fit that ultra rich

3353
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:46,159
discrete time model with actual time

3354
01:54:46,159 --> 01:54:46,960
steps that can be

3355
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:49,920
clustered on different computers rather

3356
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:50,480
than

3357
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:53,599
re-write the whole base to do continuous

3358
01:54:53,599 --> 01:54:54,800
modeling so i agree

3359
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:56,719
it's not like continuous is simply

3360
01:54:56,719 --> 01:54:57,920
better and

3361
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:59,599
it really relates deeply to how we think

3362
01:54:59,599 --> 01:55:01,199
about the continuum and the

3363
01:55:01,199 --> 01:55:02,239
infinitesimal

3364
01:55:02,239 --> 01:55:04,159
and so it's really an interesting area

3365
01:55:04,159 --> 01:55:05,360
for active

3366
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:07,760
so steven and then any other closing

3367
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:10,239
comments

3368
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:12,800
yeah i suppose if we also were to go

3369
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:14,239
back into the physics of it

3370
01:55:14,239 --> 01:55:16,719
you know with active inference as a way

3371
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:19,599
of like if vision is

3372
01:55:19,599 --> 01:55:22,880
feeling the surfaces out there

3373
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:25,119
rather than it being an input signal

3374
01:55:25,119 --> 01:55:26,880
even if we have these brain waves some

3375
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:28,480
of that might be an artifact of

3376
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:30,400
cognitive science which has got like the

3377
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:31,360
input process

3378
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:34,159
output at some level it's it's

3379
01:55:34,159 --> 01:55:36,320
extracting like alex constant talks

3380
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:37,040
about

3381
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:40,159
extracting you know information

3382
01:55:40,159 --> 01:55:43,280
from quantum noise noise

3383
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:45,440
you know random fluctuations and all

3384
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:47,199
this sort of stuff so

3385
01:55:47,199 --> 01:55:49,199
you know there's it could be it could be

3386
01:55:49,199 --> 01:55:50,320
that discrete

3387
01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:54,719
state space is kind of you know

3388
01:55:54,719 --> 01:55:58,239
sort of also because there is quite

3389
01:55:58,239 --> 01:55:59,520
choppy what's coming in

3390
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:01,920
and at some point inferences have to be

3391
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:04,400
made that makes it more like a signal

3392
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:06,719
if that makes sense now i'm just i'm

3393
01:56:06,719 --> 01:56:08,560
just putting that out there just to

3394
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:10,239
that as another layer at the lower

3395
01:56:10,239 --> 01:56:14,159
levels of the retina and stuff like that

3396
01:56:14,159 --> 01:56:16,880
good any last comments otherwise this

3397
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:17,599
was super

3398
01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:20,400
interesting i guess a closing question

3399
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:21,840
for the authors would just be

3400
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:25,280
when when's the next uh episode in this

3401
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:26,800
paper saga

3402
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:29,520
or what's the next what's the next thing

3403
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:31,760
you're excited about here

3404
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:35,360
um we have we have another paper that's

3405
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:36,800
kind of i don't know maybe like

3406
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:38,400
three-quarters done or something like

3407
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:40,840
that that's kind of the

3408
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:43,840
next

3409
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:47,760
yeah so they're done it's an expanded

3410
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:48,480
model that

3411
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:51,760
does a lot more with um so it allows for

3412
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:52,480
a no report

3413
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:55,679
paradigm and um selected selective

3414
01:56:55,679 --> 01:56:57,280
attention and working memory maintenance

3415
01:56:57,280 --> 01:56:58,320
are our explicit

3416
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:00,800
policies um in the updated one there's a

3417
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,639
number of other advantages but

3418
01:57:02,639 --> 01:57:05,280
you know it's coming soon yeah i think

3419
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:06,880
it's a matter of uh

3420
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:10,719
me riding it really sorry

3421
01:57:10,719 --> 01:57:14,719
wow too real but

3422
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:16,560
thanks everyone for joining this is

3423
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:18,080
really fun for

3424
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:21,840
18 overall and we look forward to

3425
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:24,880
probably seeing you again for 19

3426
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:26,960
and beyond thanks to all the

3427
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:28,080
participants you can

3428
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:30,480
fill out the survey for feedback in your

3429
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:31,760
events

3430
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:34,800
calendar invitation otherwise

3431
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,400
we'll uh be talking through other

3432
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:38,080
channels so thanks everyone

3433
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:41,840
see you later thanks
