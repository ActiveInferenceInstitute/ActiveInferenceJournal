1
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:09,599
hello and welcome

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,080
i think that we're going now this is the

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,360
active inference live stream

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,320
it's active inference live stream 18 on

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,960
march

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,199
17 2021 welcome to the active inference

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,160
lab everyone

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,039
we are a participatory online lab that

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,080
is communicating

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,400
learning and practicing applied active

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,080
inference you can find us at any of

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,720
these links

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,160
here this is a recorded and an archived

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:34,960
live stream

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,640
so please provide us with feedback so

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,040
that we can improve on our work

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,559
all backgrounds and perspectives are

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,960
welcome here and we'll be using good

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,200
video etiquette for live streams and

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,559
stephen thanks so much for

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,800
joining always awesome to have you on

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,000
for the conversations

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and uh this will be very fun convo

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,800
here looking at the calendar we can see

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,079
at the short and linked that we're

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,280
down in the end of march 2021 in

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,799
number 18 which is going to be

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,720
about the paper the predictive global

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,240
neuronal workspace

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,080
a formal active inference model of

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,680
visual consciousness

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,880
by christopher white and ryan smith

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,000
and this video in 18.0 is going to be

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,479
about

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,520
setting the context for 18.1 and 0.2

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,439
whether participating in these

37
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,280
discussions with the authors

38
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,720
if you're listening to this before those

39
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,840
events happen or contextualizing

40
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,159
um in sort of a bi-directional way for

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,280
listening to those later

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,119
discussions so if you're in the active

43
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,720
inference community this might be

44
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,400
exposing you to some new questions and

45
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,360
perspectives

46
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,560
if you're from outside the active

47
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,840
inference community or you're not

48
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,799
familiar with it

49
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,720
then this will be highlighting how

50
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,479
active inference is an integrative

51
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,000
framework across a few different other

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,040
ideas these dot zero videos are just

53
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,720
introductions to the ideas because you

54
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,119
could take a whole course of learning

55
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,640
on any one of them so they're just

56
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,360
little suggestions and hints related to

57
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,719
the ideas

58
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,560
and where this paper is going as far as

59
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,119
the punch line is that we can build on

60
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,240
this

61
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,560
predictive global neuronal workspace

62
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,280
model

63
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,080
and think about it in being implemented

64
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,200
by active inference

65
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,000
type models and get new insights

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,920
predictions and hopefully explanations

67
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,599
and applications

68
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,160
and in 18 we're gonna pretty much go

69
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,520
through a lot of the paper

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,160
as far as their goals and the questions

71
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,280
and many of their

72
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,319
copious figures and it'll be good to

73
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,720
talk to ryan and christopher when they

74
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,239
join for the stream

75
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,239
for 18.1 and 0.2 we're going to be

76
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,080
discussing this paper so save and

77
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,400
submit your questions and get in touch

78
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,360
with us if you want to participate

79
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,640
okay so here is the paper predictive

80
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,920
global neuronal workspace

81
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,360
a formal active inference model of

82
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,519
visual consciousness before we

83
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,920
read the goals and claims uh stephen

84
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,360
maybe you could just say hello and

85
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,720
introduce yourself and

86
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,760
what got you excited in this paper just

87
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,599
personally before we dive into like the

88
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,239
paper itself

89
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,840
thanks daniel yeah well this this

90
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,319
my background is that i'm doing a

91
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,120
practice based

92
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,159
phd um at the solomon's

93
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,440
institute of applied psychology so i'm

94
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,560
interested in how

95
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,599
active inference can help understand

96
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,040
some of the processes that i've been

97
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,200
working on

98
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,840
for understanding pre-reflective

99
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,400
phenomenological awareness and people's

100
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,519
sense-making so that kind of ties in

101
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,280
to how i'm also interested in um

102
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,720
ryan and christopher's work because

103
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,480
they're bringing this into the

104
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,080
psychological domain

105
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,519
but also bringing that into the

106
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,599
phenomenological domain

107
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,120
in ways which are practically

108
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,640
predictive and so that's really

109
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,640
really exciting and i'm i see a lot of

110
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,040
opportunities for this modeling work and

111
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,120
i've actually spoken to ryan about this

112
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,400
to try and link in with other ways

113
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,159
of uh people doing sense making etc so

114
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,360
and then this particular paper um

115
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,440
i think is really interesting because

116
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,680
we've got a lot of

117
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,040
exciting um philosophical ideas around

118
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,320
global workspace concepts

119
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,000
in neuroscience and an area that i

120
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,120
i've only partly explored but to have

121
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,120
this integrated into a predictive model

122
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,160
that can be tested at certain scales in

123
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,440
certain ways

124
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,880
and to have people who've got the sort

125
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,280
of rigor and the kind of

126
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,040
the ability to focus down and choose

127
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,080
um experimental and practical

128
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,199
ways to to explore this which vine and

129
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,919
christopher have is really helpful so

130
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,360
um so i'm looking at this from a few

131
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,320
different ways and hopefully

132
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,680
that will be something that other people

133
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,520
will find useful

134
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,960
nice so this is kind of a big

135
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,840
paper and topic so we're gonna frame it

136
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,440
first with just how the authors

137
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,880
represented their goals and claims and

138
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,759
then we're gonna kind of

139
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,840
pull back to just the bigger questions

140
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,280
about the paper

141
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,360
and then we're gonna go through

142
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,800
basically the keywords

143
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,520
so if when reading what the authors are

144
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,400
setting out to do

145
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,080
it's like why would you even want to

146
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,919
travel from a to z we're going to go

147
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,039
to define them so um stephen do you want

148
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:33,919
to read the first

149
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,199
one of

150
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,840
on six

151
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,440
oh wait you muted

152
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,440
so so goals and claims of the paper here

153
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,240
we've got

154
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,360
formalizing ideas uh first introduced by

155
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,880
how in white and fristen so um

156
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,400
they argue that conscious access

157
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,520
um or ignition which is this kind of

158
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,440
sudden awareness that things come into

159
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,639
our awareness

160
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,039
is is a fundamentally inferential

161
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,080
process

162
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,199
that depends upon a level of processing

163
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,319
of sufficient temporal depth to

164
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,560
contextualize and coordinate

165
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,800
lower levels of processing so that's

166
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,759
actually quite

167
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,800
um has a few implications there

168
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,800
so and so i carry on is that okay so um

169
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,880
then also to build on the previous

170
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,639
conceptual contributions in this area

171
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,840
mentioned above

172
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,319
um they they will be substantiating

173
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,199
arguments

174
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,680
with a series of detailed computational

175
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,440
simulations

176
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,280
these stimulations are based upon the

177
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,520
first principles account

178
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,400
of perception and action selection

179
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,280
offered by

180
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,560
active inference so that that's

181
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,680
again that's one of the real

182
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,000
foundational benefits that this

183
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,680
is testable um and then also

184
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,840
um they end by examining the

185
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,520
relationships between

186
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,120
um the predictive global neuronal

187
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,199
workspace which they've introduced as a

188
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,080
concept

189
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,319
and alternative models and briefly

190
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,800
address potential concerns about

191
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,039
how phenomenal consciousness could

192
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:21,919
plausibly

193
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,240
be situated within the model that

194
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,280
they're going to present

195
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,160
and however this paper is chiefly

196
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,440
concerned with what

197
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,599
block terms access consciousness

198
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,440
which is defined as the availability of

199
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,680
information for verbal report

200
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,120
voluntary action and executive

201
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,360
processing for brevity

202
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,840
they will use conscious access they use

203
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,800
conscious action

204
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,840
access and consciousness interchangeably

205
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,400
throughout the paper so just to really

206
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:50,879
you know

207
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,960
that this gives them a practical

208
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,879
starting point to work on

209
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,000
yeah nice yep there's a lot

210
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
in these goals but one of the key pieces

211
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,280
is that they're talking about

212
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,680
informational availability in terms of

213
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,319
report

214
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,400
paradigms and then they're going to be

215
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,440
connecting

216
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,240
big questions in multiscale systems and

217
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,280
cognition

218
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,800
to active inference so let's unpack that

219
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,160
a little bit in terms of just what are

220
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,199
the bigger

221
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,360
questions not in the author's words that

222
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,599
we identified this paper

223
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,759
as relevant for so people who are maybe

224
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,680
working in these areas

225
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,080
and the first one uh or which one of

226
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,359
these do you want to just go for first

227
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,799
i might just mention the first one and

228
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,320
then if you could pick it up after that

229
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,640
one

230
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,320
um so yeah basically there just

231
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,880
there is a question really um that

232
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,000
they're exploring

233
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,519
can simulations using generative models

234
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,360
of belief updating

235
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,560
um give you principled schemes

236
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,839
in active influence to um to extend

237
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,000
to other boosts for a predictive global

238
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,519
neuronal workspace so you know does this

239
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,839
lead to sort of a plausible

240
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,800
doing this sort of simulation to a

241
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,760
predictive

242
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,040
approach to this whole paradigm nice

243
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,120
and it's related to the second question

244
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,800
which is what are the unique predictions

245
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,279
and explanations of active inference

246
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,040
so it's the first question is kind of

247
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,360
asking how can we use the simulation

248
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,080
the generative model how can that be

249
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,880
used to get

250
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,279
to unique evidence or unique claims or

251
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,279
unique experimental design

252
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,440
and then something that's related to

253
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,360
active inferences role

254
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,920
is how could this reposition the

255
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,519
distinctions that people make between

256
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,440
access consciousness and

257
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,040
phenomenological consciousness

258
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,200
so access consciousness as per the

259
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,160
previous slide

260
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,320
is the informational accessibility

261
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,080
phenomenological consciousness is the

262
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,680
awareness or the qualia

263
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,600
and an example of something that's in

264
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,720
access consciousness

265
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,200
but not phenomenological would be like a

266
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,080
subliminal

267
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,920
sound because you're it's not

268
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,839
experiencing it it's subliminal

269
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,480
but it can influence somebody so that is

270
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,079
within their access consciousness

271
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:08,480
because

272
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,959
informationally it leads to differential

273
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:11,600
behavior

274
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,079
or the planting of an idea but it's not

275
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,000
phenomenologically experienced

276
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,839
so it's not just one basket with what

277
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,839
um is being met with consciousness yeah

278
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:22,959
stephen

279
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,760
yeah and so to clarify a little bit on

280
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,800
that as well is

281
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,680
that they they they are using this idea

282
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,320
for this

283
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,440
access consciousness whereby um you can

284
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,680
access it in a way that you could report

285
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,480
on it

286
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,120
um like you're saying and it may be

287
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,000
there

288
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,040
like i said as a qualia and it may

289
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,800
be transiently available but you may not

290
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,120
be able to access it from a reporting

291
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,560
paradigm so they

292
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,560
the way they frame access consciousness

293
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,160
is to really give a temporal

294
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,279
depth and a sense of how stuff comes

295
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,120
in so the idea of access consciousness

296
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,360
is either accessible or it's not

297
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,279
whereas phenomenological consciousness

298
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,279
is kind of more of that

299
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,040
flux which is when we think of

300
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,200
consciousness it's hard

301
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,399
there's not really something you can put

302
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,320
in a box whereas access consciousness

303
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
you can't put it in a box either but

304
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,959
they're more able to so they can model

305
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,519
it

306
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,560
right it's beautiful yes they also

307
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,279
are setting out to address how the

308
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,000
active inference

309
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,320
model can integrate different ideas like

310
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,279
bayesian brain

311
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,279
and global neuronal workspace in

312
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,399
neuroscience

313
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,399
and combine that with more psychological

314
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,440
applications

315
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,320
and also they're asking in this paper

316
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,519
how can they

317
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,000
um perhaps integrate with other existing

318
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,839
active inference models

319
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,680
to sort of extend other work like

320
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,760
related to the global neuronal workspace

321
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,800
and also

322
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,360
bringing it into a specific visual

323
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,600
modality and experimental task

324
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,079
so we had a bunch of questions making

325
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:00,880
dot zero

326
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,440
as well so what is just one or a few of

327
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,800
the questions that you just want to

328
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,680
raise and what

329
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,839
why'd you erase it

330
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,399
some of the questions that that came up

331
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,399
for me was um

332
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,000
you know just how does this all um

333
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,079
fit together into what's potentially in

334
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,920
the future so i'd be really interested

335
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,440
to get ryan and christopher's sort of

336
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,720
take on some of these

337
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,519
distinctions you know um just like you

338
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,959
were talking about that potential for it

339
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,320
to go into

340
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,320
multi-sensory integration and beyond

341
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,279
so how does visual consciousness or

342
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,720
awareness of that

343
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,560
differ from general awareness

344
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,279
and how does the ability of the

345
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,800
predictive global

346
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,160
um neuronal workspace um give these

347
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,839
detailed simulations and

348
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,480
resulting predictions so what's the

349
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,839
potential for that

350
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,959
in other fields and sectors okay so one

351
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,880
of them might be to help influence

352
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,720
psychological perspectives on people's

353
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,240
professional practice

354
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,000
um as with people are starting to make

355
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
um even what it means to take a

356
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,360
perspective

357
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,519
how much is that access consciousness

358
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,720
effectively

359
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,160
when i start to bring something to my

360
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,600
perspective am i bringing something to

361
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,680
my access consciousness

362
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,240
when medical understanding of conscious

363
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,120
awareness

364
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,800
or when people start to understand about

365
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,120
self-reporting in general and how people

366
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,959
know and people who are working with

367
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,959
knowledge and bring things up

368
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,560
because a lot of knowledge workers are

369
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,240
using interviews and reporting paradigms

370
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,560
um and there's a big question about well

371
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,120
how do you deal with first person

372
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,760
normally it's first person perspectives

373
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,880
which is one thing

374
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,680
and then there's first person experience

375
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,959
and how do you

376
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,160
even get those two resolved

377
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,320
in in some sort of coherent way so i

378
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,760
think that that

379
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,959
that that's something that would be

380
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,880
really interesting to to

381
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,639
hear more on nice good

382
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,800
thoughts and we're just always curious

383
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,639
about where active inference

384
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,360
comes from and where we can apply it and

385
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,560
learn it

386
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,040
why does it really matter well there's

387
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,240
sort of a theory

388
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,760
arm and an applications arm the theory

389
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,240
arm

390
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,680
is that this paper is exploring some

391
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,079
experimentally tractable unique

392
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:36,800
predictions

393
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,000
of an active inference type model

394
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,240
and showing how it goes beyond bayesian

395
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,000
brain global neuronal workspace

396
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
predictive processing it integrates

397
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,440
across and it goes beyond

398
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,279
several of these theoretical

399
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,440
neuroscience modalities

400
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,040
and then the paper is part of a broader

401
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,639
network of research and work by

402
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,560
ryan and others that we'll hopefully

403
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,839
hear more about just

404
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,560
as to how could this shape the kinds of

405
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,760
clinical

406
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,560
and community psychology practices that

407
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,440
people are

408
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,160
performing because this is related to

409
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,639
all these types of uh

410
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,800
topics so any thoughts on this before we

411
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,639
go to the abstract roadmap

412
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,079
yeah i suppose it just comes back to

413
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,240
this idea of ways of knowing what it

414
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,959
means

415
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,000
to know and be aware and have awareness

416
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,440
um that that actually is often sort of

417
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,639
implicitly sort of in the background but

418
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,480
this gives a way to make some things

419
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,079
more explicit which i think

420
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,199
could be really valuable

421
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,199
cool so the um

422
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,440
abstract just because i think we'll have

423
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,959
enough to actually talk about with a

424
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:47,360
paper

425
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,199
people can pause it to read the full

426
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,560
thing they're

427
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,720
in the first part of the abstract

428
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,440
framing the need to move beyond

429
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,800
the global neuronal workspace model

430
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,560
in the second half of the abstract they

431
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,160
report what they did

432
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,880
which is demonstrating their integrative

433
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,079
model which we're going to be able to

434
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,600
look at and explain what they actually

435
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,240
did

436
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,959
and they find that that model is able to

437
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,000
reproduce

438
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,240
a lot of other findings from previously

439
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,639
non-unified experiments and then

440
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,759
they close with a discussion on how they

441
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,240
can

442
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,199
build upon previous work in this

443
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,079
integrative and

444
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,360
active inference style and where that

445
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,440
leads to as far as predictions

446
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,279
so that's sort of reflected in their

447
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,399
roadmap in that they give a basic

448
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,959
broad introduction then specific

449
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,000
theoretical

450
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,120
backgrounds on active inference and deep

451
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,560
temporal modeling

452
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,399
they then spend the bulk of the work

453
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,320
presenting and many figures presenting

454
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,839
the results

455
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,079
and recapitulating several specific

456
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,279
phenomena

457
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,079
that are important to reproduce and also

458
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,360
impressive to reproduce

459
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
in a simple framework and one where we

460
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,880
can see all the parts

461
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,480
and then they close with basically a

462
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,160
discussion about

463
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,319
where their work is fitting in relative

464
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,679
to other work

465
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,959
and concluding summarizing and stating a

466
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,439
few

467
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,000
next steps so how did that strike you or

468
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,439
what would you add to that stephen if

469
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,439
anything

470
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,520
no i think that's a good summary i think

471
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,359
in some ways we might be

472
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,119
the authors would speak a bit more to

473
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,520
how that taxonomy came about and

474
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,679
there's some nuances in there in terms

475
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,919
of how and why they selected what they

476
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,039
selected and

477
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,600
um which um would be really interesting

478
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,080
to

479
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,640
to have them really step through um but

480
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,120
uh

481
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,720
and um but overall the

482
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,799
the way they've modeled this out into a

483
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,080
very practical

484
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,919
um real world kind of context i think

485
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,960
shows that potential and so and then

486
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,440
um what does that mean for this temple

487
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,160
structure

488
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,280
then links back to other work around

489
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,840
temporal

490
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,320
depth which is you know the kind of

491
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,600
since i think it's

492
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,240
2016 has been what a lot of the active

493
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,679
inference

494
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,400
work has certainly in the modeling has

495
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,679
really been

496
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,240
um yielding is this idea of temporal

497
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,440
depth and what it can mean

498
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,240
so that'd be great nice great point

499
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,160
earlier models of active inference were

500
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,799
sort of like

501
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,240
instantaneous or one-step

502
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,120
models and a lot of the ongoing research

503
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,640
is about the integration

504
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,360
of multiple scales or multiple course

505
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,160
gradings of temporal dynamics

506
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,880
so here are the keywords the paper so if

507
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,000
someone was listening to it from

508
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,080
any background and was curious about why

509
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,440
does it matter to connect some of these

510
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,559
things or why

511
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,039
why is it important or how does that

512
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,559
implication arise

513
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,720
from integrating what i've previously

514
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,280
people done if not with this integration

515
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,720
that's where the keywords kind of come

516
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,080
into play and we're going to go through

517
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,640
basically a slide for each they are

518
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,400
computational neuroscience

519
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,320
predictive processing bayesian brain

520
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,440
hypothesis

521
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,840
active inference consciousness visual

522
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,880
consciousness

523
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,960
global neuronal workspace and the

524
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,520
predictive global neuronal workspace

525
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,280
so let's start with computational

526
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,880
neuroscience

527
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,240
a lot you could say about this a lot of

528
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,080
people's department

529
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,440
and research but we can just look at it

530
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,559
pretty naively as the intersection

531
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,559
of computational approaches and

532
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,320
neuroscience research

533
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,039
so computational could mean using

534
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:33,840
computers

535
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,280
which a lot of things are in nowadays

536
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,520
using computers could be descriptively

537
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,360
modeling statistics

538
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,280
or it could be generatively modeling a

539
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,280
system like with a simulation

540
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,280
but also the computational approaches

541
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,280
might include using computational

542
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,200
metaphors to describe systems that might

543
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,039
be considered computational as well

544
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,320
like computationalist on the other hand

545
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,360
neuroscience is about studying

546
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,480
brains but increasingly non-neural cell

547
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,240
types in the brain and the body and the

548
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,000
niche and society

549
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,320
so all these different aspects of

550
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,679
behavior in the brain

551
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,360
and it uses all different kinds of

552
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,120
approaches some of which

553
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,039
are computational which brings us to the

554
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,400
overlap which

555
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,000
can look like a few different things it

556
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,840
could look like computational brain

557
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,840
metaphors the brain is a computer

558
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,000
or it does information transfer of this

559
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,280
type

560
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,240
um it could look like doing descriptive

561
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,520
or generative modeling

562
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,799
on computational representations of

563
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,159
neurological data

564
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,600
it could look like brain computer

565
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,440
interfaces so that's sort of

566
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,440
computational neuroscience

567
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,919
and stephen i know that you like kind of

568
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,039
saw where that could go

569
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,039
beyond where most people would think

570
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,080
about computational neuro

571
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,240
do you want to mention it here on the

572
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,360
next slide

573
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,960
um maybe on the next slide and just

574
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,720
i suppose in some ways it's just to try

575
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,320
and highlight some of the

576
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,240
thought practices i like to go through

577
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,240
to to get my head around what

578
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,919
um this means and how i can bring it

579
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,600
together with

580
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,720
the active inference process so the the

581
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,159
the challenge you slightly have with

582
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,159
active inferences and predictive

583
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,360
processing that goes with this um is

584
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,240
that

585
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,120
um it challenges the computer metaphor

586
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,640
that we've kind of got embedded

587
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,520
of how the brain works either the model

588
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,960
or the thought that we sort of bring in

589
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,039
signals and then we have a computational

590
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,679
awareness we think it and then we do it

591
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,559
it's this sort of

592
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,760
open system so these predictive

593
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,200
processes and this cybernetics

594
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,400
so it kind of when we talk about

595
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,440
computational neuroscience

596
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,000
in relation to the systems neuroscience

597
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,360
and non-linear dynamical systems that

598
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,799
active influence is part of um

599
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,640
it's it's a bit more of an open um

600
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,760
kind of process approach

601
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,559
so i suppose that to for someone who's

602
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,080
trying to understand this

603
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,200
i think i found it helpful to start to

604
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,520
to think about the the computation

605
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,840
computations that dynamic process that

606
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,440
develops over time

607
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,720
when it's used in this sort of context

608
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,799
so it's it and those sorts of ways that

609
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,400
these models are

610
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,760
which is different to kind of

611
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,960
system dynamic models which are much

612
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,600
more like

613
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,919
flows on something which is defined it's

614
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,039
this kind of

615
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,880
evolving process and of course the free

616
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,520
energy principle then ties into that

617
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,440
because it's all about being able to

618
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,039
work with those dynamics

619
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,280
so um i don't know does that make sense

620
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,440
what's there

621
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,280
people can seem to let us know if it

622
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,799
makes censor helps them

623
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,720
i think that the non-linear dynamical

624
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,120
systems is a big topic

625
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,280
one way that that has been

626
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,400
operationalized

627
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,720
in neuroscience is the bayesian brain

628
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,600
hypothesis because bayesian statistics

629
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,919
is often used to model non-linear

630
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,200
dynamical systems

631
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,960
so if we're thinking about the brain as

632
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,039
a non-linear dynamical system

633
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,640
it makes sense to think about the brain

634
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,720
as a bayesian device

635
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,720
and this is from the 2018 interview with

636
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,640
fristen and martin and myself and

637
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,760
in this paper we summarized

638
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,280
and characterized the bayesian brain

639
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,679
hypothesis predictive coding and the

640
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,280
free energy principle

641
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,400
and asked how are these uh different

642
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,120
models

643
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,840
similar or different from one another in

644
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,679
fact he had suggested that these three

645
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,360
frameworks are variations of the same

646
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,880
basic mechanisms

647
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,320
so if you're wanting to learn more about

648
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,000
the background of the bayesian brain

649
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,400
and how it differs in specific ways from

650
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,840
predictive processing free energy

651
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,159
principle active inference etc

652
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,200
then read his response here

653
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,400
or read the interview because um it can

654
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,039
help with

655
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,880
some people's understanding let's just

656
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,760
go through it at an overview level

657
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,640
predictive processing is specifically

658
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,080
looking at how

659
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,120
error is propagated through systems

660
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,679
which

661
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,360
can be hierarchical or must be

662
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,440
hierarchical and therefore

663
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,400
are amenable to a bayesian hierarchical

664
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,279
modeling

665
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,240
so in this sort of diagram on the right

666
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,360
it shows how

667
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,440
at the very bottom level you have

668
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,480
muscular output action and sensory input

669
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,799
and then what's happening in this

670
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,400
cascade

671
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,799
of hierarchically nested systems is that

672
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,400
predictions are coming down

673
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,480
and prediction errors are moving up but

674
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,240
it's not a spatial thing it could be in

675
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,600
or out or it could it's just

676
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,240
about how it's laid out and predictive

677
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,279
processing

678
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,640
turns out to be a way to get

679
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,880
somewhat effective bayesian-like

680
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,760
behavior

681
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,600
because it's even how we fit some of our

682
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,840
algorithms we just start with the prior

683
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,279
and then we inch it closer

684
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,120
depending on the error signal so

685
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,360
learning based upon the error signal

686
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,760
is a really common algorithmic maneuver

687
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,279
and so predictive processing

688
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,640
in the bayesian brain are sort of like

689
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,320
compatible theories because the bayesian

690
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,600
brain is just saying

691
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,279
it's going to be something bayesian

692
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,039
predictive processing

693
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,520
is a theory because it makes predictions

694
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,120
that are falsifiable about

695
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,600
what is being represented in the

696
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,840
communications between levels

697
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,360
and namely that you have prediction

698
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
going one way and prediction error

699
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,919
heading back the other

700
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,080
way anything you say about that before

701
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,400
we continue

702
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,760
no that makes sense so the only thing

703
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,520
i'd add is that what's going to be

704
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,240
mentioned is how there's um this

705
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,360
temporal

706
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,600
um depth piece starts to make so you

707
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,200
could have like a level

708
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,919
of processing goes to another level and

709
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:40,240
that

710
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,320
that's something that but the same basic

711
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,760
principle is driving it

712
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,960
so yeah cool so here is a really

713
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,000
informative piece

714
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,279
from the first in 2018 interview

715
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,440
fristen wrote the bayesian brain

716
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,960
hypothesis per se

717
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,559
does not trouble itself to commit to a

718
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,240
particular process theory

719
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,840
other than requiring implicit beliefs to

720
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,919
conform to bayes rule so similar to how

721
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,200
free energy principle

722
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
doesn't have a specific process theory

723
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,960
that's downstream it's a more like a

724
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,039
general overarching does it conform or

725
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,080
not to this

726
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,960
principle the bayesian brain hypothesis

727
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,320
is a corollary of the free energy

728
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:14,960
principle

729
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,799
and is realized through processes like

730
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,880
predictive coding or abductive inference

731
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,640
under prior beliefs

732
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,240
however bayesian brain is not the free

733
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,240
energy principle because both bayesian

734
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,919
brain hypothesis and predictive coding

735
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,200
are incomplete theories of how we

736
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,840
inspire

737
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,880
states of affairs and then here is so

738
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,600
interesting

739
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,159
where he wrote it's this inactive

740
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,039
embodied

741
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,840
extended embedded and encultured aspect

742
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,760
that is lacking from the bayesian brain

743
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,240
and predictive coding theories precisely

744
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,840
because they do not consider entropy

745
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,880
reduction

746
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,559
through action as well as through

747
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,480
inference so it's all

748
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,240
well and good to have the inference

749
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,919
engine that's driven in this

750
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,000
thermodynamic way

751
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,159
towards entropy reduction but it takes

752
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,840
on a whole other level and integrates

753
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,200
with control theory

754
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,840
and action in the niche when you go from

755
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,400
saying

756
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,240
well yes the brain is a bayesian

757
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,240
statistical inference device

758
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,559
for action and that's really one of the

759
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,880
key pieces of active inference

760
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,919
which is why we went to it here so

761
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:14,559
before we

762
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,400
um this is the definition of the authors

763
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,840
in this paper that's what they wrote

764
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,200
so stephen where would you say active

765
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,320
inference fits in or what do you have to

766
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,000
say about that well i like this this is

767
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,360
a really helpful slide well there's a

768
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,720
couple of things that come up one thing

769
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,200
is

770
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,440
the fact that it talks about um

771
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,279
abductive inference

772
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,640
and it's talking about this idea you

773
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,120
know predictive coding and um

774
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,640
you know ryan smith and christopher

775
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,799
they're talking about prospective

776
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,120
sometimes ideas of you know we're

777
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,000
predicting how

778
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,159
things are going to happen well that's

779
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,520
really interesting because most

780
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,440
research in terms of like social

781
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,120
sciences mostly

782
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,320
you know retrospective or inductive

783
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,399
or deductive and abductive is

784
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,960
this abductive emergent thing is is

785
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,760
actually very

786
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,559
um hard to get at but actually is is

787
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,279
showing that this predictive

788
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,720
rather than retroactive knowing

789
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,200
is what's driving everything um so i

790
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,760
think that

791
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,840
that in itself is quite useful to think

792
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,760
about um

793
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,559
yep nice it's interesting that he

794
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,000
mentioned it there

795
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,960
and that active inference how how does

796
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,080
it implement

797
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,360
potentially um some of these cool

798
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,399
aspects

799
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,080
that are lacking from the bayesian brain

800
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,480
so where does active inference build on

801
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,120
bayesian brain approaches here's what

802
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,399
active inference is

803
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,360
so the way that the authors uh ryan

804
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,799
smith and christopher white

805
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,320
wrote it in this paper on the first

806
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,919
sentence of their primer

807
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,480
is active inference a quarterly of the

808
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,799
corollary of the free energy principle

809
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,240
is the first principles approach to

810
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,159
modeling approximately bayes optimal

811
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,360
behavior

812
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,840
so you can look at their primer in this

813
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,960
paper

814
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,399
which is really awesome as well as

815
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,279
they're very extensive tutorial on

816
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,440
active inference and model stream

817
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,480
number one point one through four so we

818
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,039
just

819
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,880
really appreciate the clarity that ryan

820
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,640
and christopher bring to this

821
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,360
area but basically what's happening is

822
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,480
active inference

823
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,679
is allowing us to formalize the

824
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,840
process of the environment giving data

825
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,120
through sense

826
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,000
to the organism which in the generative

827
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,360
modeling of that data

828
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,080
which is like bayesian modeling but

829
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,200
that's inference

830
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,320
and then it connects it to

831
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,960
external states again closing the loop

832
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,760
via action as well as internal dynamics

833
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,760
or endogenous fluctuations on either

834
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,440
side of the interface

835
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,360
only by defining the interface do we get

836
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
this kind of a clean separation

837
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,039
so that's where active inference allows

838
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,520
us to say yes it's bayesian in terms of

839
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,279
how it recognizes data

840
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,919
and it acts in an ecosystem that also

841
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,360
has other agents

842
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,960
that's where active inference comes into

843
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,960
play all right

844
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,760
so now to sort of switch gears to

845
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,799
consciousness

846
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,520
and visual consciousness so let's just

847
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,120
start with sort of the obvious

848
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,919
what is consciousness question and just

849
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,520
we're just talking about this paper so

850
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,960
we're not talking about like

851
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,559
something that's you know some sort of

852
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,000
theological

853
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,559
question remember that it's access

854
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:17,679
consciousness it's

855
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,720
self-report paradigms and you can read

856
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,960
more about their perspective on that in

857
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,399
the limitations and

858
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,480
multiple other places where they really

859
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,159
are clear about the pros and cons of

860
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:28,960
using

861
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,520
visual modality so it's not olfactory

862
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,360
consciousness it's not a sound it's not

863
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,399
multimodal

864
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,600
they're doing a sense specific task

865
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,200
and it's reported awareness so

866
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,120
what do you think about that stephen or

867
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,559
in your you know thinking or learning

868
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,279
about

869
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,960
consciousness where would this sort of a

870
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,480
narrow approach

871
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,520
figure it

872
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,399
yeah well i think that um you know when

873
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,080
they talk about the pros and cons

874
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,120
um you know the the the

875
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,960
pros are that we are actually able to

876
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,880
generate data through reports

877
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,240
and it gives us a way into

878
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,279
this whole area and by

879
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,120
the sort of the detail of

880
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,440
how the design has been done it it

881
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,399
negates

882
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,080
and makes that negate some of the

883
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,679
challenges and makes us get

884
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,279
some workable insights um and

885
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,840
one of the cons is that or one of the

886
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,519
downsides that they're facing is you

887
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,279
can't genuinely

888
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,240
report being conscious of nothing you

889
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:32,880
can't say you

890
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,679
i'm no longer conscious of any of that

891
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:36,399
thing

892
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,320
so to speak and they acknowledge that

893
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,679
there's always something in your field

894
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:39,919
of

895
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,159
vision when you're being asked to

896
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,600
self-report around if something's

897
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,960
present or not present

898
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,840
so um but so they've had to do some

899
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,519
workarounds to get the results that are

900
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,240
usable

901
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,799
but um that that would be something they

902
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,720
can speak to better than me

903
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,919
cool i agree it'll be like um what are

904
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,200
the authors big

905
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,720
motivations what is their long-term

906
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,279
vision for consciousness research why

907
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,120
have they chosen vision first

908
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,640
what would be the next most tractable

909
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,760
sense so definitely there's a lot of

910
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,399
questions to have for them and also this

911
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,240
is a great note from them

912
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,559
brief note on phenomenology and the

913
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:19,279
phenomenal

914
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,720
consciousness access consciousness

915
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,320
distinction so again i just

916
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,000
we kind of hit this point because it's

917
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,600
one of the it's one of the key words of

918
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,320
the paper

919
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,960
is consciousness and a lot of times when

920
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,440
uh

921
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,880
we see scientific research on

922
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,880
consciousness so called it's just

923
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,799
it's always critical to be clear about

924
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,480
what's being discussed

925
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,480
and the authors thankfully here really

926
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,000
are clear which actually leads some

927
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,679
people to be almost disappointed it's

928
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:42,320
like

929
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,320
oh but what about the big phenomenology

930
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,360
it's like

931
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,039
maybe we'll get there or maybe we won't

932
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,720
or you could have any story you want on

933
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,279
that

934
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,519
but it's almost like if the sales pitch

935
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,039
is too much

936
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,919
hype then people it's what they expect

937
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,600
so then when there's a more narrow

938
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,679
focused paper they act like it

939
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:00,960
introduces

940
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,200
all these critical challenges that are

941
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,080
just being

942
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,799
glided over by a paper that doesn't

943
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,799
define consciousness or doesn't

944
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,760
go so specifically and carefully into

945
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,200
the distinctions between access and

946
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,720
phenomenal consciousness because not

947
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,320
everyone will

948
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,399
and uh yeah yeah i like that

949
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,519
the the way they talk about this um

950
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,360
they acknowledge this question about

951
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,200
this threshold and start to

952
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,240
sort of decide on where they're going to

953
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,919
fit in with that i think is really

954
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,279
valuable because

955
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,799
um this idea of

956
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,240
or the question that's sitting in the

957
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,039
background with phenomenological

958
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,480
uh consciousness there when they talk

959
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,559
about this moment-to-moment

960
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,600
sensory flux and in a way it

961
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,360
ties to the um chris fields

962
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,679
work that we were doing with quantum

963
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,399
contextuality potentially

964
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,200
um is you know what's this kind of flux

965
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,640
idea that's in the background and when

966
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,080
does it get

967
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,000
tripped over to the contextuality of

968
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,120
awareness so

969
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,720
um and that's that but just to show it

970
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,480
linking to some of the other papers that

971
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,199
have come up

972
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,239
and then for this you know it shows you

973
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,199
the importance

974
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,040
of the experimental design and

975
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,000
the modeling simulation design and how

976
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,359
the way the design

977
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,480
ends up evolving itself

978
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,639
kind of gives us some insights of how

979
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,239
you might structure

980
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,000
our understanding of consciousness the

981
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,839
sort of questions they had to ask

982
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,800
and answer to build the model in itself

983
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,079
is quite interesting

984
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,199
nice yep so they're

985
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,679
um really clear about that and we can

986
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,040
talk more about it

987
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,918
let's go to the neuro side so we kind of

988
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,918
talked a little bit about the

989
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,918
philosophical question of consciousness

990
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,000
and the systems dynamics and control

991
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,839
theory question of active inference

992
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,719
but then there's this neuroscience side

993
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,040
and

994
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,480
area that they're in and that's what's

995
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,640
also moving towards applications in the

996
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,320
clinic for example

997
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,200
and what we can do here is present some

998
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,400
of the early

999
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,760
and latter citations related to

1000
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,160
the global neuronal workspace global

1001
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,960
workspace theory gwt or

1002
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,880
there's a bunch of related ones sorry if

1003
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,560
the acronyms are not always consistent

1004
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,280
but

1005
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,240
um what the global neuronal workspace i

1006
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,720
guess is

1007
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,240
probably what we should use and

1008
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,560
predictive gnw

1009
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,760
are there integrative models that are on

1010
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,079
one

1011
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,440
hand for neuronal function so

1012
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,200
through philosophically neutral

1013
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,440
frameworks like cascade theory or

1014
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,960
network theory you can describe

1015
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,760
how you get patterns like ignition or

1016
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,400
cascades through networks or propagation

1017
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,599
then it can be applied and say ah what

1018
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:47,920
if

1019
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,040
that ignition is so-called consciousness

1020
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,720
access consciousness there's a strong

1021
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,160
argument you can say look if the data

1022
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,760
doesn't get to the other end of the

1023
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,440
pipeline it's not going to get there

1024
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,599
so if it does get there it had to have

1025
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,839
propagated through a critical system

1026
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,520
so that is the easier bar

1027
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,680
and then the harder bars is that

1028
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,599
information propagation

1029
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,760
equivalent to phenomenal consciousness

1030
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,119
experience qualia

1031
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,240
and the answer as we know from

1032
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,320
subliminal stimuli is just no

1033
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,440
it's not but that's what people often

1034
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,400
want to get at

1035
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
addressing which is how does the brain

1036
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,000
quote make consciousness

1037
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,599
or what brain states are associated with

1038
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,839
quote consciousness meaning awareness

1039
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,040
in our first person experience which

1040
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,839
even under the most generous vision is

1041
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,200
just a part of our

1042
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,880
total system what do you think about

1043
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,880
that stephen

1044
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,560
yeah i think that's a good and you make

1045
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,079
a good point there and

1046
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,720
this loom from the sort of more broader

1047
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,960
workspace to this neuronal workspace

1048
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,400
then brings in

1049
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,839
um the actual understanding which again

1050
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,680
ryan and christopher have of of

1051
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,680
neuroscience and the way that

1052
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,240
the the firing happens so that gives an

1053
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,359
insight

1054
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,040
and also the thing that i think is

1055
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,720
interesting is

1056
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,960
that they're talking about consciousness

1057
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,560
as being this

1058
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,040
belief um updating or prediction that's

1059
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,079
fairly uh on off like it's like

1060
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,520
things come in they come out of

1061
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,440
consciousness um

1062
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,280
whereas in other cases that might be

1063
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,480
more of a gradual

1064
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,839
flux of awareness there's something

1065
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,880
going on here which because that flips

1066
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,280
in and out of consciousness that gives

1067
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,560
you a way to use

1068
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,680
um belief updating schemes

1069
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,640
to model it and i'd be interested to

1070
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,760
hear how

1071
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,160
they see that yeah nice good question so

1072
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,680
here's kind of a

1073
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,520
classic neuroscience diagram from this

1074
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,359
2005 early paper

1075
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,520
left side is the single neuron scale you

1076
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,680
have receptors in a membrane

1077
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,760
and different currents that are

1078
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,359
happening at a very very

1079
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,400
micro level meso level with circuits and

1080
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,160
then more of a macro level

1081
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,599
with the activation that's propagating

1082
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,240
across regions of the brain and then

1083
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:04,880
another

1084
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,839
way that was helpful was uh looking at

1085
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:08,480
this

1086
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,720
i think it could have even been 1998

1087
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,000
paper

1088
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,760
the global neuronal workspace model of

1089
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,280
conscious access from neuronal

1090
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,440
architecture to clinical applications

1091
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,640
so lest we think that it's a new idea to

1092
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,079
apply neuroscience

1093
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,720
in clinical settings or think it's too

1094
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,680
soon or too

1095
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,040
late it's just always going to be sort

1096
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,920
of what people are recalibrating too

1097
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,520
and in this figure it's connecting

1098
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,200
sort of the uh multifaceted

1099
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,320
attributes of the self and consciousness

1100
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,880
so again used maybe vaguely maybe

1101
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,560
detailedly

1102
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,320
like long-term memory of the past

1103
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,240
evaluating systems of value attentional

1104
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:50,800
focus

1105
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,720
regimes of attention as we would say

1106
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,920
perceptual systems

1107
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,680
in the moment and then motor systems in

1108
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,960
action in the future

1109
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,560
so it's like if all those things are

1110
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,320
being connected and

1111
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,440
what connects the sound in the ear

1112
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,079
to the memory to the action pattern like

1113
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:06,800
if someone says

1114
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,359
march what connects that and the answer

1115
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:09,839
is

1116
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,800
something like a system at criticality

1117
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,920
that propagates from a sensory modality

1118
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,520
and if we're a quieter it wouldn't have

1119
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,960
been heard it wouldn't have propagated

1120
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,240
if it's the wrong language

1121
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,400
it doesn't propagate so it kind of only

1122
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,520
catches

1123
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,920
when it's all aligned with the rhythmic

1124
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,760
oscillations and the prior state of the

1125
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,720
network

1126
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,640
which is equivalent to constituting a

1127
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,880
bayesian belief network

1128
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,880
so that's sort of the global neuronal

1129
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,240
workspace model is it's going to be

1130
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,160
integrating all these features that are

1131
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,520
kind of disparate

1132
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,920
cybernetic features memory past present

1133
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,599
future self other

1134
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,079
thinking through other minds all these

1135
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,760
features of neuroscience that everyone's

1136
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,400
trying to

1137
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,040
understand and model and put that in a

1138
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,079
network science

1139
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,160
frame so that maybe it could be

1140
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,599
brought into the clinical applications

1141
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,280
just like their title is getting at even

1142
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,800
20 years ago

1143
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,480
or other avenues like how do we discuss

1144
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,319
neuroscience with the public

1145
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,480
what kind of metaphors will they receive

1146
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,920
is it like a network that

1147
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,560
activates or an avalanche that falls or

1148
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,480
a program that halts

1149
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,839
different ways that people think about

1150
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:20,079
systems neuroscience

1151
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,599
any thoughts on that before we can

1152
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,920
continue yeah i think just generally

1153
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,800
speaking this

1154
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,680
this idea of this integration um is

1155
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,920
really useful when people are thinking

1156
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,240
more broadly about um you know often

1157
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,839
people are thinking about us as a system

1158
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,839
but you people fall into this trap

1159
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,480
of i'm a kinesthetic thinker or a visual

1160
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,200
thinker

1161
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,359
you know some of these kind of folk

1162
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,680
psychology systems things and

1163
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,319
nlp and that and this approach gives a

1164
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,560
plausible way to understand what it's

1165
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,319
it's it's all one integration and

1166
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,960
it's not that you have someone going off

1167
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,680
and their

1168
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,280
visual system is in one part of the

1169
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,960
brain and this piece

1170
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,280
you know and in a way this is permeating

1171
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,680
how culture kind of thinks the brain

1172
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,560
works

1173
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,200
so and then bringing that in with the

1174
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,640
free energy as a way that it could

1175
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,319
actually integrate and it could be part

1176
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,040
of that

1177
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,640
and now this prediction um dynamic

1178
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,839
it is quite um

1179
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,680
it is quite possible that this could

1180
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,200
start to be

1181
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,760
more understood more generally as a

1182
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,640
model that

1183
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,839
is how we sort of work you know as to

1184
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:28,560
the

1185
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,319
uh different styles of learning or

1186
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,880
sensory modalities it could be that

1187
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,440
some cognitive diversity is such that

1188
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,400
the same

1189
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,599
symbols on the page will ignite

1190
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:40,400
something

1191
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,119
that the audio doesn't depending on

1192
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,480
where they can

1193
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,720
have their regime of attention which is

1194
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,400
a culturally

1195
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,599
inherited and co-created artifact so it

1196
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,200
allows instead of just saying well it's

1197
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,720
left brain right brain or it's this kind

1198
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,400
of person that kind of person

1199
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,720
it's about the dynamics of the system

1200
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,880
and oh would it be possible to do some

1201
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,800
sort of exercise to sensitize you or to

1202
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,079
allow you to perceive

1203
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,960
some dimension that your brain hadn't

1204
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,079
seen just like there's a good

1205
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,720
music or a good wine or something but

1206
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,440
it's something that

1207
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,640
is encultured and trained so let's get a

1208
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,079
little bit specific into the

1209
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,520
neuroscience

1210
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,839
before we go to the figures and that's

1211
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,599
just to talk about this erp

1212
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:25,760
or event related potential and the erp

1213
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,560
is a pattern that's kind of like a

1214
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,599
collective behavior

1215
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,160
of an electromagnetic field it's based

1216
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,520
upon eeg

1217
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,800
measurements which are

1218
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,520
electroencephalograms and those are just

1219
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,400
like electrical

1220
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,400
measurements around the scalp usually

1221
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,720
but it can be other places too

1222
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,440
and each of the little leads each of the

1223
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,079
measuring

1224
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,839
points on the eeg is a reference channel

1225
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:52,640
and then what happens is you could be

1226
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,520
taking these time

1227
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,839
series of the electrical potential at

1228
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,520
these different reference points

1229
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,480
and then using techniques like spm and

1230
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,520
other approaches

1231
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,079
to reconstruct you know generative

1232
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:04,960
capacity

1233
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,200
the electromagnetic field that gave rise

1234
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,079
to that

1235
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,440
data distribution of event leads

1236
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,480
references channels then

1237
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,240
you can align time series to events

1238
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,640
like if you clap your hands 10 times

1239
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,319
separated by 30 seconds

1240
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,640
you could take that big time series and

1241
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,640
then align all the claps

1242
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,680
and then ask is there like a coordinated

1243
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,839
probabilistic not every channel does it

1244
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,599
but when you align it you can see that

1245
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,800
yeah there is a dip and so that's the

1246
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,839
erp

1247
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,680
is when there's this spatial temporal

1248
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,000
pattern that might play out over

1249
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,880
tens or hundreds of milliseconds as

1250
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,079
shown here

1251
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,240
and in different brain regions it's

1252
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,480
known to have a canonical form

1253
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,119
and even diagnostic value in certain

1254
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:54,720
situations

1255
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,240
and there's a lot more to learn about

1256
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,839
here fristen's work

1257
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,000
buzaki many others but it's a big area

1258
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,359
but that's kind of what it is it's like

1259
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:02,319
a pattern

1260
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,319
of space and time in an electromagnetic

1261
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,319
field in response to an event

1262
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:07,520
any thoughts on that because it kind of

1263
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,359
comes into play for the paper yeah

1264
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,839
nice and and i noticed they i am this

1265
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,000
event related potential so

1266
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,640
yeah again it's giving you a way to to

1267
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,240
think about what happens when so you've

1268
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:18,560
got

1269
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,640
p one p two and

1270
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,240
p3 they talk about p3 more i noticed in

1271
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,119
the paper

1272
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,640
um there's this kind of main sort of lag

1273
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,000
but it gives it gives a sense of this

1274
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,640
temporal dynamics that are played

1275
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,960
there's an idea that something happening

1276
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,760
which is more cumulative maybe takes

1277
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,680
more

1278
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,440
time to go to

1279
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,040
register and that

1280
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,200
but it this this this model gives a

1281
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,560
plausible way where

1282
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,359
that could hint that some of the faster

1283
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,200
processes are actually

1284
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,359
sort of more closer to this flux and

1285
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:02,240
some of the others

1286
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,920
are closer to this awareness

1287
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,079
your consciousness yeah it's a lot like

1288
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,200
the pq

1289
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,319
rst system on the heart

1290
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,200
ekg and so you can say oh there's long

1291
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:15,839
qt

1292
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,760
interval it's because there's sort of a

1293
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,200
normal shape

1294
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,119
with variation and then if something is

1295
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,800
outside of a certain bound you can say

1296
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,480
this sort of interval is too long

1297
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,560
and then you can have a model of heart

1298
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,920
cells and if you had a model of heart

1299
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,359
cells with just the channels

1300
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:33,119
and you're getting the range of

1301
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,720
expressivity absorbed observed in the

1302
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,040
biological system it's pretty meaningful

1303
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,440
so let's look at figure one the first

1304
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,440
half of figure one i guess figure one a

1305
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,040
we could call it but we'll have figure

1306
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,720
one b2

1307
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,520
this is kind of the classic active

1308
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,400
inference

1309
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,119
graph this is one of our favorite

1310
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:51,599
figures

1311
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,520
and it's good that they put it in all

1312
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,200
kinds of papers

1313
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,319
what it describes is the relationship

1314
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,319
between at the starting at the bottom

1315
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:01,440
observed

1316
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,200
measurements in the world that are

1317
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,560
mapped through uh

1318
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,040
matrix a to hidden states of the world

1319
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,359
like is it actually light in the room

1320
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:10,800
is the hidden state and then you get

1321
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,720
photons on your eye and then there's a

1322
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,160
pretty clear mapping there but a

1323
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,079
could be probabilistic as well so that's

1324
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,520
about states that are hidden

1325
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,880
to observations through time um that are

1326
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,160
observed then this

1327
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,000
is actually a second level model where

1328
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,040
each hidden state it's evaluating

1329
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,960
what is going to be the state outcome

1330
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,640
mapping under

1331
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,000
a future time series so this is a little

1332
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,079
bit not the basic basic version but

1333
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,000
hopefully you'll have listened to a few

1334
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,560
other um like their model stream where

1335
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,920
they walk through from really

1336
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,480
the fundamental which is just the state

1337
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,040
outcome

1338
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,440
mapping so go to the model stream if you

1339
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,119
haven't seen this before at all

1340
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,160
then um d is the prior

1341
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,079
that plays into these second level state

1342
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,720
estimates and just like the b matrix at

1343
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,200
the

1344
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,359
lower level defines the transition

1345
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,880
between hidden states

1346
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,640
the b2 as opposed to b1 second level b

1347
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,760
matrix

1348
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,480
describes the transition frequency and

1349
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,280
patterns of

1350
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,359
the states at the higher level so this

1351
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,800
is kind of like that nice

1352
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,480
nesting you could have the higher level

1353
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,880
state changing and then lower level

1354
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,480
states changing

1355
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,400
what does influence the higher level

1356
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,680
state transition matrix pi policy

1357
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,440
so that's the innovation or one of them

1358
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,720
of active inference

1359
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,200
which is that instead of just estimating

1360
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,960
how states change

1361
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,960
hidden states change through time we

1362
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,200
estimate a conditional

1363
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,800
related to how our policies influence

1364
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,880
states changing through time that's the

1365
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,680
pie coming into b2

1366
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,880
our policies are selected

1367
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,000
from our affordances and they're sort of

1368
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,520
differentially weighted

1369
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,400
in terms of their instantaneous uh

1370
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,920
attractability

1371
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,680
in terms of this g functional which is a

1372
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,480
expected free free energy minimization

1373
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,359
of policy

1374
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:09,760
down here g of pi not just some abstract

1375
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,280
g floating out there in space but

1376
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,559
of a policy and it takes in

1377
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:18,079
arguments like c the preferences

1378
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,000
and c is the preference vector okay so i

1379
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,079
think that's all the letters on here

1380
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,680
good any thoughts on this steven or we

1381
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,040
can go to this figure one b

1382
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,960
no i think well i think this is a one

1383
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,480
thing i've noticed is also they've got

1384
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,400
at the top the variational free energy

1385
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,760
which is kind of the

1386
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,240
the broad kind of dynamic that flows as

1387
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,680
you mentioned and like you just

1388
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,160
mentioned

1389
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,920
it's the when you start to got the

1390
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,280
policies involved

1391
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,440
um you've got this expected free energy

1392
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,520
which um

1393
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,359
is more tied to

1394
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,559
how that might relate to particular

1395
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,160
actions for the organism

1396
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,280
um so i think that makes and also i

1397
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,040
suppose the other point that's there

1398
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,280
you mentioned there you know the b1

1399
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,559
matrices

1400
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,240
it it could almost be assumed that

1401
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,720
that's a that's like the flux it's it's

1402
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,200
kind of

1403
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,480
it keeps churning over and it will it

1404
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:10,800
will

1405
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,040
it will work out it will come and start

1406
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,960
to populate its values

1407
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,520
whereas these higher levels you have

1408
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,559
your priors it's

1409
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,240
in you know it might not be that

1410
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,960
important where my retina is

1411
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,000
in its state at this moment

1412
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,839
it will just populate and start to come

1413
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,559
to some equilibrium whereas what i think

1414
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:31,359
i'm seeing

1415
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,839
my prior might be at these higher levels

1416
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:36,880
a more

1417
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,839
significant parameter and that's

1418
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,440
reflected in

1419
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,119
that model cool very nicely said about

1420
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:45,440
how

1421
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,680
our priors or system priors even to

1422
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,640
remove the whole

1423
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,720
awareness consciousness thing system

1424
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,800
priors are semantic

1425
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,880
it's like i expect i'm a veterinary

1426
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,640
scanner or i'm a check scanner

1427
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,000
at the atm i expect a check

1428
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,319
it's like it doesn't expect the pixel to

1429
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:03,920
be in this spot and the green and the

1430
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,520
this way to be here

1431
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,920
it expects something semantic and part

1432
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,119
of the challenge

1433
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:10,960
with talking about observations and

1434
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,720
making meaning from data and sense

1435
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,880
making from large data

1436
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,680
and scaling sense making is that the

1437
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,119
bottom level data is almost by

1438
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,079
definition

1439
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,480
meaningless especially with respect to

1440
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,160
the larger level semantic

1441
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,000
question so yeah there's parts of the

1442
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,760
check that are sub meaningful

1443
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,400
but the pixel can't be too meaningful

1444
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,839
otherwise you need to do a whole nother

1445
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,760
model to really break that down

1446
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,599
so it is interesting that the d prior

1447
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,520
enters at the second level state

1448
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,559
but there's no d1 so maybe it's not

1449
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,319
shown or maybe we can ask where that

1450
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,319
is coming from let's look at yeah maybe

1451
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:45,839
it's not

1452
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,000
it's not necessarily so important for

1453
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,960
the modeling and

1454
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,200
so that that in a way this this is quite

1455
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,400
useful for

1456
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,680
showing i mean in some ways they say

1457
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,280
that's where autism can have challenges

1458
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,319
because

1459
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:59,359
that there's not that ability to

1460
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:01,599
know where to put your priors and and to

1461
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,119
to resolve things so

1462
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,520
um just one other point in here is they

1463
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,400
don't

1464
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,880
in the expected free energy for vision

1465
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,000
because they're looking at sort of

1466
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,520
salience of vision

1467
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,640
or fragment the idea of risk

1468
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,240
which is sometimes shown in that

1469
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,760
expected free energy is not in there

1470
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,280
because i suppose for this model that's

1471
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,480
not really

1472
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,559
it's not relevant for the vision system

1473
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,319
in the type of

1474
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,160
way that they're exploring consciousness

1475
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,359
so it just shows again that the way that

1476
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:33,760
the equations or the terms can be

1477
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:38,480
constructed is related to the nature of

1478
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,520
the way that the what's most relevant to

1479
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,240
the type

1480
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,520
of dynamic that's being looked at

1481
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,440
and i think that's quite interesting

1482
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,280
right it's not the free energy

1483
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,839
of like the system with a no function in

1484
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:52,559
mind

1485
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,520
it's a calculated free energy that is

1486
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,240
related to

1487
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,440
policy as implemented by some actor in

1488
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,640
the space

1489
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,240
so it's not just like we're making one

1490
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,400
general free energy principle model of

1491
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:04,800
some

1492
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,720
system we're doing task specific

1493
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,839
specific behavior

1494
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,520
and i'm sure that ryan and christopher

1495
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,760
will have a lot to add on that

1496
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,000
so here's the second half of figure 1b

1497
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,359
or figurehead one

1498
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,240
and it takes some of those letters that

1499
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:18,800
we saw

1500
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,400
in the first part of figure 1 a b c d

1501
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,480
and then also adding in e i think down

1502
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,200
there which is the kind of affordances

1503
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,119
prior which is not here but it connects

1504
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:30,319
to pi as well

1505
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:33,440
so there's a few other aspects and then

1506
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,960
it maps it onto

1507
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,079
parts of the brain human style brain

1508
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,359
that are tractable or plausible

1509
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:45,359
or where the architecture of how those

1510
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:47,200
brain regions are connected or

1511
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,119
functionally linked through dynamic

1512
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,040
causal modeling spm

1513
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,559
so if there's a functional or an

1514
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:53,920
anatomical connection between these

1515
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,200
brain regions

1516
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,280
with that directionality it seemed to be

1517
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,200
some might think of it as confirmatory

1518
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,720
or supportive evidence

1519
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,520
for that biological systems do free

1520
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,680
energy principle or active inference

1521
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,680
another way of thinking about it is it's

1522
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,720
the computational

1523
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,640
realization of a process that

1524
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,800
surprisingly or unsurprisingly can be

1525
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,400
modeled with active inference type

1526
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,240
models there's a few different ways you

1527
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,760
can think about it but they're kind of

1528
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,119
laying out this probabilistic

1529
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,440
graphical bayesian network and they're

1530
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,839
kind of laying that out onto the brain's

1531
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,240
neural architecture and there's a lot

1532
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,839
more papers that go into detail here

1533
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:39,200
any thoughts or ready to continue

1534
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,800
yeah i think an interesting question is

1535
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,359
like where does the body come into play

1536
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:46,079
like this is one level of the nesting

1537
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:46,800
but

1538
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,960
how far is this model towards

1539
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,480
just basic group communication models or

1540
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,720
some other type of modeling anyways

1541
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:00,000
let's return to the sort of

1542
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,599
specifics of their experiment they

1543
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:03,119
included figure one i think

1544
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,119
to be just very clear about active

1545
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:06,319
inference which is great because it

1546
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:07,599
helps the paper

1547
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:10,400
be accessible to those who are outside

1548
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,520
the field and also

1549
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,079
everybody in active inference can always

1550
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:16,319
go back to the basics and the terms

1551
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,119
because it just always helps us here's

1552
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,079
what they do

1553
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:22,240
in the results the first part and then

1554
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,160
we're gonna go look at figure 2 and the

1555
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,119
task

1556
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:28,000
so results section 3. as a proof of

1557
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,559
principle we first simulated 200 trials

1558
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:31,839
so they're going to be having a

1559
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,920
behavioral paradigm where they can have

1560
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,640
a fully

1561
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,000
in silico fully simulated experiment

1562
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,200
so it's going to be like an experiment

1563
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,240
that a person could do but they're going

1564
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,000
to totally simulate it

1565
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,839
and some of them are going to have

1566
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,200
square present

1567
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,680
and some obviously won't and then

1568
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,599
there's going to be model parameters

1569
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,480
that relate to attention and model

1570
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,200
parameters

1571
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,680
that relate to stimulus strength so off

1572
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,559
the bat

1573
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,240
you might imagine okay well if the

1574
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,000
stimulus is stronger like the sound is

1575
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,799
louder

1576
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:03,040
to some point it's going to be easier to

1577
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,720
say yep i heard that sound

1578
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,359
so if it's a bold line versus if it's a

1579
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:08,400
tiny faint

1580
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,520
you know gray on gray situation

1581
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,440
and then there's also the attention so

1582
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,119
if it said oh pay no attention to the

1583
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,559
middle look away and then something

1584
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,000
flash in the middle you're less likely

1585
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,880
to see it

1586
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,640
than if you were to be looking at the

1587
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,960
middle so that's the kind of an

1588
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,319
experimental setup that they're going to

1589
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:25,520
be simulating

1590
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:29,200
completely in silica here is what

1591
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,558
they're going to show in figure 2.

1592
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,839
there's this sort of visual pattern at

1593
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:36,880
time point one

1594
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,200
and this is what also allows them to use

1595
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,000
discrete

1596
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,680
time models like as currently shown

1597
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,520
the active inference model where it's

1598
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,720
like t1

1599
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,960
is here t2 is here and t3 is here

1600
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,599
so they can actually get a lot of power

1601
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,280
out of this sort of like checkpoint

1602
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,040
type almost kairos driven analysis

1603
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,319
really and then they show an ambiguous

1604
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,960
stimulus where it replaces these

1605
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:05,680
diagonal

1606
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,960
lines with partially with a square

1607
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,760
and then it flips back to the bars the

1608
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,160
agent is then required to either

1609
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,680
uh say yes i saw a square or

1610
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,559
no i didn't see a square so that's the

1611
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:21,440
sense

1612
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,000
and here's the action so if anyone has

1613
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,799
made it this far

1614
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,480
and was still like wait but they didn't

1615
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,319
explain you know consciousness

1616
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:31,760
of this system or of theology it's it's

1617
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,319
not

1618
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:34,880
this paper this is only about this task

1619
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,920
paradigm

1620
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,280
any thoughts on that or continue

1621
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,040
yep all right so

1622
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,559
they um this was just useful in terms of

1623
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,720
from their thinking in their discussion

1624
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,400
for those who want to read a little more

1625
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,880
about why the time scales are the way

1626
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,079
that they are

1627
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:57,040
okay figure three is a bayesian network

1628
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,000
description

1629
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,640
of the generative model with arrows

1630
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,000
showing dependencies between hidden

1631
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,280
state factors and outcome

1632
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,680
modalities okay so this is kind of like

1633
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,520
at first i was like wait what is this it

1634
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,040
looks like a

1635
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,839
an app or a game or something like a

1636
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:12,880
network model

1637
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,880
but it is actually so at um

1638
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,400
the level one

1639
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,559
let's look at these are the hidden state

1640
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,640
factors these are the report

1641
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,480
would be i'm waiting i haven't reported

1642
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,000
yet which is actually a state

1643
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,119
seen or unseen so this is sort of

1644
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:33,520
one of the hidden state s factors that

1645
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,760
we're going to fit with data

1646
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,040
then there is um the trial

1647
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,160
phase which is the time steps of the

1648
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,359
model

1649
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:46,400
and then there's going to be the uh sort

1650
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,440
of visually

1651
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,960
differentiating features of the model

1652
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,520
so it's sort of like you know round one

1653
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,799
inning one

1654
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:56,720
first out it's kind of like identifying

1655
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,720
where you are in the model as a state

1656
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,520
in the model which is something that was

1657
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,559
really important

1658
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,520
in this framing of the model so check

1659
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,720
out the model stream because it matters

1660
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,599
if you're in

1661
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,720
trial two row three or trial four row

1662
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,400
two or something like that

1663
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,440
and then at the very bottom level is the

1664
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,960
square or the lines

1665
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,160
here there's also this red or black

1666
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,079
thing so i'm not going into that but

1667
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,440
it's whether there's the square or the

1668
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,960
lines being seen

1669
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,000
and then words i uh silent or i

1670
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,319
see a square square didn't see anything

1671
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:29,200
okay

1672
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,119
so it's sort of like the generative

1673
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:32,799
models if they saw it or not

1674
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,880
so we need to have some integrated way

1675
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,599
to combine the trial phases

1676
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,920
and what is actually being displayed

1677
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,680
which we control in the experimental

1678
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,960
context

1679
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,000
with their hidden

1680
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,480
perception as to for example the

1681
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,319
sequence of two different things

1682
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:52,079
so if it was first the square or the

1683
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,079
diagonal and then red or black

1684
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,440
you could have four different

1685
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,599
combinations and if it is

1686
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,480
held across trials you had to have like

1687
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,079
been aware of it

1688
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:04,319
so the thinking would go like i'm going

1689
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,000
to read you a color and then a name and

1690
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,280
then you're going to tell me both in a

1691
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,160
row

1692
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,400
and so that's a report that they're

1693
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,839
going to be able to say

1694
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:14,640
and then that's the attentional mask

1695
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,400
because that allows them to say

1696
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,400
not report on the color but report on

1697
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,720
just the square being there or not

1698
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,720
so it's kind of like everything in this

1699
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,920
experiment

1700
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,880
is like locked down not that everything

1701
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,160
the person's shirt color

1702
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,280
and how they felt about it not that that

1703
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,760
is all explained in this model

1704
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,839
but it's sort of modeling the input and

1705
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,599
the output and then leaving the rest

1706
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,319
actually for context

1707
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,079
so we can hear more about that from the

1708
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:46,720
authors anything on figure three

1709
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,960
yeah and i think they can speak to that

1710
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,480
more i think one thing is what's

1711
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,240
interesting is they they use this

1712
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,119
these different words rather than just

1713
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:55,760
like

1714
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,119
red or no you know just basically saying

1715
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:01,200
red when you see red or black when you

1716
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,559
see black

1717
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:04,799
they had a rationale there to separate

1718
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:05,680
it out

1719
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,559
so that it helped them have a bigger

1720
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:09,839
time window

1721
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:12,000
um but i'd be i think they could speak

1722
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,359
to that better than i can so

1723
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,680
yep nice the level two outcomes are

1724
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,000
level one hidden state factors

1725
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,640
so the higher level is getting um

1726
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,480
connected to lower level in this

1727
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,920
way and then also if you really follow

1728
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,839
some of these lines like weight

1729
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:28,640
only maps to silent and that only maps

1730
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,799
to the observable silent

1731
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:32,960
scene maps to different things in unseen

1732
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,240
they both are i

1733
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,280
see and you know could be uh

1734
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,200
that's it like i see that's where the

1735
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,440
divergence point is they're both about

1736
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,480
a perspective and perception and then

1737
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,119
a square that's only for this thin dash

1738
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:48,160
for scene

1739
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,480
or i didn't see anything from the unseen

1740
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,680
condition

1741
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,520
so it's kind of showing how even the

1742
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,280
lexical tokens

1743
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:00,319
are mapped from probabilistic estimates

1744
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:03,520
of higher order models and that also

1745
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,040
relates to this quantization

1746
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,599
and this quantum nature of communication

1747
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:08,240
and it's like

1748
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,319
you're forcing them to say i saw it or

1749
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,880
not it's not a slider how sure where you

1750
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,880
saw it you could design that experiment

1751
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,000
make that model but in this paper

1752
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,880
there's a lexical interpretation of

1753
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,000
their actions

1754
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,079
because they're only given the option

1755
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:25,280
yes i did see it

1756
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,400
no i did not see it so by constraining

1757
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,839
the experiment

1758
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:32,880
you can uh do things again

1759
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,400
leave it up to someone to debate whether

1760
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,119
that is uh cutting too much away

1761
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:41,119
all right so four is split in half

1762
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,599
and here's where they sort of are just

1763
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:44,799
proof testing

1764
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:47,040
their simulation that's the foundational

1765
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,480
simulation

1766
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,599
and this is just to check

1767
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:54,079
some of the basis of their model and

1768
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:54,960
what we can see

1769
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,680
on this left one is that when the square

1770
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:58,559
is shown

1771
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:00,000
so here's the four possible hidden

1772
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,039
states it's like four horse racing lanes

1773
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:05,359
and we can see that there's this gray

1774
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:06,559
that's

1775
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,160
the red one is never even on the table

1776
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,280
because they haven't even brought that

1777
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,880
level into play yet

1778
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,359
but there's this gray competition 50 50

1779
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:14,400
i'm not sure

1780
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,880
that's just reflecting the prior of

1781
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,799
whether it's going to be the dashes or

1782
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:20,160
the squares because remember

1783
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,920
did you see it or not and not is going

1784
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,280
to be the dash

1785
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,960
and then the stimulus occurs and then

1786
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,359
there's rapidly a convergence towards

1787
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:30,960
yep i saw it

1788
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,160
and that convergence is associated with

1789
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,480
a transient period of elevated firing

1790
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,160
rates of

1791
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,400
the first level of the model so that's

1792
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,440
where we're going to get some of the

1793
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,200
cross

1794
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,760
experimental modality work because this

1795
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,480
isn't just a bayesian phenomenological

1796
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,359
analysis of probability it's actually

1797
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:52,240
linked to

1798
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,799
a mechanistic process model so if you

1799
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:56,319
found a brain region that were firing

1800
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:57,520
that way

1801
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,119
and removing it did the same thing that

1802
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:00,799
removing this did

1803
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:02,160
all of a sudden you'd start to be seeing

1804
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,839
a lot of model reification

1805
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:05,680
and then they also tie in the

1806
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,920
probabilistic component firing rates

1807
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,119
the first level firing rates in the

1808
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,400
self-report and then conversely

1809
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,680
on the square absent condition it's the

1810
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,200
same thing it's gray

1811
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,319
and then there's no transient period of

1812
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,280
firing

1813
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,039
and then it just converges towards not

1814
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:24,799
seeing anything so it was like it was

1815
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:26,640
waiting it was waiting

1816
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,240
and then it converged upon not seeing

1817
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,280
anything so that's figure four that was

1818
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,400
just sort of like because they're like

1819
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,520
oh yeah after

1820
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,119
three four five like i'm waiting i'm

1821
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:37,200
waiting waiting uh no

1822
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,240
just didn't happen so that was one

1823
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,160
now let's look at another um a little

1824
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,440
bit more nuanced way

1825
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,720
to look at that in five so here there's

1826
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:47,839
two

1827
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:49,599
axes it's kind of like a punnett square

1828
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:52,160
or eisenhower matrix a two by two

1829
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,400
and it it's called a four-way taxonomy

1830
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,000
so just like we kind of hinted at

1831
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,440
earlier

1832
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,720
you can tune model parameters to have

1833
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:04,240
low or high endogenous attention

1834
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,240
and then you can tune model parameters

1835
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,400
so that the stimulus is like shriek

1836
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,319
is weak versus strong so that would be

1837
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:12,319
like thick versus thin line or could be

1838
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:14,319
rapidly flashed versus not

1839
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:16,960
so you could imagine if it's a weak

1840
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,160
signal

1841
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:21,440
and the attention is absent very few

1842
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,200
are going to see it if it is a

1843
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,960
strong signal and attention is being

1844
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,119
paid you'd expect a higher amount to see

1845
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:29,760
it

1846
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,000
so empirically what you do to make the

1847
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,520
attention increased or what you do to

1848
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,200
increase the signal strength

1849
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,680
that's a detailed question but their

1850
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,480
model

1851
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,400
is doing quite a few things here and so

1852
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,480
it's a higher high energy high density

1853
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,039
representation because they're showing

1854
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:46,160
that basically

1855
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:49,440
they do recapitulate that pattern with

1856
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,160
high percent seen self report and high

1857
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,440
correctness rates

1858
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,160
with an archetypal firing rate at the

1859
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,920
first and the second level

1860
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,200
that are reminiscent of erps

1861
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,480
and the erp p3 looking like

1862
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,200
arises at the second level so it's not

1863
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:07,599
like

1864
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:09,839
the data have a structure that give rise

1865
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,119
to the p3

1866
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:14,400
it's like the p3 is an emergent behavior

1867
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,559
of something that as you're saying is

1868
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:17,520
more like

1869
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:20,240
forming and unforming at the lower level

1870
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,160
in the semantics and then the response

1871
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,799
that we actually observed the system do

1872
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,240
is this higher level

1873
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,160
and then it's absent in the other three

1874
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,680
cases

1875
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,760
and in those cases the accuracy here's

1876
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,880
almost 100 percent

1877
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,079
in this it's 58 47 61. so it's about

1878
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:38,400
50 50. and remember they have to make a

1879
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,599
forest choice

1880
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:40,960
and they're not always sure their

1881
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,039
confidence isn't 100

1882
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,839
so that just shows that like you get

1883
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:46,720
confidence

1884
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:50,000
and experience and firing rate and

1885
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,200
second but not first level erp dynamics

1886
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,720
in the high attention high signal

1887
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,240
strength condition

1888
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,559
very clean finding and then you can

1889
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:00,079
disentangle

1890
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:03,359
attention and signal strength and then

1891
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:04,880
just show that like whether you pull

1892
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,760
one away or the other you destroy the

1893
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,400
erp

1894
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,880
you ru you reduce the number of people

1895
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,559
who the simulation runs

1896
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:14,960
that said they saw it and it reduces the

1897
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,079
accuracy

1898
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:19,359
to a large extent so that's like a

1899
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:24,799
big finding of the model

1900
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,200
any thoughts on that yeah thanks that's

1901
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,680
really good to go through that i think

1902
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,880
um

1903
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,720
because there's a lot in this diagram it

1904
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,119
can be a little bit uh

1905
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:40,720
to first see and i think just looking

1906
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,680
at that you know first level and

1907
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,440
noticing how

1908
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,480
all four quadrants have got this parry

1909
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,640
stimulus time this kind of

1910
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,559
first level firing is present like you

1911
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:53,920
just mentioned

1912
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,559
in the in the black graph and then you

1913
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:58,880
know only on that

1914
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,160
bottom right that you have this very

1915
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,960
strong so this this does indicate that

1916
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,880
when you have sufficient signal

1917
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,480
in relation to attention bang

1918
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,559
you know it's it's it has a certain

1919
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,640
on-off-ness to it which is

1920
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,400
kind of what they're trying to show very

1921
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,400
nice to connect it to the ignition

1922
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,720
model of the neuronal workspace which is

1923
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:23,440
like

1924
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,200
yeah if it's loud but you weren't paying

1925
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,359
attention sufficiently

1926
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:30,640
then you're not gonna or the other

1927
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:33,119
quadrant it's like it doesn't ignite but

1928
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,720
when you get both together when you get

1929
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:35,200
somebody

1930
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,200
looking at the screen and it's the right

1931
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,400
stimulus

1932
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,400
it's not just a little bit different

1933
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,720
than them not looking at the screen

1934
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,039
it's so different it's qualitatively

1935
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:47,200
different it's a categorical difference

1936
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,960
and so that is something that's

1937
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,280
reflected categorically

1938
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,240
in this model flat versus not flat now

1939
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,280
it's a simple

1940
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,039
model but no it makes me

1941
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:01,760
but yeah i don't know it's a simple

1942
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,440
model but this is like a lot for a

1943
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,559
simple model to show

1944
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:07,760
i was just going to make a little

1945
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:08,880
anecdote there and say it's sunny

1946
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,400
slightly to the side but when my

1947
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,200
daughter was um i think she was like

1948
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,440
nine months old we had the fire alarm go

1949
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:15,839
off

1950
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:19,600
and it was literally like ear breakingly

1951
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,799
loud she was sleeping through it all

1952
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:25,839
and so you know that i know it's not

1953
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:28,560
but the same kind of idea is there this

1954
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:29,120
idea that

1955
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,640
because obviously i know it's sleep but

1956
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,719
it's still an intentional state

1957
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:35,198
uh it wasn't and you'd expect someone to

1958
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:36,158
always wake up

1959
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:38,560
because of the loudness it is an

1960
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:39,279
attentional

1961
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:41,600
state absolutely and it's it's

1962
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,359
encultured and it's developed

1963
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:45,520
and somebody could have phases or you

1964
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,359
know all these things can come into play

1965
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:48,640
it is like

1966
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,520
is the noise hitting the eardrum yes are

1967
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,120
the neurons firing

1968
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,960
that's where predictive processing has a

1969
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,560
lot to say and that's why it was an

1970
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,158
important theory because the centralized

1971
01:08:58,158 --> 01:08:59,198
processing theory

1972
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:01,920
would be like it hits the baby's eardrum

1973
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:02,640
it goes full

1974
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,799
force loud sound incoming and then

1975
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:06,158
there's the naptime

1976
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:08,158
region and that just says nope i'm

1977
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:09,839
asleep we just don't listen to sound

1978
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:11,439
when i'm asleep

1979
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,600
the predictive processing model is that

1980
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:14,880
there's a generative

1981
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:17,120
capacity like we're sleeping almost

1982
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,238
semantically

1983
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:20,719
and that propagates in a way that

1984
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:21,600
dampens

1985
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:25,040
the ignition of loud sounds so the net

1986
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,719
effect is loud sounds don't wake the

1987
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:27,759
sleeping baby

1988
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:29,359
but it's extremely different if there's

1989
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:31,198
like the central commander

1990
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:33,359
that's receiving the raw sensory input

1991
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:35,359
and processing it's not what happens

1992
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,439
and it is much more like this generative

1993
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:39,359
semantic capacity of systems to have

1994
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:40,960
meaningful modes

1995
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,719
that are distractible or not

1996
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:45,198
distractible to different stimuli

1997
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:48,560
so pretty nice good good baby story

1998
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,279
so here's another phenomena that they're

1999
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:51,759
going to

2000
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:54,800
recapitulate so let's expand it in

2001
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,000
6. so this is the inattentional

2002
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,520
blindness task and it's just

2003
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:04,000
another task where basically they're

2004
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,840
going to differentiate a few

2005
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,760
different uh experimental treatments

2006
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,840
that usually would be used to pull out

2007
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,960
attentional intentional blindness but

2008
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,080
sort of just the summary of this is

2009
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:19,840
in uh phase three which

2010
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,719
uh was the self report you can read the

2011
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,360
caption for

2012
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,600
what they are but similarly depending on

2013
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,920
which pieces and phases you add in

2014
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,640
you get the existence of the simulated

2015
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:31,920
erp

2016
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,000
and a high fraction of having seen it if

2017
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,080
there was attention

2018
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,320
but then in the case where it wasn't

2019
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,520
seen

2020
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,760
then it just is like a totally flat

2021
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,040
piece

2022
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,480
so this is just uh then from the caption

2023
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:46,880
says

2024
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,600
in uh phase two firing rate plots

2025
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,120
illustrate how more gradual updates in

2026
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,719
the second level beliefs do not produce

2027
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:55,040
p3 like erps

2028
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,280
so it's interesting to think about how

2029
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:00,000
they can actually titrate stimuli

2030
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,640
and find out oh was the system updating

2031
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,320
all of a sudden or was there more of

2032
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,159
like continuous updating

2033
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:07,760
but these are just kind of going into

2034
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,679
specific um

2035
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:11,520
examples that are like laid out in a

2036
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,440
clear way but it's just it's a lot of

2037
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:16,080
info that might be interesting for some

2038
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:16,480
but

2039
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,400
there's five more so let's just rapidly

2040
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,960
kind of go through the figures yeah

2041
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,320
figure seven is another layout of their

2042
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:28,000
experimental results and again

2043
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,640
it's a sort of spread where on the left

2044
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:31,520
you have no

2045
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,520
attention absence attention and the

2046
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,840
right there is a regime of attention

2047
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,400
parameter and then similarly weak

2048
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,840
strength signal on top

2049
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,280
strong strength signal on the bottom and

2050
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:46,000
they're looking at the effect of a third

2051
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:46,640
dimension

2052
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,840
so this could have been like a hyper

2053
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,320
cube of statistical results

2054
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,840
and that's what this model and the

2055
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,400
markov decision process allows

2056
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,400
is instead of just making one model and

2057
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,239
crafting it we could make like a

2058
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:00,400
spectrum of 5000 models that are just

2059
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,640
incrementally different and then report

2060
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:03,440
the whole

2061
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,679
distribution so here within each

2062
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:06,640
quadrant

2063
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,280
the left is inconsistent prior and the

2064
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,159
right is a

2065
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,719
consistent prior so here consistent

2066
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:13,679
prior

2067
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:16,239
strong signal high attention now we can

2068
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:17,280
kind of imagine that's like

2069
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,840
the focus you know paying only attention

2070
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:20,400
to that and

2071
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,400
blasts right in your face and it's like

2072
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:26,320
100 saw it and 100 were correct

2073
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,719
really salient stimuli really clear

2074
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:29,760
self-report

2075
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,120
no one's really doubting that they

2076
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,040
perceived it with qualia these are the

2077
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,239
easy cases

2078
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:37,360
okay everything else is the gray zone

2079
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,960
because if you have an inconsistent

2080
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,800
prior again it's just a model

2081
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,239
we're just experimenting and thinking

2082
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,159
about it but it's interesting that

2083
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:47,199
94 saw it 95 are correct

2084
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:50,560
so even uh with high attention and high

2085
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,159
signal strength

2086
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,239
if your priors i'm not sure about what

2087
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:55,600
i'm seeing

2088
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,080
then 1 out of 20 people in the

2089
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:58,800
simulation

2090
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,120
again just loosely 1 out of 20 will

2091
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,800
still not see it

2092
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,239
but it was right there and they were

2093
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:06,000
paying attention to it so there's a lot

2094
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:06,960
of kind of

2095
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,560
psychology anecdotes about stuff like

2096
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,080
that like the whole room says that

2097
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,480
line a is longer than line b and then

2098
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,560
the last person just is like

2099
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,520
i guess it's that way even though they

2100
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,719
think that they're there to actually

2101
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:20,320
speak the truth so

2102
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,320
people can look at the percentages and

2103
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,600
read more stories

2104
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,360
but this is a very interesting modeling

2105
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,040
framework because we can talk about how

2106
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,080
these different

2107
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,080
components of certainty and sense and

2108
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,000
action are related in different

2109
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,960
people's perspectives

2110
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,360
i mean this this could be interesting as

2111
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,120
well where it talks about this

2112
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:44,880
um inconsistent prior

2113
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,719
when you even have a strong um you know

2114
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:51,440
a strong signal but if you've got an

2115
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,120
inconsistent prior

2116
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:56,960
you may not be aware um of something

2117
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:59,360
and there's this this challenge in a way

2118
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,080
where people

2119
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,360
can be um tricked you know like we're

2120
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,239
seeing with the internet and

2121
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:08,560
cambridge analytics if you feed things

2122
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:09,600
through

2123
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,360
a level where it's not a strong enough

2124
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,440
signal but it has associative

2125
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:17,280
qualities you may be starting to

2126
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,679
have that feed into your consciousness

2127
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:21,120
at another level

2128
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:25,280
but it's not activating your awareness

2129
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:28,000
so i think that some of these questions

2130
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,040
you know that

2131
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,760
um you know and people might not notice

2132
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,040
that happening because

2133
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:36,239
when they do pay attention they you know

2134
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:38,239
every they they they they think they've

2135
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:39,520
seen everything there is to see but

2136
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,239
there may be some things which are

2137
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:45,440
just inconsistent with their priors as

2138
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:46,960
much as they're weak

2139
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,360
you know they could be and there's a

2140
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,640
there's a little bit of an interplay

2141
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:51,440
potentially

2142
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,760
there that could be going on which we're

2143
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,040
not aware of

2144
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,480
nice and then also like even on the

2145
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,040
other extreme if it's consistent prior

2146
01:14:59,040 --> 01:14:59,440
but

2147
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,199
low attention and weak signal you still

2148
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:02,719
sometimes report it and you still might

2149
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:04,960
be correct even at a higher

2150
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,159
uh amount of correctness and so

2151
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:11,760
a lot of times um belief and faith

2152
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,480
are as are as if they're to be ridiculed

2153
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:15,440
and that's just

2154
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:18,719
so far off from the way that everything

2155
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:19,840
is

2156
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,960
figure eight is uh again another

2157
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,640
two by two with the tension and signal

2158
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,800
strength and they're just really going

2159
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:27,360
into

2160
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,719
uh detail now overlaying this

2161
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:34,400
prior consistency inconsistency question

2162
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:38,400
and adding a neutral prior as well uh

2163
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,320
and now overlaying those three so to be

2164
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,159
almost like there was three cells here

2165
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:44,239
but now overlaying those as three traces

2166
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:46,080
of the erp

2167
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:48,560
so what they're showing is that you get

2168
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:49,440
sort of

2169
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,920
the prior is like a fine tune it's like

2170
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,360
a tweak

2171
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:56,480
but it remains pretty much to be the

2172
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,520
case

2173
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:01,120
that you see the categorical difference

2174
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,360
uh amongst each quadrant and

2175
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:04,159
interestingly

2176
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:06,480
the one that dips down gives like a

2177
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,080
quasi p3

2178
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,239
is the consistent prior strong signal

2179
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:11,679
low attention

2180
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:13,120
so that's like you're not really paying

2181
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:14,800
attention but something loud happens

2182
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,199
and you're sure that it's possible

2183
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:18,480
that's actually the one that comes

2184
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,679
closest

2185
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:23,199
to actually inducing uh and we can look

2186
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:25,199
at here percent c95

2187
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:27,600
low attention high signal strength so

2188
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,040
it's pretty interesting that

2189
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,600
it's easier to have again you have to

2190
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,880
calibrate it's real people

2191
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,360
but it's easier to notice something when

2192
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,640
it's a strong signal

2193
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,880
even if you weren't paying attention

2194
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,320
than it is

2195
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,640
if you um are paying attention but it's

2196
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,320
a weak signal

2197
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,920
but maybe there's values for which it's

2198
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:47,520
one way or the other but it really

2199
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,600
separates those two things like is this

2200
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,440
a subtle point in the text

2201
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,120
or is this person just not paying

2202
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,719
attention to the sentence

2203
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:56,480
and those are sort of two questions and

2204
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:57,840
you want them both to be

2205
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,000
clear and so that you can align the

2206
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,400
regime of attention but

2207
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,800
that's why this is such a cool framework

2208
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,480
okay

2209
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,239
we're not going to go into too much

2210
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:09,840
detail here but this

2211
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,239
is a experimental paradigm laid out with

2212
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:14,239
sort of classical psychologist

2213
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:17,520
style of uh quote independent

2214
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:18,560
manipulation of

2215
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,320
expectations stimulus strength and

2216
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,960
attention so they're able to use

2217
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:25,440
repetition and variation in a specific

2218
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:26,159
way

2219
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:28,480
so that you can disentangle certain

2220
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:29,600
attributes

2221
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,760
from the sequence of behavior which is

2222
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,360
something that we actually heard about

2223
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,480
from adam saffron and colin de young

2224
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:39,120
in the first streams of this year with

2225
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,960
the way that you could look beyond the

2226
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,040
personality surveys to the cybernetic

2227
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,040
big five personality traits

2228
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,880
so this is kind of like similar it's

2229
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,880
revealing higher order

2230
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,920
parametric values from

2231
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,320
behavioral sequences that disentangle or

2232
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:55,920
just like a gambling paradigm might be

2233
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,679
high risk low risk high reward low

2234
01:17:57,679 --> 01:17:58,239
reward

2235
01:17:58,239 --> 01:17:59,840
so you're disentangling a few different

2236
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,679
attributes the person's model

2237
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:04,560
it's kind of like that but for visual

2238
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,280
consciousness

2239
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,600
access attention and then just to go

2240
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,520
through the a1 and a2 supplements just

2241
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:10,320
before we

2242
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,440
kind of hit some closing thoughts so

2243
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,000
a1 is their specification of the first

2244
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,760
level generative model matrices

2245
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:21,040
so let's definitely have them

2246
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,360
talk about these but if you'll remember

2247
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,679
from the model stream

2248
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:28,480
it's all about specifying the matrices

2249
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,159
and the calculations are all about

2250
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:31,840
matrix multiplication

2251
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,159
small or big or nested series of

2252
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:35,040
matrices or

2253
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,920
lists of lists of lists and so each of

2254
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:38,480
these

2255
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,960
outcomes at each level when we're

2256
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,280
looking at figure

2257
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,600
3 this kind of colorful connectivity

2258
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,840
model each one of these

2259
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,239
are basically reflected by a row or a

2260
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:51,440
value

2261
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:54,560
in a matrix two spaces 17

2262
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,440
matrices seeing a theme with the

2263
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,960
matrices and how

2264
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,360
they can represent different things like

2265
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:02,480
attention

2266
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:06,000
or a word so then a certain combination

2267
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,159
of rows is i didn't see a square

2268
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:11,280
or i see a square but there's semantic

2269
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,239
meaning

2270
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:15,440
to the composition of a matrix and then

2271
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,080
you can do

2272
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,840
probabilistic inference using that

2273
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,120
matrix

2274
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,080
and then the second supplemental figure

2275
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,120
is the seconds

2276
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,640
level matrix structure it's like

2277
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,280
you thought the movie was long wait till

2278
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,880
you see the higher level matrix

2279
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,280
and here it's similar except now we're

2280
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:36,239
dealing with these hidden joint states

2281
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:37,920
and that's why that was the second level

2282
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,400
in the model where these higher level

2283
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:44,159
states that also deal with

2284
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:47,280
the behavior of the agent so

2285
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,760
nice figures by them and they really

2286
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,280
laid it all out

2287
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:53,280
yet still it's kind of a lot to think

2288
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,040
about so let's have them

2289
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,440
walk through what they are but i guess

2290
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:58,560
with that i'll just

2291
01:19:58,560 --> 01:19:59,920
kind of bring it to the ideas and

2292
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,920
questions where we can go

2293
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,600
and see if we just talk for as long as

2294
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,920
you want just what

2295
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,600
what do you think or what was like where

2296
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,120
did we take that or who do you think we

2297
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:09,760
find that

2298
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,800
interesting or important

2299
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:20,080
yeah i think um well

2300
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:23,520
now i think that we've we will find that

2301
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,719
a lot of people who are trying to um

2302
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:29,360
understand how this modeling can be

2303
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,159
applied

2304
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:33,440
into other contexts and i think there's

2305
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,280
there's probably going to be more and

2306
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,800
more of a movement

2307
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,040
for people to offer modeling um

2308
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:40,880
approaches

2309
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,159
more broadly so there's going to be

2310
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:43,199
people who are going to want to make

2311
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:44,400
models there's people are going to want

2312
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,280
to work with people

2313
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,520
doing models people want to look at what

2314
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,440
the implications of the models are so i

2315
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:50,320
suppose

2316
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,600
that's something that this paper is

2317
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,199
definitely from what we've been talking

2318
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:54,080
about

2319
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:57,280
um and so maybe

2320
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:01,199
even asking um ryan and chris

2321
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:04,719
to for a little bit there about you know

2322
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:08,400
how would someone maybe engage

2323
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,639
as they're working with those types of

2324
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:12,560
matrices and

2325
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,600
looking at the outputs to sort of

2326
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,719
put that into a trans-disciplinary team

2327
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:21,760
in context you know um that could be

2328
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:22,719
quite interesting

2329
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:26,080
um because this is this is all

2330
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,400
um you know it has this potential really

2331
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:29,199
but then

2332
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:31,199
without without you know asking too much

2333
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:32,480
of them but maybe

2334
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:35,760
you know because um that that sort of

2335
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:36,159
thing

2336
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:39,360
and maybe just how if there's

2337
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,120
different ways when you start to think

2338
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,800
about the

2339
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:46,639
a transformation matrix and

2340
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:49,120
the the b matrix and the d matrix you

2341
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,560
know just how

2342
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,280
those things can be um you know are

2343
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,080
there any

2344
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,880
good practices for just helping keep

2345
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,159
your

2346
01:21:58,159 --> 01:22:00,159
uh head straight with all of that as

2347
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:01,520
people start to

2348
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,600
you know because i know for ryan and

2349
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,280
christopher it's second nature you know

2350
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:05,600
they

2351
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:09,199
they they can switch in between but it's

2352
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:10,239
um

2353
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:13,600
it does take a little bit of um

2354
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,760
uh it takes a bit of tacit knowledge to

2355
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:16,800
start to really

2356
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,679
embody what's going on in there and how

2357
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:20,880
that translates

2358
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:24,080
um into this kind of common language

2359
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:28,080
and so um but uh you know this paper

2360
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,080
i think gives a sense of that but it's

2361
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,280
still um

2362
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,639
hopefully that's where this live stream

2363
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:34,800
might be useful for people is as we go

2364
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:35,920
through that

2365
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,920
um especially when it got into some of

2366
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,280
the later

2367
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:43,600
model scenarios um yeah i got a little

2368
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:43,920
bit

2369
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,800
it was a little bit like a lot of

2370
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,560
processing to try and work out what

2371
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,199
exactly was the paradigm that's going on

2372
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:53,120
um and again that might be because this

2373
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,679
is specific to people working in

2374
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,520
visual consciousness and some of these

2375
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,360
types of you know

2376
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:02,400
experiments so um so that would be you

2377
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,520
know that that

2378
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,639
type of broad question i think might be

2379
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:09,120
quite interesting to uh and maybe even

2380
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,000
it will yield

2381
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,159
other model streams in the future if

2382
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:13,760
they're even interested

2383
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:16,719
um that build on that but otherwise i

2384
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:17,280
think that

2385
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,400
that covers it for me nice yep well

2386
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,000
well said yeah thanks for kind of

2387
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,840
bringing the specifics the model but

2388
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:24,480
also

2389
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,960
all the ways in which especially through

2390
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,960
teamwork and communication we can be

2391
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,639
working on it

2392
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:32,960
and having an impact and that's really

2393
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,159
an interesting area

2394
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:37,120
i can see why you're interested in it

2395
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,000
but

2396
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,639
what a fun discussion it is always good

2397
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:41,440
to read

2398
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,320
the work of christopher and ryan it's

2399
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:44,960
really just

2400
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:47,679
informative at multiple levels so we'll

2401
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:48,080
close

2402
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,320
with that thanks again steven for

2403
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:51,920
participating here

2404
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,000
and we'll hope that people are

2405
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,920
interested in coming on live for

2406
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:59,440
18.1 or 0.2 or if it's after those dates

2407
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,960
then just leaving comments and kind of

2408
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:02,400
continuing the discussion

2409
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:06,879
that way well that's it
