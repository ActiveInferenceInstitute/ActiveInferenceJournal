"Unknown","00;00;05;28","00;00;33;28","Hello and welcome to the Active Inference Lab. This is the Active Inference Lab and the Active Inference Livestream. Today we are in Active Inference Livestream 18.1 on March 23rd 2021 welcome to the Active Inference Lab, everyone. We're a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at our links here. This is a recorded in an archived live stream."
"Unknown","00;00;33;28","00;00;56;19","So please provide us with feedback so we can improve our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we'll be using good video etiquette for live streams. Today we're in live stream 18.1 in our first of two participatory group discussions on the predictive global neural workspace paper. And we're with the authors here, Ryan Smith and Christopher White."
"Unknown","00;00;56;19","00;01;22;19","So thanks to both of you for joining today today and 18.1. The goal is just going to be to discuss and learn and ask some questions about this awesome paper. And we're going to go through some introductions and warmups. And then I believe Christopher will have some slides to share with us and set some context. And then we'll just proceed with probably a bunch of questions that we all have about the paper as well as some questions from the live chat."
"Unknown","00;01;23;20","00;01;49;10","To get started, though, let's just go around and introduce ourselves and we can each just give a short introduction or check in and then pass it to somebody who hasn't spoken. So I'm Daniel, I'm in California and I will pass it first to Dean Dean and up here in Calgary in Canada, and I'll pass to Stephen Hello. I'm Stephen."
"Unknown","00;01;49;10","00;02;13;19","I'm up in Toronto in Canada, and I'll pass it over to Christopher. All right, thanks. I'm Christopher Wyatt. I'm a student at the University of Cambridge. And this is this page. Just to give some brief context, this paper is really a work that kind of came out of my master's thesis that I was doing with Ryan. But we've kind of continued on."
"Unknown","00;02;14;14","00;03;02;14","I'm working on, so hopefully we can chat about both this paper and then at some points chat about some things that we've been continuing on. And so I'll pass to Blue and Blue Note. I am an independent research composer based out of New Mexico, and I will pass it to Dave Douglas. I'm in the mountains of the northern Philippines where it's almost the end of spring I'm retired from I.T, especially from machine translation, working on the semi technical aspects of our education project and then I believe Ryan and yeah."
"Unknown","00;03;02;17","00;03;28;25","So I'm Ryan Smith. I'm an investigator at the Florida Institute for Brain Research, and I yeah, we're in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Basically, I run a lab focused on computational neuroscience and computational psychiatry. Well, I'm sure we'll talk a lot more about that. Let's maybe just go right to Christopher's slides and then we can pick up just with conversation or with this slide deck as needed."
"Unknown","00;03;28;25","00;03;34;27","But Christopher, go ahead and show your slides and I'll make them the full screen. Yeah, sure."
"Unknown","00;03;37;10","00;04;08;13","OK, OK. So I'm assuming you can see my screen is seeing we're seeing our Jesse OK, how about now? Yep. Looks good. Okay. Well, I now it seems like I can't both look at the individual window set up. It doesn't seem like it. It wants to share the same screen that gets is on and that's OK. So that means I can't see anyone."
"Unknown","00;04;10;13","00;05;02;18","So just give me a shout so this this is, these are slides that from a they gave ACL about midway through last year and so I may need some reminding of bits of this paper because we did write it quite a while ago, although it did get only just get published in December last year. OK, so the idea with this paper was really just to kind of formalize some things that had been around in the literature for a while and namely putting global work space theory into kind of a predictive processing framework and so they'd been so conferenced in has a really nice 2012 paper that kind of did this somewhat formally, Jacob, but it"
"Unknown","00;05;02;18","00;05;42;24","didn't really connect that deeply with the global work space literature at all. Really. Jacob had in chapter ten of his 2013 book Jacob Hovey sorry has a really wonderful chapter where he discusses the relationship between phenomenal unity and global workspace theory and how active it and how predictive the predictive pricing framework in general and active inference kind of broadly conceived, fit in with global workspace theory and how these ideas can kind of take help make sense of some puzzles within global workspace theory and also kind of give predictive processing a theory of consciousness, as it were."
"Unknown","00;05;45;01","00;06;21;23","And then in terms of I published a brief paper kind of building on Jacobs work where I kind of said, Hey, here's now that's where the predictive global intellect space comes from, or that term, which is just a term that I kind of want to introduce just to denote basically kind of predictive processing approaches to a global workspace style architecture and so when Ryan I started chatting because of that paper, we really our goal was to put some fairly vague idea, conceptual ideas into a more computationally precise framework."
"Unknown","00;06;21;23","00;06;22;22","And that's what we did here."
"Unknown","00;06;25;01","00;06;53;26","And so the idea was really just to use an activity of fairly straightforward deep temporal passage of a macro decision process solved via active inference and show how by kind of tuning some of the parameters you can get basically all of the global what a very large section of the globe workspace literature and all of those empirical results, not just falling straight out of the model and what's I think really important to me."
"Unknown","00;06;54;11","00;07;23;12","So my background is in cognitive science and philosophy. And so I did my undergrad in cognitive science and did my master's in a computational cognitive neuroscience lab. And so although I work on for a long time for a while is really interested in visual awareness and visual consciousness, I was around a lot of experimentalists and it's really important to me that all of these ideas are testable and we actually specify testable predictions."
"Unknown","00;07;24;19","00;07;47;13","And so really what we were doing in this paper was trying as best we could to one, reproduce a bunch of existing results, but also kind of extend the model and show or actually give testable predictions and some of those have actually been confirmed recently, which is kind of nice. So I'll just kind of flip through some things there."
"Unknown","00;07;47;13","00;08;07;13","Just a couple of things I want to highlight. And so the first thing is just to kind of define terms. So we called it an active inference model of visual consciousness. And that was really just a kind of so conscious of the way I think about at least maybe this is some idea isn't graphic, but conscious to me is just a kind of a catch all term."
"Unknown","00;08;08;29","00;08;31;22","It isn't one thing. There are lots of sub things within consciousness that I think can come apart. And so block kind of very famously in 1995 proposed the term access consciousness where this is just content that can be reported in the first person perspective and it was available to kind of cognitive control processes and working memory. That's not a quote from him, that's not me paraphrasing, but that's roughly speaking the idea."
"Unknown","00;08;32;04","00;08;57;10","And so that allows room for there to be other processes or unconscious processes in the visual system of which you aren't aware and but nonetheless influence behavior and he then also proposes, so he's chief in that paper, his chief kind of worries distinguished brain access consciousness and phenomenal consciousness where phenomenal consciousness is kind of the experiential aspect of this."
"Unknown","00;08;57;10","00;09;14;11","And he thinks that. So this is now, now, and he thinks that they can come apart. And that's what's controversial. So I don't personally agree that they can come apart, but I think it's a useful distinction nonetheless. And so I think in terms of thought experiments, I don't remember where it might not be. It might be in that paper it might be elsewhere."
"Unknown","00;09;14;11","00;09;37;18","But he has kind of talked about the example, at least to me was really intuitive, was if you imagine someone with a jackhammer or if you're doing if you're working at a desk and you can hear a jackhammer in the background, you might well, at some point you will become aware of the jackhammer. And but it was kind of a part of your experience all along."
"Unknown","00;09;37;19","00;09;57;14","You just weren't aware of it in a way. And to me that sounds rather odd, but that's kind of but that's fine. We can we can set that aside. We're just defining times here. Yeah. I mean I mean, obviously, I agree. I mean, I think there's lots of cases like inattentional blindness and trains blindness and things like that where where you might you might think you were aware of something the whole time would actually work."
"Unknown","00;09;57;16","00;10;23;27","But anyway, so I think. Yeah, exactly. I think like there are people I think I've forgotten who coined this term, but it's like the refrigerator light illusion. Like you open the refrigerator and the lights on, you think it was always on I have a nice analogy. OK, so just briefly about the global workspace. So this idea kind of started in the late eighties with banana bars and then stand Hahn's group really just took it and ran with it."
"Unknown","00;10;25;07","00;10;57;01","And so the idea is, roughly speaking, there's this prefrontal parietal network that connects in a kind of motor processes, attentional processing perceptual systems, memory, and all of these systems are in some sense competing for access and they are otherwise relatively kind of modular and disconnected. But when they what is access to the global workspace or the content, the kind of wins gains access global workspace is broadcast throughout the system."
"Unknown","00;10;57;01","00;11;38;17","So life enables kind of otherwise isolated subsystems to share information in a common format and he's identified this with a preferred enterprise network. And it's like prima facie, there's been quite a bit of evidence for this. So across meta analysis in report paradigms. So actually people kind of like actually report their experience and binocular rivalry and phenomena masking there is a network of frontier tribal regions that is active for conscious, but not uncommon for you you cut off, we can't hear you."
"Unknown","00;11;39;02","00;12;02;23","Oh really? I can actually still hear him. Oh, maybe I just made a good. OK, good. No worries. Thanks for pointing it out. The Ryan and yeah, continue along. Cool. Yeah. So there's basically that the long and short of it is that across meta analysis there actually does seem to be quite, quite a bit of evidence for the view that there's this Frontier Network and this story gets more complicated when we get into another pilot paradigms."
"Unknown","00;12;02;24","00;12;08;23","Maybe we can chat about that at the end of next session because that's kind of the work that Ryan I really kind of concentrating on at the moment."
"Unknown","00;12;11;12","00;12;35;13","OK, I think we can. So I'll just kind of talk briefly about these two and then kind of move on to the model so the idea so basically in across event ventral potential studies. So this is a kind of meta contrast masking study on the on the left and on the right, there's an attention to blink, I think."
"Unknown","00;12;35;13","00;13;04;18","Goodness. Yes, it is. Basically what you can see is that there is this red line on the left and there is this little petri light literally labeled with a P three B here. And there is this light kind of seemingly nonlinear all or nothing event. Right. Central over frontier central electrodes that seem to characterize reported versus non reported consciousness content sorry, reportable rather not not."
"Unknown","00;13;05;19","00;13;44;26","And what this actually this is actually I should just flag for anyone who's kind of actually in the neuroscience of conscience that just who is watching this this is no longer considered a new locale of consciousness. And I agree with that it seems to drive be driven by past demands but nonetheless it is still a question why it is that when something is conscious and task relevant you got to pay three B and that's kind of what we tackle in the paper and so really all of the evidence for the global works for global workspace theory, I think it can be summed up quite nicely with this 26 kind of taxonomy."
"Unknown","00;13;45;06","00;14;09;01","And so the idea is, is that you can orthogonal only manipulate stimulus strength and attention so stimulus strength, you might just imagine that either might be like time of presentation. So if you have a classic kind of masking experiment, you'll have it might be in the ballpark then just offer it, there'll be some static noise and the static noise kind of masks."
"Unknown","00;14;09;27","00;14;35;24","Is the mask too thick a ball patch and depending on the time frame, the distance between the mask and stimulus, you can render something unrepeatable. So and nonetheless, it can still in some circumstances influence behavior. And so you can imagine that stimulus strength might be something like either you can you could get it might be contrast, it might be the distance between the mask."
"Unknown","00;14;35;24","00;14;40;03","You could do both doesn't really matter for our very coarse purposes here."
"Unknown","00;14;43;01","00;15;06;28","And then in terms of you can also vary attention. So either have attention to the task or attention to be distracted away. And the idea is that when there's a weak stimulus, a bottom up signal and attention is absent, you basically just get very little activity. It's whatever activity there is, it's confined to very early striate cortex when you have attention is presence, but the signal is still awake."
"Unknown","00;15;06;28","00;15;37;05","You get some priming but it's still unavailable for support. And so at that level, it starts to influence behavior. Then at kind of the pre conscious level or what they call pre conscious borrowing a time from Freud this is where this is, this is attention inattentional blindness effectively. So you have a very strong stimulus. The gorilla can be walking across the room in a way that you can be in the dead middle of the phobia and yet people still don't report it."
"Unknown","00;15;37;12","00;16;07;13","And the idea is that this is kind of activity that's still very strong. It's within the visual system, but it's kind of gated out of awareness via lack of attention at least most of the time. And then when in this last quadrant here, when you're attending something in the strong signal and you get this widespread kind of bifurcation in neural activity, that characterizes awareness is on our way to states."
"Unknown","00;16;08;29","00;16;27;13","And so we kind of had or personally I had a couple of reasons I was there a couple of reasons to be a bit suspicious about this. And I actually do think like workspace theory has been updated to kind of accommodate these, but nonetheless, we'll go through them. So basically, unconscious information can still be decoded from frontal regions."
"Unknown","00;16;28;12","00;16;56;12","So PFC activity is not synonymous with consciousness so the idea is that you could might have the idea that there is just a global workspace and you enter it associate loosely associated PFC and entering it is sufficient for consciousness as copyright. They have a solution to this. They then basically introduced the Bayesian model of conscious support where consciousness also requires a stimulus representation to be separable from a noise distribution."
"Unknown","00;16;57;00","00;17;24;03","I really like this model. In the beginning of my master's thesis, I spent a lot of time playing around the code. It's really cool, but it's not ideal Bayesian observer. It doesn't really give any neural predictions at all. I don't know and that's that's that's fine limitation. So it's an ideal Bayesian observer, but still would be nice if we had something a little bit more neurally detailed a."
"Unknown","00;17;24;09","00;17;53;25","Christopher, could you actually just unpack that slide 13 Just what are the disks representing and how does this relate to Bayesian statistics? Oh yeah, sure. So basically each of these axes is a source of evidence. So evidence for stimulus Y, evidence for stimulus X, and then basically these two colored lines, the pink colored line or the green colored line correspond to different decision criteria."
"Unknown","00;17;53;25","00;18;35;10","That you are imposing on a space. So the idea is, is that alternative to alternative false choice tasks where you're forced to choose between two things or versus report something as a present or absent actually employ different decision criteria. And so you can imagine these as a essentially a multivariate, each of these as a Gaussian distribution, each of these circles as kind of a univariate Gaussian distribution, where if you are in the blue, you know, that's kind of stimulus to the left if you're all the way to the right or on x axis, that is stimulus on the right way."
"Unknown","00;18;36;15","00;19;08;26","And then this green thing kind of closely around the origin is a noise distribution. So this is just saying there's nothing there. And basically what conscious or the awareness is on this account is basically these distributions or either left or right being far enough away from the origin that they don't overlap substantially with the noise distribution. So when you impose the decision criteria on the space, you are confident that you have seen something that kind of makes sense."
"Unknown","00;19;09;10","00;19;39;04","Nice. Thank you, doc. OK, and then saying the sun saying ignore ignores the noise distribution. It's just separates left versus right. So really cool model. I really like it. But yeah, unfortunately not quite as nearly detailed as I would like and second problem is the pay through B does not equal awareness. So these are two paradigms. So it's now being replicated in another report condition."
"Unknown","00;19;39;11","00;20;03;05","Basically person is this really sophisticated experimental techniques that allow you to basically access gain access to a person, make inferences about what a person saw without having to make explicit reports. And when that happens, you see that basically the P three B, which was at one point taken to be a signature of awareness, just vanishes. And that's a bit of a problem."
"Unknown","00;20;04;21","00;20;54;02","So I'd like an explanation of that. And then the last one isn't really a problem so much as just a point of absence. So there's a really large body of evidence showing that expectation seems to be a pretty crucial factor in determining the content of the visual consciousness. So across paradigms, continuous flash suppression, binocular rivalry, emotion induced blindness, blah, blah, blah, or there's all of these areas where to show that expectations probably along the lines of similar to attention, should be a part of any taxonomy or any taxonomy that claims to kind of try to be complete of the factors underlying punches, access and the global narrow workspace as it stands doesn't really describe how"
"Unknown","00;20;54;02","00;21;40;03","expectations are implemented and so our job, what we saw ourselves as doing really in this paper was just to kind of show how we could account for all of this existing work, namely the taxonomy, and also explain how the P three B doesn't equal awareness or show hap. So show how that dissociation arises very naturally. And three, show how expectations could be plausibly be implemented and give kind of a more give a model that generates predictions about expectations, I should say, and has a story about how they implemented OK."
"Unknown","00;21;40;27","00;22;15;04","And I think the real thing is it's OK to revise model like revising models is that that's just good science. And I think one of the part of good workspace theory that made me a little bit suspicious lately is that the revisions of problem one and two, they didn't generate surplus neural predictions really. They were just kind of they abandoned capacity based significant success and they apparent and they endorsed an ideal Bayesian observer model over subjective reports."
"Unknown","00;22;15;13","00;22;45;17","But neither of those things, they were kind of responses to problems that didn't themselves generate new predictions that go on and that's kind of a characteristic of what's been called generative research programs by lecture and so, I mean, we can argue about whether this is a fair characterization of global workspace theory, but I think this is kind of at least an nice way of setting up where we are coming from."
"Unknown","00;22;48;09","00;23;09;25","OK, would you like to give a a primer on active inference operations over market decision processes? I'm not sure how much more you want me to talk or whatever. I mean, this is an owl. This is an owl. I have an hour worth of slides so I can talk forever, but maybe you want me to skip to the results or just summarize the model or what?"
"Unknown","00;23;10;10","00;23;29;00","Let's actually hear your take here. This is just a really awesome presentation. And then everybody here, maybe let's write down a question or two so then we can have another however many minutes you want. The slides have about an hour or a little more four questions and then we'll have next week for questions. But it's really great to get this information out there because the way you're sharing it is awesome."
"Unknown","00;23;29;26","00;23;36;08","Yeah, cool. Well, I'll, I'll try and be a little bit more detailed if I go through the slides. I've kind of just been clicking through things at the moment."
"Unknown","00;23;38;14","00;24;11;16","OK, so what just a brief. This is, this is a little bit of a point of confusion and Ryan may want to kind of come up describe this as well. So what is active inference? Well, it's both a noun, a verb, and as now and it's kind of you can use it to describe two things. It's a it's just a mathematical framework that allows one to formulate models of kind of changing behavior using equations that are kind of justified a priori from a very, very general set of assumptions about the nature of self-organizing systems."
"Unknown","00;24;12;05","00;24;40;01","It's also that you can attach a process theory to that mathematical framework that allows you to give predictions about various neurophysiological variables, like firing rate of neuronal populations APIs and kind of how neuro modulators like dope mean or noradrenaline affect things like firing right in the eye pace and also behavior. It's also used as a verb and especially in kind of maybe pre 2016 literature."
"Unknown","00;24;40;01","00;25;13;12","That's basically what it was. It was basically an extension of predictive coding to motor control. And so people often use active inference just as a catch all for basically the predictive coding version of motor control. And there's been all sorts of confusion in the literature where people are taking of active inference as a theory basically of, of Markov decision processes right now conflating that which and because Markov decision processes being a decision process is kind of a model of Bayesian decision based optimal decision making."
"Unknown","00;25;14;02","00;25;38;23","And then if that's conflated with the theory of motor control or you use a motor control account of decision making, you're going to get say bizarre things don't actually track what's going on. Yeah. I mean, I would say that's the that's the main point. If anything, that I would say that's kind of fully emphasized is where all the active inference is a theory of motor control right?"
"Unknown","00;25;38;23","00;26;21;12","I mean, people still do it by inference where that just means, you know, like hold a prior constant and make a reflex arc, move the body to minimize the prediction error with respect to that prior about, say, like proprioceptive position or something like that. Right. That's just a theory about once you've decided what to do, how to get the body to move accordingly, I wouldn't have anything to do with the deciding what to do before finding out motor control thing is just, you know, how do I mean, how do I get the body to move, how I want to be using something predictive coding, right?"
"Unknown","00;26;21;12","00;26;57;16","Whereas, you know, we're talking about kind of like parents and friends is is again, it's a it's a theory of decision making, which is like I really think there should be two different terms for these for these things. But conflicts in that stuff far consistent. Yeah. Certainly. Thanks. And Steven, do you have a quick question? Yeah. I just be curious, like as you're here, you know, you're doing work in this paper here with the neuronal context of how deductive choices are made."
"Unknown","00;26;57;16","00;27;23;28","And it taps to the phenomenological questions as well. Do you think that's when these you see these problems happen a lot? Because when when people are you're trying to move between different aspects of fields of practice which are sometimes thought about separately, you know, phenomenology phenomenology is often talked about in the in activist field and you've got the neuroscience and they're often clean and separate."
"Unknown","00;27;23;28","00;27;52;25","But when you need to bring them together and try and talk about this bigger picture, the distinction, the distinction is you're making become even more important, if that makes sense, because you seems to be a lot of conflation that happens with that. So I'll just be interested in your thoughts so I think one thing to say is so I like Connectivism especially what's kind of been called computational and activism."
"Unknown","00;27;52;25","00;28;20;27","I've forgotten there's a really awesome paper out and synthesis author name names that author, but sorry about that. But to me that stuff doesn't really have that much to do with what I would call consciousness or I think of it as consciousness as like a cognitive scientist. I suppose when I think of awareness, I think of a very sharp, my explanatory, the thing that I'm trying to explain is very specific."
"Unknown","00;28;21;22","00;28;44;12","It is there are these states of which you are unaware, some of which you can become aware of. Say, for example, like the inattentional blindness case or in phenomena masking. In some cases there is a visual stimulus in one case where it's on the way out and there's a very small change physical change, the stimulus, but there's this radical nonlinear change in whether you can report it or not."
"Unknown","00;28;45;16","00;29;28;14","I'm interested in that contrast between reportable stimuli and non reportable stimuli. Now, along with that comes when stimuli are reportable. Generally speaking, that is a we might also be interested in characterizing kind of the content of experience, as it were, not just the availability for a poll. So we're going to get to that. Actually, the kind of towards the end of the presentation, we actually do endorse a version of the phenomenon of consciousness, access consciousness distinction but really I think to answer, I just have to repeat myself somewhat and answer the question."
"Unknown","00;29;29;03","00;29;54;25","All that I'm trying to explain with this model is that distinction between exact content that's accessible and content that's not accessible. Everything else I don't really mind like people can call it one if they like. I'm not interested in modeling it. Yeah. So I mean, I mean in general, right? I mean, again, this just speaks to kind of having precise theoretical constructs and having a good kind of toxic taxonomy of these things within a particular area."
"Unknown","00;29;55;07","00;30;25;05","And also, you know, if you're going to try to do any kind of interdisciplinary work, right, where you have constructs and one kind of field and you want to find some way to map them on to write or translate them into what you think they ought to be. Right. And some other in some other theoretical language. Right. Then I mean, then also specifying that in a precise way and how you kind of recover one from the other in terms of the way they're operationalized empirically."
"Unknown","00;30;25;17","00;30;53;04","Right. I mean, is also something you have to do, right, to do this work. Well, you know, so I mean, you know, Chris already started right to kind of describing people really loosely, at least not in all cases. Right. Obviously, some people are very precise, but in some cases the word consciousness or awareness gets kind of thrown around for a ton of different things, which makes it confusing and also makes that term, you know, imprecise."
"Unknown","00;30;53;04","00;31;18;09","And if we're not really all that useful, you know, for instance, there's a distinctions that people make between what we're talking about, right? Like whether a particular content particular represented content in the brain and if people report experiencing it versus if people report not experiencing it. Right. But then there's also some people talk about levels of consciousness, right?"
"Unknown","00;31;18;10","00;31;41;11","Which is a totally different thing. That's like being in a coma, which is being in like a minimal, you know, like a vegetative state versus, you know, being like awake but really sleepy versus being really alert. Right. That kind of thing. You know, and there's which is a totally separate thing, right? I mean, you can kind of think of one as a as a precondition in some sense for another, right?"
"Unknown","00;31;41;11","00;32;17;20","Like you have to be in a level of consciousness that corresponds to being awake, right. To have any, you know, or Oregon or like right but your brain has to be in a certain general state of consciousness level wise to be able to have the experience of one singular content over another. Right. So that's concerning. Being awake is a precondition for studying the thing that we're interested in, which is why you become conscious of one thing versus another given very similar stimulus conditions."
"Unknown","00;32;18;13","00;32;48;17","Exactly. So so there are I mean, there's there's more. Right. Different distinctions, right? Like, I mean, like I so there's this distinction between or, you know, potential distinctions between phenomenal consciousness just like the what it's like to be experiencing something versus this access consciousness thing, which is roughly being being aware of the thing you're experiencing. And and like I said, several people think this kind of thinking fell apart."
"Unknown","00;32;49;18","00;33;27;28","I also am very skeptical about that. You know, e.g., the the fridge, the fridge light example, the first mentioned earlier, you know, I mean, like I said, at the end of at the end of this paper, we do in some sense describe how our model can can identify something like something like two different types of access where one type of access is kind of what's minimally necessary for empirically verifiable phenomenology whereas the other is more kind of what determines the actual reporting."
"Unknown","00;33;29;16","00;33;54;26","But, you know, so there is something like a distinction in our model but it's not the standard kind of phenomenal consciousness versus this consciousness distinction. Yeah. But anyway, I mean, there's so my point is there's all these different sorts of things, you know, you mentioned like the point you mentioned like that like, you know, phenomena, like literature where people just kind of describe, you know, the way that phenomenology is the kind of the dynamics and phenomenology and things like that."
"Unknown","00;33;54;26","00;34;23;29","And then also as a kind of completely different kind of descriptive, you know, feels right. It doesn't have to do with this distinction about what becomes, you know, experience versus not. So I mean, the general kind of meaning is, is already kind of like long winded answer, but just just, I think very precise terms and very precise mappings between terms and different fields are necessary to do this kind of thing at all."
"Unknown","00;34;23;29","00;34;48;01","And that's not always the case. Yeah. And just to briefly follow up on that, I really what I'm interested in this is kind of was put out in Bernard Bars. He called it the goodness I might put you this done, basically minimal contrast approach where you have some content of which you're aware, some content which you're unaware and up to all of it, up to some limit."
"Unknown","00;34;48;09","00;35;18;02","The physical properties of the stimulus should be almost identical. There might best be ten milliseconds extra between the mask and the stimulus, and that's the only thing that renders it. So then the idea there is that we can contrast the neuronal kind of consequences of being aware of a stimulus as unaware, independent of hopefully the physical properties of the stimulus and so so just to give an example and just to make sure that I'm being charitable."
"Unknown","00;35;18;23","00;35;43;20","So that was recently a special issue of, I'm fairly sure, special issue of the Journal of Consciousness Studies on like consciousness and plants and I guess one thing that I'm not entirely convinced of is that we're really talking about the same thing. I think that's great and people smart. We should let smart people do what they want and study all of these things."
"Unknown","00;35;43;26","00;36;27;22","But I'm not convinced, for example, that the process will take a lot of convincing to convince me that something like phenomenal content, whatever you want to call phenomenal consciousness in a tree or a plant, really has anything at all to do with this minimal contrast approach in like the neuroscience of consciousness. Yeah, I mean, one other one other thing again, just like things go popping up in my head, they're beautiful on both sides of the bottle, not on all of it here, but on on well, I might totally like what I was going to say."
"Unknown","00;36;29;02","00;36;47;22","Well, welcome back. I guess we can refine. OK, thanks. And also, maybe you could talk like a little closer into your microphone. It gets a little quiet sometimes. OK, thank you. All right, continue. And I'm really curious to see how active inference is going to play into this oh, sorry. Sorry. I just remember what I was going to say."
"Unknown","00;36;47;28","00;37;29;07","That's good. And I think another thing that sometimes gets plated is is just representing things versus being aware of them, right? So so, you know, like a major so for example. Right? I mean, in the in the active inference literature, there are other that describe, you know, things like, ah, Kobe and Monet's I'm Right or something. They're like Karl's recent papers where where more or less of the story about how via the free energy principle, you can come to have systems where the internal states of the system and the parameter eyes are tracking in some way the states of the world outside of the system."
"Unknown","00;37;30;27","00;38;03;19","Right. So so in a really broad sense, got some some some way in which the internal states are representing or keeping track of the external states and that as a kind of representation or the kind of seeds of internal representations of what's going on out in the world. But the idea, you know, with this sort of literature is, is that the brain can represent a bunch of stuff at the same time, but only some of the stuff that's being represented becomes conscious at any given moment, right?"
"Unknown","00;38;03;19","00;38;29;00","So like I can flash like a word, I can splash like so like some state, for instance, I could flash the word field for you really fast and you won't report ever having seen the word field, but you'll actually behave in ways that are more consistent with feeling guilty or something like that. Right? Or I mean simpler like perceptual or semantic priming examples where you might flash something really quickly."
"Unknown","00;38;29;00","00;38;52;12","Again, a person doesn't you know, say they are aware of having seen anything, but they'll say the word stems in one particular way versus another, right? If I flash an elephant or you really fast, you don't know. I see it, you don't know you see it, and I give you like a word. Some like l you know, and it's like the word is like more likely to say elephants than they would be if you didn't flash it."
"Unknown","00;38;52;27","00;39;17;26","Right or something like that. Right. So behavior is affected by something that was clearly caught right by the brain. But but despite that, it was represented and you just become aware of it, right? So I just want to make that distinction as well, that being conscious of something is distinct from whether it's whether the brain actually in some sense, it's there yeah."
"Unknown","00;39;18;06","00;39;46;23","Yeah. OK, so just the idea so we used a passage over Mark of decision process as a model, a hierarchical one, I should say. So this is just a single level Markov decision process. And just very briefly, filmed is I'm just going to call them pace, just for brevity. They describe transitions among kind of hidden unobservable variables and the sensory data that they generate."
"Unknown","00;39;46;23","00;40;29;29","So you can have a hidden state of the world and the observations generated by that hidden state. And the goal of active inference is can further states and the sequences or action sequences or policies pie from the set of observations and so we'll just kind of like step through very basically how this would work. So you could just have a very simple case right here where whether this is just a graphical representation of Bayesian inference we can just have a hidden state and we have a prior over that state and we have some likelihood mapping between that hidden state and some state of the world."
"Unknown","00;40;31;11","00;41;07;07","I think I'm getting feedback from someone's computer OK, try I think it's yours right I can see if I can continue. Christopher, thanks. OK, thanks. That's what yeah. It's funny how that was, how that messes with you about predictive models of when our speech timing should be. At least we know that you're awake OK, so we've got. Yeah."
"Unknown","00;41;07;07","00;41;32;20","So this, this comes out to basically if you then invert this model, this is just exact Bayesian inference now if we start moving through time, we have to add in transition probabilities. And so this just imagine this first level of model is just a Markov chain it's just you have some initial state, you transition into your first state and you have state transitions that govern how you how those states change over time."
"Unknown","00;41;32;28","00;42;06;20","But you also have variables that you don't ever get to see this Markov chain. All you get to see is a set of observations and so the idea is these observations are generated by these hidden states and so the task of inverting these models is to infer the most likely hidden state conditioned on some stimulus, stimulus and so you get this this is this little segment here is soft matte, the soft max function."
"Unknown","00;42;06;29","00;42;42;10","And basically you can derive message passing algorithms or using message passing algorithms. Rather, you can derive very simple update rules that allow you to come up with posterior probabilities over states and then actions under this framework are then just kind of state transitions that the agent has control over. So you can imagine in like a psychophysics experiment the actions, this is a super limited set of actions, space for the agent basically they can hit left or right and they might be able to move their eyes."
"Unknown","00;42;42;29","00;42;52;21","So those would be the policies that they can control everything else, the state, the screen, those are hidden states, but they're just not transitions transitions between those hidden states aren't things that the agent can control."
"Unknown","00;42;55;01","00;43;43;29","OK, so then in a way, so how do we select actions? Well, we select actions according to the you functional. So this has two component and you select the action or the policy rather that is kind of best to minimize expected for energy where this has two terms the first is the expected cost. So this is kind of the tail divergence or the difference between our predicted outcomes, which is this cue here and out and predicted outcomes under some policy so what the outcome I expect, given that I take a certain action and the predict and just our and our preferred observations."
"Unknown","00;43;44;14","00;44;15;16","So these are things like having preferences, winning versus losing where the agent generally that you can encode the agent wants to win or not to lose or something like that the second time here this this is the exploratory component this is the expected ambiguity where this is basically the expected entropy of the likelihood mapping. And so the idea here is that you seek out actions or seek out states of the world that have a precise mapping to sensory outcomes."
"Unknown","00;44;15;27","00;44;42;29","And so for example, if you're in a hotel room that you've never been in before, it's really dark. The best way best actions are taking minimize your uncertainty is just to turn the light on because that will give you a really precise mapping between the hidden state of the world out there and kind of the observations that you generate, all that they generate and so the idea is, is that expected fringes minimize when both of these terms are minimized."
"Unknown","00;44;45;04","00;45;34;02","And it's actually a little bit more complicated than this, I should say. So policy selection isn't just the minimization of expected transit. It also involves minimization of variation for energy. But I would just say, what's the model stream to get into that for our purposes? In this conversation, we can just say policies are selected but best to minimize expected free energy and variational for energy where Variational for Energy is also basically a stand in where the posterior optimal posterior here that you infer will also kind of you minimize you inferred optimal posterior by minimizing variational for energy OK, so what about I haven't really talked about the brain so far."
"Unknown","00;45;35;29","00;46;00;15","One of the beautiful things back of inference is that comes the process theory and so belief updates, those changes to your posterior overstates correspond to changes in activation levels in response to inputs and the matrix entries here the B, H, C, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. These are all H actually isn't really a matrix, I guess it's a matrix that."
"Unknown","00;46;00;18","00;46;37;25","Rachel, what is H entropy so you can just these correspond to synaptic connections, strengths. And I mean, this is just like a very standard assumption across neural network literature really, and just in neuroscience in general where synaptic changes in weights of synaptic connections correspond to some kind of like function approximation OK. And so then you get this kind of somewhat intimidating looking equations, we can just select the ones that are really relevant."
"Unknown","00;46;38;05","00;47;14;06","So this first one here is state prediction error. And so minimizing state prediction error in perception corresponds to whether it corresponds to essentially the inference of the posterior probability Q of S ops. And you can cast this as a gradient descent on variation for energy. And that's actually where we get our ups from I'm Christopher. Could you go into a little detail what the Variational means independently or as related to the free energy here?"
"Unknown","00;47;14;29","00;47;48;14","Yeah, sure. Also, variational change is just to distinguish it from something like thermodynamic free energy. So like there are formal relationships between these things. I would just say rate calls, for instance, work if you want to know about that. But basically Variational for energy is the tail divergence between a generative model and your approximate posterior distribution. And what you're trying to do is change the approximate posterior distribution it slowly but surely, so change it bit by bit."
"Unknown","00;47;48;14","00;48;22;26","You nudge it in the direction of steepest descent until it basically this error term here, which is basically the difference between the log difference between your generative model and your approximate posterior. If you change s, until that difference is at the minimum and the rate at which that changes. So this little V dot here is your ERP. So the idea and I'm going to go into that a little bit more in a moment."
"Unknown","00;48;24;08","00;48;50;29","So the idea is that you have all the log probability of our posterior is essentially a non normalized log probability can be positive l negative like a voltage and then you you can have your ERP and this is just like your change in membrane potential over in your own populations and that corresponds to roughly speaking like these big potentials we see at the scalp."
"Unknown","00;48;51;21","00;49;19;16","And then we have a normalized firing rate where you will basically we normalize the depolarization variable through by branding it through a soft max function. And the soft max function is just a generalization of a logistic function to more than one input, more than one more than two classes and what's nice about using a generalization of a sigmoid function is that everyone who's looked at like."
"Unknown","00;49;19;16","00;49;41;04","Right models of in popular population nodes, for example, or what's sometimes called main field models these basically you can have this firing rate versus input curve where on the x axis you have the amount of input that you're driving into the population and on the Y axis, you'll have the firing rate of the population and its logistic function."
"Unknown","00;49;41;04","00;50;11;10","So it's going to be bounded a set roughly speaking, between zero and one so what you'll end up with is a this kind of sigmoid style looking curve that we treat as probability distribution, but can also be in turn has kind of this lovely by a physically plausible. Well, I don't know about plausible, but by a physically sensible maybe interpretation as a normalized firing rate."
"Unknown","00;50;12;17","00;50;52;24","And that kind of allows us to translate between this kind of normative models thinking about probability distributions and what the brain is actually doing OK, so everyone kind of happy with that. Yeah. Stephen, you have a quick question. Just one quick question. Just is the expected free energy on policies more important at level two and level one, it kind of can soft max itself or is it that's a bit simplifying, but does does expected free energy go all the way down or is it a bit more?"
"Unknown","00;50;53;14","00;51;16;12","It depends how you set up a model. You can generally have models that are you can have policy selection both levels. You can policy selection just low level adjust the high level depends what you're trying to model. Really generally speaking in models. So in the model we're going to be using, I'm going to introduce in just a moment, we don't have policy selection at the first level."
"Unknown","00;51;18;09","00;51;41;29","We have policy selection at the second level. But you might say, for example, there is work by Thomas Power. Right. And I kind of work out some similar work as a part of my thesis where basically the idea is that the higher, higher like working memory ish prefrontal level, you have goal directed policy selection and at the first level you just have kind of epistemic guided policy selection."
"Unknown","00;51;43;02","00;52;09;02","And so the policies that are being selected at the first level might be something like where in the visual field to point your attention or to meet your eyes. And that's just kind of determined by the salience of various items which in this framework corresponds to essentially the information gain offered by all the precision at the first level, a matrix so hopefully that answers your question."
"Unknown","00;52;10;07","00;52;38;16","Yeah, thanks for as AM. So as I was just a little bit of kind of a generalization of that, I mean, really and you know, and Prince will go into this, but, but the way this or this is modeled officially is just each lower level trial is just a full trial, as if you were modeling it separately. The higher level is just putting a prior on whatever the starting whatever the starting progress for each lower level trial."
"Unknown","00;52;40;02","00;53;09;28","So I mean, in a sense, you're modeling these trials, you could be you could think about each trial either at the lower level. The higher level is being modeled independently in some sense where each one can have a set of policies which can have anything that a single level model could have. It's just that the higher level is putting fires of some kind on the lower level and then posterior observations at the lower level are then feeding back in as the observations for the higher level."
"Unknown","00;53;11;15","00;53;50;12","So so it's just just think about them as as just separate kind of trials on different time scales where they're just connected by their priors in both areas. Yeah, exactly. And so I guess what we did here was you wanted to have something like to implement something global internal workspace like in a deep active inference architecture. And I what I want to highlight, I have I have mixed feelings about defining the term, the predictive global internal workspace because people lump this model in in the few people who have been kind enough to cite this work have lumped us in into like models of this as being kind of just another version of the global out"
"Unknown","00;53;50;12","00;54;28;03","of work space. I don't think that's accurate. We took the global network space kind of and all of the phenomena over at that it encompasses kind of as something that we want to explain. Both Ryan and I really like the global network space like stand behind, but not as huge here as mine. And aside from kind of like my personal love of the theory, it's also among kind of neuroscientists and philosophers who work on consciousness about 30, the majority of them, which is about 35% or something like that in 2018 said that they regarded it as the most promising neuroscientific theory of consciousness."
"Unknown","00;54;28;20","00;54;48;18","And so we thought, OK, if we're going to go into this literature, this is what we should be modeling. I think the phenomena encompassed by this theory is where it should be the starting point. But with that said, it's our model is an active inference model through and through and so it really does kind of stand on its own independently of the globe and in the work space."
"Unknown","00;54;48;18","00;54;59;24","And so I just kind of want to flag that. And so I don't use those words or in the draft of a paper that I'm writing at the moment, kind of following up on this one, I don't use those words and I don't do it, but that's very deliberate."
"Unknown","00;55;02;26","00;55;30;15","But anyway, sorry, that was an aside also very esoteric aside. But anyway, so the idea here is that we implement something global and workspace like in a deep temporal, deep temporal architecture. So the second level, we identify some really deep level. We identify with the workspace and so as Ryan was just talking about, you have these states, the second level, which are really like beliefs about how trials at the first level evolve over time."
"Unknown","00;55;33;06","00;55;56;21","And so they provide a prior at each time step of the low level, they provide a prior over the hidden state. And then after when there's posterior inference at the first level, after that's happened, it then shoots back up to the second level and that acts as an observation for the second level OK, so we take the functions we tip."
"Unknown","00;55;56;21","00;56;18;26","The idea here is that the functions we typically associate with conscious processing take place at the level of the hierarchy. It's kind of deep and temporally deep enough to abstract away from processes that are trained by the moment time, sensory flux. And this allows the agent kind of construct a report of its experience or to do any, any other kind of kind of quite abstract cognitive task."
"Unknown","00;56;19;09","00;56;47;08","And so the idea is that ignition occurs when a first level state is in third by the second level. So ignition sorry is basically like what Hahn has called this nonlinear bifurcation of this Frontier Network in the neuronal activity. So the idea is that ignition for our model occurs when the first level state is inferred by the second level with a high enough posterior probability to kind of influence policy selection at the second level oops, sorry."
"Unknown","00;56;47;09","00;57;16;05","OK, onto the task. So this is a very kind of general task structure which we borrowed from a really awesome empirical study done by Michael Pitts in 2014 and colleagues said it was that the first time step there was a forward mask presented and so second time step there's a target stimulus. So these little lines in the center can rearrange themselves into a square and the second type bit in a backwards mask of a third time step."
"Unknown","00;57;16;16","00;57;49;14","And the agent is then asked to construct a report of its experience. So whether it's say whether it saw something or not and the idea of roughly speaking these little colored circles on the outside, this is how we manipulate attention and how Michael Pitts manipulate attention and so they either had people attend to the inside and perform a task, basically click a button whenever the circle changed, the square changed, or click a button whenever the circle changed, and so they manipulated kind of what was task relevant."
"Unknown","00;57;49;14","00;58;10;04","And I will get into how they manipulate awareness in a moment. But roughly speaking, the way we implemented the model, this is kind of a Bayes net representation of the model. And then if we just kind of click through it at time one, there is a forward mask presented and this just corresponds to a black with a square trial."
"Unknown","00;58;10;04","00;58;32;04","So that's the full this is kind of a beliefs. The second level, there is a full sequence this is beliefs about the full sequence over the full trial. So this is a time step one, there's a report Hidden State Fact here, it's in white because we haven't asked its constructor report yet. Then at the first level, each of these second level states kind of implies a first level state that makes sense."
"Unknown","00;58;32;04","00;59;04;06","And each of these first level states kind of implies a observation and attention in our model was basically we just hard coded in as a but we didn't have to hard code it you can get these things to emerge. We just it's just a little bit easier in our case to do it this way. We basically hard coded it in so that attention corresponded to modulations of the mapping of the precision of the mapping between these first level hidden states, kind of whether those are square or lines out there in the world and the observations."
"Unknown","00;59;04;19","00;59;27;11","So OK, so first first time point forward mask we see sequence type is going to be a square as a trial phase one report. Next one we see trials move to we've now see the target has now rearranged itself into a square we did this for two time steps and the reason we did it for we present the target stimulus."
"Unknown","00;59;27;11","00;59;48;27","The target stimulus for two time sets is to allow recurrent feedback processes from the first level to kind of first of all to second level and recognize what's going on and feed back on to the first level. Kind of give that. That was kind of our way of modeling this ignition style process. Then fourth time step, we take away the mask, we replace the little square, just mask again."
"Unknown","00;59;49;20","01;00;05;19","And then from five to eight, then we allow the model to construct a report of its experience. So basically this same hidden state here implies a sequence of language processing states at the first level."
"Unknown","01;00;08;12","01;00;35;02","By Summit Square. Yeah, just to read it as I see a square. And then what would it say if it was unseen? I I didn't say anything I mean, just to be clear, like it we could have and the model would be exactly the same in all aspects. We could just chop off this kind of language processing part of the model, and the model would behave exactly the same way."
"Unknown","01;00;36;17","01;00;58;16","And we could still use generate reports and all of that stuff. What we wanted to do was really just kind of use this as kind of an intuition pump for what having this deep temporal represents Haitian allows models to do. So holding something at that level allows sequences or a cascade of hidden states to kind of evolve at lower levels."
"Unknown","01;00;58;16","01;01;19;25","That might be something like constructing a sentence with a goal in mind, or it might be something like making a cup of coffee where you have to hold multiple tasks in mind and break things and the subcomponents, blah, blah, blah. Yeah. As opposed to mapping to a button that says yes, or no. If it's just a two button option, then it's a one time step paradigm."
"Unknown","01;01;20;17","01;01;46;07","Yeah, exactly. I mean, we could do that. I mean, it'd be completely identical this is just kind of a nice way of showing what these models can do. Really? Yeah. I mean, so this was, this was partially for a, for a kind of to make a theoretical point right? You could say. Right, we're showing a two level model here, but the brain probably has, you know, I don't know how many levels, but a very large number of levels."
"Unknown","01;01;46;07","01;02;07;03","Right. Not just two. So, you know, you could you could kind of level the concern or question at us that like why is it that this second level is the one that corresponds to conscious access? Right. As opposed to just any other level that's about some level. Right. In the brain. So there's a big hierarchy in the brain."
"Unknown","01;02;07;26","01;02;33;02","So the idea here is, is is that we're appealing to a certain level of deep temporal structure right? Like you can you can flash a stimulus at somebody and they can see it over a very short time scale. Right? Or like half a second or something. Really fast. But actually, but the sorts of cognitive processes that can integrate that together."
"Unknown","01;02;33;18","01;03;15;14","Right. And generate you know, a set of thoughts. Right. That corresponds to being aware of that. Right? Constructing a yeah. Constructing a sentence or any of the things that Chris mentioned those are much deeper, slower integrative cognitive processes. Right? So idea is that there is a level in the brain that is integrative enough and that represents things over a deep enough temporal scale that it has the minimal resources to integrate things together, hold them in mind, and generate sequences of the sequences of words that would be necessary to communicate that you saw something or not right."
"Unknown","01;03;15;17","01;03;45;08","So it's that abstract, deep temporal structure that is the necessary conditions for what you need to get empirically confirmable awareness yeah. OK, just some brief kind of modeling notes about what we did. So to model attention and stimulus strength, we basically just altered the precision of the air. First of all, a matrix mapping by passing it through a soft max function twice where one of the soft max temperature."
"Unknown","01;03;45;08","01;04;06;14","So when you pass something through a soft max function you have a temperature on it and the temperature decides how precise it is. And we just had a different temperature for each iteration of the soft max function. And so the idea was then we had an ordering basically of precision where the most precise was a tension present stimulus string pie."
"Unknown","01;04;06;14","01;04;53;23","The second was attention, attention absent stimulus strength, high third was probably you can imagine how that goes on. And kind of the reason this is this sounds pretty abstract and a bit of cooked up and that's true to an extent, but I think this does actually really correspond to so if you look at something like device of normalization in vision where attention basically is a you will have some tuning neuron tuning curve and basically basically like how precise that tuning curve is is modulated by both the contrast of the stimulus and then the contrast the stimulus gets fed into some attentional process where that will together determine kind of the tuning curve that was a"
"Unknown","01;04;53;23","01;05;20;28","very kind of rough and ready explanation of training cuts, but whatever. And then our threshold report, we basically just set up the model to give a have a preference for receiving correct versus incorrect feedback at the final time step. And your behavior was basically modeled by simply decreasing the preference for being incorrect to encourage guessing. And so I think this was just kind of our first pass at doing report."
"Unknown","01;05;21;10","01;05;45;24","I don't think this is how the brain does report. We actually in a follow up model, we've got a much nicer way of doing this, but I think it was it worked in the sense that it was able to kind of quite accurately capture a number of empirical findings. So that's kind of good enough for me at this at this first what first model OK, sorry, that was a lot of preamble."
"Unknown","01;05;46;18","01;06;10;15","We can get into the results. So foundational simulation this was just I kind of thought like a very high precision stimulus was presented model kind of with either on a square present or a square absent trial. And this just kind of to test it. So right when there was a square present, the model reported seeing it 100% of the time."
"Unknown","01;06;10;21","01;06;34;03","You see this nice kind of bump at the second level, at the first level where the firing rates of a square increase when we present it goes down. And let's just make sure that people understand how to interpret these things. So just just so people understand so time and these plots goes from left to right and the grayscale from white to black."
"Unknown","01;06;34;13","01;07;02;03","Black corresponds to 100% probability and white corresponds to zero probability. And the gray so is something like 5050. And so and these are cast in terms of firing rates here. So darker than implies a higher firing rate. So the top plot on the left, that's the second little firing rates. That just means it's first sees the black circles on the outside."
"Unknown","01;07;02;18","01;07;28;21","So it's confident that it's either going to be a sequence that has black circles and black square or the second row. The other sequence would be black circles and just lines with no square so basically once it sees the black circles, then it knows, OK, this could either be a sequence where there's going to be a black square or red and there's not going to be a black square."
"Unknown","01;07;30;06","01;07;51;08","So then at the end that and you can tell what the stimulus was because if you look at the first level firing rates, so again, the next kind of plot down the bottom row there corresponds to seeing the lines and the top one corresponds to seeing the square so basically what happens here is it starts out just seeing the lines."
"Unknown","01;07;51;24","01;08;13;17","And then at the second time stuff there you can see it kind of bumps up and the agent's really confident that it's seeing a square, which at the second level corresponds to becoming fully confident that it's going to be the sequence of black circle and square. And then the stimulus goes away at time point four, which you can see at the first level."
"Unknown","01;08;13;17","01;08;47;25","And then space again, just lines for the rest of that and then the bottom two plots show the actual outcomes, where again, black is the agent sort of confidence in what it did, and the cyan dots correspond to the actual ground truth. So that's just showing that the agent waited for the first three time steps and then reported scene and kept that scene while it generated the sequence of words at the following four time steps."
"Unknown","01;08;48;15","01;09;10;12","And then the right one just kind of shows. It started out silent for the first four time steps and then the words that it observed itself report were I see Square, which is just those dots moving down the diagonal to the right. So so that's that's just, just so people know how to interpret what these plots mean. Yeah, exactly."
"Unknown","01;09;11;12","01;09;27;08","And another clarifying point would just be that the same simulation is leading to all of these behavioral outcomes and neural correlate predictions and a bunch of other things. So it's like one integrated model, and the model stream is kind of where they built it up. Yeah, exactly."
"Unknown","01;09;30;12","01;09;57;09","OK, so we kind of talk through all of that. OK, so in terms of the taxonomy here, what we wanted to do was basically recreate that taxonomy that we talked about earlier. So this was modulating signal strength from height lower and from kind of and whether attention was absent. And then looking at the corresponding firing rates and looking at like the percent same and percent correct, that kind of thing."
"Unknown","01;09;57;24","01;10;24;06","Also sensing support behavior and percent correct, which is false choice behavior. OK, so kind of a couple of things to highlight. Are firing rate. First level is enhanced kind of most strongly in the conscious quadrant. That's nice. That's again, what we see in empirical findings. Well, high firing rate for kind of square sequence at the second level, even when reports are low."
"Unknown","01;10;24;07","01;10;57;02","This is kind of nice, right? Because I talked about earlier, you can have kind of a firing rate at the set. You can have kind of activity in prefrontal regions that is generally speaking, below the threshold for report that is nevertheless. Oh, sorry. When I say below the threshold for report, report frequency of reports are relatively low. But you can still have a preference for you can still have a higher firing rate or the representation of this showing that there's a representation of the stimulus basically."
"Unknown","01;10;58;25","01;11;40;06","And then the last thing to highlight is this, that the highest firing rate for the kind of the square sequence at the second is at the second level is in the conscious quadrant, which we kind of might think about in terms of ignition OK. So then as we see, the real thing to highlight here is that we see a large P three like event y potential in the conscious quadrant again, like a lot of the empirical findings in the report literature whereas first level five, first level areas seem to be fairly on modulated by by contrast access essentially, which is again what we see."
"Unknown","01;11;42;01","01;12;02;13","So now to a very that was kind of a very abstract kind of taxonomy where we're just manipulating factors. What we wanted to hear was show take a concrete empirical results and show how we could basically use literally exactly the same model to reproduce it. So this is a really clever paradigm by Michael Pitts that talked about before."
"Unknown","01;12;02;25","01;12;28;11","And so the idea is that you will have these kind of three phases to an experiment in phase one, the participant is just told to attend to the dots on the outside of the screen and hit a button when they dim. And the petition isn't told is that every now and again these are things these lines in the middle will rearrange themselves into a square pattern."
"Unknown","01;12;29;22","01;12;49;08","Then at the end of the first phase three trials and at the end of the first phase, they are then given a debrief and they asked, So how many people saw a square pattern in the middle? And roughly speaking, it's about 50%. And this is now actually really what replicated result across kind of different varieties of inattentional blindness."
"Unknown","01;12;49;08","01;13;19;24","Roughly speaking about 50% of people don't report seeing it when it's not task relevant. So that's nice. So then they then all of those so then they have 50% of people who didn't report saying it and then in fact are now aware of it. And then phase two they do exactly the same tasks are tending to the desks on the outside the outside so it's irrelevant still tasks relevant but they're now all aware of it in the debris for the end of the second phase everyone report saying it."
"Unknown","01;13;19;28","01;13;48;06","And so now they've got this contrast between awareness unaware so phase one versus phase two where the only thing that's different between them is whether you're aware of the stimulus and and there and the stimulus in the middle is task irrelevant or what you can say there's no Petrie be there's no light positive center positive central component in the air space then the final phase where task a kind of the aware phase."
"Unknown","01;13;48;06","01;14;14;04","So all participants are where they now make a task relevant to have them basically attend to the dot to the squares in the middle. And when you see there is this big three B very noticeable. OK so just to kind of set up this slide, to summarize what I just said, then. Great. So basically what we did was we just used a different inverse temperature parameter to modulate to kind of represent each state."
"Unknown","01;14;14;08","01;14;37;21","So phase one, very low temperature parameter for attention, attention, the attention temperature parameter that was kind of cast. And so this is you can kind of see the precision of the matrix here. We bump up for phase two, we bump up the temperature parameter just very slightly. This is kind of roughly speaking to cars correspond to like a diffuse attention."
"Unknown","01;14;38;15","01;14;59;24","So not you're not particularly attending to one thing, one particular feature of the stimulus you're attending just kind of diffusely to the whole screen and in the last date, we basically model the attention, make task relevant by making it very high or very precise temperature parameter where you basically get almost something that looks like a likelihood like an identity mapping OK?"
"Unknown","01;15;00;04","01;15;25;13","And so these are the areas that we APIs and the firing rates that you get out of it. And what you. This is my favorite slide in the whole plot. Or in the whole paper. What you see is basically results that look very, very like shockingly similar to the empirical results, especially if they're a model that is so incredibly simple, like houses, relatively speaking, at least in terms of biophysical detail."
"Unknown","01;15;26;13","01;15;42;25","And so what you see is at the first time step. So there's basically no yup. So our first phase basically know our pace. And so we give the model feedback on every trial. But what you should say is it's a little bit darker for the square for the until we give it feedback and tell it, no, you were wrong."
"Unknown","01;15;44;06","01;16;10;13","You did. We did actually present squares and the model changes its mind. It was fairly sure that it had same lines. Then second one, we bump up the attempt, we bump up the tension parameter, and now the model sees things and it gets on it reports saying the stimulus. So at this start, I should say in phase one, our model saw the stimulus."
"Unknown","01;16;10;13","01;16;29;14","49% of the time, basically identical to the empirical result was 50%. Phase two or 99% of the time, basically the same as the empirical results report. Phase two is 100%. And then phase three, it's 100% of the time. And there's little. But by the way, I should say the way I generated these results is basically I ran several hundred."
"Unknown","01;16;29;28","01;17;07;01","I basically set up just ran a for loop over the stimulus, over the code and for each condition and had it generate I think so each kind of iteration of the for loop generated 300 trials and I then averaged over maybe ten iterations of that followed. So each with a different random speed and so what you should see with the sorry that was a quick aside, the crucial thing is that in this last point there is this when there's a very precise stimulus mapping at the first level there is this abrupt change in firing rates at the second level."
"Unknown","01;17;08;09","01;17;52;10","And that abrupt change corresponds to the appearance or the emergence of the pay three B where the P three bit where remember that these are generated, they are the rate of change of posterior beliefs and so the model suddenly becomes very confident that sort of square. And so you see this big ERP burst in the P3, which corresponds to a very precise input mapping that comes along with something with a stimulus being task relevant and so there we've kind of got this really nice explanation of this kind of somewhat counterintuitive results about that association of the P3 and awareness OK."
"Unknown","01;17;52;10","01;18;25;07","And then the last thing I want we're going to touch on is just kind of we then decide to extend the taxonomy. So basically this is exactly the same. But we also now manipulated whether a prior was consistent with a valid expectation. So we gave the model kind of we made it roughly speaking, two times. The model for those roughly speaking, two times more likely to say a stimulus than C squared and lines and or two times more likely to see lines than squares."
"Unknown","01;18;25;07","01;19;02;12","And then we presented it with squares. And so that's kind of the consistent, inconsistent prior and then the key result is that across all of this, expectations boost the effective feedback on firing rate, which is nice. And in terms of air pays, what we see is something this very specific prediction when there is so these are kind of like fairly small differences, but they are differences only when attention is present do you really do you see a P three that's again in line with the empirical literature."
"Unknown","01;19;02;16","01;19;26;05","But crucially, when there's a consistent prior event or validate based to say a valid expectation, you should say reduced P three B in contrast to when there's kind of flat priors and when there is an inconsistent prior. And this is actually something that has been empirically that has been confirmed recently. Again, this was something Michael pitches on this paper, if anyone's interested, I can kind of post a link to the paper and that's really nice."
"Unknown","01;19;26;05","01;19;27;09","We didn't plan for that to happen."
"Unknown","01;19;29;29","01;20;03;07","OK, it is slightly knowing I would have liked I would have liked to cite it in the paper, but the paper actually came out before ours was accepted for publication. Or sorry after ours was accepted publication rather than fine and say OK. And just so a very quick summary summary of the results with really what is a really kind of like surprisingly simple model, we can reproduce a very wide range of canonical results from minimal contrast paradigms, including kind of ephemeral findings."
"Unknown","01;20;04;07","01;20;29;05","So this includes we can look at the unconscious PFC activation, we can account for the association of the three unconscious axis where the P three, roughly speaking, reflects the velocity of conscious working memory updates. I kind of like that phrase and four, we have an explicit and foamy defined role for prior expectations and the implementation process there. And then we've got a number of key predictions that emerge from this."
"Unknown","01;20;29;21","01;21;09;27","So P three is tension dependent and inverted. Should its amplitude be inversely proportional to expectation feedback from frontline bridal regions? This is a very specific prediction. Feedback from Toronto straddle regions should be enhanced unconscious trials and it should dis inhibit granulomas in the relevant sensory population, sensory cortex. That's a very specific prediction that falls out of the process theory that can be tested with DCM and then consistent expectation and again, consistent expectations for dis inhibit granulomas and sensory cortices while inconsistent inhibit them OK, so any questions at this point?"
"Unknown","01;21;11;22","01;21;33;11","Christopher, thanks for this awesome presentation. Do any of the panelists maybe want to queue up a question? How about you do this last slide with the bat, leave on that sort of phenomenological note if you want to, otherwise we can return to the panel yeah. Perfect. Yep. Sounds good. So all the panel prepare a question or thought and then raise your hand when you're ready and give a last thought here."
"Unknown","01;21;33;11","01;21;59;11","Thanks, Christopher. OK, so just like a brief aside, on nominal consciousness, so we associate that. So I'll just back up a bit. Sorry. There might be a puzzle in that we associate global broadcast and the availability of information for support with this second template level owl experience, although it's kind of like there is a depth to it in the sense that experience is kind of smeared over time, right?"
"Unknown","01;22;00;04","01;22;42;02","There is an integration window that's relevant for experience. It certainly isn't doesn't occur at the level of whole sequences and so there's a puzzle here. So where does experience live, as it were? Where is the content of experience and kind of brown? I've been chatting about this and this is view is still evolving, but broadly speaking, I think what's right about this or what what we should say is that the first level states that what's what the content that we are conscious of are the first level states that have a high enough precision either through kind of bottom up precision or because there's a really precise prior that comes down from a second level, a"
"Unknown","01;22;42;02","01;23;06;29","matrix so basically the message that's being cast back up to the second level has high enough precision to influence policy selection or to pass the threshold the posterior belief threshold for conscious access and report. And so this kind of has the nice consequence that it keeps experience at the relevant level. So it's updated at each time step when we get new stimulus stimuli in."
"Unknown","01;23;07;06","01;23;40;06","And yet it has a distinct kind of link to report and behavior yeah. So I mean, just to expand on that a little bit, I mean, the kind of idea is just that as opposed to and again, Chris partially said this, but just going to reiterate, the idea is, is that what you can actually experience is is a consequence of both the posterior overstates at the first level and whatever the second level likelihood is."
"Unknown","01;23;40;22","01;24;05;08","Right? So it's a function of both of those area there one and what the structure is of a two there. And a way to think about that is if you were to rearrange a two, so the mapping was different and one had the same posterior, then that would update the beliefs that level two in a different way. Right?"
"Unknown","01;24;05;19","01;24;29;04","So you know, if I arrange a 21 way, even though one there is still sensitive to the same stimulus, and then if I rearrange it to one way then the posterior one is going to lead to awareness of one thing. Whereas if a two is set up a different way, then the second level will gain awareness of a different thing."
"Unknown","01;24;29;21","01;24;48;01","Right. So so in some way, the phenomenal content that you become aware of depends on the nature of this link between what messages, the way that the messages at the second level are kind of decode it in a sense. Right? What the second level takes to be the meaning of the messages that get passed off from the first level."
"Unknown","01;24;49;12","01;25;16;24","So so there's this kind of nice thing, like Chris mentioned, where it's the updates that the first level gives to the second level at each time points. So phenomenology kind of stays at the temporal scale of experience, but quite phenomenal content still depends on a certain type of access, right? It depends on the first level having a specific type of influence on the second level, Brian, thanks a lot."
"Unknown","01;25;16;24","01;25;45;06","It's really interesting. So let's return to the guest, the panel mode. Christopher, awesome presentation. And the first question is going to be from Dave and then anyone else can raise their hands. So Dave, go ahead. Oh, my questions about possible involvement of the air toss the ridiculous thalamic activating system either in your data or the data that are drawn on neurological data and the other relevant studies."
"Unknown","01;25;45;23","01;26;20;13","Is there any representation of possible contributions by the air us, by the midbrain and is there any accommodation in your model of something maybe not explicit with the air trust, but data that might originate there of, say, the endogenous attention so subcortical structures? Really interesting. And as for the reticular smoke activating system, I'm curious, did you did you get that from this book by Bernard Byers?"
"Unknown","01;26;20;13","01;26;45;07","So a cognitive theory of consciousness where he first introduced global workspace theory and he has a whole chapter devoted to the reticular thalamic activating system. Oh, that's great. I will definitely have to get that. No, actually I got that. This from the work that Jack Punx up and Mark Solms did, especially the 20 13th thesis of the, the conscious ID."
"Unknown","01;26;45;21","01;27;32;20","He is of course a very close collaborator with Carl Frist and he just brought out a full length book on the conscious ID, especially as active inference interacts with that. So, so my, my actual main focus of research is on emotions and so applying computational models to emotions and I'll just say that I, I have very strong disagreements with the, the kind of theory proposed they mark we actually published kind of a joint like on paper debate where me and a colleague Richard Blaine kind of debated back and forth with York and Mark about the right way to think of the way consciousness works."
"Unknown","01;27;32;20","01;27;58;06","And all of us say that, you know, their view places this really strong role of affect where they they more or less say that these midbrain structures like the Uncle Gray, send these afferent signals up to kind of activate the rest of the brain and that somehow permeates it with this kind of necessary emotion. And that's kind of primary."
"Unknown","01;27;59;11","01;28;25;06","Whereas whereas kind of the way that the way that we have the kind of structure of the sort of thing that we've defined, it is just that no, like that global broadcasting kind of thing applies to all types of information right? So if you have a representation of your beliefs about your emotional state that has to be attended to and sort of sent in the workspace just like any other stimulus for you to become aware of it."
"Unknown","01;28;26;14","01;28;58;28","And so I mean, these sorts of midbrain structures, they do a lot of really interesting and receptive and visceral regulation processes and they do have a sort of general like upward modulation role while they while they kind of you know, my view is they kind of keep the cortex in general in a state where it's capable of of representing things, being sensitive to simulate holding different states, active in other states, not so it essentially it allows things to be represented in general and then to become consciously accessible."
"Unknown","01;28;59;26","01;29;48;16","But with respect to the way that kind of emotions feed in and whether the midbrain structures actually contribute content in and of themselves, we just have theoretical disagreements about that. Can I also briefly follow up on that? So the contrast, the reason I think that frontier regions in cortex are so important is because there are a huge just amount of empirical literature now in your imaging and also very recently data from kind of invasive neurophysiology in monkeys and most recently in mice showing that, yes, when there is this contrast between conscious or unconscious, these are the things that are differentially modulated."
"Unknown","01;29;49;06","01;30;22;03","Now, you can't there are some very impressive findings for very recently coming from Matthew Larkin's group showing basically that you can wake creatures up from general anesthesia by stimulating the medial dorsal nucleus and the thalamus. And there are these crucial connect like reciprocal connections between layer five of the cortex and the medial dots and the thalamus. And when those goes out, basically general, they go out under general anesthesia."
"Unknown","01;30;22;18","01;30;51;22","And when you are awake or when like whiskers are stimulated in bowel cortex, when they take when the mouse kind of reports as it says its whiskers were stimulated, the circuit goes off essentially. So I think the thalamus is crucial, but kind of all the harm and every everyone else, I think the reticular activating system, all this subcortical structures, these are background conditions similar to what Ryan said, it puts the cortex in kind of a state where it could be aware of something."
"Unknown","01;30;53;01","01;31;20;18","But the actual contrast between something being broadcast, a broadcast that's not broadcast or being reported, it's not reported, does not rely on those structures. And I would just want to see from those authors, I would actually just want to see them engage with something like the visual awareness literature and show that those structures are differentially involved thanks for that, Stephen."
"Unknown","01;31;20;18","01;31;56;19","Go for it. And then Dean Blue or actually then Scott, then Dean of Blue. If you update Stephen with the question, then Scott yes. So thanks. Just a question. Just to be clear. So effectively, you you tagged the degree in prediction confidence and that mapped against the the data that's empirical if I'm right in understanding. So as the model showed a difference in confidence that was showing a correlation to how firing happens."
"Unknown","01;31;56;29","01;32;28;21","And I'll just be curious to know if you think that this this sort of key level or something where this firing or deductive pace can happen, where is that where there's a shift between a maybe a more Markov in Ergodic process to something more semi Markov in unless ergodic and so that an organism can make non ergodic choices in conscious awareness."
"Unknown","01;32;29;28","01;33;09;20","So I mean, a couple of things. So I'm not sure about this comment. So I think you can probably have I'm not sure how semi Markov in systems relate to identity. I assume that you can have a semi Markov system in a like system that doesn't like that wouldn't surprise me. Yeah. So basically when you move from a I just don't know, actually just stuff like that but if you I'm not particularly up on a lot of the physics, fiscal physics that relates to how these models work but yes, when you move from a first of a model to a second level model, they are semi Markov."
"Unknown","01;33;09;20","01;33;31;01","Yeah. And can you just maybe define that a little more? What does that mean to you? What does that enable? And maybe that will get at what Steven was asking to basically the model is no longer just purely dependent upon the previous state. At the first level of the model, there is more information that is determined at the second level."
"Unknown","01;33;31;01","01;34;00;10","Then what is just goes on in each time step of the first level. That's basically it. Yeah. So I think we have a sentence about the summary. Yes. You what the temporally date scale buys you is essentially what we were saying before all of those cognitive actions that allow you to do things like construct reports, make plans, et cetera, et cetera, and kind of abstract away from sensory flux."
"Unknown","01;34;00;20","01;34;46;25","All of these things depend upon there being a second level and that might be reflected in the brain, the sums from the graph. Yeah, yeah. And you know, things are not so grand, so granular. Cortex is generally speaking, like so the cortex has six layers roughly speaking across. And as you kind of move up or move towards the center of some centrifugal hierarchy, depending on who you talk to and what kind of anatomical maps you believe that type of thing are layer four of that, the granular cortex, which is essentially the input layer from the thalamus and the feedforward layer that gets smaller and smaller and smaller."
"Unknown","01;34;46;25","01;35;14;13","And so when you're at kind of the center of this hierarchy or this centrifuge, you essentially have no granular cortex at all. Ah, this is kind of ties in these filtered. Barrett's done a lot of stuff with this. I have problems with that view, to be honest. They kind of say the top of the hierarchy is where they think consciousness lives I have a rather vehement disagreement in that."
"Unknown","01;35;14;13","01;35;16;21","I just think there's absolutely no evidence that that's true."
"Unknown","01;35;19;01","01;35;43;03","In terms of neuroimaging evidence. The areas that the relevant seem to be these frontal regions, they do have a layer. They do have a somewhat well defined layer for it's not completely granular. It's not granular. Somewhere in between yeah. I don't know. I think they what one thing to say about I know Ryan has very specific views about this, and I should say that I really love, at least from Barrett's work."
"Unknown","01;35;43;03","01;35;44;02","I think she's wrong about this."
"Unknown","01;35;49;14","01;36;19;10","I just want to go with kind of the empirical contrasts. Right. And not speculate too much about very specific implementation details. So, look, they kind of go from a very loose model of kind of predictive coding and then map it to these like cellular kind of details about the structure of neurons. I am more interested in going from these computational properties to basically what would measure the level of neuro imaging, because I think that's what is most tractable experimentally."
"Unknown","01;36;19;21","01;36;38;06","And then if where and there's still all the debates about that neuroimaging level, right? If we kind of hammer it out and decide what's going on at the neuro imaging level of analysis, then good, then then we can start having more serious discussions about particular involve involved in particular types of cortex. But I don't think we're there yet empirically."
"Unknown","01;36;38;16","01;37;06;04","Yeah. I mean, I would say yeah, I just want to echo that a little bit. You know, it's, it's, it's important to realize that it's not as though the particular sets of little node neurons and synaptic backgrounds and kind of like hypothetical columns, you know, that showed earlier in terms of internal process theory that's just kind of one example of a way you could set it up."
"Unknown","01;37;06;21","01;37;42;04","There is there's a very, very large number of ways that you can connect up neurons together in different structures that would implement basically the same algorithm. And in addition to that, there are different message parsing algorithms that you can use to solve the same graphs. And active inference isn't defined by some particular message crossing algorithm, right? Like Thomas Forest as this specifically in a paper where you can have different neural limitations that require more or less neuronal resources to implement."
"Unknown","01;37;42;13","01;38;12;15","But it's kind of a trade off between efficiency and accuracy where, you know, for instance, like really, really accurate methods, passing algorithms like propagation, they require more neurons to do, but they're a little more accurate and the brain could use that, right. Or the brain could use variational message passing, which is not quite as good of an approximation, but requires less resources to do so."
"Unknown","01;38;12;15","01;38;44;15","Point being is, is that there's not really that strong a commitment to that level of kind of circuit detail in active inference. It's more just the theory of you can have this pattern of synaptic connections that implement the matrices. And we represent posterior beliefs over states with these firing rate functions. And then you take the rate of change and those is but so this is this is kind of the issue with it doesn't really make sense to me anyway at this point."
"Unknown","01;38;44;15","01;39;23;06","Again, just echoing what was said to start with, let's assume that this one very specific way of setting up neurons to do this is the right one. Let's just assume that and then figure out what must be true about different areas of cortex based on their layer, based on their cortical column layer structure. So so this is definitely super interesting and probably has a really meaningful, interesting mapping between the differences between granular and granular, granular cortices with respect to computational function."
"Unknown","01;39;24;13","01;39;46;25","But, but again, I don't think until we've really nailed down that there is this one particular circuit implementation, it doesn't really make sense in my opinion, any way to kind of infer from that direction or function. So I should say. Yeah, just to kind of echo that, I think if you work in your imaging, it doesn't make sense."
"Unknown","01;39;46;25","01;40;09;15","If you work in mouse as in a mouse model and you are literally testing hypotheses at the circuit level, then it would make sense something to do. But all right. But in that case, in that case, you're literally testing like the predictions of specific message parts about. Yeah, exactly. And now that that was kind of a testing that's testing for message passing algorithms."
"Unknown","01;40;09;15","01;40;55;00","That's not assuming a particular one, an inference from that. So anyway, I mean, but I mean, if you I mean for people who are interested, I mean, I mean we, you know, so, so I and some for a couple of previous papers have kind of built multilevel active inference models similar to this, but specifically about emotional awareness, you know, the sort of show how you can get from simple kind of lack of awareness of single emotional states all the way up to being aware of feeling multiple emotions at the same time and being able to report them and things like that that kind of show how a structure not so different from this one and"
"Unknown","01;40;55;14","01;41;19;16","can generalize to two emotions or really to any other sort of thing that you could experience and be aware of, whether that's coming from inferring things about your own kind of bodily state and its emotional meaning from into reception, or whether it's something like vision. And so, I mean, we, we haven't covered that stuff in any of these sorts of things before."
"Unknown","01;41;19;16","01;41;52;18","But, but that stuff is also out there that might kind of help at least show what kind of the view on our end is about how active inference can account for emotional phenomena and be consistent with the current literature on emotional awareness as well. Thanks for these awesome answers, Scott, with a question, and then I'll ask one from the chat and then Dean or Blue or someone else we go."
"Unknown","01;41;53;08","01;42;35;05","Thanks. Great and fascinating presentation. I was wondering this book, um, The Intelligent Movement Machine, Graziano. Yeah, and it talks generally about the cortical mapping being predicted by the movement repertoire in the motor cortex and kind of that embodiment kind of element. One of the things I wanted to ask about the, and I think it follows from that most immediate prior part of the conversation is when we have an active inference setting and that model is being employed for multiple perception."
"Unknown","01;42;35;11","01;43;07;23","And I won't use the phrasing right, because my active inference terms aren't all up to snuff, but when the inputs into the individual who's performing the active inference, that system are from various sensory inputs and various temporal distance. So they're several inputs and then they're being synthesized into a an action or an externality. Something is going to reach out."
"Unknown","01;43;07;23","01;43;37;01","And again, my apologies for not internalizing all the definitions. What is what are some of the cortical mappings or have you found cortical mappings that embody that process of synthesizing multiple inputs into a single action? What are the core, what are the structural correlates of the process of synthesis of multiple different strands of active inference into a single action potential?"
"Unknown","01;43;37;02","01;44;03;26","Again, I'm using wrong words, but nice place to be. Is this a question essentially about multimodal integration? Yes. So, yeah. And so I guess I think active insurance is probably you could you might be able to build a specific. So I think there are two parts this question. That's an interesting question. First part is I'll just kind of answer the active in front end about the way I think about active inference at least is just as a really useful modeling and mathematical framework."
"Unknown","01;44;04;05","01;44;34;05","And I think it's possible to build multiple active inference models of any phenomenon. So I would want to hammer out an empirical paradigm and then figure out, OK, what models could I build of this? So that's kind of the first part. Second, policies about multimodal integration are there kind of places that Hal's multimodal? I haven't looked at multimodal integration from since I was an undergrad, just trying to remember like my third year cognitive courses."
"Unknown","01;44;34;05","01;45;01;05","I think there are places like posterior bridle cortex where there is integration between multiple mode out like you might say, like vision and one other thing, whatever it is, and then that gets shot off to motor cortex implemented in actions. So I think I would just say look at the motor planning literature. There's lots of stuff about Bayesian visual writer integration."
"Unknown","01;45;01;12","01;45;29;19","And one just follow up. One of the things that that leads to is I was wondering about these situated cognition opportunities for those syntheses. So for instance, you have hysteresis or my son used to say stereotypes are real timesaver. You said it as a joke. Right? So the idea is you have externalities that facilitate the synthesis. So they're actually not cortical structures, they're social and link and linguistic and rhetorical structures."
"Unknown","01;45;30;22","01;45;57;03","Right. I mean, is that could those what I'm where I'm exploring is could those be described with some of the same models as the cortical structures? So you're actually able to have a scale independent description of the processes, both in a social and a cortical cognitive context. For the synthesis of multiple multimodal inputs. So I'm not sure about the scale independent part."
"Unknown","01;45;57;22","01;46;18;00","Yeah, yeah. I hear you. I know. Scott, it's a beautiful question. I see where you're coming from because we've been talking about the scale free formulas Formalisms with Chris Fields and others and then this whole nested mark on blank, it's like you could have the neuron and then the neuron, you could go within a model. And just like you said, your model doesn't presuppose that awareness is actually at a higher level."
"Unknown","01;46;18;06","01;46;37;02","You're just saying there is a structure that's deep temporal structure and that's the state, that's the timeline that you are at. But there could be another level and then mechanistically or functionally, how that level plays out is going to come back to a task specific measurement, which is and a plural, a plurality of models. So still good points."
"Unknown","01;46;37;05","01;47;05;25","I mean, part of part of I mean, I think if I want to go back to I mean, there's lots of nice opportunities, right, to build active and for involve a very simple for like multiple multimodal or cross modal right integration path. You know, like for instance, like I haven't seen this done but maybe look back but things like the double flash illusion or the rubber hand illusion or you know any any of these kinds of multimodal things I mean like that like a double flashlight is really nice, right?"
"Unknown","01;47;05;25","01;47;50;21","Because I mean more or less for being more familiar, you either play one or two tones and they are coincident with a single flash of light and it just turns out that when you play two tones really quick, then people perceive two flashes of light. Well, when there was really only one and the reason for that is so there's this, this kind of like Frayer in the mix, presumably that coincident things that are coincident temporally have the same hidden cause, but also at the same time, the temporal resolution of audition is just better is more trustable than the temporal resolution of vision."
"Unknown","01;47;52;04","01;48;18;23","So so you can just say, look, like the system just trusts right? It has beliefs that the auditory system has higher precision and that there's a high probability of common causes of coincident input. Therefore, there must have been two flashes given that there were two columns. I mean, that's just one example of like a really simple, well-known miracle task force model integration that would be pretty easy."
"Unknown","01;48;18;23","01;48;39;15","I mean, probably without a lot of without even a ton of tweaks. So the kind of structure of the model that we're using here, you could do and all you really have to do probably just to find the right precision for it to the auditorium visual input where those are jointly generated by the same hidden cause or hidden state in the model."
"Unknown","01;48;40;15","01;49;09;06","And so basically it's either you're just inferring one cause two causes and that generates receiving one flash or two flashes. I mean, anyway, it would be it would be simple to do. And I guess that I don't know, I don't not aware of that having been done in a kind of formal accident for sure. But, you know, I mean, there are known like neural Horowitz of this stuff, and they're in part where you'd expect them to be right there at like the borders."
"Unknown","01;49;09;08","01;49;45;15","Right, of like auditorium, visual processing and like association cortex and like posterior association cortex. And they'd be really, really, really cool projects, right. To try to build a model of something like that. And then to see whether the predicted neural time courses actually better kind of single out the areas the association areas where the kind of borders of vision, it seems like it's it's almost like a situated synesthesia where you have the Gabor Square, where you have the frequency and time variance."
"Unknown","01;49;45;15","01;50;08;08","But it's being one of the variance is being hijacked by another perception in the visual field. Right. You know, so the you're that it's crossing over to that other sense is very interesting. Thank you. Thanks. I'm going to ask a question from the chat and then if anyone wants to give probably a short final note, but then we'll end around the hour so that we can have a whole second discussion next week."
"Unknown","01;50;08;20","01;50;32;04","The question and chat is to the authors. What would you say the main limitations of the model are or where some next things you're building on, but what are the main limitations of the current model? And then how are you going to be building so I mean, there's lots right so I'll just list them. I think we list this in the paper, some might say for starters, it's a discrete model."
"Unknown","01;50;33;02","01;50;56;23","We treat the whole visual system as basically like one discrete hidden state to be inferred by the high level. That's obviously like not true, but it's a good enough approximation that you think reproduce about your findings. It would be nice to have a multilevel model. Now with that multi level model, I think there are some empirical cases. There's this thing called the partial awareness hypothesis bias."
"Unknown","01;50;56;23","01;51;21;14","It could air where they talk about having partial access or the global workspace having partial access to different parts of the hierarchy and that giving rise to kind of odd experiences. So you might have something like you might have really good access to the fact that the color of rain range, but not to the fact that the shirt or vice versa so that would be nice."
"Unknown","01;51;21;14","01;51;43;23","I'm not sure quite how to do that in a hidden kind of hidden Markov model situation, but that would be nice. Second thing is we really just model kind of report paradigms where we're where we're going with this is we're trying to extend this explicitly. So models, no report paradigms and actually casting kind of thinking about that in a more precise way."
"Unknown","01;51;44;02","01;52;02;13","And so we've actually built another model and we're kind of writing it up at the moment. I mean, it's not it's kind of a side project because it's not a part of my thesis. But the idea is, roughly speaking, to actually have a model that is able to explain a lot of the weird findings on the report literature."
"Unknown","01;52;03;06","01;52;34;28","And also I think we have a much more principled we now have a much more principled account of report, but I'm really quite excited about then just I guess on a loss limitation would just be and this isn't really a limitation because Ryan has got a lot of work in emotion in intro section on this. And I know that somewhere that his lab is like really pushing, but it would just be nice if we could use these very similar architectures and apply them to something like introspective awareness."
"Unknown","01;52;36;07","01;53;00;09","And I would be I would find it personally very compelling if you had one. I think it's too demanding to have one model, but one very general model structure that generalizes across visual consciousness to introspective awareness, to like auditory awareness, to smell the sensory awareness. That would be really nice. Awesome answer, right? Do you want to add anything?"
"Unknown","01;53;00;09","01;53;22;17","And then we'll have any final comments you know, I mean, I think I think Chris covered most of the kinds of limitations or I mean, I don't know. I mean, I would just say like like. Yes, I mean, it would be it would definitely be nice to do something like have a so there are what are called mixed models where you have kind of a discrete model like ours on the top."
"Unknown","01;53;22;17","01;53;50;29","But then the kind of plus area is some predictions downwards that essentially sets the points for a continuous level below it so so then you can have a continuous space where where for instance, it's a lot more plausible, right, to think that the sorts of inference that are being made in kind of like early visual processing or on it on a continuous, continuous space, right?"
"Unknown","01;53;50;29","01;54;13;20","It doesn't have to be like motion speed one motion speed to rate. It can be it can be continuous values for things like that. But like another thing that I you know, I mean, you know, process and interception and emotion, I mean that's something like that. I mean, we have empirical paradigms that we've been setting up to test just this kind of thing and and perception."
"Unknown","01;54;14;28","01;54;43;26","And we have a we have a paper under review right now where we applied a computational model to intercept this perception and like a gastro intestinal interception task, that's not a multi level model at the moment. And that paradigm doesn't have so it doesn't have enough trials to do contrast between conscious versus unconscious simulations. But we're kind of working on that so that would be nice."
"Unknown","01;54;44;07","01;55;05;10","And other things that, you know, Chris kind of mentioned the example of like being aware of the sort of red but not a shirt, right? That kind of thing also is really important for modeling emotional awareness because a lot of times people might be all right, some kind of bodily sensations, you know, it's kind of like a pit in their stomach or like heart rate or something like that, right?"
"Unknown","01;55;05;10","01;55;26;17","They might be conscious of that, but not in for one step above and they are conscious of the fact that that's associated, say, with feeling fear, right? Like like people with like panic disorder, for example. Right. They might feel like a strong heartbeat, but they might instead infer, oh, that means I'm having a panic attack or something like that."
"Unknown","01;55;26;17","01;55;50;17","Or they might infer, oh, I'm having a heart attack. Right. So there are different kind of conceptualizations that you can you can infer from right patterns and moral intercept of experience, some of which are emotional and some of which are not but and this is where it becomes interesting, is that you might also prime right. An emotion category right?"
"Unknown","01;55;50;17","01;56;15;00","Like like I mentioned with the guilt example, right? I could prime guilt so that higher level concept representation is activated, but also but does not enter into awareness, right? So you can kind of have multiple levels in a hierarchy where each level can independently or compete for broadcasting. And so, you know, I've been thinking about ways to do this model wise."
"Unknown","01;56;15;00","01;56;36;08","And the best thing we can come up with right now, just in terms of the practical implementations we have would be that, for instance, like have an introspective level and then have the emotional level above that. But have the interception representations also get kind of like duplicated and passed up to the second level. So then they can also kind of equally compete for access to like a third level."
"Unknown","01;56;36;08","01;57;07;10","That would be like the workspace level but anyways, I mean, these are all things that are kind of in progress. But just by way of saying this additional limitation is you can only be in our model, you could only be conscious of conscious or unconscious of one type of processing or a loved one level of abstraction, which is not the case, which is not the case in the thanks a lot for these awesome answers."
"Unknown","01;57;07;24","01;57;25;23","Always a great time with the two of you on the stream. So I'll just thank all the participants who joined us live. And in the calendar event, there's a forum, so be helpful if you want to add feedback on the form. And then we're going to be having 18.2 next week. At the same time, it's going to be the same paper."
"Unknown","01;57;26;03","01;57;56;03","So hopefully we'll all get another chance to reread the paper. Listen to this stream because Christopher, what you said was really deep. So again, much appreciated to all and we'll see everyone next week. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Thanks, guys."
