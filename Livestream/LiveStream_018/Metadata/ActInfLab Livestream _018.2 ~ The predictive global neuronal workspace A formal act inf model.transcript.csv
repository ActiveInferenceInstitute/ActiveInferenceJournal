"Speaker 1","00;00;09;01","00;00;34;04","Hello and welcome to the Active Inference Live Stream. This is the Active Inference Lab and we are here in active inference live stream 18.2 on March 30th 2021. Welcome everyone to the Active Inference Lab. This is a recorded in an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve on our work. So the video just changed a little bit."
"Speaker 1","00;00;34;04","00;01;08;11","There we go. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we'll all be following good value for livestreams today. We're here in session 18 point to a March 30th, having the follow up discussion with the authors and other participants on this predictive global Toronto workspace paper and today the goal is really to follow up on the last week's discussion, continue discussing and learning about this very cool paper and why the authors did what they did and what are the implications for different areas."
"Speaker 1","00;01;08;27","00;01;29;24","So today we're just going to go through some introductions and warm up questions and then we'll be able to walk through the paper and the slides and ask a few questions to the authors and get a few different perspectives. So for the introductions, we'll just go around and introduce ourselves and then pass it to somebody who hasn't spoken yet."
"Speaker 1","00;01;30;09","00;01;38;16","I'm Daniel. I'm a postdoc in California. And I'll pass it to Alex thanks."
"Speaker 2","00;01;39;07","00;01;40;01","Hi, everyone."
"Speaker 3","00;01;40;03","00;01;41;12","I'm Alex Rabkin."
"Speaker 2","00;01;41;29","00;01;43;04","I'm a researcher."
"Speaker 3","00;01;43;08","00;01;45;06","In Systems Management School in."
"Speaker 2","00;01;45;06","00;01;53;10","Moscow, Russia. Also, I'm a co-organizer for Active Influence Club. And I said to Stephen."
"Speaker 4","00;01;55;14","00;02;11;15","Hello, I'm Stephen. I'm based in Toronto, and I do a lot of work with social topographies and landscapes for social drama. And I will pass it over to Dean."
"Speaker 2","00;02;15;13","00;02;24;22","Hi, I'm Dean. I am retired. I'm hanging out in the loft of my cabin which is not very well lit."
"Speaker 2","00;02;27;02","00;02;29;16","I'll pass it to Ryan."
"Speaker 5","00;02;31;04","00;03;01;20","Yes. So I'm Ryan Smith. I'm a investigator at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I mainly work on computational modeling of empirical behavior and different psychiatric disorders, as well as some theoretical work on emotions and emotional awareness and introspection. And I guess some yes, I'll Senator Chris Violent."
"Speaker 3","00;03;02;15","00;03;25;04","Christopher White. I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge in England, and I mostly work on active inference or competition using active inference or computational models of cognitive control. But a lot of my previous work is kind of focused on visual awareness. So I'll pass it to Adam Hi."
"Speaker 2","00;03;25;22","00;03;47;19","I'm Adam. I'm a postdoc at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research. I'm also a research fellow at the Institute. And then consciousness free will to that."
"Speaker 1","00;03;47;19","00;04;20;22","Everyone Cool. Does anyone want to raise their hand and give a thought on one of these warm up questions, which are just what are something they're excited or curious about today? Or something that they liked or remembered about the paper or last week's discussion to sort of jump start where we were at or maybe really quickly at the beginning, Christopher wanted to clear up something or and then we'll kind of go into questions so maybe everyone could write down a question and then Christopher, go for it."
"Speaker 3","00;04;21;22","00;04;45;05","Yeah. So as I said, two things like both last time, widespread mistakes. I kind of want to correct them. So the first one was to quickly reference someone asked question thalamus and its involvement in consciousness. And I kind of referenced a whole body of work from Matthew Latham's group and I think I said the medial dorsal nucleus and it's not its central lateral nucleus and thalamus, I think like 99."
"Speaker 3","00;04;45;05","00;05;12;13","So people wouldn't care. But anyone who knows anything about the thalamus would be annoyed by that. And the second thing was I was talking about King and Dan's like Bayesian model of conscious access. I think I described the model as Univariate Gaussian. That's also not correct. It's a multivariate like Gaussian, although you can extend the same model to a univariate case anyway."
"Speaker 3","00;05;12;16","00;05;15;27","It doesn't matter. But I just want to kind of correct those two things."
"Speaker 1","00;05;18;13","00;05;25;06","Thanks for the correction. So if everyone could raise their hand. And first we'll go with Adam, then Steven."
"Speaker 2","00;05;29;11","00;05;48;12","I was a bit curious about what Chris just, just said. So like medial dorsal, that would be what thumb is for anterior cingulate in the frontal lobes. Kind of like the gateway to like amygdala at all. Would that be right? And then what of the central lateral like who's that loopy with? I forgot."
"Speaker 3","00;05;49;26","00;06;00;26","I think central lateral would be looping. I was specifically thinking about like a loop between layer five terminal neurons and central lateral thalamus."
"Speaker 1","00;06;03;01","00;06;13;23","So if I could ask a question there, just why are we identifying brain regions or what would it mean to be identifying brain regions one way or the other in humans or some other species?"
"Speaker 3","00;06;17;09","00;06;44;17","So this particular body of work. Not to go too far on a tangent, but it's really impressive body of work that basically has identified both level of consciousness and content of consciousness with burst mode firing in layer size of cortex I think most of this and most of this evidence is from a mouse model. So interpret that as you will yeah."
"Speaker 1","00;06;44;24","00;06;48;25","Or you can use the actual Jesse present. But yeah, go on."
"Speaker 2","00;06;50;24","00;07;31;18","I mean, for me, partially be what systems might contribute to wakefulness or different aspects of consciousness, but I really want to carve the joints on it in different respects. So let's say stimulating the medial dorsal was more important. Well, then that might implicate like the specific relays. It's ability to form slam of cortical loops or slam of the whole what it helps to bind together functionally and other functions."
"Speaker 2","00;07;33;01","00;07;51;00","It would tell you what processes might be involved So maybe action or salience that might be important. Or maybe it's like frontal lobes as hub, but like which part of the frontal lobes is it? The parts that are like a general or top, like the central hub, or does it look kind of like a motor bits or does it look like something else?"
"Speaker 2","00;07;51;03","00;08;00;04","So I'd be trying to look for like fish around for clues about what's important in what ways. So it might mean, but it's easy to tell stories."
"Speaker 1","00;08;02;09","00;08;05;25","OK, cool. So Stephen and then anyone else who has a question."
"Speaker 4","00;08;08;08","00;08;46;23","So yeah, I'm just really excited about the when I when I listened last week, you talked about temperature being used in the modules and like you had different places where you used different amounts of temperature. And I think it's in the self map function to, to show different types of models scenario. So I'll just be curious. I'm just excited about maybe just a general way that you use your thinking to build the modules to inform how you start to look at consciousness."
"Speaker 4","00;08;46;23","00;08;56;10","And the way the brain works as much as the way that you find the results from the modules. So that I'd be interested in that. Those two sides."
"Speaker 5","00;08;57;09","00;09;35;07","So so I mean, one, one thing I just want to make sure this is clear is that, you know, like not behavioral science borrowed for historically ended up borrowing a lot from criminology and physics, engineering and things like that. So there's some of these sorts of terms that can be a little well, a little funny. Right. So so like temperature like a temperature parameter or typically an inverse temperature parameter and something that's borrowed from physics that just kind of has to do with the physics that in the physics sense kind of how, how much, you know, how much energy particles are kind of bouncing around against each other."
"Speaker 5","00;09;36;05","00;10;08;27","And, you know, I know very oversimplified by putting it on light, but so it just means that there's more kind of randomness right in that in the system. So in the context of all of this, we're just applying that same equation to describe essentially the amount of noise and decision making. So a higher temperature in this case just is just a parameter in an equation that controls how deterministic versus the past that decision making processes are."
"Speaker 5","00;10;09;09","00;10;26;15","So I just want to make sure that it has. I just wanna make sure it's clear to anyone listening that it has nothing to do with actual like physical temperature, like being hot or cold. It's just a parameter that this that kind of modulates how random decision making is So I just wanted to make that make that clear."
"Speaker 5","00;10;26;15","00;10;50;16","So in this case, it's just it's just controlling. So, so for example, if, if the temperature parameter is really low or the inverse temperature has a really high value, then that just means that say even if the model was only like 51% versus 49% confident in one thing over another, it would always choose the action associated with the 51%."
"Speaker 5","00;10;51;18","00;11;20;22","Whereas if the temperature or value parameter value was high or as low or as high or the inverse temperature parameter is low, then that means that the like for instance, that with 51% of the time it would choose the action associated with 51% or what .51 probability it would choose that one less often than it would if the probability was say point seven."
"Speaker 5","00;11;22;06","00;11;49;07","And what probability than that then if it was if the probability was point nine. So essentially just having a low inverse temperature parameter value just allows the probability of choice and the actual choices that our frequency of choice to kind of scale in some sense with the actual probabilistic beliefs over the different states in the model."
"Speaker 1","00;11;51;13","00;11;56;03","Thank you, Ryan. We'll have Christopher then Adam and anyone else who raises their hand."
"Speaker 3","00;12;00;16","00;12;21;09","Such just the kind of contextualize that a little bit. So soft back function is exactly the same function as a Boltzmann distribution from statistical physics. So often if you have a you'll just use the same terminology because it has. And in the physics case, it has like a literal physical interpretation In this case, it doesn't. So that's kind of why."
"Speaker 3","00;12;22;12","00;12;49;29","So there's that overlapping terminology in terms of deciding why or on those parameters or actually building them in. It was really just kind of came from thinking about what what attention does. So what we're trying to modulate that was attention and signal strength. And both of those things in some way modulate the strength of feedforward input. So when you think about that, then kind of think, OK, what part of the model corresponds to that?"
"Speaker 3","00;12;50;00","00;13;33;17","Well, it's the likelihood matrix that maps but that decides the precision of the mapping between external observations. And first level hidden states. And so both the idea is, is that both attention and kind of external signal strength where or where might be something like contrast whatever will jointly determine the precision of that mapping. And then there's a lot of different ways where you can kind of cash that out if you actually want to get into kind of the neurobiology of it, like the normalization model of attention or bias competition or something like that, but kind of extracting away from that detail, basically it just modulates the matrix, the computational level of analysis."
"Speaker 3","00;13;34;04","00;13;35;29","So that was kind of the thinking that went into it."
"Speaker 1","00;13;38;04","00;13;52;05","Very interesting. Adam then Steven than anyone else Okay. Adam to be ready to speak, but go for it."
"Speaker 2","00;13;52;26","00;14;24;13","Yeah, sorry about that. Oh, it's kind of off the current topic, but from before. So some quick googling turned out the central lateral seems to be looping largely with parietal and temporal association areas. So that's potentially interesting. In ways that indirectly could like speak to based on the physical substrates of consciousness, like the the brouhaha between I-80 and JWT said more like the front of the brain or the back of the brain and in which senses of, I mean, consciousness."
"Speaker 2","00;14;24;28","00;14;42;26","So but it's interesting. I actually I'm having trouble finding an image of like a diagram of the syllabus actually shows the central lateral nucleus. It's all just like I see central medial, but not central lateral. It seems like they might be kind of like tucking it in with a pull that our whatever that means."
"Speaker 4","00;14;44;15","00;15;09;06","Stephen Yeah. Just say thanks for that. That feedback. That was really useful. I think also I, because I've got background in chemistry, I keep thinking about the gives free energy where it talks about temperature times change in entropy in that term. So it's like that that the temperature is multiplied into the amount of entropy change there is to make it more significant."
"Speaker 4","00;15;09;06","00;15;19;12","So that would kind of mirror why it's a bit like you're putting in noise or entropy. So that that's quite useful. So yeah. Thanks."
"Speaker 1","00;15;19;29","00;15;50;06","You're welcome. Blue, you, you or anyone else can raise their hand but one chemistry metaphor. And again, Brian, as you brought up, it's not always like a literal meaning, but thermodynamic versus the kinetic alternative for a reaction. So, like, the thermodynamic outcome for the candle is to burn because it has all this pent up energy, but it doesn't spontaneously combust because the kinetic barrier, the activation barrier is too high."
"Speaker 1","00;15;50;15","00;16;16;22","And then when there's like an enzyme or a spark of energy, then in the right situation, the product can go all the way down the big delta G to the kind of ultimate thermodynamic least energy versus the more kinetically accessible. And so that's kind of like information foraging. There's sort of the perfect citation you would find if you had the right surge and it was that low temperature or something analogous."
"Speaker 1","00;16;17;00","00;16;33;29","But then if it's too kinetically constrained, then attention is drawn away. I'm not sure if that will map directly in this whole active inference mode, but it's just kind of another chemical informational distinction."
"Speaker 5","00;16;35;04","00;17;02;18","Well, I mean, it depends. I mean, it depends how you're using it. Like in this in this case, there's not really much the connection is weirdness. Essentially, we're just using a parameter and it's not my function to control the precision of a mapping. Well, in a few different places for attention and for familial strength, we're just using it to change the precision of the mapping between and states and observations at the first level."
"Speaker 5","00;17;03;12","00;17;28;13","So it just it just controls essentially how how a strong sensory signal ends up updating beliefs and theories over space at the first level. And then modulated by a second temporal parameter that does the same thing, but that accounts for attention. So these sorts of things jointly control essentially how much evidence sensory input provides for plus years of research."
"Speaker 5","00;17;28;24","00;17;57;11","At the first level, we're using it for that kind of thing. And then we also use it for controlling deterministic sort of choice at the second level of the model in terms of in terms of actions like them So and in all those cases, I don't personally see a direct relationship between that and the kind of thermodynamic thermodynamic aspect of of temperature of getting over, you know, energy barriers and things like that."
"Speaker 5","00;17;57;23","00;18;02;22","But I mean, I could be, I could be I could be just not thinking through it all the way."
"Speaker 1","00;18;04;07","00;18;08;14","Steven then anyone else Yeah."
"Speaker 4","00;18;08;15","00;18;26;07","So I think that makes a lot of sense what you're saying. And I suppose the nice thing with the modeling is that you've got this potential to and then you're using it, like you say, as this way to bring in noise or soft max. But it gives you that way to increase and decrease it, which in real life, when you do empirical work, it's hard to, to do that."
"Speaker 4","00;18;26;07","00;18;37;25","So it's, it's one of the strengths of the model that you can use that parameter and see. It seems to be one way that you really get insights into the dynamics of the system."
"Speaker 5","00;18;40;21","00;18;49;23","Yeah. I mean, in terms of just being able to modulate modulate the or mimic the influences of attention and modulate that from perception of a signal."
"Speaker 1","00;18;52;15","00;18;55;21","Just even or Dean even Steven."
"Speaker 2","00;18;57;28","00;19;24;08","Yeah. I just have a quick question here. And maybe this is far too oversimplified, but when you guys were doing this work, I started also looking at the effect paper that I think the two the two together gave me a better sense of some of the work that I was doing around helping people walk into these novel situations pre reflectively."
"Speaker 2","00;19;24;23","00;19;49;00","And there is a tendency to want to commit, to want to pay attention, to want to give over whatever you have in terms of processing power to figuring out what's going on. But we had to spend quite a bit of time on helping people get the idea that there is this channel, there's this kind of sweet spot. And when you were talking about degrees, it brought it up for me."
"Speaker 2","00;19;49;00","00;20;18;20","Again, the idea of how to help a person know when they're overcommitting, when they're overcorrecting and when they're overcompensating. So and they're trying to do this estimation, how do they know that they're not seeing the moonwalking bear because they're so committed to counting up the number of basketball passes. I wonder if you guys had spent a little bit of time looking at the other end of the of the channel when people actually readjust back in."
"Speaker 2","00;20;18;20","00;20;23;10","And I know that that's probably where the degrees part comes in. But I was just wondering about that."
"Speaker 5","00;20;24;08","00;20;34;03","So I mean, are you imagining or imagining in some kind of like clinical scenario where a person. Yeah, I'm like biased attention away from something that would be subversive if they were to focus on it."
"Speaker 2","00;20;34;08","00;20;35;15","But yeah, exactly."
"Speaker 5","00;20;35;29","00;21;06;27","And yeah, so I mean, I mean, there's there's probably a mechanistic relation in a sense, just in the broad sense of how we think attention is implemented. Right? So so for example, if you if you think that a person is avoiding paying attention to something because it would be aversive right then, then you can end up with this kind of implicit reinforcement of attentional policy selections, which we don't directly have in this model."
"Speaker 5","00;21;06;27","00;21;31;25","Right, choosing what the precision is associated with attention in this model. But, but that's something that can be added and it's something that we have actually added in some more recent work that we're doing right now. But the idea, the idea there or one way to think about that would be that when a, whenever a person essentially starts to pay attention to the thing that would be aversive, then they start to feel it starts to feel aversive."
"Speaker 5","00;21;32;07","00;21;53;13","Right? And so then if they pay attention away again then the choice of paying attention away actually ends up being negatively reinforcing because the bad feeling goes away. Right? So then what that ends up doing, at least according to this kind of reinforcement learning account, is that that ends up assigning higher value to the policy of attending away."
"Speaker 5","00;21;54;02","00;22;35;23","Right. So over time, the probability of attending away just ends up getting higher and higher because it makes you feel better every time you do. So then this sort of avoidant attention can become really kind of habits and, and that's one way of thinking about it. And so, you know, and, and, and the clinical setting, right? You, you want to help people potentially, you know, like start to, you know, gradually, you know, expose themself to, to you know, pay attention to this thing that's aversive in hopes that if they're able to kind of do that in a sustained way over the long run, the avert the aversive ness will go down as they kind of"
"Speaker 5","00;22;35;23","00;23;03;02","learn to better deal with the thing that they've been avoiding potentially. You know, so so that's that's know fairly tangential to the kind of thing we're trying to do here. But, you know, but there's a there's a connection and this very kind of broad sense in that if you can control attention and choices of what to pay attention to can be reinforced, then that's one way you can kind of end up with this."
"Speaker 5","00;23;03;06","00;23;30;06","This kind of thing where a person might not even know, right, that they've developed a strong habit not to pay attention to something. It just becomes very automated, you know, the same way, the same way. Any other behavior can be habits, the repeated reinforcement. But here just that would be a kind of a cognitive action as opposed to a more overt behavioral Very interesting."
"Speaker 1","00;23;30;15","00;23;35;02","Thanks for that question. Response, Adam. And then anyone else who raises their hand."
"Speaker 2","00;23;38;27","00;24;08;25","I guess, to come out of left field and what you were just describing, it seems like that could have some relation to maybe grounding, psychodynamic concepts in terms of if these patterns of attentional approach in avoidance can move from your C matrix to your Imitrex, you can end up finding yourself in these sort of like garden paths of attending and coming to inferences for reasons that you might not even understand."
"Speaker 2","00;24;08;25","00;24;18;13","Just some the way your policy selections of attention have been shaped for conditions that are might be too numerous and varied for you to track. And so."
"Speaker 5","00;24;18;28","00;24;51;23","Yeah, yeah. I mean, there's I mean, we've written we've written a few papers on this or I have with some colleagues. I mean, again, you know, my focus, you know, is largely in terms of emotional and psychiatric condition. Right. And I wouldn't, I would say it's a way of of recasting the sorts of behaviors that psychodynamic approaches are trying to capture, but to do it in a way that doesn't actually posit the existence of these sorts of repressive."
"Speaker 5","00;24;52;07","00;25;19;23","Right. Like, you know, like unconscious like there's no unconscious agents, there's no disarray that's being posited, that's sitting there keeping these things out of awareness. But somehow their physical presence unconsciously. Right. There's nothing like that. Right. It's just a very simple story of having reinforced patterns of attention that, you know, so it's a it's a way of capturing the phenomena that that I think psychodynamic forces are often trying to capture."
"Speaker 5","00;25;19;23","00;25;30;23","But it doesn't posit a lot of the kind of like ontological a lot of the entities that are positive and psychodynamic versus cool."
"Speaker 1","00;25;31;06","00;25;33;29","Steve and then anyone else with Eraserhead or."
"Speaker 2","00;25;34;06","00;25;59;13","On Adam, go yeah. It's like I'm not saying like you're Freudian, but yet you're actually defining like the baby in the bath water rescue, rescuing it, cleaning it up, contextualizing it like why did people have these intuitions to begin with? Like, what was the grains of truth? I'm wondering if through this this can lead to like this kind of a patterns of attending, some of which you're not tracking."
"Speaker 2","00;25;59;29","00;26;35;00","This could be like an account of what would lead to potentially mismatch or discrepancies between things like stated and revealed preferences or things like your actual affective disposition with respect a thing. And then what you think is going on. And then those could potentially go at cross-purposes and ways that could be different, difficult to explicitly model and potentially have like problematic sequelae or not but I'm wondering if like this could lead to like a mismatch or cross purposes of attracting states at different levels."
"Speaker 5","00;26;36;17","00;26;41;15","I mean, I'd probably need more concrete examples to try to figure that out. I mean, that's probably something I'd have to think about more."
"Speaker 2","00;26;41;29","00;27;05;05","I guess one quickly would be like implicit asset tests or something like that. Like you say like a I'm not racist, but then it turns out, no, no, you are. And like if you actually look at the reaction or something like better I am really happy in this relationship. But then like I measure your heart rate variability and its crap or things like that."
"Speaker 2","00;27;05;05","00;27;27;25","I'm just this your actual affective states might end up being different than what you think it is like a lack of self-awareness, like a difficulty coming to coherent modeling of yourself because of these like shaped parts of attention. Like you might miss the mark about you because it was like difficult to see something like that."
"Speaker 5","00;27;27;25","00;27;48;19","I mean, I mean, I would, I would think that, you know, I mean, perhaps there are sort of some instances of the sort of thing you're talking about, but to be captured by the kind of mechanisms that we're talking about here or the kind of tangential extension of that we're talking about here. But I'm not confident that all of them could."
"Speaker 5","00;27;48;19","00;28;23;00","I imagine there's a number of mechanisms that you might feel to describe some of those things, like, you know, implicit. Yeah. Like, I mean, if you're talking about like implicit associations, I'm like like an to right or something or something like that. That's probably my intuition is that's probably different. Yeah. It's more kind of like a like, like a, like a right, which I know Chris has actually been working on models for the past, but right which is, which is probably pretty different from some of the other examples that you were doing."
"Speaker 5","00;28;23;06","00;28;41;10","But, but yeah, I mean, like I said, right after taking a particular example, I probably have to think it through a little more to see think about what sorts of what kind of generative model would be able to reproduce the kind of behavior you're talking about. Or, you know, most likely there would be multiple generative models that could reproduce that."
"Speaker 5","00;28;41;10","00;28;58;19","And then you'd have to do some kind of experiment, right, to do model comparison and see which one actually best account for it. But again, I wouldn't feel really confident, you know, saying what that might look like. You know, this just in the in the very kind of abstract general description I was talking about, you know."
"Speaker 2","00;29;00;13","00;29;01;19","Nice, nice."
"Speaker 1","00;29;02;01","00;29;03;01","Thank you for the response."
"Speaker 4","00;29;03;01","00;29;31;22","Steven yeah. I'll just bring in this. So this point with this model that's now sort of maybe getting into the model in part is I think this interesting with the awareness base is a lot of work with awareness based systems change and looking at awareness. And I like the I'd be interested in your thoughts on how we can move beyond being trapped in a psychology of the individual and, you know, pathology of the individual."
"Speaker 4","00;29;31;22","00;29;57;02","And it moves into the into subjective multi scales like you talk about task but you it also could be used in task types, you know, organizational contexts or groups of people. So I just think that there's because the is not nailed down to like a psychological model the person's thoughts and feelings but more general model of the attentional structure."
"Speaker 4","00;29;57;16","00;30;07;13","It has like a, you know, ability to move beyond between scales and context. So I just think I'll put that out there. There's something that seems quite interesting."
"Speaker 5","00;30;09;17","00;30;12;17","On this or more to. So go ahead."
"Speaker 3","00;30;16;14","00;30;46;03","So I think the utility of models like these is to identify a very specific phenomenon and that namely having conscious access to some content and not others. So I have conscious access to what's in front of me in my visual field at the moment. If I direct my attention around my body, I can bring up all sorts of like I can suddenly become aware of different kinds somatic sensory bits of information."
"Speaker 3","00;30;46;20","00;31;26;15","And all of these have very specific kind of neural signatures, as it were. What we're trying to do is really propose a model at a computational level of analysis and algorithmic level analysis that explains these. And I'm outside of that. I'm not sure to what extent actually talking about awareness into subjective awareness is it's all the same thing as talking about awareness as someone who works in like neuroscience of consciousness, for example."
"Speaker 3","00;31;27;04","00;31;30;18","They might be, but I don't see any evidence that they are."
"Speaker 1","00;31;33;08","00;31;42;15","Pretty interesting because it's in the title of the paper. So many people might think of it differently as I mean, it's just an interesting question right?"
"Speaker 5","00;31;43;25","00;31;45;15","Sorry, what's in the title of the paper?"
"Speaker 1","00;31;46;05","00;31;52;00","Just the idea that the visual consciousness is involved."
"Speaker 5","00;31;54;22","00;32;21;16","Well, but I mean, but again, I mean, this is a model of a particular visual consciousness that's right into it. It's meant to account for things that are seen in the visual consciousness literature. You know, there is the structure is abstract enough that we would and we say this of the discussion that it ought to apply to faces of having access for one set of information versus another in other domains."
"Speaker 5","00;32;21;24","00;32;56;23","Like an auditory domain or something that I've been working on with a bunch of colleagues that you library where I am trying to see if the same sort of thing and it looks like it's present in the receptive domain, for example, you know, so so I think it's right to say that we would we would hope anyway that it's abstract enough that it can account for any any piece of information that you either gain access to or not when it's being represented somewhere."
"Speaker 5","00;32;56;25","00;33;20;18","So. Right. So whether it's, you know, right now as I'm talking to you, I'm not necessarily aware of what my heart's doing, but now I choose to pay attention to it and all of a sudden I can kind of feel that it's beating at a certain rate. I believe I believe that I that I feel I wasn't conscious of that before, despite the fact that my brain was unconscious, attracting, you know, what my heart was doing that whole time."
"Speaker 5","00;33;21;03","00;33;45;15","Right. So it could apply to being aware or not aware of any stimulus. So, I mean, to the only to the extent that when we say something about intersubjective awareness, only to the extent that that means something about a piece of information that, you know, before I was attending to it, I didn't know it was there. But now that I'm paying attention to it, that I do."
"Speaker 5","00;33;45;15","00;34;15;07","So, for example, like if I happen to notice that a person's smiling or something like that, even though they were smiling at me the whole time, maybe my brain has picked up on the fact that they were smiling. But I wasn't aware of it until I focus my attention on it or something like that. Right. Or even maybe more abstract than that, when my brain sort of had unconsciously detected the smile, there might even have been some further inference that that means something about them being happy."
"Speaker 5","00;34;15;23","00;34;36;17","Right? So so there might even be a case where I either do or do not gain access to this unconscious inference or this posterior belief that the person is more likely happier than unhappy or something like that. Right. But but I mean, these are sorts of cases that would have to be tested in their own in their own right."
"Speaker 5","00;34;36;27","00;34;46;03","My broad point is just that it's an abstract structure where all it is meant to account for is when your brain is representing something and you either become aware of it or not."
"Speaker 3","00;34;48;02","00;35;18;20","I mean, I mean, if I could just kind of build on that slightly. So I think one, it's very tempting when we've got computational models that are relatively when we've got lots of equations sitting in front of us, the kind of thing that I think it's easy to get an illusion of rigor where there is none the thing that makes these models meaningful is that we can we're tracking some real world phenomenon in terms of the abstract model structure."
"Speaker 3","00;35;18;28","00;35;48;01","It may be the case that say you have group dynamics where there is some group that some aspects of that maybe the individual behavior of individuals within a group evolves that really quick time scale and then the decision that group decision making evolves at a slower timescale. You may be able you you could in principle set a two level percentage of a Markov decision process to this as a model of that behavior."
"Speaker 3","00;35;48;23","00;36;12;05","But that would be very, very deep. I think even in that case, even when we're sitting in the same model, I don't think that those are at all the same phenomenon, although there may be similarities across them. I would be extremely resistant to calling one visual awareness or that a group as visual awareness not interesting."
"Speaker 1","00;36;12;05","00;36;28;19","And of course, a parallel to be in the ants world. Is there a colony awareness or a single six legged ant awareness, or how should we think about distributed systems? And aren't we all kind of just distributed systems all the way down? So Adam and then Steven."
"Speaker 2","00;36;34;27","00;37;05;06","So this would be related to, I guess, different types of interests, objective or interests objective awareness that you might build these a model for. I recently uploaded a preprint after some conversations with people from the Brain Institute at Chapman University, basically trying to do the beginnings of like an active inference account of lab phenomena and readiness potentials that are a little bit less deflationary with respect to volition and conscious causation."
"Speaker 2","00;37;05;26","00;37;52;21","And so in essence, I was thinking of like the actual moving your hand being like an accumulation of model evidence, model evidence with respect to appropriate receptive pose. And there might be some sort of like conjunction of like also like like whether or not you're like will or feeling of urge was part of it. You could think of that as like an inference over your affective state and that if these things are and what kind of alignments could help to explain whether you're aware of readiness, potential activity, or whether this awareness is actually feeding back and contributing to it, and so I feel like your model could potentially provide like a very precise contextualization of"
"Speaker 2","00;37;52;21","00;37;58;15","this really subtle what's going on then I would like to collaborate."
"Speaker 5","00;37;58;29","00;38;25;07","So and so I mean, this just just again, just to make it really maybe that could be the case. I have no idea. But it could only potentially be the case if what you're talking about, right? Like what you're motivated to do or what you're in the process of about being about to do or whatever aspect of action or action tendency or anything like that."
"Speaker 5","00;38;26;02","00;38;59;12","The only way this could apply is if you think that that information about what your what you're motivated to do or something like that, whatever it is, and only if it's the case, do you think that is a represented piece of information that you can attend to or not? And then you could sort of get into the higher kind of people's deeper temporal level of the model that would inform verbal reporting and sort of other goal directed users."
"Speaker 5","00;39;00;09","00;39;15;18","So would it only be the case? I guess my point is this is if the representation associated with action that you're talking about is in some sense formally equivalent to a representation of something visual that that you can attend to."
"Speaker 2","00;39;18;21","00;39;35;08","That makes sense. So it's so the preprint is like it's like a three, I think like a three page more of a promissory note. But if I could pick your brain later about like if you think there's like a way we could actually get some like empirical traction of like nailing down the specifics along the lines or something."
"Speaker 5","00;39;36;07","00;39;58;25","Looking I mean, if you have a task and that task involves people paying attention to the aspect of action that you're talking about, then in principle and you could have people, you could have people, you know, in some sense sue them or prime them or something like that, that that engages that sort of action bias or action motivation."
"Speaker 5","00;39;59;26","00;40;05;14","And again, you can they can either attend to it or not or report on it or not in that case. Yes. But otherwise probably not."
"Speaker 2","00;40;06;05","00;40;22;22","It's a little tricky, I think, in terms of like the action that would be attended to would be of a couple varieties, but none of them, few of them would be directly observable. So it's like you could say like it's the action of the neural activity in terms of like the ramping activity, like you have access to that."
"Speaker 2","00;40;22;22","00;40;54;16","But the I was thinking it could also be like the action of like mental acts and like rehearsing, like imagining in a kind of sophisticated affective inference that's like am I going to move my hand or not? What would that be like? And then that being contributing to that signal. But then we're like actual awareness of this like fictive meant the strict of action could be part of what would contribute to whether or not you feel ownership of it."
"Speaker 2","00;40;54;16","00;41;13;00","Like, that's interesting. Like some people don't show readiness potentially, so they just act. Other people do like schizophrenic patients. They tend not to show readiness potentials before they spontaneously raise their hand. But it would be hard to get this. Some reaction is internal. And so I don't know what you do with that."
"Speaker 5","00;41;13;29","00;41;29;11","Yeah. It just seems it just seems like you have to have some kind of behavioral readout that can be fit to do or not to to a model of this to be able to say. And this explains the ability to consciously report on it or not. Right."
"Speaker 2","00;41;30;02","00;41;48;03","So I guess could you use like like right before that leading to like the action there tends to be like it starts out like more bilateral and then the repetition tends to go lateral and then the hand moves could you use like that sort of signal as the readout like."
"Speaker 5","00;41;49;26","00;42;22;21","So in principle, you can use, you know, you can set models to neural like neural activity. I mean, you can set models to to anything that the generative model generates but but I'm not necessarily all that confident that you'd be able to justify the claim that because the because the model in one case generates you know, like a readiness potential signal that that has anything to do with having conscious access to something."
"Speaker 2","00;42;23;11","00;42;36;25","And you have the other problem, like if you're using like the ensemble activity, it's still the interpretation like awareness of what like what are we even talking about with awareness that the whole point is to try to like contextualize what those signals mean. And so."
"Speaker 5","00;42;37;00","00;43;17;04","Yeah, yeah. I mean, in the majority of cases, you know, either directly or indirectly, you know, like verbal or recourse. Right. Is still kind of a gold standard for whether someone has access to something. Right. Even in no report paradigms, you're still later right, asking them to report what they were experiencing at the time. So it's I mean, yeah, the issue is that in some sense all kind of supportable or accepted sort of evidence for being previously aware of something is is always ultimately and Chris, you can correct me, evidence is wrong."
"Speaker 5","00;43;17;04","00;43;24;20","But but I mean, I think that it always ultimately comes down to a verbal report or some reliable correlate of verbal report."
"Speaker 3","00;43;25;10","00;43;49;01","Whether or I agree with that. So I think I'm not an expert in our quote paradigms, but to my to my knowledge, all of them. The reason we trust our paradigms is because our measure whether that is a particular mode of eye tracking or it is just like incidental memory afterwards, all of those things correlate really, really well with report."
"Speaker 3","00;43;49;01","00;44;04;23","And that's the thing that kind of like makes us trust them as measures of conscious access, independent of report, yeah. I think it's always report to foundational unless we have really, really good evidence. Otherwise, I think we have to take them kind of at face value."
"Speaker 1","00;44;06;16","00;44;12;20","Who will return to the stack. So blue and then Stephen and then anyone else who raises their hands."
"Speaker 6","00;44;15;18","00;44;39;05","So and I'm always brings me into this like metaphysical like thoughts whenever he talks. And I just was wondering you know, in terms of this like visual model, there's you hear the expression that people see what they want to see. Right? And so have you thought about maybe testing like, you know, like there's the idea of paying attention to something."
"Speaker 6","00;44;39;11","00;44;57;04","And so we thought about testing whether, you know, people can deceive themselves in this visual process, right? Like some self-deception or even like the you hear like the power of manifestation. Like can people bring into their awareness something because they simply want it to be there? I mean, have you thought about this or testing the model in this way?"
"Speaker 3","00;44;58;08","00;45;35;05","So I mean, you go to figure maybe scroll down. Is it which one? So we have we have a actually, I'm not sure. So that's the piece. Yeah. That the tax, the extended taxonomy. So we start with this kind of forward taxonomy between which Don proposed along with some other colleagues of the kind of factors underlying whether you'll have conscious access to a stimulus and you kind of broke it down into whether attention was weak or adds at present or absence at all, whether kind of this how strong the signal strength was with the street, weak or strong."
"Speaker 3","00;45;35;22","00;46;13;14","And then we extended this by adding in prior expectations. So the extent to which you expect a stimulus to appear and there is now like one of the big motivations this work is that there is an enormous body of work now showing that expectation does play a fairly fundamental role, I think, in determining the contents of visual awareness so as for whether you can voluntarily bring something into awareness, I'm not the answer is I think that's more to do with attention, I suspect."
"Speaker 3","00;46;13;14","00;46;49;03","But say, for example, if you are looking at a by stable image, you can attend to one part of that image and then have the key is it's a I it's called the neck cube. You can have the cube flip versus if you attend to another part it'll flip back and you can do kind of similar deliberate moves of attention with a lot of bias table images so also I think there's some really cool there is some interesting kind of back to the expectation day and expecting seeing what you expect to see belongs."
"Speaker 3","00;46;49;03","00;47;15;28","That depends upon how strong your bottom up evidence is if you are much more likely. So there are paradigms that kind of distract people but basically condition them into expecting a stimulus to appear and you can get kind of accidental hallucinate or you can basically induce people to work what is essentially a hallucination in those cases or mistakenly report something that we know is a fact."
"Speaker 3","00;47;16;03","00;47;33;06","The experimental is experimental, so they want that. I think there are two examples that what I have in mind at the moment is a really clever set of studies by Zhang Maru. But I know, Ryan, that maybe you can talk about this there's also a lot of work on Conditions Illuminations from a group at Yale who I know you collaborate with."
"Speaker 5","00;47;34;08","00;47;56;17","Yeah. So yeah, that was, that was something I was actually going to bring up is and this is, this is not. Yeah. Because I mean, I agree with you guys and in most cases I think it's going to have to do with some kind of like motivated selective attention that kind of like biases say different possible interpretations that you have a series of mistakes for the three to the first one."
"Speaker 5","00;47;56;17","00;48;25;21","Well, but, but yeah, definitely you can have these expectation effects, although I don't necessarily think of those as being voluntary. Right. I'm not sure that like selective attention is definitely a kind of controllable cognitive action, whereas shifting prior expectations are less important. But that can be cast that way. But but priors definitely have an influence, right on what your plus year is over."
"Speaker 5","00;48;25;21","00;49;03;15","States are given some stimulus, especially like for someone the stimulus strength is fairly low or noisy, you know, so so some of the work that our powers and his group at Yale and on that I've been we've been collaborating to build active inference models for the stuff is yeah these sorts of conditions place nation paradigms in people psychosis so the way these paradigms work is that you you start out always showing people a white ass and that is always coincident with a tone that appears in some white noise and so on."
"Speaker 5","00;49;03;15","00;49;29;24","The first several trials there's a fairly strong tone but plays in the white noise every time they hear a light or everytime I see a light and it's threshold so that they would perceive that tone 75% of the time. And then, and then after several of those trials and there starts to be cases where the the tone is still present but it's weaker."
"Speaker 5","00;49;29;24","00;49;53;28","So they only detected 50 or 25% of the time. And then there are trials where the light comes on but no telling is played and there's just white noise. And what, what they have found is that people with psychosis have a higher probability of recording, hearing tones when the light shows up, even when there was no tone. So this is kind of expected."
"Speaker 5","00;49;53;28","00;50;34;14","So they build up this expectation to hear a tone and never see the light and somehow there's prior expectation that those prior expectations that the tone will be there have a stronger influence over whether they hallucinate the tone or not. That influence is stronger in people that have hallucinations than in people that don't have those missions, which has kind of led to this idea that what's what's going, you know, part of the computational issue and people with psychosis that are more likely to have less nations is that prior expectations are in some way really precise and therefore are going to dominate perception."
"Speaker 5","00;50;35;14","00;50;58;16","And that could be that could be either because the prior expectations themselves are really precise or because beliefs about the actual sensory signal are those are believed to be very imprecise. But in either case, that relative precisions are supposed to our thoughts are going to favor prior expectations and psychosis to a greater degree than people without psychosis."
"Speaker 1","00;50;59;11","00;50;59;28","Thank you."
"Speaker 6","00;51;00;18","00;51;01;23","Can I just follow up really quick?"
"Speaker 2","00;51;02;01","00;51;02;10","Yep."
"Speaker 5","00;51;02;19","00;51;02;28","Yeah."
"Speaker 6","00;51;03;09","00;51;27;06","So it's interesting that you brought the auditory thing into this, but the auditory hallucinations and I wonder if it's a visual cortex thing or if it's involved more with the auditory cortex. Because even when Chris was talking, you know, you think about like people have seen like when you have two things played simultaneously, auditory tracts that like it's like listen for the phone number and then you hear the phone number."
"Speaker 6","00;51;27;06","00;51;45;07","But then if you're not listening for the phone number, you're hearing something else. So it's interesting that that the auditory system, like the selective attention in the auditory tract really is is much more apparent, like where you see the blue dress versus the white dress or the gold dress or whatever color it was like the two dresses is not so selective."
"Speaker 6","00;51;45;07","00;51;52;16","It's like, look for the blue dress or look for the white dress. If you set up that expectation in the visual system, it's not as prevalent. I think."
"Speaker 5","00;51;54;08","00;52;18;23","Yeah. I mean, I will agree, it was definitely harder to switch the interpretation from the blue to the yellow. When I've tried that, I can I can get myself to do it, but it's way more ethical, right? And yeah, I mean, I don't know if you have any ideas about why exactly that would that would this is of like, I don't know, binocular rivalry and things like that."
"Speaker 5","00;52;18;23","00;52;32;06","In those cases, I think there are cases where I think selective attention can play a bigger role like a network negative, for example, that's maybe more analogous to the kind of like multi channel auditory input."
"Speaker 3","00;52;32;27","00;53;04;12","I think it just depends on how you set the task up. I'm not sure if the comparison is really a fair one, I suppose. I think you can vary. I think you definitely can set up a lot of expectations, play a huge role in the visual system. I think it's one thing to say whether you have voluntary control or whether those things command the purview of like voluntary attention is another thing but I still think there are lots of cases depending on how you set up the problems."
"Speaker 3","00;53;04;12","00;53;28;09","I think binocular rivalries, a good one, or even something like actually literally like where you move your eyes I know that sounds trivial, but whether your eyes are moving around a page or not kind of determined determines some different types of visual illusions. So if you think about maybe the illusion isn't even the right word, but what's the artwork?"
"Speaker 3","00;53;28;15","00;53;34;03","Sorry, we're working on a project about this right now. What's it called again, Tom Papa's paper on this run to remember it with trucks elevating."
"Speaker 5","00;53;34;15","00;53;36;21","Yeah, I hear yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;53;36;22","00;53;47;27","If you Google trucks. Look, I think I think that's a really powerful example of why I just kind of selective attention has a really major role on whether you perceive something is present or absent."
"Speaker 3","00;53;51;01","00;53;51;08","There."
"Speaker 1","00;53;51;27","00;54;08;21","Yep, very interesting. It's almost like there's ambiguous and non ambiguous stimuli in different domains and maybe even interpret personal variation. One person being really good at picking up on something subtle in one domain or not. So we'll do Steven, then Dean, then Adam."
"Speaker 4","00;54;11;08","00;54;29;17","I think this ties in actually to what we was mentioning earlier about, you know, when you scale things up and I agree with what you're saying when you scale things up, it may be useful to think about how someone facilitates the attention of people in a group and how you take them and how they you think about taking their attention."
"Speaker 4","00;54;29;17","00;54;52;15","It doesn't mean that whatever they consciously have into subject to put together is now read by the model. So its usefulness may be in how people's attention is taken. And I think it ties to this hypnosis thing as well because I think your model speaks to top down and bottom up happen at different level or different scales because often we think top down."
"Speaker 4","00;54;52;15","00;55;18;25","We think executive function and like executive function is telling me what I think but like you say, you can have a subconscious level of trying to think what something is, even if it's in the subconscious, you can. And hypnosis is doing that hypnosis is playing the game with someone. So they, they or with these optical illusions, you say to someone this you're looking at this cube from above or below and it flips."
"Speaker 4","00;55;19;05","00;55;35;00","But it's not that you you're being told it's this type of cube and that you executive function is pushing it. It's still top down but it's it's happening at a a more subconscious what we might call a subconscious level. And I think that's quite interesting."
"Speaker 3","00;55;35;24","00;56;11;12","So it's I could just speak to that. I think there are a couple of things going on there. So I would talk about executive function. Well, I mean, I think it one thing that this is a bit of a trite point, but top down is a very ambiguous term I think. What where so you can mean kind of that can mean anything basically like recurrent loops from higher call from causes that are higher up the cortical hierarchy to something like top down the like voluntary control of attention via executive like Frontier Primal Networks or something like that."
"Speaker 3","00;56;12;21","00;56;36;20","So those are just different, different phenomena I think in our model, control of attention would presumably be apt if if we were to build a model of this would be at this you you would put the dorsal attention network at the second flow of time scales. The model, I think maybe Ryan, you can we can speak this as well."
"Speaker 3","00;56;36;20","00;56;37;28","I haven't really thought about this much."
"Speaker 5","00;56;39;19","00;56;50;09","I would have been a little more like executive control that worked for, I guess what we're about a little bit more what I would have thought about this kind of stuff."
"Speaker 3","00;56;50;09","00;56;52;24","But yeah, you're probably right."
"Speaker 5","00;56;53;15","00;57;21;28","I mean, visual I mean visual attention, right? I mean, obviously the dorsal attention network is kind of defined or originally like specifically to like visual attention and things like that or quote unquote top down visual attention. But in terms of the kind of directing visual attention on a goal directed way that I think I think that would be more like the people that work with violence."
"Speaker 5","00;57;21;28","00;57;22;09","Although."
"Speaker 3","00;57;23;06","00;57;56;01","I mean, on the hallucination point, I did my undergrad at Macquarie University and they have a whole hallucination group there and within the cognitive science department and so I, I just feel like acutely aware of the fact I don't know anything about it. And it's also an extremely complicated phenomenon. You can use hallucination to like as a model of various delusions like you can induce is a cold like mirror basically like mirror agnosia where you don't no longer recognize yourself mirror cells like noses or something, you no longer recognize yourself in the mirror."
"Speaker 3","00;57;56;09","00;58;13;27","Like it's a really powerful tool, but I have absolutely no idea how it works and so I'd be very kind of I think it's very tempting as kind of modelers and theorists to kind of go into various experimentalist domains like, hey, here's how my overarching framework explains the whole thing."
"Speaker 3","00;58;16;21","00;58;27;09","And I kind of want to resist that. I know a little bit about visual consciousness and how expectation all that stuff works there, but hallucination is such a hairy topic. I just don't know."
"Speaker 5","00;58;28;14","00;58;56;06","Yeah, I mean, I would also I would also say, I mean, the thing, I mean, so there's a few different things I've been brought up here, right? But I mean, in terms of it's not it's not clear, for example, the kind of auditory hallucinations story that I was talking about earlier with in terms of having relatively more precise prior expectations, you know, creating a stronger sense tendency for auditory hallucinations."
"Speaker 5","00;58;56;20","00;59;20;12","And it's not it's not clear at all that that kind of story mechanistically is generalizes to other domains. So, I mean, actually, in the in the visual domain, there's this whole other body of work where it looks like people that have delusions, again, as part of a sort of as part of psychosis right. Actually. So the opposite weighting in the visual system, right."
"Speaker 5","00;59;20;12","00;59;49;25","So where they actually assign too much precision to low level bottom up sense of bottom up visual signals, you know, so they end up in these interesting cases where they end up on and feel like an eye tracking. They end up doing people with delusions end up actually or psychosis. Schizophrenia end up feeling better at certain tasks than healthy people, but worse at others."
"Speaker 5","00;59;50;07","01;00;24;06","So like one example of this is if you have people just kind of try to follow this visual tracking for a little kind of moving target, then if that target switches directions really quickly, then the people with psychosis end up actually following following it better than healthy people, because healthy people kind of continue to follow it for a little bit after the turn and they kind of predict a direction, right?"
"Speaker 5","01;00;24;06","01;00;47;07","So prior expectations are kind of playing a stronger role, and so they actually do a little better. Whereas if instead you have something where the where the target temporarily kind of moves behind some kind of barrier, then healthy people do better. Whereas people with schizophrenia kind of lose it because prior expectations don't do enough to keep them kind of following what the trajectory would have been."
"Speaker 5","01;00;47;07","01;01;06;01","Right as it goes behind the wheel. And there's there's lots of other cases on, for instance, in the proprioceptive domain where people talk about the same kind of thing, where people with schizophrenia actually do better with things like for smashing illusions and stuff. Yeah. Or smashing tasks."
"Speaker 5","01;01;08;07","01;01;35;10","And I mean there's more to the story there. But, but, but to try to link that to like delusions about agency and things like that. So I guess general point being, but the way that a kind of computational mechanism is, you know, looks like it happens in one say sensory domain can still operate very differently in the other sensory domain even in the same in the same disorder."
"Speaker 5","01;01;35;12","01;02;06;02","Right in the context of the same psychosis. So so these things don't don't necessarily they shouldn't be expected to generalize across across domains as as 11 points the other the other point was, you know, in relation to things like hypnosis, which I don't know a lot about, as part of a textbook chapter, I was asked to write a paragraph or two on hypnosis."
"Speaker 5","01;02;06;02","01;02;33;01","So I kind of what kind of I wonder for a little bit and it's actually pretty messy. They're very different. There are multiple different theories about hypnosis work and I mean, one of them, you know, can relate to this idea of that, you know, if if the hypnotist repeatedly gets suggestions that are set up such that they will be confirmed."
"Speaker 5","01;02;33;01","01;02;51;12","Right. So it's like hold out. You're the hypnotist, hold out your arms. And then he says your arms are going to start to feel heavy and then they'll start to fall. Right. Obviously, anybody who holds out their arms still eventually start to feel heavier and heavier and they'll start to drop just as a result of your muscles. You're feeling the muscles getting tired, right?"
"Speaker 5","01;02;51;19","01;03;27;26","So if you do a number of those things and the kind of things the hypnotist, the predictions made by the hypnotist are confirmed, then it could be that you're just coming to assign a really high reliability to whatever the hypnosis says. Right. So so in that case, if if the hypnotist just claims to be assigned really high precision, then you can just prior expectations adjust for our expectations in a way that just kind of dominate or can end up having a much stronger influence on what you do and that's that's kind of 11 idea."
"Speaker 5","01;03;27;26","01;03;55;16","But again, there's there's several other theories of hypnosis. I just have to do with kind of like conforming to it. And official roles and things like that. They are told to they are kind of told to do. And I mean, anyway, so I wouldn't necessarily feel all that confident saying much about about how this relates to hypnosis, other than that in a broad sense, it can involve manipulating sort of tricky ways of manipulating our expectations and other in other people."
"Speaker 5","01;03;55;16","01;03;57;10","But again, I mean, even that is pretty speculative."
"Speaker 3","01;03;58;13","01;04;23;03","I mean, so if I could just quickly throw something in another complicating factor. So even within visual the visual system having a strong prior in one domain or doesn't generalize to others, there's this really great paper that just came that came out, I think last year in cognition where they looked at representational momentum, meaning images and goodness. I think it was one other I think was illusory contours."
"Speaker 3","01;04;23;03","01;04;48;27","And they had one other top down expectation kind of paradigm. And there were large individual differences between all of them. And they'll also large individual differences in kind of the effect of prior expectation across those different tasks. So I think there's just kind of a lot of complicating factor, many moving parts and a lot of this stuff that we have to deal with when we talk about these things."
"Speaker 1","01;04;50;11","01;04;55;28","OK, we're going to return to the stack and go to Dean and then a question from the chat, then Adam."
"Speaker 2","01;04;57;19","01;05;19;10","So I'll go back and be ambiguous. So when I was looking at your diagrams and one of the things that really I wanted to ask this question that we ran out of time last week, do you think we can say that if a person says I see this or I do not see that, see, that's the OR yes or no."
"Speaker 2","01;05;20;12","01;05;44;11","Can we can we apply an idea that there is a certain amount of acceptance and a certain amount of letting go and I kind of bundle that under we reconcile? Or is it something completely different? I mean, how do you how do you look at this now when a person's actually looking at something and going, OK, I do not see the box?"
"Speaker 2","01;05;44;18","01;05;49;23","Is it just is it that simple? That's a simple yes no. Or do you think there's something more built into it?"
"Speaker 3","01;05;52;11","01;06;17;08","So how to could there is a whole cottage industry. Cottage industry. I thought college industry might even be an understatement. On how to collect verbal reports and the proper ways of doing it. So there's like a perceptual awareness scale where you in some sense have a description of the content. See, I didn't see anything I maybe saw something, but there was no specific content."
"Speaker 3","01;06;17;08","01;06;38;10","Like you have a vague feeling you saw something, but it was a bit blurry, and then you had like a full vivid experience. That's one way you can have people place bets. That's another way you can. People do confidence ratings. Lately, there's been some incredibly clever work. Basically looking at. So just give a shout out to people who I work I really admire, like Hawk one."
"Speaker 3","01;06;38;10","01;07;16;06","Leo and Megan Peters have a really great paper in life. Where they basically show that people seem to have optimal in the sense of like pays optimal introspective access to their own performance. So basically when they are, they will. People never behave correctly, but without kind of knowing that they behave correctly, as it were. If you do these like very tightly controlled experimental situations, so yeah, I think maybe I was a bit flippant before when I said you have to take reports as foundational."
"Speaker 3","01;07;16;06","01;07;25;26","I stand by that statement. But there is like years and years and years of like careful Psychophysics has gone into being like, yeah, these things are reliable."
"Speaker 3","01;07;28;07","01;07;58;21","And basically it comes down to I wouldn't believe some if, if someone said, yeah, I see something, but they were getting like 61, like 50% on a false choice task about the orientation of Google Patch, but they were claiming no, I wouldn't believe them. Generally speaking, you would expect if you see something your performance should also go up that is not to say, however, that you can't have thought increased performance without awareness."
"Speaker 3","01;07;58;21","01;08;07;17","There is some convincing evidence showing that those two things dissociate and that's kind of what we were trying to show here. Right, right. Yeah. OK, so hopefully that's the question."
"Speaker 2","01;08;08;00","01;08;08;17","Yeah, it does."
"Speaker 1","01;08;08;29","01;08;46;18","Nice. Yeah, I noticed on this extended taxonomy, the bottom, right? It's like consistent prior high attention, strong signal. It's the perfect storm and then it's 100% seen. 100% correct. And then again, kind of taking it loosely mapping to our experiences with other attention phenomena. Like if you're sure about it, of course, the way that you tuned prior or inconsistent prior, these are variables that are in the model so people can play around this isn't like a specific yes no, but it just examples of how rich the phase space is in terms of what the model can do and what it can capture."
"Speaker 1","01;08;47;02","01;09;07;07","So here's the question from the chat and then it will go to Adam. So the question from the chat is any thought about the possibility of using this model to investigate lucid dreaming related phenomena? Like the failure of implicit metacognition while dreaming? Thank you so how about dreaming or lucid dreaming?"
"Speaker 3","01;09;08;15","01;09;20;07","That's not is super interesting. I mean, I don't think this model captures that at all except in like a very in like a computational sense. Like, I don't know what task would be modeling specifically, but like we can for being a bit metaphorical about it."
"Speaker 3","01;09;23;22","01;09;51;20","So presumably, I don't know anything about lucid dreaming. I presume it's a case where basically you are dreaming. So you have kind of you're not just asleep, you have kind of a experience that goes along with it. And also you are aware of the fact that you are dreaming that's really interesting. I think it has to come back to the I don't know how one would capture metacognition in this framework."
"Speaker 3","01;09;51;29","01;10;04;02","I think that's one thing to say. I don't know what it would be. Maybe. Ryan, you have some thoughts on this but it would relate to basically how how one thinks about metacognition in these deep temporal models."
"Speaker 5","01;10;07;05","01;10;33;01","Yeah, I mean, I mean, I mean, metacognition in and of itself comes in a bunch of different flavors, right? I mean, so there is kind of you know, beliefs about how good your memory is, for example. Right. This metacognition, it's you know, it's like beliefs about your beliefs. Or beliefs about patterns and your assumption. Or there's a bunch of bunch of different types of metacognition, right?"
"Speaker 5","01;10;33;02","01;11;09;02","This is sort of beliefs or operations over representations of your own cognitive processes. So I mean, the tricky part is that you kind of have to have a higher level that's treating what you chose to do in terms of a cognitive, voluntary cognitive process that observes that and then infers something about it. And the way that that ends up influencing the, the, the cognitive the cognitive operational level."
"Speaker 5","01;11;09;02","01;11;29;21","So right. The way that the higher metacognitive level ends up setting priors on the lower level, I'm not sure the right way to think about that. I mean, you'd have to look at literature on the way metacognition affects performance on cognitive tasks, which I'm not. I'm definitely not."
"Speaker 3","01;11;29;22","01;11;56;28","It's one thing to say, just very briefly, it would just be in the discussion section of a paper. We discuss alternative models. I think probably the model that's closest allies in the literature would be Steve Fleming's Higher. The State Space Model. And I think that he explicitly discusses ignition related phenomena and metacognitive inference is about the presence or absence of stimuli."
"Speaker 3","01;11;56;28","01;12;02;22","So I would say if you're interested in that kind of stuff and how to think about it in the basic framework, look, that's a really great paper yeah."
"Speaker 5","01;12;02;22","01;12;39;14","I mean, another, another one I mean that comes to mind I know is that there's a paper by where the first author is plus seven from 2016 where he talks about the way you can apply active inference models to model homeostatic and allostatic control processes. So basically like anticipating, for example, that your temperature is going to drop and therefore increasing temperature body temperature a little in advance so that when it subsequently drops, we stay in a within that kind of stressful homeostatic range."
"Speaker 5","01;12;40;00","01;13;31;08","And I'm just using temperature here as an arbitrary example of any kind of variable internal bodily variable like glucose levels or my levels or anything like that. But they do talk about this level, a metacognitive level that you can add above the allostatic regulation level that more or less tracks the efficacy or the success of the allostatic level and how if the allostatic level repeatedly fails to keep homeostatic variables or bodily variables within homeostatic ranges, then the higher level can basically infer that outstations will fail and they shall have that and possibly certain sorts of symptoms of depression."
"Speaker 5","01;13;31;08","01;13;46;02","And you have low beliefs about the efficacy of your own allostatic processes. And so I mean that's a, that's a paper that I recommend looking at one example of the way that you might might apply one type of metacognition on top of the Bayesian."
"Speaker 3","01;13;47;00","01;14;00;22","I also just remember the paper came out yesterday, I shared I sorry, I forgot about this. I just read it on Twitter yesterday. If you want to look, it came out of Mike Allen's group that although I forgot the first author's name, I'm really sorry about that."
"Speaker 3","01;14;02;23","01;14;23;21","But they explicitly discuss like predictive processing and active inference theories of consciousness in relation to introspection and metacognition, and they have a whole discussion of this type of thing. So it's interesting. Maybe it's like check my Twitter page or Mike Allen's to a page sounds good."
"Speaker 1","01;14;24;13","01;14;31;29","We'll go to Adam and then anyone else who raises their hands all right."
"Speaker 2","01;14;33;28","01;15;16;08","Perhaps tying a few of these things together. I was wondering if, like respect to hallucinations and psychosis and delusions if maybe some of it you could essentially model it in terms of not having access to mental acts. So which might have associated efforts, copies that could potentially be adjusting precision and also having different components of the Associate Mental Act, which you may or may not attribute to some aspects of introspective inference that could lead to senses of like ruling or ownership."
"Speaker 2","01;15;16;23","01;16;03;03","But then by not having access this potentially where the access itself of the action generation could basically adjust what you're how you're attributing what sense you're making of the associated perceptual events. So it's like I said, so it's like if you're talking to yourself in thought or something like, like, like thought is in her speech, like, for God's sake, let's talk about like, well, if you don't have access to like the generation part and for some reason, I don't know how much give me separated, but then like the voice might just appear to you in a way where you don't have a sense of ownership if there's not like the right type of like maybe"
"Speaker 2","01;16;03;03","01;16;11;03","intercept of coupling to the general generation process or just like the lack of metacognition to contextualize it. That was."
"Speaker 3","01;16;11;11","01;16;12;25","Yeah, so I really want to."
"Speaker 5","01;16;12;25","01;16;42;18","Say, I mean, one thing and one thing to keep in mind here is this is not the sort of thing that you're talking about when people have sort of different experiences of or whether a different contents and experience. I mean, basically that's where you're talking about different contents of that can be an experience. Those, those are just in a model like this going to amount to different sorts of state spaces that you can infer plus areas over, right?"
"Speaker 5","01;16;43;03","01;17;07;11","So you can have beliefs about how much ownership you have over your body or you can have beliefs about something going on in your body in a receptive way. And all of those things are just going to be you're going to have some sort of afferent signal and you're going to have some prior expectations, obviously, and then you're going to infer some posterior over whatever the contents are of the thing in question."
"Speaker 5","01;17;07;29","01;17;38;15","Right? So so anything along the lines of what is the, what is the content of one thing versus another is just going to amount to a particular level and a model that for posteriors over particular contents. Right? So none of that is going to have to do directly with our model other than the fact that given posteriors over any content and if our model were applicable to that, you could just treat those contents as the lower level."
"Speaker 5","01;17;38;28","01;18;19;06","Right? So you'd have influence over some content. And then our model would say something about the processes that make that content conscious or not. Right? Or consciously accessible or not. So so the only thing that our model might be able to say is if you swap out the square versus squares versus lines in our model, right? Whatever the beliefs are at the lower level and we sort that out with representations of some of their content, whatever, whatever it is you're interested in, you know, something about the body or something about what you know, what pattern, it's what sequence of speech, right?"
"Speaker 5","01;18;19;07","01;18;37;07","Or your name or anything like that. Right? What, what word you just heard. And you know, what that out as the content of the lower level and our model might be able to say something about the processes that determine whether you whether those comments accessible or not. But beyond that our model doesn't have much is that."
"Speaker 3","01;18;38;03","01;19;06;06","Yeah. I mean it's I could say something on that as well. I, I really like the idea. I think just along similar lines to Ryan because it just casts like decisions about ownership is just having access to some content or another. And so for me, like the essence of any type of conscious access or awareness process is basically whether it's integrated into this temporally deep representation and in doing so available to all of these sub processes."
"Speaker 3","01;19;06;06","01;19;27;05","Our global workspace theory and so I think this kind of relating this to kind of the metacognitive point, I think this is actually a spot where maybe this is a difference between our theory versus an active inference theory that gave an explicit role to metacognition."
"Speaker 3","01;19;29;16","01;19;46;05","So to me, it's just the fact that you can be aware that it is, you're aware of it because it's integrated into this representation, right? Whereas maybe a higher order person be. No, you have to also infer that you are seeing it or that I am seeing it or something like that."
"Speaker 3","01;19;49;05","01;20;13;21","And so I I think there's is actually like really interesting empirical questions. That's all I can say. But I hope that we can kind of, I don't know, maybe it would be nice to see a discussion of kind of active inference theories of visual awareness, of metacognition versus active inference, theories of like visual awareness in general. Yeah, I know."
"Speaker 3","01;20;13;28","01;20;17;27","I know you've written a lot about kind of different theories of consciousness. And I'm sorry, I was giving thoughts about that."
"Speaker 5","01;20;21;18","01;20;56;29","I mean, I know that, you know, there's this preprint by the first the first author is I'm a Smith Lars I can remember this is first. That's the first thing. But, but, but there's less than a Smith that that does propose a type of model of metacognition. There's in there's attention works a little differently than ours. But essentially you do have a second level that controls the decision parameter on the on the first level."
"Speaker 5","01;20;57;11","01;21;23;26","And then there's a third level in there. And first things about control of that control of that temporal parameter, first level on the far right. And they use it as a way of the way they talk about it as a way to think of like meditation and mindfulness and things like that and things like that. But I'm not, you know, I don't remember it enough detail to say a lot about my my specific feelings on that."
"Speaker 5","01;21;23;26","01;21;38;12","But that is an example that I'm aware of. Again, it's just the preference at this point. But of, of another attempt to try to model something like focusing Cool."
"Speaker 1","01;21;39;04","01;21;41;28","Interesting questions. Adam, did you want to say something else? Yep. Go ahead."
"Speaker 2","01;21;43;10","01;22;13;07","Yeah. So I basically want to throw your model at everything. But in terms of metacognition and what I've worked on in the past, mostly I've been focusing on like trying to cross-reference various theories to see the points of overlap and non overlap, mostly considering like a council of dynamic modularity that might apply to a global narrow workspace architecture or like integrate information theory where you can think of their complexes of integration."
"Speaker 2","01;22;13;07","01;22;35;26","Those modules as themselves being like doing Iot handling of those and saying like, where's the overlap? Basically trying to give semantic content to it via like G. NWT is like an architecture for Bayesian model selection and the whole thing kind of being adjudicated by strategy principle and mostly an act of inference, not nearly the technical depth that you have."
"Speaker 2","01;22;36;11","01;23;29;10","I'm only beginning to move into things like metacognition and like higher order forms of consciousness and the ideas are like really speculative. Like, so like one idea is that like as your like let's say imagining like enacting something you might start out from like generating like experience from an egocentric perspective. But then this enactment would auto associate hopefully also have third person Alice centric representations like from like the ventral visual stream or something like this, or like you've seen people or yourself doing similar things and so you might then be able to get access to in the mind's eye this like third person point of view on you with someone folding like some sort of"
"Speaker 2","01;23;29;10","01;24;04;08","like moving back and forth between a first person like and the models I'm working with like phenomenal consciousnesses and accessible consciousness. There's a sense in which like in a Rudolph projected geometric abstract modeling, it's always from this first person egocentric point of view. But then the idea is you then are looking at and objectified you and this would be part of metacognitive awareness and contextualizing you in terms of like you were doing actions and then this third person, little homunculus doing actions that you're seeing in your mind's eye and moving back and forth."
"Speaker 2","01;24;04;23","01;24;10;08","That's like the basic space I'm moving into. I don't know how much that's going to work or, or how you would model that."
"Speaker 3","01;24;10;23","01;24;12;21","Or so like one thing just kind."
"Speaker 5","01;24;13;08","01;24;37;23","Of, kind of I mean, I mean again, just to just a, I mean when you think about this kind of informal terms, right then, then and if you are in some sense, if you are the content you're describing as a belief that you are doing something right so that's just the content in the space. Space, right. So same kind of thing, right?"
"Speaker 5","01;24;38;02","01;25;09;07","Swap out our lower level with a state space that is beliefs about what I am doing, right? Then it's just the same thing, right? You have a representation about what you are doing. And in our model, you would either you would either gain access to the representation of that content or not. Yeah, it's integration with this deeper temporal level granted, beliefs about what I am doing or not is already right pretty, pretty temporally."
"Speaker 5","01;25;10;15","01;25;51;13","But were those sorts of contents to apply to our model. And that's what it would say. It would say that those contents need to be integrated with this deeper temporal model that is able to form posteriors over something that incorporates that and so so again, I mean, at the end of the day, really, it really just comes down to this distinction about the content being represented and whether or not the Posteriors associated with that content get integrated with the with the higher with the higher level, that that's the sorts of things that the higher level spread here can do."
"Speaker 5","01;25;52;22","01;26;19;27","So so it's just a question about whether something like that is the content that you want to be using and a goal directly or a recording or whether just just representations of the of the lower level kind of visual content right. And that being integrated with this level is what is what's involved. But to me, again, this just has to do with different levels of representation and what the contents are that you're becoming conscious of."
"Speaker 5","01;26;21;09","01;26;42;18","So. Oh, and by the way, I just, just, I just to mention, I looked up the paper I was mentioning, so it's, it's called towards the formal neuro phenomenology of Metacognition. And I'm the first author as Lars Sandberg Smith just to do justice to a remembering who the first full name was and the name of the paper about self."
"Speaker 5","01;26;43;24","01;26;46;11","Sorry. I think I think you start as in a couple of sentences."
"Speaker 1","01;26;47;03","01;26;48;25","Yeah, Christopher's done out of."
"Speaker 3","01;26;51;01","01;27;22;14","I was going to change the topic very slightly, but I was wondering so how you think about phenomenology or phenomenal consciousness because to me it comes down to the nature of the representation that you're gaining access to. So to talk about like we talked about the projective consciousness model, which is really cool work there, this plus perspective, all nature consciousness comes from the structure of the generative model and the fact that they're using this projective geometry and that's built into the structure of the generative model."
"Speaker 3","01;27;23;27","01;27;50;06","I'm just curious about how you think about this and how that kind of maps on it. He because at least as I understand it, you know, normal consciousness kind of a different I mean, it's never really been clear how the content of consciousness fits into it for me. Like, it's a little bit anyway. Yeah, I'd just be interested to hear thoughts, how it all fits together, what's like global workspace theory so like."
"Speaker 2","01;27;50;18","01;28;15;07","Yeah, I would say there's some kind of giant big questions. I.t I think though, it's not nothing that they start from axioms of what they think should be part of phenomenology and then work their way to this sort of way of handling systems in terms of I think it's a decent prior for like what we should look for in like physical substrates when they completely, like, turn off."
"Speaker 2","01;28;15;07","01;28;48;08","But they then would say if you have these axial the characterize experience, some intrinsic existence, composition, information integration, exclusion, if you have these different properties, then it is sufficient to bring about phenomenology because they started from phenomenology. Oh, no, I don't think that follows at all. That being said, I think it does potentially give us some priors in trying to think about physical and computational substrates of consciousness."
"Speaker 2","01;28;48;08","01;29;11;23","So that would be like two cross-referencing. And then the other part would be like, how do you think? So if you're thinking of global neural workspace as like potentially like a trading off of modularity as being part of the physical implementation, well then the question is like, so when do you have like larger big modules functioning as like dynamic coarser workspaces and when do you have like more fragmented, like little local processing?"
"Speaker 2","01;29;11;23","01;29;32;16","So like in theory, you could get like Bayesian model selection with like discrete updating with like a bunch of like small data complexes close to the modalities. Or it could be like this big sprawling alpha complex that's like going to that's multimodal and all these different ways. But then like you're moving back and forth between these like degrees of synchrony."
"Speaker 2","01;29;32;25","01;30;14;03","Seems like it could potentially be useful there for describing that. So that was one of the ideas of that in relation in terms of like and bring it to Rudolf. Like for me, like the object I would want there would be like potentially a minimal condition for phenomenology would be some sort of joint distribution over your body. Pose and visual spatial awareness as like the minimal thing for me, at least for human like consciousness and like a series of basically roughly alpha frequencies, a series of estimates of that."
"Speaker 2","01;30;15;18","01;30;41;22","And then in thinking of this as iterative Bayesian model selection via a global workspace architecture, but not necessarily one where there's like access that's like a more sophisticated kind of consciousness in terms of you wouldn't like, I would call it like it's pretty darn global. You have something like spanning all the posterior cortex, but it's not the kind of workspace you're dealing with where you're actually having knowledge and access Thanks."
"Speaker 1","01;30;42;06","01;31;16;24","Adam. So if anyone else wants to, they can raise their hand. Otherwise, I think there was a very good request just you did just ask them, so let's mix it up. But there was a very good request, actually, if Ryan or Christopher, you could just look at this part of the figure, which I know is a structure we walk through in the model stream as well, and just kind of map some of these bigger ideas that we've been talking about to some of the letters, just in a way where people can now look at this outline, say, OK, the experiment, I'm kind of all on the page."
"Speaker 1","01;31;17;01","01;31;32;22","We talked about a bunch of visual and intercept of kinds of experiments. Just where did it map in this paper so that people will always be able to go back to this paper, look at the code, and then kind of map some of these bigger metaphors to the experiment that you did here."
"Speaker 3","01;31;36;19","01;31;38;04","Do you want to take this Ryan or Jon?"
"Speaker 5","01;31;38;14","01;31;43;17","And I neither. Either way, it doesn't it doesn't matter to me if."
"Speaker 3","01;31;45;04","01;31;55;16","And so how detailed do like me to go. You'd like me to explain the little square, the days A's businesses on all that stuff."
"Speaker 1","01;31;55;17","01;31;58;23","Let's go for all the letters on the right side and maybe even someone."
"Speaker 2","01;31;58;23","01;31;59;01","Like."
"Speaker 3","01;32;02;06","01;32;55;02","So this is a partially observable Markov decision process, and it's hierarchical one so at the first, let's just focus on essentially let's start at the bottom. Ours are observations and S's are hidden or latent states. And what the matrix does is it provides a mapping between those two things. So circles of random variables and the squares are essentially fact functions in this case, probability descriptions that map between those two things or the AI and little arrow going down just says that that's essentially a set with that little a superimposed on arrow is basically saying this that's expressing a conditional probability distribution, saying that our observations depends upon the hidden state."
"Speaker 3","01;32;56;10","01;33;40;29","Now, as we start to evolve through time, we need transitions between discrete, hidden latent states in the world and those are what's described by B. So this is something like what is the probability that at time one, what's the probability of each hidden state at the next time step or or describe kind of exit T conditioned on asset T -1 now then what's special about the hierarchical models is that you have another layer on top of that where state hidden states at the first level are now being treated as observations by the second level."
"Speaker 3","01;33;42;07","01;34;18;20","And so the posterior probability at the first level is basically acts as an observation for the second level, a matrix and then at the second level there should be a D at the first level two. But that's fine. Basically what this private what this second level hidden state does is it provides a prior over that first level. And then at the first level, you can then have basically we just have one time step at the first level, but you can have any amount of time steps as you want."
"Speaker 3","01;34;19;02","01;34;45;01","So if you imagine the metaphor that's often used is like the minute versus the hour clock on the end, they evolving at different time scales. So you could in this diagram, we show that the second level evolves two time steps for every one time step at the first level. At the second level, sorry, at the second level, there are again transitions between these light and states and that's also where we have policy selection."
"Speaker 3","01;34;45;01","01;35;14;23","So that's why we put it up there. So policy selection is essentially if you imagine a whole series of hidden Markov models, this is my favorite way of describing policy selection. So these hidden Markov models are basically just a partial observable Markov decision process without the decision aspect, if you imagine a whole series of basically these graphs and you are deciding what graph kind of is going to be my future, you are trying to find the graph with the highest model evidence."
"Speaker 3","01;35;16;21","01;35;34;07","That is what computing doing policy selection does. So you are choosing the transitions that will take you to basically the graph of the highest model and I know that, Brian, you want to kind of clean up some of that explanation."
"Speaker 1","01;35;34;12","01;35;39;02","We're at the shoulders. Let's go to the last few variables."
"Speaker 5","01;35;40;02","01;36;20;08","Yeah. So I'm like, I didn't do three and see any right across the pond. And just like your distribution over all Phase G is the expected free energy. So that's essentially the function that decides. Right, which with what the value as you can think about it about each policy and that is with respect to C, which is your preference distribution, which is which is essentially the thing that specifies which observations you want and which observations you don't."
"Speaker 5","01;36;21;16","01;36;53;00","Now somehow I see that an E has been placed with an arrow down to three, and that's not correct to me. You should be going, you should be going straight to pi if you're going to include E. I don't think we did anything with E in our model, so I don't think it needs to be there. But, but E if it's used is just a kind of separate prior or policies that can encode something like habits."
"Speaker 5","01;36;54;02","01;37;19;09","So it competes with the expected free energy over policies to infer what to when you're inferring what the policy or policy is so so yeah, I mean, otherwise, I feel like Chris Gross described it well. I mean, you know, it'd be a little it's always a little easier if you have like a control point or signal point to the thing."
"Speaker 3","01;37;19;14","01;37;55;00","So I think you also asked us to relate this to an experimental paradigm. So if we maybe briefly click down to figure two, what is labeled this figure two there. So we can just look at that. So the idea is there was a forward mask at the beginning of the paradigm. This was just a series of lines. And now these kind of stimuli on the outside, the second time step in the task that or now like simulated task, say on some trials the square kind of was self-organizing the some of the lines and self-organized into a square."
"Speaker 3","01;37;55;26","01;38;20;09","So either in our discrete state space model, a square was present or it wasn't and in third time step it was just replaced by more lines. And then afterwards we asked the agent to construct a report of that so basically apps you can think of the first level of the model as being all of the features of the stimulus and also the location of attention."
"Speaker 3","01;38;20;23","01;38;46;05","So this might be something like saliency maps in posterior parietal cortex, which are directing where attention is being pointed to you might and then you might have the features of the stimulus which are represented in various places. At the second level, we now have our this is space scale frontal private courses. This is tracking the evolution of state at the first level."
"Speaker 3","01;38;46;05","01;39;05;19","So it's tracking that at the first time step there was lines presented. At the second time, step there was square presented, maybe it maybe it was, maybe, maybe it wasn't. And it's third time step that was more lines. And you can imagine in like a real task, all of that unfolds in the space of a second yeah."
"Speaker 5","01;39;05;21","01;39;24;19","So so you can think about it. I mean, like, yeah, the second level is really the content in question that it's inferring is the sequence right? It's not whether or square, it's whether it was lines, square lines or just lines, lines, lines. And so you said."
"Speaker 3","01;39;25;24","01;39;44;27","Oh, and so if you're thinking about where experience, let's obviously we don't experience a sequence. Right. I think and I think Brian, I've been chatting about this a lot lately because it relates to work we're currently doing. But I think what's going on is that what we experience are essentially like the updates to our second level beliefs and that's really crucial."
"Speaker 3","01;39;45;15","01;40;13;05","So the reason why it's crucial is because we know empirically that that kind of what could be we might describe as brain processes, they're at the first level of the model. These can be either conscious or or not and contents that are conscious. When you are conscious of something, it has all of these really important functional consequences. So here it might be kind of being able to see it for a maintenance report."
"Speaker 3","01;40;13;08","01;40;38;09","But also if I see something, I can then voluntarily maintain it in memory for as long as I want. As long as I don't get distracted. Like there are limits on like human psychology but that that's kind of a really important function that's enabled by being conscious of something, right? And that allows us to do things like construct reports of our experience or even I think by report, I just mean something very general."
"Speaker 3","01;40;38;17","01;40;53;01","It could be in this model, we kind of have the toy thing of being able to like put a sentence together, but it could also be more empirically really into an empirical paradigm. So just like hitting a button or doing a confidence to getting a confidence interval or something like that."
"Speaker 1","01;40;56;17","01;41;13;07","Cool. Thank you for that interesting answer. We'll have Steven and then Adam and then anyone else who wants to raise their hand. And also any last questions from the live chat as we kind of slowly land the plane yeah."
"Speaker 4","01;41;13;23","01;41;34;24","I was just going to ask in relation to those lines in the way that the square appears, like you said. So this this is actually like a graphic representation, but when someone looks at it, there's probably some special device that you've got that represents this. Is it like that the lines rotates typically and at some point it just happens."
"Speaker 4","01;41;34;24","01;41;59;06","They rotate such that they line up and then they rotate or I'm just one of the questions. Why didn't you use negative space? Like you say, they line up to make like a negative Space Square. I just wondered whether that relates to the choice of how it pops in and out of perceptual. So phenomenological awareness, phenomenological consciousness or access consciousness."
"Speaker 3","01;42;00;16","01;42;21;01","And so basically like this is just a very in our model, we have discrete hidden states which are categorical distributions, which are lines or squares and external states which are red. And so this is kind of just a graphical representation of a way to think about that. But it had really nothing to do with how it works mathematically."
"Speaker 3","01;42;23;21","01;42;47;04","Then in terms of actually the empirical task like this is this is a task that we basically like borrowed from. Michael Pitts is a really done he's a neuroscientist, done a really important work in the area of visual consciousness. And as to why they chose to kind of have these I guess the I think from memory there are videos attached to this paper."
"Speaker 3","01;42;47;14","01;43;10;15","From memory, I think the lines is kind of they just throw around and then occasionally a subset of them will all line up into a square and then go back to like jittering as to why they did that versus other methods like other. No, really, there definitely are subtle things you can do to a stimulus which have major impacts on whether you have called success to it or not."
"Speaker 3","01;43;10;19","01;43;32;14","But there's the phenomenon of inattentional blindness is super general. Like these are you can have people. So the really famous example is that everyone gets shown in like undergrad psych is about this. You have your tracking whether a group of people playing basketball and you ask how many, how many times the sum was like a white shirt get past a bowl or something like that and your attention is distracted."
"Speaker 3","01;43;32;19","01;43;57;08","So we're kind of consumed with that that a bear or a gorilla can like walk into the middle of the screen being the dead center of your phobia wave at you and then walk away. And about 50% of people don't see it at all. And that's really well replicated across the bunches or they don't report seeing. And I think I should say, I think there's some there's some debate about whether this is a memory phenomenon or any of that."
"Speaker 3","01;43;57;08","01;44;01;01","There's lots of subtleties there, but so hopefully that answers the question."
"Speaker 1","01;44;01;16","01;44;41;07","Yeah. Also one advantage and one rationale for these pure modeling papers that we're discussing today is the space of the possible human experiments or even any other kind of real world experiments is very limited. It's very limited what you can actually have a real set of humans do. And so it's great to have tools that help us explore some of the patterns that we're looking for and understand how variability and do statistical calculations like how many participants might we need of a given variability range if we want to capture such and such an effect without distorting it this way, that's critical information."
"Speaker 1","01;44;41;07","01;45;06;17","And if you don't have the model, then the experimental design phase is totally blind. And it's a very shot in the dark. And so this helps inform structures for even thinking about how to design human experiments for example, as we're talking about here with visual awareness. But it could be for other kinds of experiments. So Adam and then anyone else who wants to make a comment see you later, Alex."
"Speaker 1","01;45;06;17","01;45;07;15","Bye, Adam."
"Speaker 2","01;45;09;04","01;45;41;20","Hi. I'd be curious and knowing more of your thoughts on the potential I guess the richness or lack thereof of experience so that one could consciousness be phenomenal. Our access more experience as a series of snapshots that are like static, sequential, but we don't know, it's like a flipbook, or is it more like a continuous stream? Like if you're getting this discrete updating, are these updates over like, like the agents in like motion?"
"Speaker 2","01;45;41;20","01;45;51;23","Like if you take like a camera, sometimes in your phone, there's like a little brief like for the had like look ahead and back. But like what would be the nature of these discrete updates?"
"Speaker 5","01;45;52;26","01;46;17;19","I would, yeah. I I mean, I know the like I'm trying to remember. I know and I remember reading dandelions, but a few years ago and there is there is some work I think showing you know, there are kind of there's like a minimal time for like essentially updates to the to the content of consciousness to have some kind of discrete character to them."
"Speaker 5","01;46;17;19","01;46;19;14","I don't I don't remember."
"Speaker 3","01;46;19;14","01;46;21;09","What object or refractory period."
"Speaker 5","01;46;21;26","01;46;57;19","Yeah. Do you know what that you remember the actual like milliseconds like I remember like it looks like. Yeah, I don't, I don't remember. But there is there is something like that that maybe it might be like similar to like a refresh rate or something like that, but I don't remember too much about them. But, but I mean one thing one thing to say is that, you know, because you know, there are these sorts of discrete updates in our model, but I mean it's also good it remember that the the, the higher level representation is specifically about this sequence."
"Speaker 5","01;46;58;00","01;47;26;22","Right? Which is integrated in a sense of a hypothesis it is about a whole sequence that doesn't necessarily need to be thought about as having sort of this great chance to it. Right. Is just a single to the single hypothesis about what that what that whole sequence was. And so you might think of that, right, as having a more kind of continuous character to it, despite the fact that it is updated in some ultimately discrete fashion."
"Speaker 5","01;47;27;00","01;47;54;22","It's kind of like that bins that talk about it that way. But, but, and in terms of rituals, I mean, to me, I mean, I just think of I just tend to think of Rich as meaning. There are more features, right? There's more features that they're more precise. And at the at the lower level, right? So instead of just, you know, a lion's or a square, right?"
"Speaker 5","01;47;54;22","01;48;24;29","At our in our example, there could be a ton of different lower level representations about color and shape and size and all these sorts of things. But our represent in some sort of joint way, right. And become accessible. And so, I mean, that's one way to think about richness is just what, what are all the things being represented that become acts that become accessible together."
"Speaker 5","01;48;26;26","01;48;28;28","But I don't know that you said something."
"Speaker 1","01;48;29;02","01;48;46;07","That's a question actually there about the continuous modeling. Is it possible that active inference could have a continuous mode? Yeah, I know that it would get rid of a lot of the discrete benefits and the sequential message passing or maybe other hero sticks, but it could there be a continuous format continuous to whatever space?"
"Speaker 5","01;48;47;06","01;49;11;14","Yeah. No, there are continuing mistakes based models and there are also mixed models. Mixed mixed models are kind of especially nice and probably a lot more realistic here. You know, because visual, visual input, a lot of the things that are represented by the visual system are continuous, right? Like motion, for example, is continuous brightness, you know, all these, all these sorts of things."
"Speaker 5","01;49;12;12","01;49;27;28","And so those can be those can be perceived and represent it in a continuous scale. At the lower level, it still get passed up to the three representations at the higher level. We didn't do that here for simplicity. Anything."
"Speaker 1","01;49;29;05","01;49;47;09","So I was just to clarify, I was in scaling active inference. We did talk about the continuous state space. I was just wondering if it's possible that the continuous time active in for a small rather than a discrete time model of T one, two, three, just, just bringing up. OK, but then Christopher and then blue."
"Speaker 3","01;49;47;17","01;50;17;18","So yeah, three things. Just quickly to answer your question, Daniel, it's hidden markup models, just like super general thing. It's basically just when you have a Markov chain and that you have but each state of the Markov chain links to some outcome. Those outcomes can then both the outcomes and delight in states can be continuous. When you have a discrete light and state continuous outcome, you end up with a Gaussian mixed with like basically what ends up being a mixture of Gaussians model."
"Speaker 3","01;50;19;11","01;50;42;11","And when you have if you have continuous states, you end up with, I think you basically end up with a common filter and you can stack those top of each other and do all the same things. It just yeah, for all the reasons you say, things get really complicated when you start to move to continuous time and I completely agree with Ryan."
"Speaker 3","01;50;42;11","01;51;15;05","I actually I think there are computation, there are functional reasons to think that decision making is discrete. And so as a decision maker, it the level of decision making computationally speaking, we should use discrete database models. I also think that at a certain level we need continuous databases. Obviously, we represent continuous quantities. And I think Tom's part we chatted about this before in the model stream, but Thomas has a really nice paper on kind of the discrete continuous interface, and that's something I'm actually really interested in."
"Speaker 3","01;51;15;05","01;51;29;01","I'm not sure I don't know to what extent we should take these things as idealization or as general kind of neurophysiological predictions. I think that's a really I'm super interested in that in other words, but I don't know."
"Speaker 5","01;51;29;02","01;51;58;28","That's what we're trying to say is that it's not as though only, only action only action selection has to do with discrete spaces or there are plausibly a lot of higher level representational things that are also discrete. So for instance, like concepts, right? Like I can, I can have a bunch of continuously represented lower level visual features, but I can use those to infer something discrete as well."
"Speaker 5","01;51;58;28","01;52;24;12","Like, for instance, that those features correspond to my concept of a God or my concept of a building, you know, whatever we do have these discrete categories that we map on patterns of continuous features too. And I mean, that's a that's a whole another discussion I think we talk about everything last time, right? Gaining conscious access to the visual features versus gaining access to the fact that it is the dog, right?"
"Speaker 5","01;52;24;15","01;52;49;26","No. Are those are different levels. Represents and that can be attended to and you may be able to kind of independently or semi independently be accessible separately. So but that's just I just want to point out that not everything not everything is going to be continuous in in perception when when sort of past problem."
"Speaker 1","01;52;50;16","01;52;59;14","And that's where it's like what you can say that's for a lot of category theory. Discussion comes into play. Let's do blue then Christopher for final thoughts."
"Speaker 6","01;53;01;13","01;53;22;21","So I know that we operate under the assumption that the visual like we perceive things continuously in visual space. But I mean really the input is like 60 hertz right? So I mean theoretically like this thing, this object is consistently a dog. But if it's like flashing back and forth to a cat at some perceptible levels, like we wouldn't know, right?"
"Speaker 6","01;53;22;28","01;53;28;14","So I mean, I think anything can be modeled in discrete chunks if you break the chunks."
"Speaker 5","01;53;28;23","01;53;30;04","Small enough pieces."
"Speaker 3","01;53;31;07","01;53;57;04","Yeah. Yeah. I've sometimes seen people like make be a bit smarmy about this when they someone says like, oh, discrete state space is unrealistic and the comeback is always like it. Like you can always democratize things up to some arbitrary level. And then this great state space works fine. I actually think that's a bit of a dodge, to be honest, because the way we're using it is this great state space models is in like an ultra discrete kind of way, right?"
"Speaker 3","01;53;57;15","01;54;21;12","So I think that if we had like if we had a hidden Markov model where we had like 660 Hertz equivalent or something, that would just be ridiculous. Like you should just work and continue at state spaces at that point, like the, the computational and conceptual vantages of working in a great state space are gone. It's so it would be so difficult."
"Speaker 1","01;54;22;07","01;54;53;29","It's a really nice question, though, and it's like if you do make it a fighter and find a granularity, you keep some of the really big benefits of splitting. And sometimes it's actually easier to even do like a protein folding. They'll do a time step of the tiniest, tiniest amounts and do millions of times steps tiny because it's still easier to fit that ultra rich, discrete time model with actual time steps that can be clustered on different computers rather than rewrite the whole base to do continuous modeling."
"Speaker 1","01;54;53;29","01;55;10;24","So I agree, it's not like continuous is simply better, and it really relates deeply to how we think about the continuum and the infinitesimal. And so it's really an interesting area for active. So Steven and then any other closing comments yeah."
"Speaker 4","01;55;10;25","01;55;46;04","And I suppose if we also were to go back into the physics of it, you know, with active inference as a way of like if vision is being on the surfaces out there rather than it being an input signal, even if we have these brainwaves, some of that might be an artifact of cognitive science which has got like the input process output at some level it's it's extract like Alex Constant talks about extracting, you know, information from quantum noise, noise, you know, random fluctuations and all this sort of stuff."
"Speaker 4","01;55;46;04","01;56;11;26","So, you know, this it could be, it could be that discrete state space is kind of, you know, sort of also because that there is quite choppy what's coming in and at some point inferences have to be made that makes it more like a signal. Does that make sense now? I'm just I'm just putting that out there. It's just that as another layer at the lower levels of the retina and stuff like that."
"Speaker 1","01;56;13;26","01;56;30;20","Sounds good. Any last comments otherwise? This was super interesting. I guess a closing question for the authors would just be when when's the next episode in this paper saga? Or What's the next what's the next thing you're excited about here?"
"Speaker 5","01;56;31;24","01;56;42;21","I am processing, right? We have another paper that's kind of, I don't know, maybe like three quarters done or something like that. That's kind of a Mac, stuff like that. Unless it's."
"Speaker 3","01;56;42;22","01;56;44;03","Different. All the simulations."
"Speaker 5","01;56;45;11","01;57;03;19","Yeah. So they're done with an expanded model that's a lot more with and so it allows for a no report paradigm and selective, selective attention and working memory maintenance are our explicit policies on the updated one with a number of other advantages. But you know, it's common sense."
"Speaker 3","01;57;04;21","01;57;07;27","Yeah, I think it's a matter of me writing it really."
"Speaker 1","01;57;08;16","01;57;38;17","So well to real, but I think thanks everyone for joining this is really fun for 18 overall and we look forward to probably seeing you again for 19 and beyond. Thanks to all the participants. You can fill out the survey for feedback in your events calendar invitation otherwise we'll be talking through other channels. So thanks everyone. See later."
"Speaker 2","01;57;39;22","01;57;39;29","Thanks."
"Speaker 3","01;57;41;06","01;57;44;12","Thanks. Thanks thanks."
"Speaker 2","01;57;45;20","01;57;47;11","Thanks thanks."
"Speaker 3","01;57;48;19","01;57;56;07","Thanks thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks."
