00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,880
hello everyone welcome to

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,880
the active inference lab the active

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,080
inference live stream

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,920
today it is active inference live stream

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,079
15.0

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,760
and it is january 27 2021

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,760
welcome to the active inference lab

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,920
everyone we are an experiment in

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,240
online team communication learning and

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,439
practice related to

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,760
active inference you can find us at our

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,560
website

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,160
twitter email youtube key based team

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,960
also with the discord now

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,879
and this is recorded in an archived live

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,399
stream so please provide us with

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:40,960
feedback

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,920
so that we can improve on our work all

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,840
backgrounds and perspectives are

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,399
welcome here and this is going to be fun

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,840
because it's a dialogue which i'm not

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,600
sure if it's a format we've tried before

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,039
but we'll abide by

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,600
good video chat etiquette with blue and

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,680
i so just to introduce ourselves before

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,199
we jump into everything

27
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,680
i'm daniel friedman i'm a postdoctoral

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,399
researcher

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,799
in davis california and i'm an insect

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,880
biologist mostly what about yourself

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,240
blue

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,000
my name is blue knight i am an

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,240
independent research consultant based

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:12,799
out of

35
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,439
new mexico and my background is mostly

36
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,200
in neuroscience

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,280
cool well this is going to be a fun

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,040
conversation

39
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,439
these conversations are related to the

40
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,200
active inference live stream

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,360
group discussions that we do regularly

42
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,520
and these discussions are every tuesday

43
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,159
from 7

44
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,759
to 9 a.m pacific and if you go to this

45
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,240
red link you'll find a spreadsheet and

46
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,840
the spreadsheet shows the two

47
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,320
participatory group discussions that we

48
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,200
spend the time on

49
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,920
with each paper and so for february 2nd

50
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,799
and 9th

51
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,960
2021 for active stream 15.1 and 15.2

52
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,560
we're going to be talking about this

53
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,000
paper that we're going to discuss

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,200
in 15.0 with a bigger group as well as

55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,880
with the authors in s

56
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,960
and thomas so this is going to be a cool

57
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,399
opportunity to hear a lot of

58
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,680
perspectives of people who are just

59
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,240
learning

60
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,640
and also have the authors on for some

61
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,000
long form discussions

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,160
with time to digest so the dot zero

63
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,038
videos

64
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,760
um which is what this video is has the

65
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
goal of setting the context for these

66
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,879
group discussions

67
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,599
because these are research papers and

68
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,560
they're

69
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,800
basically the form of the ideas as

70
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,879
they're being worked with by researchers

71
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,040
so it is something that might take a lot

72
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,800
of background reading or thinking about

73
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,680
to catch up with

74
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,840
so the goal is maybe these videos in the

75
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,720
dot zero

76
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,239
can prepare someone to feel more

77
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,000
comfortable participating in

78
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,599
point one or point two even

79
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,080
participating as a listener

80
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,000
so the paper we're going to be

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,239
discussing for today and for the next

82
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,040
two weeks

83
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,120
is called free energy principle

84
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
computationalism

85
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,680
and realism a tragedy it's by thomas van

86
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,720
ness and in s

87
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,519
hippolyto and the link is provided here

88
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,840
the video is just an introduction to the

89
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,319
context of the ideas it's not a review

90
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,480
or a final word especially if you knew

91
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,080
how much time we spent preparing for

92
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,280
this

93
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,760
and the punchline of the paper if we

94
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,560
could put it

95
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,120
this way is that realism is a tragedy

96
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,000
and instrumentalism is no joke either

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,920
the sections of today are going to go as

98
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,440
follows in the introduction

99
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,879
we're going to go through the aims and

100
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,879
the claims of the papers

101
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,959
then the keywords the abstract and the

102
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,000
roadmap

103
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,879
then there's one figure one table and a

104
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,280
few

105
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,680
key topics and quotations that really

106
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,480
stand out

107
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,799
as far as summarizing some of the bigger

108
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,560
ideas that we've been talking about

109
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,080
but also really crystallizing the

110
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,159
arguments of the paper so good things to

111
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,239
catch on to if you didn't highlight it

112
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,080
or draw a circle around it when you were

113
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,959
reading it earlier and then we'll close

114
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:43,680
with a couple

115
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,000
questions that we had just while making

116
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,120
the slides

117
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,480
and these aren't ones that we're going

118
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,879
to address today but they're things that

119
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,480
we're curious to hear what people think

120
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,239
about and what other questions and

121
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,080
methods they connect them out to

122
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,560
so in 15.1 and 0.2 we're going to be

123
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,200
discussing

124
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,640
this very same paper so just submit your

125
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,400
questions through the live chat

126
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,560
or through a youtube comment or twitter

127
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,239
however and then if you want to

128
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,239
um participate live in these or a future

129
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,680
discussion then you're welcome

130
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,959
to join okay

131
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,600
let's so let's talk about the aims and

132
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,440
the claims of the paper

133
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,199
um blue do you want to start by saying

134
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,360
anything about just your broad overview

135
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,960
of what you thought about the aims and

136
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,639
claims before we read some of the quotes

137
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,560
from them

138
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,080
uh just that i liked the paper i thought

139
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,759
it was really um

140
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,400
well written and made the fep very

141
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,120
approachable

142
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,199
for a variety of different backgrounds

143
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,960
and i can you know read some of these

144
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,120
off if you want so the first aim is

145
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,000
according to

146
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,080
predictive processing theories the

147
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,600
generative model is literally

148
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,199
implemented by a human brain to

149
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,880
calculate the potential states of the

150
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,759
environment

151
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,000
termed a realist approach whereas other

152
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,919
approaches take it to be an insightful

153
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,600
statistical description that a

154
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,680
non-scientifically trained organism

155
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,000
has no access to termed an

156
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,400
instrumentalist approach

157
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,080
in this paper we shall engage with both

158
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,759
debates and argue that

159
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,759
the representationalism debate is not

160
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,440
relevant to the fep

161
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,600
and realism is doomed to fail regardless

162
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,440
of whether it is representationalist or

163
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,160
not

164
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,880
and conversely instrumentalism can drive

165
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,600
either way or so we shall argue

166
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,919
thank you for reading it so it's saying

167
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,199
this first selection

168
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,759
is kind of laying out the the spectrum

169
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,880
or the battlefield

170
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,440
or the continuum of approaches or

171
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,479
understandings

172
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,240
whether we take the fep to be more

173
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,400
realist or more instrumentalist and

174
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,680
we're going to go into a lot more detail

175
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,720
about that

176
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,600
and in the middle quote they basically

177
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,199
write that this representationalism

178
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,479
debate is important

179
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,639
but it's not relevant to this realist

180
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,080
instrumentalist contention

181
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,280
which we're going to graphically see

182
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,199
soon and then their conclusion

183
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,800
is represented in the third part and

184
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,320
their conclusion is that realism is

185
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,120
doomed to fail

186
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,880
independent of the representationalist

187
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,600
question and instrumentalism can work

188
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,000
so those are the aims and claims and the

189
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,360
way that we're going to be

190
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,360
understanding the paper's meaning and

191
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,520
whether or not it makes sense or lives

192
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,199
up to its claims

193
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,520
so to understand whether it lives up to

194
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,360
its claims and to understand how

195
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,240
those implications would be in our own

196
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,280
lives as well as

197
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,960
in the broader literature we kind of

198
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,479
have to understand where this paper is

199
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,080
situated so what is it

200
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,560
related to what other areas of research

201
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,199
is it

202
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,000
uh going to be citing what else is it

203
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,080
discussing in common with other areas

204
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,520
so we know that this is a free energy

205
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
principle related paper but also the

206
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,240
keywords of the paper were provided as

207
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,759
scientific models representationalism

208
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,600
realism and instrumentalism so these are

209
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,039
some of the main keywords that we're

210
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:43,759
going to be

211
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,520
talking about and the goal of these

212
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,880
keywords which is just

213
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,759
again you could take a course or do so

214
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,440
much independent research on any of

215
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:51,840
these

216
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,880
topics so we're just going to be broadly

217
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,440
going over these a few different

218
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,039
keywords just very

219
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,039
at the surface layer but picking out a

220
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,560
few good examples

221
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,400
and that's just to connect the active

222
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,919
inference ideas

223
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,919
and research community out with other

224
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,599
areas that might be useful for

225
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,360
applications or for insights and then

226
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,080
also provide

227
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,919
accessible on-ramps into active

228
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,360
inference for those who might be

229
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,080
familiar with

230
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,680
one of these keywords but not with

231
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,680
active inference itself

232
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,039
so first is the scientific models

233
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,080
so scientific models uh blue

234
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,840
how would you describe a scientific

235
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,319
model because i was almost um

236
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,440
just tabula rasa with looking up images

237
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:33,919
on

238
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,080
image searches because like how does one

239
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,680
go about saying what a scientific model

240
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,639
is or how does it

241
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,759
play out for you so a couple of things

242
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,440
that i always think about when

243
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,520
i think of a scientific model is the

244
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,680
quote from george box that's

245
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,400
that um all models are are wrong some

246
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,520
are useful

247
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
uh and then i always go back to the book

248
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,120
that i read that was a compilation

249
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,160
called uh the map is not the territory

250
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,400
and so this really you know plays out in

251
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,280
the way that like

252
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,800
in constructing a model what we are

253
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,960
doing is essentially building a map

254
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,280
whether it's a map of you know gene

255
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,160
states or

256
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,000
or regulatory patterns or neural coding

257
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,720
or whatever it's it's a map and it's not

258
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,240
ever directly the territory because if

259
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,919
the map was the territory it would not

260
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,800
be useful

261
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,560
right so you need to have like so there

262
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,240
has to be some dimension reduction

263
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,560
in in a scientific model but not too

264
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,319
much otherwise it's it's overly

265
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,360
simplistic and

266
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,199
doesn't encompass all of the potential

267
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,479
variables so that's what

268
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,440
modeling like really brings up for me

269
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,120
nice and there's a there's a borges

270
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,599
story

271
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,760
about the map that just pastes over

272
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,440
everything it goes into people's lungs

273
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,159
and it kind of

274
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,919
becomes one-to-one with the real world

275
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,440
and then it you know is it the real

276
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:43,919
world

277
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,480
so we're dealing with not that situation

278
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,920
but we want to be talking about things

279
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,320
that we

280
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,720
care about and want to explain predict

281
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,920
design control

282
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,600
perturb we want to be useful in the

283
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,160
world so we want to generalize from our

284
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,440
experiences and

285
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,080
look at empirical observations in a way

286
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,600
that's nuanced so that's kind of

287
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,959
scientific modeling

288
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,600
and if you look on search engines or in

289
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,720
the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy

290
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,080
you could get a few different

291
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,839
distinctions like physical models

292
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,000
the kind of thing that a artist might

293
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,200
use as a template

294
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,600
like a torso with some clothing on it

295
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,920
and then mathematical models which are

296
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,360
the kind that we're going to be talking

297
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,839
about today but also there might be

298
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,399
qualitative models or models that don't

299
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,240
use mathematical symbols but

300
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,720
are still conceptual so in the stanford

301
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,880
encyclopedia of philosophy just table of

302
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,839
contents

303
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,760
at the sort of overview layer we can see

304
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,519
that there are several ongoing

305
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,080
related fields of philosophy that are

306
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,760
talking about scientific modeling

307
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,800
ontology what are models epistemology

308
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,240
how do we learn about models what do

309
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,839
they do for us cognitively

310
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,440
and then how do we think about different

311
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,959
kinds of models and

312
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,959
mel andrews paper in active stream 14

313
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,200
discussed a lot of these topics so let's

314
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,480
talk about the scientific

315
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,040
models of a few different types and this

316
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,160
is pretty central

317
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,880
to the discussion of paper today which

318
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,279
is

319
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,920
the uh descriptive of scientific models

320
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,959
so we're talking about

321
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,279
family of models and you have the taller

322
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,000
and the shorter

323
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,680
within the family so now we're going to

324
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,440
talk about the more realism

325
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,519
or more instrumentalism in terms of

326
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,200
scientific models

327
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,839
so um blue do you want to read the

328
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:22,880
paragraph

329
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,600
sure realism and instrumentalism here

330
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,440
concern the models and statistical

331
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,000
manipulations that make up the fep

332
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,680
and whether they are thought to be used

333
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,839
and manipulated by the systems under

334
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,839
scrutiny independent of scientific

335
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,680
inquiry which is rea

336
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,320
or conversely whether they are thought

337
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,760
to be scientific tools

338
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,680
wrought by humans in specific

339
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,680
socio-cultural environments to study

340
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,440
particular systems which is ins

341
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,839
with rea being realism and ins being

342
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,200
instrumentalism

343
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,320
yes so there's a continuum from extreme

344
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,040
realism

345
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,360
with a rhea acronym to extreme

346
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,399
instrumentalism

347
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,320
and then in the middle you could imagine

348
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,240
is something that draws insights or

349
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,000
tries to be sort of like a compromise

350
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,279
between the positions

351
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,920
but we could ask whether a theory or

352
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,120
whether a model were

353
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,000
more amenable to one of these sides or

354
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,640
another

355
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,760
and the archetypal realist theory is

356
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,720
saying that

357
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,440
the model is what the system is doing so

358
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,880
let's think if you had a pendulum

359
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,000
and your model had a gravity force and a

360
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,640
hinge

361
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,320
and you might say although these are

362
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,240
just parameters with the angle

363
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,760
and the force of gravity and the weight

364
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,839
of the pendulum it actually has a

365
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,600
natural interpretation

366
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,760
i i don't know and i don't want to go

367
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,200
too down the rabbit hole with what's

368
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,360
realist or what's real because

369
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,200
blue you know that it's an open-ended

370
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,560
question but

371
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,480
the instrumentalist one would be more

372
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,640
like i'm modeling the stock market

373
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,839
and so i'm going to model it like a

374
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,000
pendulum with a weight and in that case

375
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,600
you wouldn't be saying

376
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,440
the same kind of claim about the

377
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,639
pendulum so if you have a full model

378
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,240
of what you think is actually happening

379
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,720
out there it's more realistic

380
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,079
and that doesn't mean it's more accurate

381
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,920
per se it doesn't mean that it's cheaper

382
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,399
to run

383
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,399
it's always in balance with a lot of

384
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,920
other features of modeling

385
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,480
but this realist instrumentalist aspect

386
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,399
has big implications for the fep but

387
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,760
we're just bringing it up

388
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,560
in the context of what the idea is by

389
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,440
itself

390
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,720
for now and then we're going to connect

391
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,560
it to the fep with the paper

392
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,760
anything else to add there just like in

393
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,079
the

394
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,480
author's interpretation of realism or or

395
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,079
at least what i interpreted that the

396
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:28,639
authors

397
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,279
interpreted um you know the realism like

398
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,279
viewpoint or stance is actually

399
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,959
it seems very mechanistic like in

400
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,399
science we're always or especially in

401
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,040
biology

402
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,800
like what is the underlying mechanism

403
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,480
instead of like building a big

404
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,560
model we're like where is the how does

405
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,600
it work and so

406
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,079
this this realism claim is actually you

407
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,040
know

408
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,959
it says that that this is actually the

409
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,399
mechanism the model is

410
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,040
the way that it is working so so you

411
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,480
know i think about gene regulatory

412
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,839
networks and some things that might be

413
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:56,720
amenable

414
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
to that kind of like realistic

415
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,920
representation

416
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,320
um as opposed to instrumental which is

417
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,079
which um you know look like

418
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,079
there's a useful you know like a model

419
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,680
of the stock market or something like

420
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,639
that

421
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,320
yes so let's talk about this other axis

422
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,120
so we had sort of one continuum that

423
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,720
categorizes or describes

424
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,200
kinds of scientific models and then here

425
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,399
is going to be another

426
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,639
axis and we're putting them orthogonal

427
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,320
or just at 90 degree angles to each

428
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,519
other because you could kind of pick and

429
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,200
choose we're going to see how that plays

430
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,760
out

431
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,959
and this is a debate or a continuum

432
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,880
known as representationalism and it's

433
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,040
related to a lot of other topics and in

434
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,560
earlier discussions with

435
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,680
alex kiefer with maxwell with others

436
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,320
we've

437
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,920
broached this idea of what is a

438
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,480
representation is a representation

439
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,160
mean that it has to be inside of the

440
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,639
organism or can it be a distributed

441
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,000
representation um but that's

442
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,720
kind of again what we're locking in on

443
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,440
with this

444
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,079
question is what exactly is a

445
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,040
representation

446
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,920
and does the theory highlight aspects of

447
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,040
the world that are

448
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,720
like representations like a specific

449
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,560
pattern of neural firing or

450
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,360
a specific compound that's that signals

451
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,959
or represents alarm

452
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,240
um or do people take non-representation

453
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,560
stances blue what would you say is

454
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,000
differentiating or

455
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,839
relevant or what's on the table with

456
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,639
this debate

457
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,760
so i i feel like i i am like personally

458
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,160
very

459
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,279
very biased here i think um you know

460
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,560
what's on the table is is there you know

461
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,240
are we perceiving

462
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,560
the object in perception right i mean as

463
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,160
a neuroscience background it's like are

464
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,600
we literally perceiving

465
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,639
this orange which is round flavorful

466
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,959
juicy like cold it might be lots of

467
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,720
different things are we perceiving this

468
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,920
orange or are we perceiving whatever our

469
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,160
mind represents as this orange sweet

470
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,720
juicy like brightly colored flavorful

471
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
scented whatever so are we perceiving

472
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,399
some representation

473
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,560
or actually the orange directly so i

474
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,800
think that that's that's the debate

475
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,040
the good news about this debate is that

476
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
for this paper it's going to turn out

477
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,440
that

478
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,760
we can be agnostic so if we're not sure

479
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,680
or we don't know or we don't even care

480
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,000
it's going to be okay for this paper

481
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,639
let's look at the abstract of the paper

482
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,240
with a picture by sasha in the

483
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,240
background of neurons

484
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,240
the authors write the free energy

485
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,000
principle provides an increasingly

486
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,240
popular framework to biology and

487
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,519
cognitive science

488
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,839
however it remains disputed whether its

489
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,920
statistical models are scientific tools

490
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,759
to describe non-equilibrium steady-state

491
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,480
systems

492
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,839
which we call the instrumentalist

493
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,480
reading or are literally implemented and

494
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,480
utilized by those systems the realist

495
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,360
reading

496
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,360
we analyze the options critically with

497
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,560
particular attention

498
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,600
to the question of representationalism

499
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,320
okay blue and then on the second part to

500
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,160
that slide of the abstract can you read

501
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,800
it

502
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,839
sure however it remains disputed whether

503
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,920
it's statistical models are scientific

504
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,120
tools to describe

505
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,360
non-equilibrium steady-state systems

506
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,560
which we call the instrumentalist

507
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,399
reading or are literally implemented and

508
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,160
utilized by the systems the realist

509
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,680
reading sorry you just read that

510
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,000
we argue that realism is unwarranted and

511
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,920
conceptually incoherent

512
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,240
conversely instrumentalism is safer

513
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,120
whilst remaining explanatory powerful

514
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,440
moreover we show that the

515
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,320
representationalism debate loses

516
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,959
relevance in an instrumentalist reading

517
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,720
finally these findings could be

518
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,639
generalized for our interpretation of

519
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,399
models in cognitive science more

520
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,880
generally

521
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,639
nice abstract and pretty interesting

522
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,839
topics let's look at the roadmap to

523
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,959
see how do the authors take us from

524
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,839
a to z and then we're gonna go into the

525
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,480
figure

526
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,560
the table and go through a couple of the

527
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,639
key quotations where if you read over it

528
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,279
and you weren't

529
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,279
sure you know what were the key turns

530
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,959
the parts on the actual road trip where

531
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:55,759
someone says

532
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,519
make sure to take a left at the red barn

533
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,199
or whatever what are the parts where

534
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,560
you want to really evaluate these

535
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,040
sections and ask how you feel about them

536
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,160
so we're looking at the roadmap and

537
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,240
it starts with an introduction before

538
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,000
jumping right into the free energy

539
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,359
principle essentials

540
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,119
and i think it will be fun to go over

541
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,199
the quotation and the figure there

542
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:15,760
because

543
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,679
blue i know that you wanted to explain

544
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,039
and think about it in a few

545
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,679
new ways and then in section three

546
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,079
there's the discussion of

547
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:26,319
representationalism so it starts off by

548
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,039
discussing representational realism and

549
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:29,440
then

550
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,039
talking about non-representational

551
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,559
realism we're gonna look at all this

552
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,720
quadrants all the two by two soon

553
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,280
in table one we see a actual summary of

554
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,799
the possibilities the two by two

555
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,880
possibilities of instrumentalism versus

556
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,440
realism

557
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,679
and representationalist or not and then

558
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,120
this is brought back to generative

559
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,000
models in the free

560
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,640
energy principle and then section 4 is

561
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,039
sort of a plea for instrumentalism

562
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,000
and talks about how independent of

563
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,160
whatever we think about

564
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,720
representationalism

565
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,280
instrumentalism can work for us and then

566
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,000
we're going to talk a little

567
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,400
bit about what that actually looks like

568
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,080
and then there's a conclusion with some

569
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,280
really awesome

570
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,080
philosophical and broader points any

571
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,200
thoughts or comments on the roadmap

572
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,640
no no let's do free energy principle

573
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,679
essentials so the free energy principle

574
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,960
according to the authors this is the

575
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,720
quote is based on three aspects

576
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,799
blue how about go through the three

577
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,559
aspects just what was interesting what

578
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,679
did you like about this

579
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,640
layout the first aspect is the

580
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,600
observation

581
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,960
of self-organization and you know in all

582
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,240
biological systems

583
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,640
are our non-equilibrium steady-state

584
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,080
systems because if we were

585
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,760
in equilibrium we would all be dead

586
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,919
right so we're maintaining this constant

587
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:42,799
influx and

588
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,679
and efflux of you know nutrients and

589
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:46,720
waste and

590
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,840
all of the things that that are

591
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,240
necessary to keep us going um and so

592
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,960
that

593
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,280
is the first uh aspect and then the

594
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,280
second aspect is that living organisms

595
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,919
can be described as stochastic dynamical

596
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,720
systems

597
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,039
possessing attractors and i talked about

598
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,640
uh gaining energy which i thought this

599
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,960
was cool so you have like the the lorenz

600
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,720
attractor here um and in this space like

601
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,200
you know

602
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,600
if you add energy it like brings a

603
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,640
difference

604
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,799
like state that the organism can be in

605
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,640
right so so the addition of energy

606
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,880
you can add start adding points in this

607
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,400
space and like

608
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,480
in infinite entropy like the whole

609
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,480
trajectory would be black right like

610
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,960
you could occupy any point in this phase

611
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,760
space

612
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,000
so so that is you know the expansion of

613
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,240
the phase space by the addition of of

614
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,280
energy and

615
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,679
then the you know the reduction of that

616
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:36,720
um space

617
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,960
is an increase in in certainty right

618
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,840
like you can only

619
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,039
you know once you start down a

620
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,960
developmental trajectory like

621
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,360
there's only so many you know like paths

622
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,400
you can follow

623
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,039
and so it's your you know trajectory has

624
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:49,520
been

625
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,760
reduced contracted your space has been

626
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,160
reduced in that in that way

627
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,280
and then the third essential point was

628
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,880
that the states in which the

629
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,720
self-organizing system

630
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,080
is is at a point in or are in at a point

631
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,559
in time

632
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,400
can be identified by the interactive

633
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,919
role that they play within the

634
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,720
multi-level self-organization scheme

635
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,960
and like you know daniel that i'm very

636
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,320
uh interested in

637
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,000
the multi-scale uh possibility of agency

638
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,240
and

639
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,840
and systemness and and all that so at

640
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,720
every level

641
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,120
you know from the molecular level to the

642
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,559
cellular level to the

643
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,039
brain to the organism uh to groups of

644
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,039
organisms and so forth i think that

645
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:31,760
that's all

646
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,280
you know those are all self-organizing

647
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,200
systems

648
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,280
nice now where does the free energy

649
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,960
principle come into play

650
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,200
or where do we go because those are

651
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,640
three of the coolest

652
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,360
aspects of complex systems it's probably

653
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,799
what drew us both to

654
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,360
complexity where we met is through being

655
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,120
attracted to these kinds of questions

656
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,559
because it's kind of like a community of

657
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,520
people who

658
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,159
like topics like self-organization

659
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,240
dynamical systems and chaotic systems

660
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,520
strange attractors

661
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,559
multi-scale systems emergence like those

662
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,760
are kind of the key

663
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,440
pieces so i like that the fvp

664
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,080
starts with it's it's being based upon

665
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,640
these

666
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,799
observations and then it's going to

667
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:13,919
build on

668
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,640
that so it's kind of like taking the

669
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,600
complexity

670
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,200
not as an endpoint but as a beginning

671
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,799
point so that's one thing that i think

672
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,080
is really fun about

673
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,200
fep so how are we gonna bring fep into

674
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,520
this

675
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,919
specific setup as far as here's what we

676
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,200
know that we have to explain

677
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,640
we don't have to explain a single or

678
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,200
double pendulum we have to explain this

679
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,559
so where does figure one come into play

680
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,039
in relationship to those aspects or

681
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,000
anything else

682
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,840
well so let me add to this slide first

683
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,320
so the the fep where it really comes

684
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,320
into play is is because it's focused on

685
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,600
entropy reduction right it's focusing on

686
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,840
you know that this the state that the

687
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,960
organism assumes

688
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,000
is is that of of the reduced entropy of

689
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,159
the least entropy right so it's the the

690
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,000
minimization of free energy through

691
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,960
entropy reduction

692
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,640
so so that's that's that on this and

693
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,080
then on the next slide

694
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,600
um you know as we get into figure one

695
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,840
they they talk about the um active

696
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,000
states and the sensory states

697
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,559
of organisms so this really will go into

698
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,240
the free energy equation although the

699
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,760
equation's not discussed here they do

700
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,000
discuss some elements of it

701
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,440
so there's internal states of the

702
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,840
organism active states

703
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,559
sensory states and external states of

704
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,720
the organism and so this is like really

705
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,280
the patterned activity of every organism

706
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,440
it's perceived through the environment

707
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,600
uh the the active states are really what

708
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,880
the organism is doing

709
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,640
and then the sensory states are what the

710
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,280
organism is perceiving

711
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,039
and then there's blanket states right so

712
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,799
the blanket states are

713
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,440
all the hidden states of the world the

714
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,400
active states

715
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,039
the noise of the random fluctuations and

716
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,080
this is

717
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,919
the internal states and the blanket

718
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,240
states go to minimize the free energy

719
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,640
those two things together

720
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,960
so this is like you know how it's a

721
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,799
formal way the free energy is a formal

722
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:03,760
way of

723
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,960
measuring the surprise and surprise not

724
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,400
in the information theory

725
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,880
uh way not surprised as in like an

726
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,640
entropy reduction so it's important i

727
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,640
think to make that distinction

728
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,679
um but but it minimizes surprise between

729
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,159
the prediction and the the actual

730
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,280
reality

731
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,679
so the surprises is like that divergence

732
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:24,400
right the

733
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,520
kubrick kublai blur divergence between

734
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,799
those two um you know the surprise

735
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,080
uh is is that the divergence between um

736
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,440
the posterior and the essentially

737
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,400
thank you thank you for that let me try

738
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,520
from a different angle yeah

739
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,360
sure so yeah we're coming from the

740
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,440
scientific modeling literature

741
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,320
not the graphical bayesian literature

742
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,200
those are cited

743
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,760
but in this paper it's being approached

744
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,400
and kind of

745
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,640
reflected upon from this philosophy of

746
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,960
science and almost history of ideas

747
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,159
away so last time in 14 we talked about

748
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,159
wanting to cut nature at the joints

749
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,440
because we wanted to understand what

750
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,760
kind of things were what kind of things

751
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,840
things were and we wanted to be able to

752
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,279
model them effectively

753
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,440
now we're going to be thinking about

754
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,400
using this

755
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,840
markov blanket formalism that partitions

756
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,679
external and internal states but that's

757
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,360
kind of really like saying that we're

758
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,880
defining an interface and there's two

759
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,400
sides to the interface

760
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,440
because it can be symmetrical in a sense

761
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,279
so we're defining an interface which

762
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,279
implies an internal and external

763
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,400
partitioning

764
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,440
and this is going to allow us to

765
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,320
do modeling in a way that is multi-scale

766
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:36,960
because

767
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,760
different kinds of nodes internal can be

768
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,360
internal to each other

769
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,559
so you can have hierarchy or nestedness

770
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,440
of modeling

771
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,960
so it's kind of like like having a ton

772
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,880
of small little computers running and

773
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,279
then

774
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,880
another computer could be like on top of

775
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,320
them coordinating them

776
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,799
so those kinds of hierarchical models

777
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:55,360
can be

778
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,880
done with this type of uh markov blanket

779
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,200
interface definition framework because

780
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,480
you can have internal states that

781
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:02,960
consist

782
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,279
of multiple things so that's nesting

783
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,080
hierarchy

784
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,080
you can also have hierarchy or

785
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,760
collective behavior or interactions

786
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,799
between subunits

787
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,600
because the external states of agents or

788
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,400
nodes

789
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,880
can be other agents like themselves or

790
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,640
different things like the environment

791
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,320
so there's this massive amount of

792
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,559
systems such as interacting agents or

793
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,240
agent environment feedbacks

794
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,799
that you can think of with an interface

795
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,279
in mind and then it lets you

796
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,600
get at this question of modeling in a

797
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,400
way that's

798
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
multi-scale can deal with arbitrary

799
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,760
dynamics you could have the internal

800
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,200
states could be arbitrary it could be a

801
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,919
flat

802
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,840
wave it could be a sine wave it could be

803
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,120
a jimi hendrix song

804
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,039
you know it could be anything because

805
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,559
it's defined in kind of

806
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,279
the most skeletal way so this is like

807
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,559
the body plan

808
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,200
for one layer but then in other papers

809
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,679
by

810
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,840
maxwell and ramstad and others we've

811
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,440
seen how that kind of plays out in a

812
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,200
multi-scale way

813
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,039
because that's like the beyond

814
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,720
internalism and externalism

815
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,320
paper where we talked about this in the

816
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,720
multi-scale way and then that was just

817
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,159
on one slide ago on the bottom right

818
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,559
was the multi-scale question so we know

819
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,919
that we're dealing with multi-scale so

820
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,360
when you're looking at figure one

821
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,279
it's kind of like you're thinking about

822
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,440
one ant interacting with the environment

823
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,360
but just know that we're fully taking

824
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,360
into account this multi-scale

825
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,440
approach that's also gonna come along

826
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,039
with the generative model and this

827
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,360
action selection the policy and the

828
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,080
surprise

829
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,919
so there's a lot of features to it and

830
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,279
this is a simple figure

831
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,200
we've seen these kinds of figures before

832
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,480
and there's always more things to say

833
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,000
about it and also if people in the live

834
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,120
chat have any

835
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,440
thoughts or questions we can say those

836
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,320
or anything

837
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,960
anything else to say on one blue no i'm

838
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,360
good

839
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,039
nice it's just it speaks a lot that

840
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,840
with one figure two very thoughtful

841
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,159
authors

842
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,200
put this because there's a i don't know

843
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,919
if it's

844
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,400
uh citable or not but you know data on

845
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,120
how even

846
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,520
one equation will reduce the amount of

847
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,200
people who will like read a paper

848
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,919
sad but true so when putting figures

849
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:06,799
with math

850
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,120
it's just it really has to be done

851
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,039
appropriately and this is an example of

852
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,520
that's very elegant in what it conveys

853
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,440
and in it what it opens the door to

854
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,000
so whatever you're seeing in the figure

855
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,039
it's what's there

856
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,880
the caption just describes what the

857
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,640
parameters are but again

858
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,559
whether real systems are doing that

859
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,720
realism or whether this is just a

860
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,840
graphical model

861
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,080
that we're applying like any other

862
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,120
graphical model

863
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,240
in statisticalandia that's the topic

864
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,080
of this paper so if you want to learn

865
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,520
more about the technical details then

866
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,360
that's where the citations lead you

867
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,720
but we're looking at this and we're

868
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,640
asking what would it mean if the world

869
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,399
was actually doing this what would it

870
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,080
mean if this was how we could approach

871
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,679
systems like a scientific instrument

872
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,880
that's the discussion blue so so i do

873
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,600
think that this

874
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,240
this figure like you know it just takes

875
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,799
all of

876
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,320
everything that you've ever known about

877
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,000
the free energy principle and like puts

878
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,600
it in front of you in a very simple and

879
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,880
elegant way like it's like

880
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,880
you just want to unload like brain dump

881
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,000
all of your your

882
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,520
fep knowledge at a simple figure and so

883
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,159
it's very you know minimalist which lets

884
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:10,880
you

885
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,640
it makes it accessible right for for

886
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,080
people whatever their level

887
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,880
of you know mathematical background

888
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,320
which i think is really cool

889
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,880
if i were going to read this by the

890
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,559
numbers by the colors

891
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,399
so each of the things has a slightly

892
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:25,840
different color

893
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,279
so that's reflecting that they're

894
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,200
similar like they're squoval

895
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,039
boxes but they're different types of

896
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,720
things which is true

897
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,440
um they have a single letter in the

898
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,360
equation so each of them is defined by a

899
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,240
single letter

900
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,240
that's related to some other function so

901
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,679
it's kind of like you know

902
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,520
x number of pizzas that we have to order

903
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,360
equals dot

904
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,799
it's like one of those things but it's

905
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,440
related to that color of the squival

906
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,600
and then there's the same kind of

907
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
relationship with a barbell

908
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,919
that relates internal and active states

909
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,000
as sensory in external states

910
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,200
and then there's a similar kind of

911
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,279
relationship how sensory states

912
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,799
influence internal states and active

913
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,640
states influence external states

914
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,559
and then there's a sort of relationship

915
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,760
between with an

916
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,600
arrow a new kind of relationship between

917
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,880
active and sensory states

918
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,120
so this by headed arrow to me in the

919
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,960
middle is the definition of the

920
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,760
interface

921
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,320
because as we talked about in 14 the

922
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,120
markov blanket

923
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,679
had the interpretation of just

924
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,200
statistically insulating nodes

925
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,600
and then later on fristen separated that

926
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,840
into incoming or sensory states

927
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,399
outgoing or active states and then

928
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,679
internal states

929
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,039
act uh impinge upon the interfaces

930
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,200
active states like that sort of like you

931
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,399
know the internal we can think of as the

932
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,159
brain and active states being the arm

933
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,760
the same way the brain sends signals to

934
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,360
the arm that's the way that the

935
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,200
ecosystem the external states is like

936
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,600
sending signals to the sensory modality

937
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,080
so that's the trees green going into

938
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,799
your retina

939
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,039
just at a first pass so the internal

940
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,880
state influences action states just like

941
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,919
external states

942
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,919
influence sensory states what do sensory

943
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,159
states do they update internal states

944
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,679
and what do action states do

945
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,840
they update external states so there's

946
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,600
so much that you can really say and i

947
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,360
agree it's a minimal prompt that helps

948
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,279
coalesce a lot of understanding

949
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,760
and there's just four boxes and a couple

950
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,080
of lines

951
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,520
okay table one so this is the kind of

952
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,760
the crux of the debate and it's awesome

953
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,399
to see a philosophy paper with a table

954
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,720
because it lays it out starkly so

955
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,000
instead of just saying

956
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,480
this chapter or this subheader or this

957
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,440
paragraph

958
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,480
this is a and b this is a but not b so

959
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,240
here we're just seeing it in a graphical

960
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,559
way and with acronyms and the letters

961
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,240
kind of look similar a little bit at

962
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,000
least to me so we're gonna

963
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,720
colorize them um and also just make it

964
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,919
very clear which one we're

965
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,600
talking about but basically it's a two

966
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,159
by two so kind of like a punnett square

967
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,360
and or an eisenhower matrix and it has

968
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:53,840
the two

969
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,440
options for each of the dimensions that

970
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,679
we care about so on the top

971
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,840
columns are whether we're talking about

972
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,360
realistic realism

973
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,080
theories models that are have realism or

974
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,279
an instrumentalism

975
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,480
approach to modeling in the fep and then

976
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,600
the rows

977
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,559
are whether we think about things

978
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:12,799
representationalism

979
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,640
so do we think there's representations

980
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,200
occurring or non-representationist

981
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,200
and then you have the four combinations

982
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,440
of the three letter schemes rep

983
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,679
rhea et cetera et cetera so what would

984
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,440
you say about that blue before we look

985
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,640
at it a little more

986
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,240
uh visually uh just that

987
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,240
it's very um cool how they kind of

988
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,600
restrict the representationalism and the

989
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,080
non-representationalism and

990
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,519
because they're gonna really take that

991
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,120
out of the

992
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,240
equation at a later time so um not

993
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,679
really much else to say

994
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,760
but other than you know that there's

995
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,519
different combinations that can exist

996
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,440
right the representational realism

997
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,480
rep rea non-representational realism

998
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,519
which is nrp

999
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,880
rea representationalist instrumentalism

1000
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,320
and non-representationalist

1001
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,399
instrumentalism so the representational

1002
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,159
standpoint representing

1003
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,519
like where you're using a representation

1004
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,360
of the object as opposed to the object

1005
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,200
itself like where you're perceiving

1006
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,760
the orange like your mind map or your

1007
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,440
mental map of the orange versus the

1008
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,720
actual orange

1009
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,799
uh and then realism and instrumentalism

1010
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,000
being um

1011
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,399
you know the realism is is implemented

1012
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,440
directly

1013
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,760
and instrumentalism is implemented as a

1014
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,760
statistical tool or model

1015
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,559
something like that and if it's too many

1016
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:31,600
syllables

1017
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,640
just think realism yes no

1018
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,000
representation yes no or there's longer

1019
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,880
words on the other

1020
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,760
sides let's look at it in a graphical

1021
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,000
way

1022
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,799
and also it's it's it's not um for

1023
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:45,600
granted

1024
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,600
that you could make a two by two or make

1025
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,440
a orthogonal axis

1026
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,200
because there might be two philosophical

1027
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,279
ideas that are correlated like one

1028
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,480
implies the other

1029
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,399
but for the purposes of a paper

1030
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,320
sometimes what somebody will do will be

1031
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,679
lay out two options like um the plant

1032
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,200
could either be influenced by nitrogen

1033
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,679
or not

1034
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,000
by light or not and then you use that to

1035
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,760
study what the plant needs or how two

1036
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,360
factors are related to each other

1037
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,919
well here we're studying how two ideas

1038
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,000
two continuums of ideas

1039
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,600
are related to each other and so it

1040
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,679
might turn out that some quadrants or

1041
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:18,720
some combinations

1042
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,000
are mandated some are prohibited some

1043
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,360
are

1044
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,960
not preferable or preferable for some

1045
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,880
other reason so you lay out the two by

1046
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,440
two

1047
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,200
or you lay out the higher dimensions of

1048
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,640
combining thought

1049
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,640
and then you ask what are the pros and

1050
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,799
cons of each of these areas

1051
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,440
so here we have the x-axis is the

1052
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,000
realist

1053
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,480
on the left instrumentalist on the right

1054
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,120
and then

1055
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,159
the fep options for representationalism

1056
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,200
are the y-axis

1057
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,279
representationalist higher and

1058
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,880
non-representation is lower

1059
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,480
and drumroll the contention

1060
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,600
of the authors as screenshotted in this

1061
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,679
section 5 conclusion so always awesome

1062
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:58,880
when the first sentence of like a

1063
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,360
section

1064
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,559
actually is a summary in this paper we

1065
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,320
have defended the instrumentalist take

1066
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,200
on the fep

1067
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,960
arguing that the realist approach is a

1068
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,760
non-starter so it doesn't go

1069
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,119
regardless of whether it is

1070
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,800
representationalist or not

1071
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,639
so these big x's with a question mark

1072
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,639
because we're not saying it's the end

1073
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,879
that's not our take it's not even the

1074
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,079
end point for the authors

1075
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,239
or the community per se just that's what

1076
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,520
the paper is about

1077
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,520
is saying no matter what you think about

1078
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,800
representationalism

1079
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,399
so no matter where you fall on the

1080
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,480
y-axis

1081
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,119
realism is a non-starter so realism is

1082
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:33,760
not going to work

1083
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,399
anything with rea is not going to work

1084
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,719
anything to the left on over this is not

1085
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,000
going to be a tenable

1086
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,719
approach for the fep and we would do

1087
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,520
better off

1088
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,119
to hang out on the right side here with

1089
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,440
instrumentalism where there is a debate

1090
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,520
or there's more to be understood about

1091
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,800
representationalism

1092
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,918
but let's be clear that fep is being

1093
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:54,480
approached

1094
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,639
instrumentally rather than with a

1095
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,480
realistic research agenda

1096
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,640
or interpretation paradigm what does

1097
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,839
that make you think about blue

1098
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,920
just um you know in some ways like

1099
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,599
like it just it brings up a lot of stuff

1100
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,280
right everyone has like maybe what they

1101
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:11,760
think

1102
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,040
so in the instrumentalist um

1103
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,280
you know from that framework right it's

1104
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,520
it's a model or a tool that we can use

1105
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,880
not something that's actually

1106
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,119
implemented like say by the brain right

1107
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,200
so so the brain's not actually

1108
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,160
using the fep to do thought like

1109
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,200
processes

1110
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,440
but you know you know we can always make

1111
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,960
it real right like so

1112
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,520
so we can take the you know statistical

1113
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,920
tool or model and put it into a computer

1114
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,079
and then it actually does use that right

1115
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,040
and so so then

1116
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,359
you know there's always ways to you know

1117
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,960
abstract realism from

1118
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,119
from the instrumentalism uh you know in

1119
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,560
constructing something that runs on the

1120
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,920
model

1121
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,880
maybe that's not biological very

1122
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,640
interesting question so it's almost like

1123
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,640
if you had a state machine

1124
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,800
um and then you had a mathematical model

1125
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,079
of it it would be

1126
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,079
almost a realistic mathematical model or

1127
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,760
it might be a comprehensive

1128
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,480
and then yeah when we um and we talked

1129
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,599
about the metaphor

1130
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,640
reification and about how sometimes when

1131
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,079
there's a conflation of the map in the

1132
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,000
territory or there's only one map for a

1133
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,960
territory

1134
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,280
so people start navigating off of that

1135
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,560
what does that do

1136
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,720
and then how do we know that we're in

1137
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,079
that situation that we're in the

1138
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:22,880
epicycle

1139
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,400
situation where there could be a

1140
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,480
breakout into a whole different way

1141
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,359
of thinking on a topic but we're just

1142
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:30,640
seeing within the

1143
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,400
bounds of how we think about the system

1144
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,240
really being or what instruments we

1145
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,760
really have access to

1146
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,920
let's look at some of the quotes because

1147
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,960
it's worth

1148
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,599
going into if if the fep is an

1149
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,480
instrument

1150
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,880
shop if it's more like a music shop you

1151
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,400
know than the

1152
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,960
the hall of reality what are those

1153
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,599
instruments

1154
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,040
so what will the fep instrumentalize as

1155
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,359
how's it gonna gonna be manifested and

1156
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,960
then what will allow us to do

1157
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,640
why does that matter because if we were

1158
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,400
going down the realist rabbit hole

1159
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,920
we could ask questions like well what

1160
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,359
does that mean for the meaning of life

1161
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:03,680
or

1162
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,880
what does that say about how we should

1163
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,560
live a good life or how does that relate

1164
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,320
to the trolley car problem or something

1165
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,240
now we could still ask those questions

1166
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,560
but if we first go the instrumentalist

1167
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,680
route we'd be like saying

1168
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,480
okay let's model the trolley car problem

1169
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,400
not thinking that it's actually this way

1170
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,839
but

1171
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,200
and then you could still be clear about

1172
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,839
where your non-fep derived

1173
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,320
value system arose from because just

1174
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,160
like any other model linear aggression

1175
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,800
anova it's incomplete without a little

1176
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,520
bit more

1177
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,280
on that side and that's really something

1178
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,800
that's coming more and more into focus

1179
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,640
with ai ethics and

1180
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,520
how data is being utilized in society so

1181
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,119
it's pretty interesting to talk about

1182
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,520
those things all right do you want to

1183
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,720
read this

1184
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,720
full page quotation with the aim where

1185
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,480
the authors again thankfully lay out the

1186
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,640
aim of their paper

1187
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,200
sure the aim of this paper is to show

1188
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,720
that philosophically

1189
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,240
instrumentalist thinking is less

1190
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,800
controversial yet remains explanatory

1191
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,400
powerful and can yield important

1192
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,000
insights in an organism

1193
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,800
environment dynamics an instrumentalist

1194
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,119
attitude about the fep is a safer bet

1195
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,640
without losing the potentially high

1196
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,599
returns

1197
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,359
after briefly describing the fep in

1198
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,760
section 2 we assess two proposals

1199
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,079
made in the realest logical space that

1200
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,000
of representational realism

1201
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,760
and non-representational realism in

1202
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,320
section 3. we reject both of them and in

1203
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,480
section 4 we proceed to offer positive

1204
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,640
reasons to embrace instrumentalism about

1205
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,000
the fep

1206
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,079
given the activity dependence feature of

1207
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,440
neuronal activity

1208
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,839
dynamic causal modeling under the fep

1209
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,280
seems to be the most suitable and

1210
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,040
promising set of instruments

1211
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,800
to preserve the character of neuronal

1212
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,800
activation as we empirically know it to

1213
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,440
be

1214
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,839
activity and coupled systems from this

1215
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:44,480
angle

1216
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,240
realist arguments look like forcing the

1217
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,920
world to conform with the

1218
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,240
anthropomorphic instrumental lens we use

1219
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,079
to make sense of it

1220
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,760
cool so one note is the defining two

1221
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,880
kinds of realism

1222
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,640
representational or not again we're kind

1223
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,240
of rehashing some of the same

1224
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,839
discussions because the strange

1225
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,599
attractor is the paper we're gonna keep

1226
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,880
returning to this because you could

1227
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,359
study

1228
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,440
your whole life so if you think that you

1229
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,400
haven't heard the word

1230
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,720
enough in two hours then wait till it's

1231
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,720
been thinking about it for two years

1232
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,400
and this reminds me of just going to a

1233
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,079
restaurant it's like you could just say

1234
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:16,960
no i don't want

1235
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,599
soup and then here it's like there's two

1236
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,040
kinds of soup and i don't want

1237
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,320
soup a or soup b it's like you divide

1238
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,560
to conquer instead of just saying we

1239
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,920
think instrumentalism is better than

1240
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,480
realism

1241
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,119
paper's done they actually said there's

1242
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,560
there's more there's nuance to the

1243
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,000
realist position

1244
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,079
and we're going to give a strong

1245
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,119
presentation

1246
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,200
of why somebody would honestly believe

1247
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,400
that realism works for various reasons

1248
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,320
and then we're going to individually

1249
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,920
respond to the

1250
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,040
uh unique realist perspectives maybe

1251
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,000
there's more than two

1252
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,599
there's other axes that you could go

1253
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,520
into uh defining but we're going to

1254
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,800
actually uniquely respond

1255
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,119
to why different kinds of realists are

1256
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,000
realists

1257
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,599
rather than just only looking at the

1258
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,520
realist instrumentalist number line

1259
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,440
and just saying instrumentalism's better

1260
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,359
because it's more useful duh

1261
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,920
that's less nuanced paper and it's less

1262
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,960
useful because it

1263
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,200
doesn't really help us understand why

1264
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,640
realism is being dismissed

1265
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,119
unilaterally out of hand this is a much

1266
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,720
more nuanced way to deal with the

1267
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,520
question

1268
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,040
and then also i've highlighted the

1269
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,040
dynamic causal modeling

1270
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,040
because it's going to be discussed as

1271
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,160
kind of the leading

1272
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,040
instrument so again if the fep is to be

1273
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,200
understood in an instrumentalist way

1274
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,640
so it's the music shop with the

1275
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,520
instruments what are the instruments

1276
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,200
what have people done with them do they

1277
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
not exist is it an empty music shop

1278
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,000
where people are saying

1279
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,240
just come and build music things we

1280
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,119
don't know what it's going to look like

1281
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:41,760
yet or

1282
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,599
is there something already there and

1283
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:44,560
could there be something that looks

1284
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,000
different or is it going to only look

1285
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,640
similar

1286
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,119
those are the kinds of questions that in

1287
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,319
early 2021

1288
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,400
were wondering aren't we any other

1289
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,839
questions or thoughts on this blue

1290
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,200
before we go into

1291
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,800
dynamic causal modeling a little bit

1292
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,440
more in detail no let's take it away

1293
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,720
yep okay so dynamic causal modeling

1294
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,640
we often hear things like well where's

1295
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,240
like the textbook on

1296
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,280
fap or active inference or what are the

1297
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,880
sections that are related to understand

1298
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,680
it

1299
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,000
or it's something that we all want to

1300
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,119
improve the state of and

1301
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,480
again it's one of the main projects in

1302
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,880
our lab to be developing educational

1303
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,760
material and

1304
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,720
bodies of knowledge that being said if

1305
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,319
dynamic causal modeling

1306
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,880
as posited by the authors really is the

1307
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,839
leading

1308
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,400
implementation of the instrumentalist

1309
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,359
fep

1310
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,440
then it would make sense to understand a

1311
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,400
little bit about

1312
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,960
what dynamic causal models are because

1313
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,960
these are ultimately the form

1314
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,200
or the type of models that you're going

1315
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,319
to be discussing

1316
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,640
so if we've dispensed with the fep as

1317
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,240
describing how the system

1318
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,560
is with a realist lens we're going to be

1319
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,319
modeling the stock market using active

1320
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:50,880
inference

1321
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,319
using the fep but we're going to be

1322
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:53,760
using it instrumentally we weren't

1323
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,040
saying that the stock market

1324
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,520
was linear aggressions or was arima

1325
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,359
models so we're not saying that it is

1326
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,119
fep we're just saying that we're going

1327
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,400
to explain variants

1328
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,160
we're going to explain design predict

1329
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,520
control better

1330
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,240
because the fep so what will it look

1331
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,920
like beyond the metaphor

1332
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,560
and just thinking about it in a cool way

1333
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:12,960
well

1334
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,800
it's going to look like dynamic causal

1335
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,800
modeling that's what is going to be

1336
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,040
discussed in this paper so this book

1337
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,079
from 2007

1338
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,359
i think it might be the most recent

1339
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,920
version statistical parametric mapping

1340
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,280
or spm

1341
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,920
is a long running tool kit that's been

1342
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,720
developed by

1343
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,680
carl fristen and others in relationship

1344
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,160
to

1345
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,680
this dynamic causal modeling framework

1346
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,680
so dynamic causal models are kind of the

1347
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,520
statistical family of models

1348
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,839
and statistical parametric mapping is

1349
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,680
first off spm that's the name of the

1350
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,280
toolkit in matlab

1351
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,440
as we've discussed in the model streams

1352
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,480
python and other

1353
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,079
languages are being developed for this

1354
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,680
as well so we're not going to go into

1355
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,119
that right now

1356
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,880
it's called the statistical parametric

1357
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,040
map because

1358
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,520
given the dynamic causal model that's

1359
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,640
being inferred

1360
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,280
this spm package puts a layer of

1361
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,720
statistics over that

1362
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,280
and it asks from a parametric statistic

1363
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,839
perspective like a p-value perspective

1364
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,400
just again this is a whole like 800 page

1365
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,599
textbook so there's just like

1366
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,079
two sentences it does statistics on

1367
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:17,440
these kinds of models

1368
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,280
so that entails not just specifying

1369
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,119
these models but specifying

1370
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,319
what fields of models they exist within

1371
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:25,920
and a lot of other attributes it's not

1372
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,359
the same just to write out one models to

1373
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,800
do statistics but that's what this book

1374
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,440
is for

1375
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,599
now what is the form of these models

1376
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:32,720
there's other

1377
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,960
cousins and colleagues but this is one

1378
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,440
of the core forms in dcm

1379
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,319
there's two coupled equations the first

1380
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:41,440
top equation

1381
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,480
has z which is neural activity we can

1382
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,920
see from this caption

1383
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,599
that the change in neural activity so it

1384
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,119
could be dz or z dot

1385
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,079
just its neural activity is hidden it

1386
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,680
cannot be directly observed using

1387
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,119
non-invasive functioning

1388
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,280
imaging modalities so it could represent

1389
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,800
neural firing but it can actually

1390
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,440
represent just

1391
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,040
any hidden underlying unobserved state

1392
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,760
and that underlying hidden state is a

1393
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,960
function of

1394
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,040
itself at the prior moment and in the

1395
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,000
past that's

1396
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,520
the previous z its own value basically

1397
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,560
then you are the experimental inputs

1398
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,640
so that's the things you added nitrogen

1399
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,560
and you're inferring the ecosystem

1400
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,480
so that's this kind of idea and then

1401
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,480
theta is the number of parameters

1402
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,880
in this fitted model and again we're not

1403
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,079
talking about reality

1404
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,440
we're instrumentalist so these

1405
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,280
parameters are just a heuristic

1406
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,760
8 is better fitting than 12 okay then

1407
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,040
that's how many we're going to use we're

1408
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,079
not making claims

1409
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,560
we're getting hung up on that this z

1410
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,400
hidden underlying equation that has to

1411
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,119
be fit

1412
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,240
just like you didn't observe the

1413
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,440
regression line you're not going to

1414
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,200
observe the dynamical z

1415
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,440
but you're fitting it with data then

1416
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,960
what data are you fitting it with

1417
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,040
you're fitting it with with y which is

1418
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,280
the observed activity it can be unimodal

1419
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,040
or it could be multiple kinds of

1420
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,319
time series but it can handle multiple

1421
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,880
different types of time series together

1422
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,359
like

1423
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:05,040
eeg fmri meg with different types of

1424
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:05,359
time

1425
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,800
series being overlaid with different

1426
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,680
types of uh dynamics and sampling rates

1427
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,560
and everything

1428
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,599
and that under that observable y

1429
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,880
function is a different functions g

1430
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,520
related to inferring this underlying

1431
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,800
hidden neural state

1432
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,599
plus parameters of the statistical model

1433
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:26,880
with a noise term

1434
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,000
that can be modality specific so

1435
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,480
that's almost like if it's really true

1436
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,000
that the fvp is instrumentalist

1437
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,520
then it's really true that we should

1438
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,119
think about things this way

1439
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,599
with like a hidden component here with

1440
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:40,880
change in hidden variable

1441
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,319
being related to the hidden variable

1442
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,400
state and other features inputs and

1443
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,240
other features like attributes

1444
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,800
and then we're observing and it turns

1445
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,440
out that this

1446
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,400
minimal two equation set is going to be

1447
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,920
really helpful because it allows us to

1448
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,760
make an arbitrarily complex

1449
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,720
z whether we know nothing or a ton about

1450
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,359
z

1451
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,680
we can arbitrarily lay that out and then

1452
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,560
we can have y

1453
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,920
be very scarce or very noisy or

1454
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,720
just only have y for 15 minutes so it's

1455
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,839
going to open up

1456
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,960
a lot of types of models that are

1457
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,800
with one aspect that we didn't see and

1458
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,040
then a semi-related aspect that we did

1459
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,680
see

1460
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,599
okay any thoughts on that blue before we

1461
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,240
look at a few dcm examples

1462
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,520
no go ahead let's go okay so this is

1463
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,079
an example of going even more one layer

1464
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,920
more specific now we're looking at

1465
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,119
a dcm paper looking at specific brain

1466
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,000
regions

1467
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,599
so one thing that's really important

1468
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,280
about the dcm

1469
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,480
framework is where it had the

1470
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,560
experimental inputs so again we're

1471
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,079
instrumentalists not realist so we don't

1472
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:43,440
think that these connections

1473
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,440
reflect like where the neurons are

1474
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,960
touching it doesn't say this is what

1475
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,000
causes what

1476
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,839
it's parameters that we're fitting in a

1477
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,040
model and so

1478
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,640
the way that you ask does a influence be

1479
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,160
in the dcm framework is is it a better

1480
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:58,960
model

1481
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,720
when i have a statistical influence

1482
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,160
between a and b

1483
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,000
rather than the statistical model where

1484
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,160
that's absent which by definition is

1485
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,040
simpler

1486
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,560
but so if it explains the same amount of

1487
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,319
variance then the simpler model is

1488
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:11,359
preferred

1489
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,839
however if there's a significantly more

1490
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,680
amount of variance explained by the more

1491
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,800
nuanced model

1492
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,280
then it's equivalent to saying there is

1493
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,880
statistical evidence that a

1494
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,599
and b are influencing each other and so

1495
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:24,240
this is

1496
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,920
something that's really cool in this

1497
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,520
textbook and in this paper

1498
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,280
where they talk about psychophysical

1499
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,880
interactions and so

1500
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,839
in this case they're looking at a few

1501
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,200
different brain regions

1502
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,240
which are the nodes like stg you know

1503
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,000
superior temporal gyrus and a couple of

1504
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,400
other

1505
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,599
visual areas and visual associated areas

1506
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,400
and then each of those underlying hidden

1507
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:46,960
actual

1508
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,680
neural regions are emitting a y which in

1509
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,440
this case is the voxel

1510
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,160
of data for fmri so there's like a time

1511
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,400
series of intensity with a bold signal

1512
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,839
we're not going into fmri but it's a

1513
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,440
time series of intensity

1514
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,839
that's emitted by an underlying

1515
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:02,559
something

1516
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,000
that could have a very very different

1517
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,400
profile than the actual emitted signal

1518
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,240
because of how fmri is measured and all

1519
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,680
these things like that

1520
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,640
then they can ask in two conditions

1521
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,720
where the same visual input is happening

1522
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,400
so it will be like a field of things

1523
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,160
moving or there's different visual

1524
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,760
assays again we're also not going into

1525
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,440
that you can have two conditions

1526
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,119
one of them where the participant is

1527
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:24,960
told look at the center

1528
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,720
and the other one where the participant

1529
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,160
is told do this

1530
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,079
something else you know look at the far

1531
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,240
side or track the moving dot

1532
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,440
that is going to be reflected by changes

1533
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,720
in um the visual region potentially as

1534
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,400
well as in other regions

1535
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,440
and then they can look at two different

1536
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,400
instruction sets to highlight whether

1537
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,839
there's a statistical association

1538
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:50,000
between two other areas of the brain

1539
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,280
again it doesn't say anything about

1540
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,480
whether they're actually connected with

1541
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,200
neurons

1542
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,520
but it highlights a dynamical or a

1543
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,359
functional dependency

1544
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,599
doing these kinds of nuanced statistical

1545
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:01,440
models so it's kind of like a structural

1546
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,880
equation model

1547
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,280
but with time series and dynamical

1548
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,760
series and partially observable states

1549
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,520
and uh bayesian networks and a few other

1550
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,119
things

1551
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,160
next slide blue or any other thoughts

1552
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,599
no i'll have a thought at the end but

1553
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:17,280
then okay

1554
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,040
there's two more i think dcm slides this

1555
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,240
is just to we're not going to go through

1556
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:20,880
this one

1557
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,480
this is just like saying that was the

1558
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,880
simple that was 2003 dcm

1559
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,040
with the uh the v1 region this is 2019

1560
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,440
dcm dynamic causal modeling revisited

1561
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,640
narrow image first in

1562
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,079
all 2019 so it has become implemented

1563
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:36,559
with

1564
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,599
things that are very interesting

1565
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:43,200
and it's a very nuanced model so look

1566
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,359
at what the developmental trajectory has

1567
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,599
been and it kind of makes sense

1568
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,680
how more and more features like the

1569
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,280
presynaptic and the postsynaptic

1570
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,079
dynamics

1571
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,200
could be incorporated within this course

1572
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,880
scaffold so that's why it's really

1573
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,000
important to start with the right

1574
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,599
generalizations because then it can get

1575
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:00,319
nuanced

1576
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,880
you know 20 years down the line and then

1577
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,480
this paper just the last point on the

1578
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,240
dcms just to give one example of the

1579
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,680
applications of dcm

1580
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,240
because again if it's instrumentalist

1581
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:10,800
then

1582
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,160
we want the instrumentalist uh uh we

1583
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,359
want the instruments that are useful

1584
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:16,720
we want the financial instruments

1585
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,240
musical instruments carpentry

1586
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:18,720
instruments

1587
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,800
that work so what can we actually do

1588
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,920
with dcm

1589
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,319
and papers like this one in 2013 and

1590
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,000
other more recent ones

1591
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,319
show how we can actually use free energy

1592
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:29,920
fitting of models

1593
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,280
so we talk about free energy

1594
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,200
minimization on big data sets

1595
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,280
or we're talking about whether there's

1596
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,800
free energy minimization happening in

1597
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,720
the context of organismal behavior

1598
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,520
again instrumentally not realistically

1599
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,000
that

1600
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,839
free energy minimization can be

1601
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,319
understood as navigating this trade-off

1602
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:49,119
with accuracy minus complexity and so

1603
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,720
we're going to use this free energy

1604
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,680
minimization

1605
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,720
on graphs of dynamically associating

1606
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,680
brain regions

1607
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,119
as acid by neuroimaging and then use

1608
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:00,400
free energy

1609
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,760
to fit this vast family of models down

1610
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,680
into something that's on that manifold

1611
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,599
that's kind of like pareto optimal

1612
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,280
with respect to accuracy minus

1613
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,160
complexity given the experimental design

1614
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,079
and the massive amount that we actually

1615
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:16,559
do know about things like hemodynamics

1616
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:19,280
and the bold responses error dynamics so

1617
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,240
i'm going to just

1618
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,240
stop there blue what do you think about

1619
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,680
that

1620
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,599
so i just wanted to say like when you

1621
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,359
know we're talking about fmri

1622
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,960
i don't know if everyone has seen

1623
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,280
pictures of fmri and what that

1624
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,800
looks like but it's you know essentially

1625
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,240
like a black and white picture of the

1626
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,160
brain with little areas of the brain

1627
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,680
that are lit up

1628
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,839
and in in those fmri pictures when you

1629
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:41,599
take that into this realism

1630
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:45,119
versus instrumentalism kind of framework

1631
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,800
it was i was thinking of this

1632
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,359
specifically as i was reading this paper

1633
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:52,079
it really literally says that that the

1634
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:52,880
fmri

1635
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,640
which is like the model of of the

1636
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,960
how the brain perceives the world right

1637
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,440
so in this fmri scan somehow like you

1638
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,960
know the jennifer aniston

1639
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,359
neuron like it should be like a tiny

1640
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:06,480
little picture of

1641
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,319
of jennifer aniston i just like kept

1642
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,920
thinking about that like inside

1643
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,760
the brain in the fmri scan we should

1644
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,520
literally be able to see

1645
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,640
this this realist representationalist

1646
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,480
um like the representation of the tree

1647
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,920
we see outside should be there in the

1648
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,599
fmri scan if it's really

1649
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,760
like falls into that that framework and

1650
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,520
i just i kept having that thought and it

1651
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,240
was like

1652
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,680
recurring and silly nice the jennifer

1653
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,400
aniston

1654
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,559
neural distributed activation pattern

1655
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,480
that was the longer article the editor

1656
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,599
scrapped the headline

1657
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,920
so somebody in the youtube chat wrote

1658
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,359
this and it's just great to hear another

1659
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,200
perspective on free energy while we're

1660
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:41,599
here

1661
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,559
they wrote hi i'm a student in math free

1662
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,400
energy to me is just a moment

1663
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,559
generating function for a probability

1664
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:49,680
distribution

1665
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,680
in feynman's path integration it is a

1666
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,280
generating functional

1667
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,839
in geometry free energy is a generating

1668
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:56,480
function

1669
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,119
for yet more probabilistic information

1670
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:00,079
does this free energy

1671
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:01,599
principle relate to specific

1672
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:03,920
probabilistic information

1673
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,680
so let me while blue you can prepare

1674
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,880
anything if you want but let me just

1675
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,400
work backwards through a few of these

1676
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,400
terms just really quickly yes i would

1677
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,760
say it relates to probabilistic

1678
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,440
information because it's very closely

1679
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,000
related to

1680
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,680
information theory like we're seeing

1681
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,040
gnats on

1682
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,040
this y-axis so we're talking about model

1683
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,040
fitting reduction of uncertainty

1684
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,720
model fitting of probabilistic and

1685
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,640
stochastic variables

1686
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,160
instrumentally so we're in that

1687
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,240
territory and then um

1688
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,119
there's i know a lot of detail that

1689
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:32,640
others with a lot more mathematical

1690
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,079
background could add to

1691
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,440
how the trajectory the path integration

1692
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,319
and how the free energy is like a path

1693
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:41,200
integral

1694
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,160
that's being optimized as far as policy

1695
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,359
because you're not just doing

1696
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:48,079
the instantaneous static optimization so

1697
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,359
it's not like just that first moment

1698
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:49,680
it's

1699
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,280
more like a trajectory of a dynamical

1700
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,880
system and then you mentioned it's a

1701
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,079
generating function

1702
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,400
for more probabilistic information

1703
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,680
there's probably multiple ways to take

1704
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,160
that but

1705
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,119
it seems like we're talking about

1706
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:01,040
generative models and the way that

1707
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,720
generative models even in feedback with

1708
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,079
their environment

1709
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,079
could be generating and uh more

1710
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,119
information and

1711
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:11,200
doing behavior what do you think blue

1712
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,280
um i think that you summarized it quite

1713
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,319
well and i also

1714
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:19,040
i do think that um it's important to

1715
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,359
you know distinguish the surprise as the

1716
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,680
authors did in this paper that surprise

1717
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,040
in the free energy principle is not

1718
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,839
the surprise from information theory

1719
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:30,960
just make that one

1720
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,079
kind of distinction because it's easy to

1721
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,960
conflate those those two things yep and

1722
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,559
as far as feynman specifically i know

1723
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,480
that's the variational

1724
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,799
principle and so we're heavily in the

1725
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:44,240
variational territory

1726
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,680
and variational base vb but

1727
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,880
it would be awesome to have somebody

1728
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,480
with a little more background to answer

1729
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,359
it more

1730
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:54,799
speaking of bays and of models and also

1731
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:57,119
of everyone learning and continuing to

1732
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,000
be on their

1733
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,559
active inference journey how are we all

1734
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:01,440
going to be

1735
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,799
challenged in learning because there's

1736
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,319
so much to learn in philosophy and in

1737
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:05,280
math well

1738
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,119
it's awesome when the paper can give us

1739
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:08,880
both philosophy and math together

1740
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,119
so even though this is a simple equation

1741
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:11,920
for some

1742
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,200
for the two equations that are in this

1743
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,960
paper we're just gonna look at them and

1744
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:15,760
understand

1745
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,520
what they're actually doing in the

1746
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,040
context of the paper

1747
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,040
because again they're speaking to an

1748
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,720
audience including philosophers

1749
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,319
and they've gone out of the way to

1750
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:25,760
include equations

1751
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,200
because this is the clearest way to

1752
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,119
signal what they're thinking about

1753
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:32,079
so here they're talking about rep rhea

1754
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,760
so representations and

1755
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,799
realism so yes for both and

1756
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:39,359
um they write that this rep review comes

1757
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:40,240
in the form of

1758
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,640
process theory offshoots of the fep such

1759
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,920
as predictive coding predictive

1760
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,720
processing

1761
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,440
or more generally pem theories of

1762
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,319
cognition

1763
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:51,200
what is pm prediction error minimization

1764
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,799
right

1765
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:55,119
okay by employing bayesian epistemology

1766
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,720
or using bayesian ways of looking at

1767
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,119
things

1768
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,720
scientists refer to the model of the

1769
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,720
nervous system by using technical terms

1770
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,359
pertaining to the basis theorem as shown

1771
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,000
here

1772
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
so blue what would you say about bayes

1773
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,119
theorem

1774
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:10,400
here so uh just that

1775
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,240
you know to your point about philosophy

1776
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,680
and math i think that that

1777
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,799
really you know this equation um

1778
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:19,040
even for someone like you know i i'm

1779
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,400
teaching my nine-year-old daughter how

1780
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,000
to do math and she would be like that's

1781
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,839
not math

1782
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,920
so really like there's they both come

1783
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,000
down philosophy and math to

1784
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,040
to formal logic which is um really

1785
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,839
kind of highlighted in um in bayes

1786
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:34,640
theorem so

1787
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,680
the theorem really to read it it's

1788
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,480
the probability probability of a given b

1789
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,040
which is

1790
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,960
the left side of the equation is equal

1791
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,880
to the probability of b

1792
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,760
given a like you know if this then that

1793
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,960
right the probability

1794
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,119
of um you know one event in occurrence

1795
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,480
with another

1796
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,119
uh times the probability of a divided by

1797
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,280
the probability of of b

1798
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,720
so so that is the the um the reading of

1799
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,119
the equation and it is like formal logic

1800
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:03,920
like

1801
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,000
you know what are the chances of trying

1802
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,960
to think of a good

1803
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,000
example um if

1804
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,319
uh you know the eagles win the super

1805
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:13,520
bowl

1806
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,680
then their quarterback goes to the pro

1807
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:16,799
bowl like what

1808
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,480
right like so what are the chances of

1809
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,760
what is the probability of that

1810
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,760
quarterback going to the pro bowl

1811
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,160
giving given that team winning the super

1812
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,920
bowl like what are the chances of this

1813
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,720
given that

1814
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,240
and what are the you know and it's the

1815
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,000
probability of what's the probability of

1816
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,200
the eagles winning super bowl

1817
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,640
divided by the probability of um the

1818
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,160
quarterback going to the pro bowl so

1819
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,760
those kinds of of things

1820
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,920
like if one event then another here's

1821
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,760
another take on that is

1822
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,680
when events are independent we know that

1823
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,119
they shouldn't impinge on each other

1824
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:45,520
like

1825
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,200
flip a coin you get heads you roll the

1826
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,119
dice you get a six so it's like

1827
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:51,520
one half chance of getting a heads and

1828
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,440
then one and six of getting

1829
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,359
a six so it's like a twelfth you just

1830
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:56,480
multiply them together

1831
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,720
so that's regular probability numbers

1832
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,839
between zero and one

1833
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:02,319
nothing happening or unlikely to happen

1834
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,160
and extremely likely or must happen with

1835
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:04,880
one

1836
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,319
so if they're independent you just

1837
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:08,480
multiply them but this is actually for

1838
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,680
cases where it's not

1839
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,160
quite so clear that there's independence

1840
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,359
so it's more for

1841
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:15,839
the case in real life where things are

1842
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:16,960
associated

1843
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,000
even if for spurious reasons that's why

1844
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,760
the instrumentalist reading is so

1845
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,559
important

1846
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:24,960
because just finding that there's some

1847
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:25,839
um

1848
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:27,680
correlation in the real world doesn't

1849
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,359
entail any specific

1850
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:31,520
underlying model it's just a statistical

1851
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,480
association

1852
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,480
between different variables and so here

1853
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,319
we're studying the set of all

1854
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:38,000
interacting factors there's two here but

1855
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,760
there can be way more than two in large

1856
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,880
bayesian models

1857
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,480
for just things that influence each

1858
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,000
other so we're thinking from the

1859
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,359
simplest case with just

1860
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,359
two non-interacting events and then you

1861
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:48,400
could think about more than two

1862
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,599
non-interacting events

1863
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:50,880
and then you might want to ask how

1864
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,480
events interacting makes it more

1865
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,200
complicated

1866
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,559
and of course it does make it more

1867
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:56,880
complicated but that's why there are

1868
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,640
good instruments to deal with it

1869
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,000
like spm and the dynamical

1870
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,480
equation modeling approaches so that's

1871
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,000
bayesian approach and you could learn a

1872
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:06,640
lot and there's

1873
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,160
courses and lectures and stuff on

1874
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,839
bayesian statistics but

1875
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:11,280
this is kind of the core of it and the

1876
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,960
point is that the terms

1877
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,680
and the uh frameworks that are used of

1878
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,640
in the rap ria

1879
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,839
camp involve this equation in spirit

1880
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:22,960
and in code so they use terms like

1881
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,440
the prior and updating the prior and

1882
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,440
calculating the posterior which is a few

1883
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,400
sections of these

1884
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,839
equations which we're not going to worry

1885
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:32,319
about but also they implement scaled

1886
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,000
versions of these equations on empirical

1887
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:34,799
data

1888
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:37,920
let's go to the second equation so the

1889
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,359
the previous equation was about updating

1890
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:43,359
with new information based upon priors

1891
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:44,559
just taking what you knew

1892
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:46,240
about how the world was associated

1893
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,000
implementing information that's gained

1894
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,680
from experiments or observations

1895
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,599
and updating your model of the world in

1896
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:52,720
some way

1897
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,079
now we're going to be talking about the

1898
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:55,920
kind of different area of math

1899
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,400
a different feature that equations are

1900
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,599
helping us understand

1901
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:01,680
so do you want to read the equations or

1902
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,119
anything else you want to say on it

1903
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,839
go ahead uh yeah i'll read the the quote

1904
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:07,760
if you want and then you can explain

1905
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,760
um i do want to say that the probability

1906
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:10,880
of the eagles winning the super bowl

1907
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,520
this year is

1908
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,640
zero so just by the way

1909
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,920
notably notably noise can drastically

1910
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:18,559
modify

1911
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,960
the even deterministic dynamics

1912
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:21,680
importantly

1913
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,520
this means that stochastic dynamical

1914
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,119
systems accounting for noise are

1915
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:26,960
equipped at least in principle

1916
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,880
to capture how existing states

1917
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,720
contribute to adaptation

1918
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,960
state space models are among the most

1919
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,960
suitable set of techniques

1920
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,599
uh from rozzy and first in 2016. to

1921
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,839
model the unfolding activity or behavior

1922
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:41,760
of a system subject to fluctuations in

1923
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:42,720
noise

1924
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,559
described by an ordinary differential

1925
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:45,920
equation

1926
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,119
and then i'll let you take it from here

1927
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:49,200
down sure so in the previous equation we

1928
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,160
were thinking about

1929
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,839
systems that change through time when

1930
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,839
new information comes into play

1931
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:56,240
now we're thinking about other aspects

1932
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,599
of systems that we care about

1933
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:00,960
specifically fluctuations and noise

1934
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,559
so that's kind of like change through

1935
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:04,559
time so it's another way to say that

1936
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:05,200
it's changing

1937
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,960
and developing through time in a way

1938
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,359
that either oscillates very cleanly

1939
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:10,960
or it could just be all over the place

1940
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,440
it could be any kind of rough path or

1941
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,440
any kind of signal anything in the

1942
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,640
signal processing

1943
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,559
domain is going to be considered a

1944
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:19,839
fluctuation it's just not

1945
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:21,680
a flat line or that could be considered

1946
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,520
a very small fluctuation

1947
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,920
so things that are changing through time

1948
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:26,960
and noise

1949
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,799
so we're kind of getting the basics of

1950
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:30,319
statistics things that influence each

1951
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:30,640
other

1952
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,160
things that change through time and

1953
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,920
things that have noise

1954
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,920
which is to say that in the measurement

1955
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,040
or any other

1956
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,160
um step between the system occurring

1957
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,079
and you modeling it which is to say

1958
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:43,680
everything there's some

1959
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,240
lossiness and therefore there's some

1960
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,240
noise term that has to be modeled

1961
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,160
so again the instrumentalists take isn't

1962
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,000
that the noise is like

1963
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,160
in the world doing something the noise

1964
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,920
term is a parameter

1965
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,319
in our instrument that's defined in

1966
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,000
relationship to the variance left

1967
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,960
unexplained

1968
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,599
by the rest of our model so depending on

1969
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:04,960
what you do include in your model and

1970
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,640
how you calculate it what data sets you

1971
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:07,119
use

1972
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,119
your noise estimates can be different

1973
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:10,799
just like depending on what variables

1974
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:12,319
you include in a regression

1975
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:14,319
which interactions you allow for you're

1976
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:16,240
going to even estimate the sign

1977
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,599
of different associations to be

1978
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,319
different so if one country has younger

1979
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:22,079
people another country has older people

1980
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:23,520
and then you do a regression you might

1981
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,280
think that age was associated when

1982
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,520
actually it was country or vice versa

1983
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,599
so that's why it's really important to

1984
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:31,680
take an approach that looks at the whole

1985
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:32,799
face space

1986
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:36,480
to understand how to fit these dynamical

1987
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,280
models

1988
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,039
so instead of descriptive we're looking

1989
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:40,319
at underlying

1990
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:41,920
instead of static systems we're looking

1991
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,920
at changing systems instead of perfect

1992
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,680
measurement we're allowing for noise

1993
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,000
measure uh noise to be included so

1994
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,200
there's a few dimensions

1995
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,480
where it's like we're thinking

1996
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,559
mathematically but we're also

1997
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,680
relaxing it in key aspects that help us

1998
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,079
deal

1999
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:58,480
with philosophically and just

2000
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,480
practically important aspects of the

2001
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,440
world

2002
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,640
so the kinds of things we want to use

2003
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,640
the fep instrument on because if someone

2004
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,079
says i made an instrument but like no

2005
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:07,119
you can't play it

2006
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:08,720
because it's like very large or it takes

2007
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,200
25 people to play or something like that

2008
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,480
we don't want to make that kind of an

2009
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,480
instrument so what kind of instrument do

2010
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,200
we have

2011
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,680
it draws upon these types of mathematics

2012
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:23,839
okay all right let's look at a few more

2013
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:26,240
quotations um do you want to read this

2014
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,640
quote on yet from the fact

2015
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,039
sure yet from the fact that it is

2016
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:32,640
possible to model the process

2017
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,480
it does not necessarily follow that the

2018
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,079
target phenomenon represents the

2019
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:38,400
intellectual tools we use to model it

2020
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,400
consider a moving object that can be

2021
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,119
explained by newton's laws of motion

2022
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,039
that we can model the movement by that

2023
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:47,440
form of formalism does not follow

2024
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,599
that object represents the law by which

2025
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:50,799
it falls

2026
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:52,559
few people would claim that the object

2027
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:55,119
represents or embodies instantiates

2028
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:57,200
implements employees leverages the laws

2029
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,480
by which it moves

2030
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,240
because science does not back this up

2031
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,240
those who wish to do so are committed to

2032
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,000
a philosophical assumption that moving

2033
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:04,720
objects

2034
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,319
like cells or organs in the nervous

2035
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:08,079
system represent laws

2036
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,240
principles or the intellectual tools we

2037
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,319
use to describe processes conforming to

2038
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:13,039
laws

2039
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:15,680
or principles posterior posteriors

2040
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,599
likelihoods and priors

2041
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:20,640
first in whis and hobson 2020 are

2042
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,119
on the guard on this matter pointing

2043
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:24,880
that from the fact that it is possible

2044
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,559
to map states does

2045
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:28,960
not mean that the resulting descriptions

2046
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,960
refer to entities that actually

2047
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,160
exist uh and just i love this like

2048
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,720
newton's law of motion that like i loved

2049
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,319
this except from the paper

2050
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:39,520
like i was thinking about like you know

2051
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,920
the apple classic hole that falls on

2052
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,200
newton's head like

2053
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,079
does that apple actually like embody or

2054
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,799
represent

2055
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,720
the laws of motion like does that apple

2056
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,200
represent gravity in and of itself

2057
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,960
i thought that was a really nice uh way

2058
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,119
to put it and it also highlights

2059
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:57,599
why the examples are important of the

2060
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,559
example theory

2061
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,720
of newton's law of motion and also the

2062
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:01,839
example within that

2063
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:04,160
of the apple falling because if you go

2064
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,680
up to someone on the street and you say

2065
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,760
you know are scientific models realistic

2066
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:08,880
something you explained them what

2067
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,640
realism was and said yes or no

2068
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,000
some people might say yeah i mean it's

2069
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,680
the best shot or it really is that way

2070
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,280
or that's really how the clouds form or

2071
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,799
that's really how the climate changes

2072
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,240
but then when you say right but then the

2073
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,079
apple isn't gravity it's not the idea of

2074
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:21,359
gravity it's an apple

2075
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:25,039
so then doesn't that make you rethink

2076
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:27,599
where you are on the realist spectrum so

2077
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:29,200
this is part of the author's

2078
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,640
argument from a philosophical

2079
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,240
perspective against

2080
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,480
realism they're saying the commitments

2081
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:35,520
that you make

2082
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,079
by taking the realist stance on newton's

2083
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:38,960
law of motion

2084
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,599
are kind of crazy it's like not good

2085
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:42,319
stances

2086
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:44,160
that you're taking on this example agree

2087
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,839
or disagree if you agree

2088
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:47,520
you continue forward and then saying

2089
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,200
well then that is a commitment

2090
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,559
to also these other implications that

2091
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:54,480
maybe are you still on board but

2092
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:55,680
somebody might say yeah i'm still on

2093
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,280
board the cell is just the intellectual

2094
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,480
idea of a cell

2095
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,720
it's really nothing more than that and

2096
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:01,920
then somebody would say right but then

2097
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,359
at some point you're going to be

2098
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,280
instrumentally wanting to do something

2099
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,039
pragmatic and then you're gonna

2100
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:09,359
like you know have your front of house

2101
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:11,119
be realism but then actually be acting

2102
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:12,079
like an instrumentalist

2103
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:13,359
because in the end you care about useful

2104
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:15,440
models too so this is a long-running

2105
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,559
debate but it's just

2106
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:18,880
really captured here let's go to the

2107
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,240
conclusion

2108
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,520
and then we have a few more things that

2109
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,839
we'll talk about so um do you want to

2110
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:25,440
read it or i can't

2111
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,079
you can go ahead all right they let me

2112
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:29,520
just

2113
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,359
they write in this paper we have

2114
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:33,200
defended the instruments list take on

2115
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,640
the free energy principle

2116
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,160
arguing that the realist approach is a

2117
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,000
non-starter regardless of whether it is

2118
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,520
representationalists or not

2119
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,359
crucially the question as to whether

2120
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:42,880
systems do or do not model their

2121
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:43,520
environment

2122
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,280
will not be decided by neuroimaging

2123
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,880
studies or the models we employ

2124
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,640
in interpreting the data so this is

2125
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,160
awesome it's gonna entail

2126
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,480
data and research and empirical studies

2127
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,680
but there is no

2128
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,280
neuroimaging data set that's gonna

2129
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,520
resolve it this paper and following

2130
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,480
discussions

2131
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,400
are how we get at this issue there isn't

2132
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,760
a data set that exists

2133
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,680
there isn't a data set that could exist

2134
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,680
it's actually a philosophical question

2135
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,000
so this is why we want to have

2136
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,280
participation from different

2137
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,079
perspectives

2138
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:11,599
because it's not a machine learning

2139
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:13,440
question whether the fep

2140
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,440
is realist or not and it does have

2141
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,520
implications so that's really

2142
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,039
a great conclusion this is a

2143
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:20,319
philosophical matter that should be

2144
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:21,920
dealt with by way of philosophical

2145
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,520
argumentation

2146
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:24,480
we have argued that the

2147
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,640
representationalist realist rep ria

2148
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,160
position does not hold up

2149
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,400
because of the as of yet missing

2150
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,680
naturalistic grounding of

2151
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,119
representations independent of

2152
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,960
sociocultural practices including

2153
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,640
structural representations

2154
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,200
citations the non-representationalist

2155
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,240
realist position

2156
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:43,200
nrp rhea reports to solve the issues of

2157
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,240
rapporia

2158
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,079
by removing representational content

2159
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:48,480
from the story yet it does not hold up

2160
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,000
because without content there is no

2161
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,839
model and no bayesian inference

2162
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:53,359
the instrumentalist does not face the

2163
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:55,599
same problems as they do not ascribe the

2164
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:56,640
modeling activity

2165
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,960
to the organism under scrutiny so that's

2166
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,640
why they first went to the rap rhea

2167
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:01,280
position

2168
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:02,880
and introduced the bayes equation

2169
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:03,839
because it's really important to

2170
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:05,039
understand reparia

2171
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,200
this is sort of like the first take you

2172
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,280
say yeah the fep is literally

2173
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,200
representing what the organism literally

2174
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,200
does it's a markov blanket and it's

2175
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,640
dissipating a gradient what else is

2176
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:15,920
there to say

2177
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,439
that is critiqued for reasons of

2178
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:19,759
representationalism so then people moved

2179
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:21,040
from the reptria

2180
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:24,080
to the nrp rhea non-representational

2181
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,839
realism was like okay well yeah fep is

2182
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:26,238
still

2183
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:27,839
really what the organism's doing

2184
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:29,600
literally realistically

2185
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,719
however it's not representing

2186
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:35,120
it's just a representationalist

2187
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:35,759
realistic

2188
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:38,640
model and then according to the authors

2189
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,158
take it or leave it or discuss it with

2190
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:40,560
them

2191
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,759
later they're saying that that rep rhea

2192
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:46,479
is a contentless model because it's

2193
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,238
basically saying you can't have

2194
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:50,479
this kind of a combination of a

2195
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:53,359
contentless model so that's the approach

2196
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:54,880
the philosophical argumentation

2197
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,960
approaches they divide into the quadrant

2198
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,479
say you know it could be anywhere we

2199
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:00,158
don't really know start with one

2200
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:01,679
quadrant say that it's not good

2201
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,279
move into another quadrant say it's also

2202
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:05,198
not good and then in doing so

2203
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:07,839
realize that they've eradicated both

2204
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:09,198
interpretations of realism

2205
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:11,198
on the representationalism spectrum

2206
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:12,560
maybe there's another spectrum that you

2207
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,920
want to bring into the picture

2208
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,759
but that's the way that you actually go

2209
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:18,158
about asking whether another idea

2210
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:20,560
bears upon this the way that they've

2211
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:21,439
laid it out

2212
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:24,080
so such a great approach and really

2213
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,198
clear what would you add to the

2214
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:28,000
conclusion blue

2215
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,719
um i didn't really have anything to add

2216
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:32,238
except it was really a good

2217
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:34,719
paper and i really liked the examples

2218
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:35,279
and

2219
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:36,960
the way that they laid it out it's kind

2220
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,640
of like you can't um

2221
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,000
you know they presented the argument in

2222
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,679
such a way that you can't really argue

2223
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:42,960
with that

2224
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,439
so i liked that or if you wanted to

2225
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:47,759
argue you'd know where to go

2226
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:49,520
let's just go through a couple of these

2227
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,960
questions that you

2228
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,640
raised let's just we're not going to

2229
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,158
address them but like

2230
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:56,480
what is a cool example of each of these

2231
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,080
points or questions or what do you think

2232
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,280
is exciting

2233
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,360
what kind of project does it bear upon

2234
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,719
that these are the questions that we're

2235
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:04,880
asking in relationship to this paper so

2236
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,480
first with the process theories

2237
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,560
and the fep what was interesting to you

2238
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,000
there so this

2239
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,840
i i just highlighted this because this

2240
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:12,960
is something that the authors

2241
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:13,600
highlighted

2242
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:17,120
um and not really with a question but um

2243
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,960
you know they they highlighted that the

2244
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,400
free energy principle

2245
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,440
uh is um a principle

2246
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,360
right it's not a process theory and this

2247
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,040
kind of we discussed this really in

2248
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:30,159
mel's paper in 14.0 right

2249
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:33,360
so um but but that these process

2250
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,719
theories such as bayesian brain

2251
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:35,520
hypothesis

2252
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,760
predictive coding active inference

2253
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,880
really explain

2254
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:42,640
how the fep is is actualized right

2255
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,880
um where the fep you know targets

2256
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:45,760
reduction of en

2257
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,400
of entropy the bayesian brain hypothesis

2258
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:48,880
and

2259
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,440
predictive coding focus on maximizing

2260
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,600
the hypothesis likelihood given

2261
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,800
the sensory input um and that the fep

2262
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,239
really doesn't uh

2263
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:00,320
imply or require any specific

2264
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,600
representational tools that are

2265
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,280
implemented by these

2266
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,280
process theories and really going back

2267
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,920
to 14.0 and

2268
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,120
one which i attended but um going back

2269
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:12,000
to that it's

2270
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,840
you know mel really described it in her

2271
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,760
paper how the fep

2272
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:19,520
fits into scientific theory and um

2273
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,320
and you know active inference and such

2274
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,440
yep within the

2275
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,760
mel so demarcation boundary we're saying

2276
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,840
yes fep is within science

2277
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,760
but what is it if not one of these

2278
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,760
process theories and it's almost like

2279
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,000
fep is the music shop and then the

2280
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,760
process theories are like the actual

2281
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,800
instruments

2282
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,040
that are being played and so maybe one

2283
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,000
of them is useful for

2284
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,120
one setting or it's useful at a certain

2285
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,199
range of volumes or it's useful in a

2286
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:46,880
certain ensemble size

2287
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,040
those are the instruments so that's the

2288
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,080
instrumentalist

2289
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:53,040
understanding of the fep approach which

2290
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,120
is why we can say that

2291
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,320
fep is doing things that's

2292
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,159
differentiated from other ideas

2293
01:11:58,159 --> 01:11:59,840
like it's a different focus on the

2294
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,600
reduction of entropy rather than the

2295
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,360
maximization of likelihood or

2296
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,600
other attributes but what it's doing

2297
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,440
it's like a workshop that's a generator

2298
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,840
in some ways and we're also constructing

2299
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,600
the workshop along the way

2300
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,440
but what it's making actually are

2301
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,360
instruments and by clarifying that

2302
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,520
there's a workshop or an approach

2303
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,040
and the instruments that are being

2304
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:20,800
utilized instrumentally

2305
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,199
and then making it clear that it's a no

2306
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:23,840
realism

2307
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,239
zone we're actually sidestepping a lot

2308
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:27,840
of the questions and moving straight to

2309
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,040
the utility

2310
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,280
and the ability to translate and apply

2311
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,640
instead of waiting

2312
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,960
for something that can't be resolved

2313
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,560
empirically as we're

2314
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,159
seeing from this paper so that's pretty

2315
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:40,400
cool and the process theories in the fpp

2316
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,320
has come up in a few previous ones

2317
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:45,360
let's go to ideas and questions that you

2318
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,679
had ever thought about related to

2319
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:48,480
reparia

2320
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,560
and the prediction air minimization

2321
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,120
theories of cognition

2322
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:56,159
so just some um you know of the

2323
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:57,600
questions that were raised by the author

2324
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,280
but i think that some things that are

2325
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,960
interesting to think about like

2326
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,800
does the brain actually perform

2327
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,800
probabilistic inference

2328
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,800
and does it represent probability

2329
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,280
distributions in this variational base

2330
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:12,719
kind of way uh and really what is what

2331
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:15,040
is the agent here or like the the huge

2332
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,320
the unit of agency

2333
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:19,040
is it like the brain or the organism or

2334
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:19,920
you know going

2335
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,320
to the multi-scale is it subcellular

2336
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,760
like the neuron

2337
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,400
or the cell or the molecule or also like

2338
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,600
groups of systems

2339
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,920
ant colonies and so forth like where is

2340
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,440
where is the agent

2341
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:34,159
there um and our agents prediction

2342
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:34,800
machines

2343
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,800
right i mean really like this is the the

2344
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,640
reprieve kind of

2345
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,120
take on this but i think it's it's uh

2346
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,800
interesting to think about like

2347
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,040
does the brain really do like i do i

2348
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,960
think i do probabilistic inference maybe

2349
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,000
sometimes

2350
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,360
um but do science possess

2351
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,679
the perspective of an external observer

2352
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:54,640
uh this is another

2353
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:56,080
question that the authors raise what

2354
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,320
about organisms or brains like are the

2355
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,280
are we

2356
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,600
observers or not so what do you think

2357
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,120
daniel do you have any any uh

2358
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:06,719
ideas on these i think it's the perfect

2359
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:08,640
paper to read as a starting point for

2360
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:09,679
the discussion

2361
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:12,159
because it really does depend on whether

2362
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:12,960
we're a realist

2363
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,840
or an instrumentalist because let's just

2364
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:16,480
think about

2365
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,239
computationalism like the idea that the

2366
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,400
brain is anything like a computer or a

2367
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,320
calculator has like anything to do with

2368
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,920
numbers just the idea of

2369
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,320
even talking about math in relationship

2370
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,600
to the brain

2371
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,520
if it's realism like the brain is a

2372
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,440
computer versus instrumentalism it's

2373
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,800
just a lens that we're using

2374
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,320
to apply onto the um brain

2375
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,400
it makes all the difference in the world

2376
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,600
because it's the difference between

2377
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,280
investigating the world and trying to

2378
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,000
decipher what

2379
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,280
it is quote versus knowing how to work

2380
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,320
with the world

2381
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,560
and then actually focusing our attention

2382
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,560
on the integration of our preferences

2383
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:53,520
and affordances with our models so it's

2384
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,760
like a totally different mode of doing

2385
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,560
research it's almost like in entomology

2386
01:14:58,560 --> 01:14:59,920
it's like the difference between doing

2387
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:00,880
the basic research

2388
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,320
going out there in the desert and

2389
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,800
observing the ants versus like pest

2390
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,199
control or integrated pest management

2391
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:08,960
it's like you do need to know about the

2392
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,199
basic biology to be effective

2393
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:14,159
so it's not just as simple as observe

2394
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:15,040
carefully and

2395
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,400
think carefully it's like thinking

2396
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,400
carefully and observing the system are

2397
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,560
intrinsic but when there's this

2398
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,120
integrated pest management mindset

2399
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,400
then there's a different timeline

2400
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:25,520
there's a different approach different

2401
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,480
way of thinking

2402
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,840
you might make a model at a different

2403
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,520
level of agency and just say yeah

2404
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,199
philosophy aside i'm going to model it

2405
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,679
as if the group of colonies is related

2406
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:35,360
i'm not making a claim about how they

2407
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,960
are i'm just saying this is how i have

2408
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,199
to model it because of xyz

2409
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:40,960
constraint so just like the

2410
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,320
instrumentalism

2411
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,960
clarifies some philosophical debates on

2412
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:47,280
these cognitive sciences

2413
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,199
but it brings us right to the doorstep

2414
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:50,880
of other questions

2415
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,239
like our own unit of cognition our roles

2416
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,679
and cognitive networks and things like

2417
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:56,239
that

2418
01:15:56,239 --> 01:15:58,960
so it's a it's a suite of questions that

2419
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,400
i i like it

2420
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,920
clarified with the realism

2421
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,679
instrumentalism and it just really

2422
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:06,800
shows again how many uh downstream

2423
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,960
consequences there are of taking a

2424
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,480
research agenda that's realist versus

2425
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,520
instrumentalist

2426
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,280
but this time it's cognitive and that

2427
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:16,000
means it really matters

2428
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,040
so in the in my like background being

2429
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,480
neuroscience i really think

2430
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:24,239
fundamentally like we have to understand

2431
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:26,800
the tools that we are working with in

2432
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,120
order to be able to do good science

2433
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,560
like you know coming from a bench

2434
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,199
science aspect like you have to know

2435
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:34,640
the detectable limits of your

2436
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,239
spectrophotometer if you want to measure

2437
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:38,159
the concentration of protein right

2438
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:39,920
in a sample so it's like you need to

2439
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,600
know these

2440
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,920
limits of of your machine and and what

2441
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,520
exactly your machine is capable of and

2442
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,199
also what it's not capable of

2443
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:49,679
because you could be you know generating

2444
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:51,280
data with your instrument

2445
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,679
but the data is not not valid for one

2446
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:55,120
reason or another outside the limits of

2447
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,719
detection or whatever

2448
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:59,199
so um i think that understanding the

2449
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:00,159
brain

2450
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:03,040
and what the brain does and how it works

2451
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,040
is fundamental to doing good science

2452
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,480
because that's ultimately our

2453
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:09,679
instrument of detection

2454
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:12,400
very cool nice to bring it to the brain

2455
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:15,120
as both the instrument of our detection

2456
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:18,239
and really what it is

2457
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:20,800
like it is both and that's why and we're

2458
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:21,600
it

2459
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,440
and related to it or something so that's

2460
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,719
why it's kind of at this

2461
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:26,800
strange loop intersection let's go to

2462
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,080
the cognition

2463
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,000
in general slide so the working

2464
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
definition that you added was

2465
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,840
cognition is the mental action or

2466
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,520
process of acquiring knowledge and

2467
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,400
understanding

2468
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,480
through thought experience in the census

2469
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,440
and what were your

2470
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:42,239
questions or kind of prompts for those

2471
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:43,199
who would want to come on and

2472
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:44,880
participate or what was exciting about

2473
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:45,760
how the paper

2474
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,199
rose these questions up for you

2475
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:55,280
just the whole idea of

2476
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,640
you know this the from again the like

2477
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:59,440
the realism

2478
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:02,880
aspects right like the is there

2479
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:06,719
some way or or is it even possible

2480
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:08,640
is cognition done in this bayesian

2481
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:11,600
framework um i know that there are ways

2482
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,960
to artificially

2483
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,520
implement this framework in in a system

2484
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,000
to

2485
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
you know like an artificial intelligence

2486
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,400
or some other thing for example but

2487
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,800
but is do we have any of this actually

2488
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,560
going on and i just wonder what what

2489
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,800
other people think you know what where

2490
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,480
after reading this paper that's so

2491
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:31,360
heavily um

2492
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:35,199
locked us into the instrumentalist uh

2493
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:37,600
stance or perspective i just would like

2494
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,600
to hear people's counterpoints

2495
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,600
to that like i can see why the bayesian

2496
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,120
framework is attractive

2497
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,360
for cognition i can see that we

2498
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,040
definitely um

2499
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,800
but but not always like we don't always

2500
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,480
learn from our mistakes

2501
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,400
we tend to like repeat the same mistake

2502
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,000
again and again and so it's not

2503
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,520
always there's not always we don't

2504
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:57,199
always update the the prior

2505
01:18:57,199 --> 01:19:00,159
right so so um you know we might miss a

2506
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:01,360
data point or six

2507
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:04,800
or twelve um and i just wanted to know

2508
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,560
like what people's general thoughts are

2509
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,640
on on whether cognition cognition is

2510
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:09,600
bayesian

2511
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,560
what that would mean and if bayesian you

2512
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:13,040
know

2513
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,280
then is it anything that we can ever

2514
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,880
model mathematically

2515
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,239
statistically is that a possibility

2516
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:23,120
um yeah and then it's cool because the

2517
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,880
first question is cognition bayesian

2518
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,640
what's the alternative frequentism or

2519
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,400
some other statistical

2520
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,600
and then it's like whoa what if it

2521
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,199
weren't statistical what if there was

2522
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:33,360
something even beyond that clade

2523
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,040
like that's an alternative that's local

2524
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,199
but and then how do we even pull back

2525
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:38,400
that far and you really

2526
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,640
raised it with this piece here which is

2527
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,280
that language and formal logic whether

2528
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:46,800
philosophical logics or mathematical

2529
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,960
formulas or any other type of

2530
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,239
quantitative model

2531
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:52,880
it's powerful for communication

2532
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,880
especially in our current

2533
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:58,400
niche but that's us today in this moment

2534
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,320
and you wrote not everyone has an

2535
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,000
internal monologue and i mean it's like

2536
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:02,400
not

2537
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,080
every species communicates the same way

2538
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,280
and different people have different

2539
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,639
experiences so

2540
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:09,679
how will we tap into all of these

2541
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,440
what if the logical is only the tip of

2542
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:13,040
the iceberg or just the total

2543
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:16,400
disinfo relative to the totality of what

2544
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,560
needs to be understood

2545
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,800
for effective action and that it's even

2546
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,719
local optimization to be in the

2547
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:23,679
linguistic

2548
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:25,840
or the formal domain or it's predicated

2549
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,360
deep on assumptions

2550
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,360
that potentially are unwarranted or

2551
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:32,320
inaccurate themselves

2552
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:33,760
yeah definitely and i think that the

2553
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,440
authors mentioned that also like or

2554
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,080
maybe

2555
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,639
uh not like language specifically but

2556
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:40,320
they mentioned you know scientists

2557
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,960
is is this the gloss that we're or is

2558
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,239
this like actually the meat

2559
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:45,840
that of what we're working with i don't

2560
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,280
remember like the exact line from the

2561
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,440
paper but i'll look it up for next time

2562
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,120
the theory is called the bayesian brain

2563
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,440
not the i use bayesian statistics our

2564
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,080
package

2565
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,320
to study the brain but that's what it

2566
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,000
would be in the instrumentalist and i

2567
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:58,639
think that

2568
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:00,320
for people will say it's for reasons of

2569
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,080
clarity we'll say well

2570
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,600
the system's doing this or this is what

2571
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,280
this protein wants to do it's really

2572
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,159
easy

2573
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:09,199
to confuse the map with the territory

2574
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:12,480
to go from i'm using bayesian equations

2575
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,080
or formats that remind me of basic

2576
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,600
statistics or something i learned in a

2577
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,040
bayesian course

2578
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,960
i'm using that to model data it's the

2579
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,080
bayesian brain

2580
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,360
but again we didn't have the linear

2581
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,880
regression brain when it was a linear

2582
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:23,840
regression

2583
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,000
and in some senses that's even what dcm

2584
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,760
has underlying it as well

2585
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:31,120
and so it's really something to think

2586
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:31,840
about about

2587
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,840
yeah what are the alternatives here and

2588
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,080
how do we model it

2589
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,520
yeah and so the authors like really

2590
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,199
provide a fresh uh

2591
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:40,719
i thought it was refreshing anyway

2592
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:42,320
because people do they take the

2593
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,159
you know it's the bayesian brain right

2594
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:45,679
like this is how the brain works it's

2595
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:46,880
basing of course

2596
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:49,840
um and you know it's just like our

2597
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,120
tendency to be so

2598
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,440
anthropocentric i think like we do it

2599
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,520
even within our our scientific

2600
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:58,400
you know niche right we take what we're

2601
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,480
studying or what we're focused on and

2602
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,199
kind of

2603
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:02,719
make it the center of everything i mean

2604
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:04,800
the brain is like in my opinion

2605
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,480
at like the center of our universe it is

2606
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,080
the instrument by which we detect what

2607
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,120
is going on

2608
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:12,159
in the world so i mean just even

2609
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:15,199
at the fundamental individual unit level

2610
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:18,719
so so if if we're gonna say like oh this

2611
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:20,080
is my work and now it's

2612
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,920
the brain this is how the brain works so

2613
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,679
i think that the brain has been

2614
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:28,080
you know dissected and and re you know

2615
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,400
imposed on so many framework frameworks

2616
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,239
like going back to like broca's area and

2617
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:33,440
the different like

2618
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,239
phenomenology you know positions in the

2619
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:38,239
brain and so everyone has kind of

2620
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:39,920
taken their own their own thing and

2621
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:41,679
tried to say this is how it is and the

2622
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:43,360
way that the world works and

2623
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,199
you know maybe it's not as simple as

2624
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:46,800
that

2625
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,679
agreed but it's just such a uh more

2626
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:51,520
helpful framing to say well my

2627
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,960
model the world versus your model of the

2628
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,360
world and then my values are abc in that

2629
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,080
order

2630
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,679
and you explain this fraction of the

2631
01:22:57,679 --> 01:22:59,600
variance with this input here's your

2632
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,159
values and let's figure out what model

2633
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:03,520
is going to be

2634
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,239
tractable for all of us versus world

2635
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:07,840
view versus world view

2636
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,639
it's um even without going down the

2637
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:12,080
gerdell incompleteness

2638
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:14,639
rabbit hole worldview versus worldview

2639
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:16,719
is a difficult discussion to have

2640
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:18,960
because you're talking past one another

2641
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,000
with vocabulary

2642
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,600
with the narrative with so many other

2643
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,840
aspects but modeling is a shared

2644
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:24,560
framework

2645
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,880
now the question is does that

2646
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:27,840
artificially

2647
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:31,199
or unduly constrain the discussion

2648
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:34,719
in a way where uh leaving the world view

2649
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:38,159
level who really knows these are like

2650
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:40,080
some of the coolest things so

2651
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:41,600
i think let's go to this oh we have a

2652
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,199
few more slides so let's kind of go

2653
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:43,679
through

2654
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:45,440
like that that's a perfect segue right

2655
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:46,800
to the next um

2656
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:50,159
slide right right about uh and this is i

2657
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:50,639
i

2658
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:53,040
put this in here um this is the brain

2659
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,480
versus the mind right and i think that

2660
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:55,920
the authors here

2661
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,560
use that term at least in this place

2662
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,159
interchangeably

2663
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:01,520
and i'll just read this really quick um

2664
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:02,960
one must be on the garden with respect

2665
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,280
to organisms or brains unlike scientists

2666
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,600
do not possess a perspective of an

2667
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,600
external observer

2668
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,280
thinking that it does requires a sound

2669
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,960
argument that is not yet offered in the

2670
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,880
literature in fact the hypothesis for

2671
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:16,880
the brain as an ideal observer

2672
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:18,719
has been often rejected in the

2673
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:20,560
literature most recently

2674
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:25,600
uh brett 2019 hippolyto at owl 2020 as a

2675
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,040
bad metaphor

2676
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,159
uh and then another group of

2677
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:32,159
citations mursky and brickhard week

2678
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:33,440
2019.

2679
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,360
in agreement with this merski at owl

2680
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:38,080
2020 called for encultured minds in

2681
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,120
replacement

2682
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:42,159
of error reduction minds oh and and that

2683
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:42,800
like just

2684
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,080
totally ties back to what you were just

2685
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,679
saying you know the the different world

2686
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:47,760
view like the encultured mind

2687
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,320
it's got to be from which culture and

2688
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,400
and you know can we speak the same

2689
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,239
language if we're not both acculturated

2690
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:55,440
in the same way

2691
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,679
and also the encultured mind can be

2692
01:24:57,679 --> 01:24:58,719
carrying out

2693
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,960
error reduction or surprise residual

2694
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:01,760
reduction

2695
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,320
but error reduction as the number one

2696
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:05,600
leading point is like

2697
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,920
well who is anyone to know what the gold

2698
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,120
standard is

2699
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,560
whereas when you start within cultured

2700
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,320
minds like what are mines well they're

2701
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,080
in culture it's developmental it's very

2702
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:14,960
specific

2703
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,880
what are they doing well among other

2704
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,000
things they're

2705
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,719
balancing error and surprise not down to

2706
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:21,280
zero

2707
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,639
but they're balancing it because they're

2708
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:24,320
uncultured in a certain way

2709
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,320
so we've started from how things kind of

2710
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:28,400
actually are so it's almost starting

2711
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:28,800
with

2712
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,840
realism or naivety and then just asking

2713
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:32,400
whether the

2714
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:35,280
instrument can cover the space rather

2715
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:36,560
than thinking we're going to have the

2716
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:37,360
realism

2717
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:39,440
and like the scope to describe how it

2718
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:41,280
really is across space and

2719
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,880
some cultures really are this way and

2720
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,480
other cultures are really that way

2721
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,719
versus i made a model and this parameter

2722
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:47,600
ranges from

2723
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,800
12 to 50. so continue

2724
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,000
and then i just pulled these different

2725
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,320
definitions out of mind is

2726
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:57,280
is defined as i think google or someone

2727
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:57,679
uh

2728
01:25:57,679 --> 01:25:59,520
the element of a person that enables

2729
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,040
them to be aware of their world and

2730
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,159
their experiences

2731
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:04,480
to think and to feel the faculty of

2732
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,199
consciousness

2733
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:07,679
and thought and then the brain is an

2734
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:09,600
organ of soft nervous tissue contained

2735
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,280
in the skull of animals functioning as

2736
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,520
the coordinating center of sensation

2737
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:16,639
and intellectual and nervous activity um

2738
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:19,280
and and i would be curious to hear

2739
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,639
whether people think that these are the

2740
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:21,360
same thing

2741
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,360
are they related is the brain where the

2742
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:24,480
mind is

2743
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:27,199
um and can the are the is it okay to use

2744
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:28,239
these two terms

2745
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:31,360
interchangeably um and what is yeah i

2746
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:31,679
think

2747
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:33,440
we talked about error reducing mind

2748
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,920
versus you know injured

2749
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,159
are they one kind of thing monism are

2750
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:39,520
they two kinds of things

2751
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,600
dualism is there a qualification of

2752
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,600
monomonism or dualism

2753
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:45,679
um i also remember just in the past few

2754
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:46,639
days forget where

2755
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:49,120
heard something like the roots in the

2756
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,800
mind and the fruits in the brain

2757
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,480
or it was vice versa and i thought well

2758
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:53,840
it could go either way

2759
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,600
because that's really the debate is

2760
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,920
whether matter generates mind or whether

2761
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:58,320
mind

2762
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:01,600
generates matter but blue another about

2763
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,320
oracle determination but another day

2764
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:07,360
let's go to this kind of closing

2765
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:10,400
section so it's written here the fvp is

2766
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:10,800
thus

2767
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,120
best seen as a research heuristic a

2768
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:14,800
particular lens through which we can

2769
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,639
view and carve up the world

2770
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:18,400
associated process theories is like

2771
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,159
we'll make our joints as we go

2772
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:22,239
associated process theories then are

2773
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:24,239
concerned with how the fep is realized

2774
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:25,040
in real world

2775
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,520
systems this crucial distinction sets us

2776
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,600
to realize that the fvp

2777
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,679
the fep does not imply process aspects

2778
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:33,600
or features

2779
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,080
tandem duplication paralog such as

2780
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,199
representations

2781
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:38,960
pertaining to the theoretical processes

2782
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:40,639
that aim to explain how the principle is

2783
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:41,520
realized

2784
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:44,080
yet the fep does not in itself imply the

2785
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:45,920
representational tools implied by these

2786
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,040
process theories

2787
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:48,560
so again there's a distinction between

2788
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,320
the principle and the process theories

2789
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:51,600
so the instrument shop and the

2790
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:52,960
instruments themselves that's like the

2791
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:53,679
principle

2792
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:56,960
to the process theories and then again

2793
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:59,120
the representational dimension is take

2794
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:00,080
it or leave it

2795
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,960
and it turns out that neither form of

2796
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:03,440
representationalism

2797
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:06,000
is gonna save realism and whatever you

2798
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,679
think about representationalism

2799
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:09,199
as long as you're on the instrumentalist

2800
01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:11,280
side it's all good and there's a debate

2801
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:12,480
to be had

2802
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,400
and then at the bottom quote there is

2803
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,639
within this more modest framework

2804
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:19,120
of fep still plenty of insight to be

2805
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,639
gained into the workings of life and

2806
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:22,400
cognition by way of dynamic causal

2807
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,199
modeling

2808
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:25,120
which is why we spent the time to go

2809
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,880
through it and why it's worth it to read

2810
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,600
the textbook

2811
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:30,560
because if this paper is on the right

2812
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:31,199
track

2813
01:28:31,199 --> 01:28:33,280
then take it seriously what it says

2814
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,280
which is that dynamic causal modeling is

2815
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,880
underlying the fep

2816
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,440
so metaphors you plow through them and

2817
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:40,480
you're going to get to something that

2818
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:43,120
has to be modeled like the dcm

2819
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:45,040
in sum we argue that the modesty and

2820
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:46,639
ambition go hand in hand

2821
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:49,120
when it comes to models and the fep

2822
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:49,840
awesome

2823
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:52,560
great closing so blue any thoughts on

2824
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:53,520
this or

2825
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:56,080
what are these insights that we can gain

2826
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:56,960
into life

2827
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:00,320
and uh mind and brain cognition and

2828
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,000
what else are you curious or excited

2829
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,320
about

2830
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,679
um so i'm curious and excited to hear

2831
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:09,440
really what what people think

2832
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:13,280
um about the mind the brain cognition

2833
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,639
is cognition done in the mind is

2834
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:16,320
cognition done in the brain

2835
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,400
um where does that happen where does an

2836
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,320
activism fit into this

2837
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:23,120
kind of framework um is another like

2838
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:24,159
parting question

2839
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:26,400
um and so i'm excited really to hear

2840
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,600
what people have to say

2841
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,679
in the dialogue i could talk about what

2842
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:31,600
i think all day long but i really would

2843
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:34,080
would like to listen to what others have

2844
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:35,440
to say

2845
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:39,920
i agree also getting into the 16.0

2846
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:42,639
um i think this is a fabulous lead up to

2847
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:43,920
discussing consciousness

2848
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,520
uh in 16.0 agreed it's all part of a

2849
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,800
sequence i would say i'm excited for

2850
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,880
both the authors to join for both weeks

2851
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:53,840
and also for

2852
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:56,159
hopefully new and old participants to

2853
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:57,120
join

2854
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:00,159
and just to hear everyone's perspective

2855
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:00,639
like

2856
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:03,920
before i read the paper i felt this way

2857
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:06,480
then when i was reading the paper i

2858
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,080
thought i stopped here

2859
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,920
and i took a break here and i took a

2860
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:12,159
week off here i thought about this part

2861
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:12,480
and

2862
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,000
i cut out this part and i highlighted

2863
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,320
this part like what this question arose

2864
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:16,800
just

2865
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,280
what was the before what happened during

2866
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:20,719
working through the paper

2867
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:22,800
if you had 20 minutes before the meeting

2868
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,320
it's chill you can still read a few

2869
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,560
sentences something will still pop out

2870
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:27,600
and then

2871
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,000
we capture that as it's happening with

2872
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
our discussions and we bring out things

2873
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,360
that people can't bring out

2874
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,520
alone or in dialogue with the paper

2875
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:36,639
itself

2876
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:38,239
and then it's like how we're going to

2877
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:40,639
move forward and so how does it change

2878
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:42,719
how we work with the fep and active

2879
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:44,639
inference how we communicate it and do

2880
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:45,360
it

2881
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:47,360
to be instrumentalist how do we be

2882
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:48,880
instrumentalist through and through

2883
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,800
so that we don't put out the realist

2884
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,120
bait and tell people the fep is a grand

2885
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,360
unifying theory of how things are

2886
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,679
okay well that's a realist claim so how

2887
01:30:57,679 --> 01:30:59,520
do we start with the instrumentalist

2888
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:00,400
approach

2889
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,800
in our minds understanding this paper

2890
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,400
and conversing with the authors and

2891
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:05,840
hearing from those who are just learning

2892
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,239
at all different stages and then

2893
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:12,800
imbue that into our full stack approach

2894
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,679
to making tools onboarding and

2895
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:17,040
accessibility just all these other

2896
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,239
aspects of what we do

2897
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:20,560
related to fep and active inference what

2898
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:21,760
are the implications

2899
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:25,360
for instrumentalism in those cases and

2900
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:28,960
that will be pretty fun to find out so

2901
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:30,800
oh oh then let's close with the tragedy

2902
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,719
because this is the uh this is the the

2903
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:36,560
danume so i control f'd

2904
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,120
but i didn't find tragedy in the paper

2905
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:40,320
so thinking

2906
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,560
it's you know it's the dog that doesn't

2907
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,000
bark in the night

2908
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,920
because it's the tragedy is the title of

2909
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:48,159
the paper but what is the tragedy

2910
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:50,960
and so this quote they write the

2911
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,080
difference between realism and

2912
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:52,880
instrumentalism

2913
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,120
is primarily ontological in nature in

2914
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:56,880
realism there's an ontological claim

2915
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,639
with regards to the status of models and

2916
01:31:58,639 --> 01:31:59,440
living systems

2917
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:00,960
in instrumentalism there is no such

2918
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,719
ontological claim about how things are

2919
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:03,679
ontology

2920
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:05,520
this may be seen as a weakness as though

2921
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:06,880
it looks as though the instrumentalist

2922
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,800
position only gives up explanatory

2923
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:09,520
ambitions

2924
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,679
relative to the fep realist so in other

2925
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:13,199
words is the

2926
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:15,280
instrumentalist just picking a lower

2927
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:16,320
target a

2928
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,400
easier target and so like yeah we did it

2929
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,320
but it's like too easy it's not useful

2930
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:21,920
actually we need real we need full-blown

2931
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:23,520
realism to be effective

2932
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:27,120
this is true devastating true however

2933
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:29,040
the ambitions given up on we argue are

2934
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,159
never going to be met

2935
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:32,320
so it was a delusion for the first

2936
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,320
thought or for those who were aiming

2937
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,000
it's great you know shoot for the moon

2938
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
end up in the stars or whatever but

2939
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,800
that was not the right target if this is

2940
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,080
going on the right track

2941
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:44,239
the realist ambition is a fata morgana

2942
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:45,199
if you will

2943
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:47,360
as such instead of chasing ghosts the

2944
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:48,639
instrumentalist position is more

2945
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:50,159
realistic in their ambition

2946
01:32:50,159 --> 01:32:51,679
and so that was pretty fun i had to look

2947
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:53,199
up what it was

2948
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:55,760
but it's this visual illusion on the

2949
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,040
horizon

2950
01:32:57,040 --> 01:33:00,320
over water or over the desert that

2951
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:01,600
does all different kinds of visual

2952
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,440
effects blue you probably see it in the

2953
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:04,800
southwest in the desert when you're

2954
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:05,920
driving and stuff

2955
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,600
could look like a boat or a car or a

2956
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,280
river or mercury

2957
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,360
and so it's kind of interesting it's

2958
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,120
like we're in a desert

2959
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:15,520
you know there's a real niche that is

2960
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:16,400
challenging

2961
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,960
either there's relative con competition

2962
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,000
within the niche

2963
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,719
or all the agents in the niche just get

2964
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:23,679
wiped off the table

2965
01:33:23,679 --> 01:33:26,000
so we're in a scenario that involves

2966
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,280
doing inference

2967
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:29,760
and it might feel good to have a

2968
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:31,280
delusional target

2969
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:34,960
but in the end we need policy that works

2970
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:37,760
and keeps us alive and so we don't want

2971
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,199
to get tied up with

2972
01:33:39,199 --> 01:33:42,320
illusions of what things could be we

2973
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:43,040
want to be

2974
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,760
on a path towards utility but also

2975
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,440
bringing in all these other nuanced

2976
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:49,840
characteristics so it's a tough question

2977
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:50,880
and it's a beautiful

2978
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:53,040
illusion and an allegory and so i was

2979
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:56,000
just wondering what is the tragedy or

2980
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,239
is realism a tragedy or what is the

2981
01:33:58,239 --> 01:33:59,520
tragedy in this case

2982
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,040
blue before we look at the definition of

2983
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:03,360
tragedy

2984
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:05,040
in this case i think that the tragedy is

2985
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:06,880
that uh representationalism

2986
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:09,520
is is not even applicable in the end

2987
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:10,320
right

2988
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:12,880
so and that's my tragedy because i'm so

2989
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,000
attached to my

2990
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,159
you know representationalist uh

2991
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:18,960
standpoint i guess let's go to what the

2992
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:20,239
final slide here is just

2993
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:22,800
the definition of tragedy we won't read

2994
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:23,280
it but

2995
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,360
it was just pretty interesting to see

2996
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,440
that uh tragedy has meant different

2997
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:28,880
things

2998
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:31,040
over time of course it's been used in

2999
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,719
different ways but it's sort of like

3000
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:35,360
an inciting incident incident a plot

3001
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:36,320
reversal

3002
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,159
and then there's the end and then

3003
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:40,320
there's a catharsis and a new resolution

3004
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,800
melt thaw resolve itself into a do

3005
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,080
except in this case it's d

3006
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:46,480
o because it's doing stuff so it's sort

3007
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:47,760
of like the prior

3008
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,920
and then the update or the stimuli or

3009
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:50,960
the observation

3010
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:53,600
and then there's something the

3011
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:54,960
resolution

3012
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:57,119
could be the same as the beginning or

3013
01:34:57,119 --> 01:34:58,560
the person could have resolved and

3014
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,440
everyone could have

3015
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,040
you know gone home with a different you

3016
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,719
know set of whatever

3017
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:05,199
but it has this format that's the

3018
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:06,560
minimal

3019
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:09,600
problem reaction solution or prior

3020
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:12,400
update posterior so pretty interesting

3021
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:14,080
to see how tragedy has a connotation

3022
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:17,360
of like sad it was a tragedy what

3023
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:18,960
happened it's like oh something sad must

3024
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:19,760
have happened

3025
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,520
but this is almost neutral and it's like

3026
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:22,960
saying oh it's a tragedy what happened

3027
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:23,520
it's like

3028
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:25,119
what happened what was the update what

3029
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:27,119
was the plot reversal that led to the

3030
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:28,239
outcome so

3031
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:30,960
very nuanced reference and very

3032
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:31,920
interesting by

3033
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:34,800
the authors so here are the final

3034
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,639
questions blue any last thoughts

3035
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:40,000
on anything otherwise we'll close it out

3036
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,159
