the active inference live stream from

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,719
the active inference lab

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,079
it is active inference live stream 15.2

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,640
today and it is february 9th 2021

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,480
welcome to the active inference lab

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,680
everyone

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,760

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,039
learning and practice related to active

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,720
inference you can find us

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,160
on our website twitter email youtube

13

streams

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,480
today in the active inference live

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,320
stream you can check out the calendar

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,280
for 2021

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,000
at this link on the left side and we're

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,440
here with the red arrow

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,239
on february 9th for 15.2 this is our

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,039
second

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,760
group discussion with the two authors of

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,560
an awesome

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,000
paper about realism and computationalism

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,439
and instrumentalism

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,200
and so this follow-up discussion we're

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,880
going to be probably taking it in a lot

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,520
of different

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,360
directions bringing up some ideas that

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,040
we heard about in earlier

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,920
15 discussions and sending us off with

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,560
momentum

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,080
into the future of 16 and beyond

40
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,600
in 15.2 we're going to go around and

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,560
hear from everybody

42
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,079

warm-up and then we will

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,840
jump around go to some questions that we

45
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,439
had from last week

46
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,119
and anything else that people are

47
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,880
thinking about will be awesome

48

cool well this will be a really fun

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,799
discussion

97
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,080
so let's just get warmed up with kind of

98
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,159
the pivot point with the phase

99
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,280
transition from

100
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,799
all of our disparate lives whatever we

101
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,560
were thinking about before this

102
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,599
conversation

103
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,239
and get warmed up into the paper and so

104
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:04,959
the three

105
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,599
warm-up questions are on here anyone who

106
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,879
raises their hand can just

107
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,959
take a stab and it'd be cool to hear

108
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,159
from everyone

109
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,840
what is something you're excited about

110
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,320
today what is something you liked or

111
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,320
remembered about the paper

112
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,079
and then what is something that you're

113
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,839
wondering about or would like to have

114
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,800
resolved

115
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,199
by the end of today's discussion so

116
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,240
while

117
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,320
people are raising their hand one thing

118
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,840
i was curious about is

119
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,639
what leads one to be an instrumentalist

120
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,040
or

121
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,479
a realist like how do we um

122
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,520
make that choice what kind of sends us

123
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,240
down one

124
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,639
road or another or is it something that

125
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,400
switched back and forth

126
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,680
just something i was curious about

127
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,560
anyone else have a um thought on one of

128
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,680
these

129
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,840
warm-up questions or just something that

130
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,400
stayed with them from the paper

131
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,160
um dave and then anyone else who raises

132
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,440
their hands

133
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,919
yeah i would hope that folks don't get

134
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:02,639
stuck

135
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,800
in having to choose between

136
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,000
instrumentalism

137
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,440
and really getting into the meat of

138
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,199
causation

139
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,360
in any particular topic that you're

140
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,680
interested in uh you gather data

141
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,240
by looking at the envelope of a

142
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,280
phenomenon

143
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,440
and when you've gotten enough data you

144
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,360
just say well what is it like to be one

145
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,479
of them

146
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,800
and uh one hopes you've got enough

147
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,400
mirroring or modeling of the relations

148
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,120
that you can start coming up with some

149
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,759
[Music]

150
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,880
some mirrored explanations of how to

151
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,479
what is it like to be uh

152
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,280
a thermostat

153
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,520
cool thanks anyone else steven

154
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,639
yeah um yeah i think that this

155
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,840
question around thinking about using an

156
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,560
instrument

157
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,080
is quite interesting sort of that

158
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,319
embodied sense of like

159
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,720
i'm probing something with an instrument

160
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,400
um as opposed to maybe using a tool

161
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,160
which maybe is a bit more like i can

162
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,680
hold that in my hand you know

163
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,000
i know what my tool does but my

164
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,600
instrument there's like a little bit of

165
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,840
a gap so i i like that

166
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,440
way of thinking about how we are

167
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,120
working with something between us and

168
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,600
the world and where does the idea of a

169
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,880
system

170
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,880
go in there or where does the idea of a

171
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,960
tool or where does the idea of

172
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,840
you know it actually in some ways is

173
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,560
kind of

174
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,240
realist in the sense of how we try and

175
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,639
think about things physically so i quite

176
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,919
like that

177
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,360
ironically shannon

178
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,479
and then anyone else yeah so i don't

179
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,080
know what it's like to be a thermostat

180
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,199
um but that made me think

181
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,720
of the dynamics of a crowd that consists

182
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,240
of a lot of individual

183
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,440
people and no

184
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,720
one person in the crowd know what knows

185
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,000
what it is like to be the

186
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,720
whole crowd and you can identify certain

187
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,319
behavior that's happening

188
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,199
at the level of the crowd and we can be

189
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,720
super instrumentalists and say this

190
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,680
crowd is

191
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,840
navigating a space or something

192
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,520
um and that sits fine with me but

193
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,360
somehow when i transition to neurons in

194
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,440
a brain i want to say that there is

195
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,639
something realist

196
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,319
and we don't have to be instrumentalist

197
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,319
about the brain we can say

198
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,120
this population of neurons is is

199
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,000
representing some

200
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,759
activity but i don't want to say that

201
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,360
about a crowd

202
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,599
but if you put those two side by side i

203
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,800
should i should have the same view

204
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,680
against both of them

205
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,880
interesting thanks yeah we line up all

206
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,479
these kind of mappings

207
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,120
and then it's almost like um well the

208
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,160
linear regression

209
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,319
is an instrumental um way of doing

210
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,000
statistics so then if we're going to be

211
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,520
serious about instrumentalism

212
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,759
could we replace linear regression with

213
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,520
some other statistical technique or

214
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,879
does it come down to the details of the

215
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,520
instrument in s and then anyone else who

216
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,599
raises their hand

217
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,240
yeah i was thinking about um dave's

218
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,199
remark actually

219
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,319
um which i i also agree with and i think

220
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,039
that

221
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,199
dave's remark allows us to say a little

222
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,479
bit more about

223
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,919
why we need to be careful about being

224
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,840
realist and uh

225
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,879
that is um with the fact that if we're

226
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,520
going to

227
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,199
model say a cognitive phenomenon

228
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,319
say perceptual learning on something or

229
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,319
a phenomenon that is cognitive that

230
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,940
entails also what it is like

231
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,000
[Music]

232
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,039
then probably in modeling that cognitive

233
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,559
phenomena and we are going to have to

234
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,279
take a very realist stance

235
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,360
because you won't be able to capture the

236
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,959
what it is like

237
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,839
so in a way if we are taking the realist

238
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:48,240
path

239
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,560
and saying that well my model is not

240
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,760
only modeling

241
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,360
the cognitive phenomenon but actually

242
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,680
that's how the phenomenon

243
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,399
works by using these models and these

244
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,240
representations

245
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,480
then we are we also are committed to the

246
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,760
implication

247
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,399
that um that particular phenomenon does

248
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,959
not have or is not permeated by

249
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,320
any phenomenological aspects because we

250
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,480
are applying a reductionist model and

251
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,320
taking a realist perspective

252
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,160
so taking a release perspective is not

253
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,240
going to be useful if we want to account

254
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,040
for the phenomena

255
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,440
the phenomenology aspect of the

256
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
cognitive phenomenon

257
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,800
yeah thanks for that

258
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
um and anyone else can raise their hand

259
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,920
i have a question for

260
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,320
the authors so the title talks about

261
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,800
computationalism

262
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,279
but one of the main tensions in the

263
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,320
paper is about

264
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,880
instrumentalism and realism but the

265
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,600
title has computationalism and realism

266
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,480
so what is the relationship between

267
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,640
computationalism

268
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,839
and instrumentalism

269
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,560
yeah ns

270
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,519
yeah so um i can say something about

271
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,560
that um

272
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,800
so in computationalism we can take

273
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,560
either instrumentalism or

274
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,680
realism which is cool it's fine um

275
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,320
one way to think about this is that i

276
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,880
can be

277
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,560
uh completely in agreement with

278
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,000
computational

279
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,640
science and use all the apparatus and

280
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,480
machinery that computation

281
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,279
science has to offer at our disposal and

282
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,040
i can use that from an instrumentalist

283
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,480
perspective

284
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,399
now the other way is being realist

285
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,760
within computationalism

286
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,920
and i'm going to say that it's not only

287
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,680
a tool that i use this computational

288
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,480
machinery

289
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,120
but it's also um the way that in this

290
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,560
case the target system which

291
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,079
is the brain or cognitive activity works

292
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,360
so these are the two options of um or

293
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,920
the two uh um options that we have

294
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,440
within the computation within

295
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,560
computationalism

296
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,959
the the typical um the typical

297
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:55,920
standpoint

298
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,560
is to be a realist about it that's the

299
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,560
history of philosophy of mind

300
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,920
is to apply a realist attitude

301
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,279
towards our scientific models of the

302
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,399
brain or cognitive activity

303
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,040
so it's not only that i have a

304
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,600
representation

305
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,079
or i'm developing a representation of

306
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,000
what i think the brain is doing in

307
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,959
generating

308
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,519
uh these data that i have access to but

309
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,720
i also think that

310
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,600
this representation is also in the brain

311
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,120
that's also how the brain works by

312
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,200
having these sort of representations

313
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,640
permeated with all these cultural

314
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,440
constructs that we have like numbers

315
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,320
logics

316
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,360
uh bayesian inference concepts and all

317
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:39,920
of that

318
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,959
is in the brain too

319
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,279
cool thanks thomas and then anyone else

320
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,920
yeah um so i think that's that's exactly

321
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,399
right

322
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,079
and um last time it came up as well that

323
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,720
uh it seems like only philosophers are

324
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,399
worrying about this or

325
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,120
making this uh distinction or anything

326
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,920
um

327
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,000
but the thing is that you see that in in

328
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,639
certain scientific projects as well

329
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,680
um when people

330
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,959
uh i've heard anyway

331
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,440
of a research project where people are

332
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,959
trying to identify

333
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,040
particular priors in the brain

334
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,480
are trying to find neural correlates of

335
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,360
the priors in bayesian probability

336
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,880
distributions

337
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,920
um that only

338
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,760
makes sense like the entire research

339
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,279
project only makes sense

340
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,360
if you think the brain is literally

341
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,160
engaging in bayesian infants

342
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,079
so it really matters in that sense also

343
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:48,560
for

344
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,320
many scientific projects whether you

345
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,600
take an instrumentalist or realist

346
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,079
attitude

347
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,880
thanks yeah i think it's something we

348
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,000
can kind of

349
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,320
tease out and return to is what are the

350
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,839
implications

351
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,399
for where we fall out on this

352
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,160
instrumentalism and realism

353
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,680
continuum or what are the consequences

354
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
for different projects or for different

355
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,760
kinds of explanations predictions

356
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,200
models um is it possible to use bayesian

357
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,839
statistics instrumentally on the brain

358
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,320
and be totally neutral and talk about it

359
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:24,959
like it's a

360
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,360
uh like uh you can model it usefully as

361
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,959
a computer or as doing bayesian

362
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,839
statistics

363
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,240
but then not take the realist turn and

364
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,680
say that it is doing that

365
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,720
or do those two tracks run so close to

366
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,440
each other

367
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,160
that maybe it's a just a slip from one

368
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,880
to the other

369
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
and what would be the consequences of

370
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,040
that so stephen and then anyone else

371
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,760
i'd be curious to know whether you've

372
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,360
got the idea that when you

373
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,399
are trying to probe

374
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,399
the brain or try to understand it then

375
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,760
you take an instrumentalist

376
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,160
perspective i was wondering if there is

377
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,399
like a level at which realism

378
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,800
is sort of still seen to be there like

379
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,519
even if it's

380
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,920
in a sense that can't be seen i.e the

381
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,519
free energy principle because it's a

382
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,120
principle

383
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,279
and it's and the idea of non-equilibrium

384
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,120
steady states or the fact that it's

385
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,600
you know that you need the dynamics to

386
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,360
be happening rather than it being

387
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,199
a system that can be just snapshotted

388
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,720
is that in principle form

389
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,360
still coherent to have as like a

390
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,000
relatively

391
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,040
realist interpretation it's just that

392
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,639
doesn't necessarily mean that any of

393
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,240
your models

394
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,920
are realist they're just instruments or

395
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,680
is it not that is there is there

396
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,000
something like that kind of

397
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,880
interaction at a more foundational level

398
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,160
cool question thank you um dave and then

399
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,760
anyone else

400
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,480
yeah on that point i would recommend you

401
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:56,880
look

402
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,720
at the um mark some

403
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,000
lecture series from 2013 on

404
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,199
the conscious ego he is

405
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,040
both a neuroscientist and a

406
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,360
psychoanalyst

407
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,320
he is also currently collaborating with

408
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:14,800
carl

409
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,079
fristen and is in like two weeks

410
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,760
bringing out a book

411
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,040
that uh integrates dream

412
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,199
study psychotherapy and

413
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,560
um bayesianism

414
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,518
solm s

415
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,720
cool any other thoughts on the

416
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,519
introduction

417
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,440
or we can um just start with some of

418
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,160
these

419
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,320
questions that we had raised as a group

420
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,440
last week so

421
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,480
yeah sounds good we'll just kind of

422
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,320
i guess walk through a couple of these

423
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,399
questions people can take it in any

424
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,399
direction though so there's not too much

425
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,240
of a linear ordering here but

426
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,920
we'll just walk through them so this

427
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,440
first question um

428
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,320
several people spoke to it last week and

429
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,399
it was related to

430
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,519
conscious awareness and to self

431
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,360
modeling so i um was reminded of this

432
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,040
with steven's question about instrument

433
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,000
and tool

434
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,120
so like do we have an i

435
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,040
is there something that isn't you know

436
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,880
is the uh maybe i'll pick a different

437
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,639
word that's not you know literally the

438
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,800
same e y e or i but let's just say like

439
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,839
um for tactile sensation is it that we

440
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,480
have

441
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,000
proprio sensation or that we are proprio

442
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,920
sensation or do we make a model

443
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,120
of proprio sensation or are we agnostic

444
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,880
on how it really is with proprio

445
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,040
sensation but we're just gonna model it

446
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,880
a certain way there's a lot of

447
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,160
directions that we can

448
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,440
take this but i think that the

449
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,399
interesting question that was raised is

450
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,399
where does the self awareness come from

451
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,920
and then is a self uh

452
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,440
enacting these types of uh

453
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,519
inference schemes or is it as if they're

454
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,560
in acting schemes

455
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,319
how do we think about that for ourselves

456
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,160
how do we think about that for other

457
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,640
systems

458
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,160
um yep ines then chan

459
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,160
um i think that um one point

460
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,319
uh at which we can start this

461
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,679
conversation

462
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,640
is by asking ourselves um what is

463
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,319
modeling what are the motivations

464
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,440
for us to uh get around and

465
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,600
uh construct a model of something

466
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,280
so i would say um that we model things

467
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:39,679
that

468
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,799
we do not have a complete access to

469
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,799
we are somehow missing something about

470
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,480
you have an object of study

471
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,320
but somehow we are missing um

472
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,720
some part of it that is puzzling to us

473
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,520
and we don't have

474
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,919
a a direct access to it almost like

475
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,400
saying we don't have the true posterior

476
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,600
so we need to find it by um uh

477
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,880
coming up with theories um and uh by

478
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,000
thinking about

479
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,320
uh what would be uh what would make

480
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,000
sense um

481
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,160
to explain that particular phenomenon

482
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,120
that we are

483
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,760
puzzled about so i think this is

484
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,440
important for this question of

485
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,679
self-modeling because then it raises the

486
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:20,320
question of

487
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,080
whether i have access to the self or not

488
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,080
because if we think that however when we

489
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,080
answer this question is going to be very

490
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,840
relevant to however we think this

491
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,799
question

492
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,039
if we think that we the self is

493
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,559
something that is hidden away

494
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,240
and we don't have a complete access to

495
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,160
it then we could perhaps

496
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,080
think about that oh there's motivation

497
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,360
to model the self

498
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,840
how is a different question if we think

499
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,280
that no i have a direct

500
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,080
access if to anything to the self on a

501
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,120
conscious level

502
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,120
um i might not understand everything

503
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,720
about myself or the

504
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,360
self um but i do have a direct access in

505
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,160
which case

506
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,320
perhaps there is no motivation to model

507
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,600
it um

508
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,760
so yeah i just think this is a nice way

509
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,440
to to start thinking about

510
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,480
this thanks

511
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,039
shannon and then thomas i'm actually

512
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,160
going to hold my comment

513
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,720
until a little bit later all right cool

514
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,120
thomas

515
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,720
yeah um so i think two other

516
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,080
very important questions here

517
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,559
um

518
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,880
i don't know maybe there's another one

519
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,559
um

520
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,160
what is access

521
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,160
um what do we mean

522
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,240
with the conscious level

523
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,760
um

524
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,840
what is the self that we are supposed to

525
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,640
be modeling or not modeling

526
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,039
um

527
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,840
i think that that might be it and and

528
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,240
this seems a little nitpicky

529
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,159
and typically philosophical i can

530
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,600
imagine but it

531
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,559
really is very important that we get

532
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,960
clear on these things because

533
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,600
[Music]

534
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,720
some people will have a very very narrow

535
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,840
definition

536
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,880
of what you have access to um

537
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,000
which will very quickly kind of mean you

538
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,799
will need to

539
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,840
represent or model just about anything

540
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,440
um whereas if you have a broader

541
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,200
definition of what we have access to

542
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,919
that's going to

543
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,960
change the story completely um

544
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,799
the same thing goes with the self some

545
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,960
people have different

546
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,880
varieties of the self there's this sort

547
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,720
of pre-reflexive

548
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,480
self that is just sort of self-hood

549
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,919
some people call it that you just

550
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,640
have a feeling of being yourself and as

551
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,159
an acting person

552
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,080
and there's a narrative self that's sort

553
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,159
of the story you make up about yourself

554
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,080
like what sort of person am i i'm

555
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,240
etc

556
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,000
those are all going to be enormously

557
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,480
important questions to answer before we

558
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,360
can really

559
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,000
talk about what self-modeling on the

560
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,960
conscious level

561
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,400
even is i think

562
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,280
great point it is very philosophical to

563
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,559
to take one question

564
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,520
and just fractalize ask sub questions

565
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,000
but it's

566
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,320
so true it really does matter if we

567
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,039
think that we're

568
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,240
going to explain some consciousness

569
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,159
in one definition then we might be off

570
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,640
base so i guess since these are big

571
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,360
questions what might the free energy

572
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,320
principle or

573
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,120
active inference do to help us resolve

574
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,720
or at least approach these

575
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,799
ideas shannon and then it could be on

576
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,000
that or or anything else

577
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,400
than anyone else yeah so coming up from

578
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,520
what you said do we have proprioception

579
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,600
like do we have a certain sensation or

580
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,960
are we that sensation are we

581
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,159
proprioception

582
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,200
um and anest's question like what are

583
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,919
the motivations for modeling

584
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,799
um and we model if we're somehow missing

585
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,120
the full picture

586
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,840
um and this brings me to like in

587
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,880
yakipovi's

588
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,559
book predictive mind right the brain

589
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,600
doesn't have access to

590
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,559
the sensory environment the brain has

591
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,000
access to

592
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,120
electrical firing and so it's trying to

593
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,600
model

594
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,360
what in the environments could have

595
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,679
caused or what

596
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,559
um what could have caused that certain

597
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,200
pattern of electrical firing

598
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,640
and back to last week when we were

599
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,080
talking about representations having

600
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,919
some sort of truth conditions

601
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,280
if we do you know electrically stimulate

602
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,600
um part of your somatosensory cortex and

603
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,480
then you

604
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,799
your conscious self model is that i feel

605
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,200
a sensation of somebody touching my hand

606
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,280
because you stimulated that part of

607
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,559
my somatosensory cortex so on

608
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,080
the like conscious self-model level

609
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,200
i'm making sense of what

610
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,960
my neurons are telling me and my neurons

611
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,159
if we're asking what is it like to be a

612
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,320
neuron um is making sense of the

613
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,679
electrical signals

614
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,679
that it's receiving by saying they must

615
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,039
have come from

616
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,039
this area of the body because usually

617
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,799
when these bonds are stimulated in that

618
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,360
way

619
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,720
that corresponds to a sensation from the

620
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,240
sensory environment from this part of

621
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,480
the body

622
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,600
and if we

623
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,200
think of it that way then maybe we could

624
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,720
say that set of neurons

625
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,559
is predicting or doing

626
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,679
doing some sort of modeling

627
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,559
of the world because it's using these

628
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,279
signals

629
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,520
as a stand-in for the world these

630
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,440
electrical signals as a stand-in for the

631
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,799
part of the body that's usually

632
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,440
associated with that

633
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,880
or we could be instrumentalists about it

634
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,400
and just say that we're using our math

635
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:04,960
to

636
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,960
to describe how the neurons are doing

637
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,600
interesting and great to introduce that

638
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,760
experimental result that when you do

639
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,440
you know give a little electricity the

640
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,039
person will identify

641
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,360
that as being experienced a certain way

642
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,559
so um in s

643
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,440
and then stephen

644
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,279
um okay so i just wanted to address a

645
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,400
few of um

646
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,440
of thomas's questions

647
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,120
and just to give a little bit of context

648
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,799
with these uh particular questions

649
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,960
coming from i think it was from mark's

650
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,360
uh discussion with the discussion remark

651
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,559
last week

652
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,000
and we were talking about uh the body

653
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,960
uh being modeling itself and then this

654
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,520
came up

655
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,919
what about self-modeling uh on the

656
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,039
conscious level

657
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,559
what would that be um and here

658
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,039
i think that there are two things um so

659
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,480
uh thomas asked

660
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,400
what is more i think i asked okay

661
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,600
doesn't matter so

662
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,640
um modeling um here is important because

663
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,840
how is it that the self would be modeled

664
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,520
is important because all of us

665
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,600
understand what is

666
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,400
modeling from a scientific perspective

667
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:16,960
right

668
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,000
we develop our tools and we know how

669
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,279
things are modeled

670
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,120
right depending on the target system i'm

671
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,360
going to use certain set of tools

672
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,760
uh that's going to be dictated by the

673
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,919
system that i'm targeting

674
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,760
okay now we know what that kind of

675
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,000
modeling is i don't know what

676
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,200
modeling is when we turn to the self

677
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,360
i have no idea what that looks like is

678
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,600
it asian inference what kind of tools

679
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,720
are we talking about

680
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,600
that um the nervous system or the body

681
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,679
or even myself and this is the point of

682
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:48,400
this question

683
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,480
or even myself on a conscious level and

684
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,600
by conscious level i

685
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,279
don't even like the expression conscious

686
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,440
level um

687
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,679
here i was more thinking of the agent

688
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,440
level so the agent that interacts with

689
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,320
the world

690
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,520
and has um representations and things

691
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,400
about the world

692
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,840
is capable of drawing mapping things

693
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,679
that's um that's a sort of a much more

694
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:12,799
sophisticated kind of

695
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,279
interaction with the world that entails

696
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,440
language concepts logics

697
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,120
uh skills and that's the agent level

698
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,440
right so this is like lifting up this

699
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,159
conversation

700
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,159
into the agent level and thinking about

701
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,919
okay how is it

702
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,559
that self model modeling would be

703
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,760
motivated would it be

704
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,600
motivated at all um and if it is

705
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,000
how is it that it happens because um on

706
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,919
an agent level and i think this is

707
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,720
this is a a a point that might elucidate

708
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,760
things for us

709
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,960
on an agent level is an agent

710
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,080
ever engaging with beijing inference

711
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,919
i haven't learned bayesian inference

712
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,880
until very late in life

713
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,600
so before i learned beijing inference i

714
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,760
wasn't able to model myself

715
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,279
i guess so that's the point so even on

716
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:03,520
an

717
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,919
agent level for me to interact with the

718
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,320
world by using representations because i

719
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:08,799
can

720
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,960
on an agent level i don't think anyone

721
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,720
has an issue with that not even radical

722
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,080
in activism

723
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,240
not even any other an activist i don't

724
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,279
think um

725
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,520
so on a conscious level on an agent

726
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,360
level where we can actually engage in

727
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,880
representations and use

728
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,159
logics and use our concepts are we uh

729
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,520
using uh these kind of uh modeling that

730
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,039
we know what it is in science

731
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,159
so that's one point about modeling

732
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,799
the other one is um i think was shannon

733
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,799
that mentioned this very nice example

734
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,399
um and i think it's useful for us to

735
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,080
look at uh which is

736
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,039
um shannon said i feel a sensation of

737
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,399
someone touching

738
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,960
right touching touching my heart my arm

739
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,760
or something

740
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,399
right um so in that particular case this

741
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:55,919
is the agent level that's why i think

742
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,120
this is a nice example

743
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,279
in that particular case i feel someone

744
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,200
touching my arm

745
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,320
do i go around and uh start wondering

746
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:04,960
about

747
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,080
whether i felt that touch or not because

748
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,520
that would be starting off

749
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,520
an inference kind of kind of thinking

750
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,960
which we can totally do

751
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,120
by using logics and deduction and

752
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,039
induction and abduction all of that we

753
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,399
can totally do that

754
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,520
uh because we are enculturated beings

755
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,320
now do i wonder about whether someone

756
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:24,799
did

757
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,039
really touch my arm whether do i really

758
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,159
feel pain

759
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,159
because if i do wonder then i engage in

760
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,919
inference kind of thinking but that also

761
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,600
does not come for free that i'm using

762
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,799
beijing inference

763
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,480
unless i have the training and i'm

764
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,320
applying that for that purpose

765
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,480
right so uh what i think is problematic

766
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,600
about that is that

767
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,799
once we start thinking about um whether

768
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,799
someone really touched my arm

769
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,720
in kind of like a wandering kind of way

770
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,480
it's because we are assuming that we

771
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,919
don't have a direct access

772
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,080
to that particular experience somehow

773
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,600
that particular experience is hidden

774
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,080
from us

775
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,640
so we need to infer whether it is really

776
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,240
the case that i'm in pain

777
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,200
for example right so that puts us in

778
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,000
another

779
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,240
yet level of experience which is like

780
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,240
the position of a spectator

781
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,080
the spectator does not have direct

782
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,080
access to whatever is going on

783
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,600
so it needs to infer what is the most um

784
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,960
uh uh the the best explanation for that

785
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,919
particular case

786
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,840
yeah i just wanted to add that

787
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,640
interesting thank you

788
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,600
stephen and then

789
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,279
yeah that that idea of how much you have

790
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,120
have access to

791
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,960
and that may relate to different types

792
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,520
of engagement but the the

793
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,760
the way do we have access to our

794
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,600
multi-sensory integration

795
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,799
so we have a sense that we are i'm here

796
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:47,600
now i'm

797
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,720
i feel myself sitting i can see i can

798
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,520
hear

799
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,640
i'm aware of stuff and then i'm waiting

800
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,120
that's

801
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,880
in different ways just in my awareness i

802
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,760
suppose

803
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,760
and then there's the question of like

804
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,320
what i actually choose to do

805
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,960
um which made me more deductive maybe

806
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,880
more based on cues

807
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,039
so it is is interesting once you get to

808
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,640
this conscious

809
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,480
level is how much does the conscious

810
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,000
level give us

811
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,279
a way to not have to follow

812
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,399
um ergodic kind of flows

813
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,360
and we can kind of break out from that

814
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:25,919
but

815
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,039
when we get down to lower levels it kind

816
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,600
of needs to be more

817
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,240
flow it needs to basically be more

818
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,200
biological

819
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,960
so to speak um i don't know if that

820
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,360
makes sense but

821
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,639
thanks steven blue

822
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,440
so i just wonder is the model of the

823
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,159
self

824
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,360
maybe the ego like are those two things

825
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,080
the same

826
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,559
and like does the self model necessarily

827
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,360
need to be

828
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,080
um like rooted in narratives uh and i

829
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,559
think we

830
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,919
that we kind of touched on this a little

831
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,399
bit um last week i think scott had

832
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,720
brought that up and then just to reflect

833
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
really on what shannon said and what he

834
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,200
ness

835
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,760
uh just was talking about um you know in

836
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,200
terms of like a

837
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,519
a pain experience right like this is

838
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,279
kind of in like the

839
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,840
the eastern traditions pain is a very

840
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,880
like objective

841
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,120
experience like yes i'm feeling pain

842
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,279
like i just burned my hand on a hot pot

843
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,960
of water or whatever so like pain is

844
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,640
like an objective experience

845
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,640
but the suffering that's associated with

846
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,200
that pain is a subjective experience and

847
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,559
that's that's part of like

848
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,399
your ego or identity like oh my god i

849
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:35,840
feel so horrible for myself

850
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,919
or like suffering in relation to the

851
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,360
pain that you're experiencing is

852
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,360
optional right it's not uh it's not

853
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,799
something that you have to

854
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,279
necessarily like experience and so i

855
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,000
wonder then

856
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,960
is suffering like inference is is that

857
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,880
part that's the inference part or

858
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,640
or i don't know just a thought

859
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,000
yeah it's like the observation it's

860
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,240
raining and if you are i'm the kind of

861
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,240
person who's sad on a rainy day or i'm

862
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,519
the kind of person who's happy on a

863
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,399
rainy day

864
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,720
it's quite disjoint from it raining or

865
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,080
not but then sometimes when it's

866
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,320
biological and it's about our body

867
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,679
it's easy to conflate those two like

868
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,200
well pain is bad and it makes me suffer

869
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,320
because it's painful

870
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,840
but actually there is a little bit of a

871
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,519
step in between shannon

872
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,760
yeah thanks for that um so yeah i wonder

873
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,158
if there

874
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,159
it makes sense um to say to

875
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,480
a philosopher that we have direct access

876
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,399
to

877
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,000
something that something emergent

878
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,799
um but our brain is a spectator in this

879
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:39,840
process

880
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,880
so i have access to knowing that someone

881
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,240
touched my hands

882
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,880
i might question it if i see nobody's

883
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,799
touching my hand but someone stimulated

884
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,039
my brain in a certain way and i still

885
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,240
feel that sensation

886
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,720
i still have direct access i feel like

887
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,240
to that sensation

888
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,760
i don't feel like it's vertical with the

889
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,840
world anymore or vertical with

890
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,360
um touching on my actual hand

891
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,960
um and then maybe on the level of of

892
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,919
the person like blue said i can

893
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,039
associate

894
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,320
this feeling with pain or if this is an

895
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,080
instant where i enjoy this feeling then

896
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,440
i don't associate it with

897
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,159
um the suffering i get you said of pain

898
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:20,880
um

899
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,080
but my brain doesn't know that

900
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,760
like so my neurons are still being a

901
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,240
spectator on these sensations

902
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,399
and are still inferring

903
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,159
something about their causes or

904
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,240
something about what the next sensation

905
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,840
the next pattern of activity will be

906
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,279
given the pattern of activity they're

907
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,360
feeling now

908
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,480
so on our emergent on our side of these

909
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,480
emergent processes we can have

910
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,240
something like direct access but

911
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,320
within all of the individual parts that

912
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,679
make up that emergent process

913
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,360
we still have a bunch of spectators a

914
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,240
bunch of neurons

915
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,879
cool um thomas stephen and s

916
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,320
yeah so that's that's um that's very

917
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,360
interesting um

918
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,839
let's see i i initially had a just a

919
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:12,960
comment on

920
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,079
blue but now also on shannon so

921
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,359
um i think the first thing

922
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:24,320
to try and understand is um

923
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320
what it really means to say that the

924
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,480
brain knows

925
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,079
anything at all um and that's actually

926
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,599
something in holi's work

927
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,040
that i would also quite strongly

928
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,320
criticize

929
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,679
because there is a weird way in which

930
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,280
a single organ in a body

931
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,800
suddenly becomes a an autonomous agent

932
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,320
where it is guessing things

933
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,000
where it is predicting things it's

934
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,839
knowing things and

935
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,520
doing all sorts of things that

936
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,800
we would usually relegate to the

937
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,480
personal level or the agent level um

938
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,359
this is i think fairly well known among

939
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,119
neuroscientists the

940
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,040
myriological fallacy ascribing

941
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,320
agent-level behaviors to a part of the

942
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,680
system

943
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,119
um the

944
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,520
thing is then that the brain doesn't

945
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,119
have access

946
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,599
and needs to predict or because it

947
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:32,450
doesn't know

948
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,599
[Music]

949
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,680
doesn't really make any sense anymore

950
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,880
when you

951
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,760
just see the brain as an organ in an

952
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,359
organism

953
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:46,160
and the organism as a whole has access

954
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,200
um so that's

955
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,760
that's one point the moment in what

956
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,119
you're doing here basically you're

957
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,720
shifting from

958
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,839
the uh from a neurocentric

959
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
way of doing cognitive science and

960
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,200
definition of the

961
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,040
mind to a more embodied one

962
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,320
um and then if you're talking about the

963
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,680
difference between

964
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,920
pain and suffering that comes with it as

965
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,599
blue was doing

966
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,079
um under the inactive approach

967
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:25,359
the um difference sort of falls away

968
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:29,520
um and both of them

969
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,119
are the very specific ways

970
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,160
that the sensory stimuli

971
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,599
and your own actions interrelate

972
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,040
those are called sensory motor

973
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,800
contingencies

974
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,119
um so if you get a pin prick

975
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,160
in your finger the pain

976
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,359
you're experiencing is the very specific

977
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:54,480
way

978
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,160
that the sensory stimuli in your finger

979
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,599
change as you poke the needle in

980
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,359
or the needle gets poked in if it's not

981
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,078
you doing it

982
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,040
or it's about squeezing a sponge and the

983
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,800
softness of the sponge that's a very

984
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,760
nice

985
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,440
example um you only really feel the

986
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,520
softness of the sponge

987
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,400
as you're squeezing the sponge there is

988
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:22,800
no

989
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,079
softness of the sponge separate

990
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,440
from your squeezing if you're not

991
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,200
squeezing the sponge

992
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,800
you won't know if it's soft and you

993
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,040
can't feel softness

994
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,560
so the softness you're experiencing just

995
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,000
is the particular way

996
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,400
that your sensory stimuli in your hand

997
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,720
interrelates with your own squeezing

998
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,119
so there's nothing over and above

999
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,960
that interactivity

1000
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,680
or underneath that interactivity that

1001
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,240
makes up the experience

1002
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,439
interesting thanks steven in ass blue

1003
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,400
thanks thomas that's really well put i

1004
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,079
mean i think that's where

1005
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,760
the idea of the spectator that in itself

1006
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,240
is a

1007
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,560
you can fall into that trap of it being

1008
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,079
apart because like a spectator is

1009
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,440
assuming like

1010
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,400
i see the story coming at me and

1011
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,480
therefore the brain is

1012
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,240
having all this information come in

1013
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,520
whereas if it's

1014
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,280
part of the the mind is part of the body

1015
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,880
and the proprioception and

1016
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,640
and the dynamic with whatever is being

1017
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,480
encountered

1018
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,640
then that spectator role doesn't really

1019
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,440
make as much sense so and i think that

1020
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,280
um

1021
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,119
that also then comes in with the active

1022
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,680
inference idea that the signal isn't

1023
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,240
coming in with the knowledge it's it's

1024
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,400
being created

1025
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,280
somehow well through active inference

1026
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:01,680
through

1027
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,520
this dynamical process so i think that's

1028
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,119
really interesting and one thing that's

1029
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,280
quite interesting to say with pain

1030
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,320
um is is pain you can only create pain

1031
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,520
you can only talk about pain through

1032
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,440
metaphor it's a stabbing pain

1033
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,560
it's an ache it's a it's um it's it's

1034
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,280
kind of a

1035
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,720
burning feeling so

1036
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,040
all pain is expressed or has to be

1037
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,800
expressed through some sort of metaphor

1038
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,440
so

1039
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,040
so um we have to utilize not just our

1040
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,800
proprioception but we're

1041
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,520
um we need to come back full loop with

1042
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,000
our sensory apparatus to create the

1043
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,880
thoughts

1044
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,320
and this is where the mental space

1045
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,760
psychology work could be quite

1046
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,960
interesting to

1047
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,680
to mix with that because that idea there

1048
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,640
is that

1049
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,160
there's an organizing principle in the

1050
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,680
space around us

1051
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,839
that we're effectively designing a

1052
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,359
mental space

1053
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,560
around us which then becomes

1054
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,720
a part of that interface so anyway that

1055
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,240
that's uh

1056
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,160
definitely an important point

1057
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,599
thanks ernest

1058
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,000
um okay i wanted to uh just go

1059
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,280
back to um brain level and then i want

1060
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,240
to go back to the

1061
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,599
self modeling um just to make a point

1062
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:18,720
about that

1063
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,160
um so on the on the case of the neural

1064
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:22,880
level

1065
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,119
um i think that we're talking about the

1066
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,640
spectator and we're talking

1067
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,560
we're trying to pursue this path where

1068
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,720
we were motivating why the brain is a

1069
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,440
spectator

1070
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,520
and then thomas made up this nice

1071
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,800
comment um

1072
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,960
coming from um the reasons that jakob

1073
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,400
hui provides

1074
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,040
um to that direction and i just want to

1075
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,240
address that from

1076
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,400
um the free energy principle in the uh

1077
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
the active inference um

1078
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,560
um trend um so i think that even if we

1079
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,440
would accept

1080
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,680
that um we were under the assumption it

1081
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,280
would accept the assumption

1082
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,520
that the brain is a spectator and we

1083
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,200
were sort of agreeing here with the

1084
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,400
yakov huey

1085
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,119
um that the brain is encapsulated in the

1086
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,800
skull therefore it needs to infer

1087
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,920
whatever is going on outside we have to

1088
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,000
understand that the brain

1089
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,280
has not uh gone to school to learn

1090
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,400
asian inference or dynamical modeling so

1091
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,240
that's important and

1092
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,000
we also should not forget because this

1093
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,839
is what brings us all here we're talking

1094
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,200
about free energy principle active

1095
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,560
inference and those things

1096
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,480
so this is not something that active

1097
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,680
inference or the free energy principle

1098
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,480
will endorse

1099
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,119
right that the brain is encapsulated um

1100
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:31,680
so

1101
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,040
uh according to the free energy

1102
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,119
principle or active inference

1103
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:36,960
um the brain is embedded in a

1104
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,720
multi-scale system that

1105
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,359
many people call can be captured by uh

1106
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,760
by nested markov blankets

1107
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,240
so this multi-scale system itself

1108
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,119
organizes

1109
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,319
at every single level and in

1110
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:54,079
function of immediate influences

1111
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,119
that we can explain for example by by by

1112
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,240
by applying uh

1113
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,720
active inference and and uh bayesian uh

1114
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,359
and the

1115
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,280
leaf and that kind of thing that we all

1116
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,880
know so this means

1117
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,040
uh one important thing which is that

1118
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,480
every part of the brain

1119
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,680
is interacting okay and

1120
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,680
where there is a interaction there is no

1121
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,800
spectator

1122
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,720
there are these causal influences and

1123
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,560
this is the principles of um

1124
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,079
effective connectivity for example which

1125
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,680
we talked about uh

1126
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,040
about last last week so i just wanted to

1127
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,800
put this out there that this sort of

1128
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,720
like spectator encapsulation is

1129
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,599
something that

1130
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,240
would not be endorsed um and i think

1131
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,319
that this is the right way to think

1132
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,480
i'm just not sure if we should take the

1133
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,160
realist um

1134
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,240
view about it the other point that i

1135
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,200
wanted to make just

1136
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,960
going back to the self-modeling and then

1137
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,720
probably just drop it but i think that

1138
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,160
this is important for us think and it

1139
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,359
wasn't mentioned

1140
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,880
um the self-modeling it's important to

1141
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,680
ask

1142
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,800
who is doing the modeling in

1143
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,920
self-modeling

1144
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,200
who is doing the modeling is it a

1145
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,000
homunculus

1146
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,960
so i think this is important because

1147
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,960
this there have been a few arguments

1148
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,640
against this idea of like of

1149
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,839
self-modeling

1150
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,079
and um it's important to know always

1151
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,680
because in science we know who's doing

1152
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,879
the modeling is the scientist

1153
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,359
in self-modeling i'm not sure who's

1154
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:20,880
doing the modeling

1155
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,160
yeah and yeah these are my points

1156
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,880
thanks a lot blue and then i'll ask a

1157
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,920
question from the live chat

1158
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,200
so um i don't know the the brain as a

1159
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:33,920
spectator

1160
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,720
is is an interesting uh point and also

1161
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,440
like who

1162
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,440
is doing the modeling like these two

1163
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,560
maybe might

1164
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,040
go together but maybe are are

1165
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,119
encompassed by a bigger question

1166
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,160
um like what does the brain know versus

1167
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,400
like what does the mind know and are

1168
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,520
these two things

1169
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,520
interchangeable like and what does the

1170
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,520
free energy principle apply to does it

1171
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,800
apply only to the brain

1172
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,359
or can we scale it to maybe include the

1173
00:43:59,359 --> 00:43:59,839
mind

1174
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,599
right or maybe the brain is part of the

1175
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,040
mind if you take a more

1176
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,040
embodied approach or what is the mind

1177
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,800
has also been like positive to be maybe

1178
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,720
like the bioelectric field that's been

1179
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,240
out there and some work so

1180
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,720
so what is the brain what is the mind

1181
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,520
can it

1182
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,200
is the brain part of the mind i would

1183
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,640
say a pretty large part if you're

1184
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,560
looking even at the bioelectric field

1185
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,160
it's it's a big part right like so the

1186
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,000
brain has most bioelectric

1187
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,680
activity so maybe it scales to that um

1188
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,920
so so and maybe like the integration of

1189
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,599
all of the systems happens

1190
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:30,880
outside of the brain i mean maybe a

1191
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,960
component happens inside the brain but

1192
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,599
maybe

1193
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,359
then it scales up to include like

1194
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,280
embodied knowledge such as you know

1195
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,560
the gut brain axis or other um

1196
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,400
areas so i just was wondering really

1197
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,400
what the free energy principle as

1198
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,240
developed by first and i guess is that a

1199
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,520
brain specific

1200
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,040
or do you what do you guys think can it

1201
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,560
scale to include the mind or

1202
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,319
or are these the same thing i don't know

1203
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,160
just curious

1204
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,359
yep um i'm gonna just wait for the live

1205
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,640
chat because it looks like a lot of

1206
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,160
people have thoughts on blue's question

1207
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:00,480
so

1208
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,839
stephen and s thomas and then i'll ask a

1209
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:04,960
question

1210
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,720
i mean this is also where the free

1211
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,400
energy principle and the active

1212
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,200
inference side comes in so i suppose

1213
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,079
there's the active inference would be

1214
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,839
like you could say it has to be inactive

1215
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,440
so it's the whole mind-body environment

1216
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,200
dynamic but then the question with the

1217
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,160
brain is

1218
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,280
is there a level of the brain

1219
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,720
they should say it's all using free

1220
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,640
energy principle but maybe there's a

1221
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,839
level of the brain

1222
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,040
which is um you know using free energy

1223
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,880
principle approaches to create the

1224
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,400
consciousness

1225
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,520
as this kind of epi phenomenon that's

1226
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,520
sitting on top of the whole organism

1227
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,440
which is more broadly used in active

1228
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,800
inference with this with the

1229
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,920
with the um senses my feeling

1230
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,920
is everything has to go back to the

1231
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,200
mind-body environment

1232
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:54,078
at some level but there may be some

1233
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,119
i don't know some like slightly higher

1234
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,839
level encapsulated piece that gives you

1235
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:02,400
the ability to have this reflective

1236
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,040
capacity of consciousness at like the

1237
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,000
human level

1238
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,599
but i'm not sure thanks steven

1239
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:15,520
um ines and thomas

1240
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,040
um yeah okay so i just wanted to um

1241
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,760
address the mind brain um whether the

1242
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,520
energy principle applies only to

1243
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,960
mind or brain or both or only that

1244
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,599
um i just wanted to bring to the

1245
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:30,240
discussion

1246
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,800
um the the the fact that the free energy

1247
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,760
principle

1248
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,599
uh is a principle that is supposed to

1249
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,680
apply to every single system that is in

1250
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,280
non-equilibrium steady states

1251
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,920
and this is the majority of the world

1252
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,440
it's very hard for us to find

1253
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,319
a system a natural system that is not um

1254
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,680
that is in equilibrium

1255
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,359
um so that's what the free energy

1256
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,680
applies to another way to say it is that

1257
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,119
free energy applies to anything that has

1258
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:54,480
a markov blanket in the sense that is

1259
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,640
coupled with the environment exchanging

1260
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,760
uh energy with the environment and

1261
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,200
interacting with the environment in that

1262
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,960
particular sense obviously these

1263
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,560
things become much more complex to

1264
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,079
explain for us when

1265
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,119
uh we come to adaptive systems because

1266
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,480
levels of complexity

1267
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,839
uh sort of explode because of the the

1268
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,400
the higher levels of degrees of freedom

1269
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,040
right

1270
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,119
so just to put it out there it applies

1271
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,200
to um every single system that is in

1272
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,800
non-equilibrium which is the majority of

1273
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,160
the things

1274
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,319
and then we can pursue a sort of a line

1275
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:27,280
of research that

1276
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,559
is about the mind brain identity

1277
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,480
where we ask questions of whether it

1278
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,400
applies only to the mind also applies to

1279
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,200
the brain or

1280
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,880
applies to both of them or tries to

1281
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,800
unify both of them in a single

1282
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,040
explanation right

1283
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,079
um so i think that um

1284
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,400
the machinery of the free energy

1285
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,839
principle with the corollary after

1286
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:48,960
active inference

1287
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,160
um is is very nice to to to help us

1288
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,079
understand both the mind and the brain

1289
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,839
and here by mind i'm thinking about the

1290
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:56,960
agent level

1291
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,359
where we we can think about decision

1292
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:00,160
making

1293
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,040
beliefs uh what is motivating my actions

1294
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:03,680
in terms of

1295
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,640
more intellectual aspects of ways that i

1296
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,839
can interact with the environment like

1297
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,440
having thoughts and beliefs

1298
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,440
uh that would be the mind and that would

1299
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,880
be the nice way where i think that the

1300
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,400
free energy principle with active

1301
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,000
inference can be very helpful

1302
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,359
um to develop um generative models for

1303
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:20,160
us to understand

1304
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,040
the specific psychological phenomenon

1305
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:23,680
that is

1306
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,480
on the agent level and then we can also

1307
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,280
apply this

1308
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,200
uh this machinery these generative

1309
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,599
models to uh the brain level which would

1310
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,119
be the neural level

1311
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,920
where we will look at the connectivity

1312
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,240
in

1313
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,359
brain activity and obviously we can

1314
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:42,559
explain these things by saying that

1315
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,960
the activity in the brain can be

1316
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,000
described

1317
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,319
as if there was belief update as we know

1318
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:49,040
uh uh

1319
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,760
with uh with active inference what i

1320
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,319
would then

1321
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,720
be a little bit more careful about is to

1322
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,520
say that

1323
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,640
um this is precisely our neuronal

1324
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,359
activity

1325
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:02,559
or even the agent level uh works

1326
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,839
uh when doing its own uh reasoning

1327
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:08,880
um to act in the environment um so

1328
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,480
that's what i would be a little bit more

1329
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,280
careful about

1330
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,680
is then the second the second step and i

1331
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,800
don't think that we lose

1332
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,920
a lot um i don't think that uh we lose

1333
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,119
the explanatory power

1334
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,760
as long as we understand that this is a

1335
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,000
tool

1336
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,359
thanks a lot thomas

1337
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,720
yeah i was um basically going to

1338
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,200
um say sort of the same thing as ines

1339
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,079
did

1340
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,640
um i mean that makes it a little easier

1341
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,440
for me

1342
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,240
um i think just mostly what is also what

1343
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:42,960
i would like to

1344
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,160
add is the free energy principle isn't

1345
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,760
going to tell you

1346
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,839
where the mind starts and where it ends

1347
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:55,520
um since it does apply to just about

1348
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:59,920
anything that exists um

1349
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,119
you can just take any system draw your

1350
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,200
own boundaries and start analyzing and

1351
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,599
things will start popping up

1352
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:12,400
um when you want to think about where is

1353
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,920
the mind is it the body

1354
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,480
is it the body in an environment is it

1355
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,920
just the brain

1356
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,480
um those are philosophical questions

1357
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,319
that will need philosophical answers

1358
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:26,480
um

1359
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,640
you can answer that in in different ways

1360
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,319
and if you want to say it's just the

1361
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,520
brain you're going to

1362
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,359
end up in sort of always camp the

1363
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,920
predictive mind you want to say it's the

1364
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,200
the body in

1365
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,480
its environment um you're going to

1366
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,960
end up more in an inactive camp but

1367
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,760
those are

1368
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,079
separate questions that i i don't think

1369
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,920
you're going to answer just by looking

1370
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,319
at the formalism

1371
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,160
cool it's like should the title of your

1372
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,839
book be the predictive mind

1373
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:57,760
the predictive brain the predictive

1374
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,160
brain body mind the predictive niche

1375
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,400
you could keep going and the point is

1376
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,640
when we're taking this instrumentalist

1377
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,880
multi-scale nested markov blanket

1378
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,800
approach you just

1379
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,160
could kind of pick your title depending

1380
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,920
on what you want to emphasize so the

1381
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,480
question

1382
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,240
from the chat which i think was related

1383
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,680
to this question about

1384
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,680
um who is doing the self-modeling and

1385
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,040
who am i which

1386
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,880
sounded a lot like some meditation

1387
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,079
prompts the question

1388
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,520
from cv in the chat was can

1389
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,160
spontaneously arising thought give us

1390
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,000
insight in to answer the questions in

1391
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,839
this discussion that cannot be given by

1392
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,680
any other research or other thought

1393
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,559
types

1394
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,760
if yes where and how thanks a lot

1395
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,720
so as selfs if we're thinking about this

1396
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,400
self modeling at the conscious level

1397
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,760
thomas you just said maybe there's

1398
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,280
things the formalism isn't going to

1399
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,000
resolve

1400
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,480
for us there's uncertainties we have

1401
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,240
that aren't going to be

1402
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,440
equations resolving it for us um

1403
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,480
might spontaneously arising thought

1404
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,079
or other types of reflection maybe

1405
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,720
shine some light into any of these

1406
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,280
questions

1407
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,880
so i'll just put that out there and go

1408
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,480
to just leave it up

1409
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,760
while we go to another um slide and then

1410
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,480
stephen just

1411
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,440
just to put this up because this was

1412
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,160
some related questions about the body's

1413
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,839
expectations and about where these

1414
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,400
priors or these expectations come from

1415
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,960
so any thoughts on the spontaneously

1416
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,000
arising thought

1417
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,480
or any other topic stephen and then any

1418
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,400
other hands

1419
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,880
i think this is quite interesting from

1420
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,119
the point of view of how

1421
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:32,079
neurophenomenology is generally done

1422
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:34,000
with people doing meditation

1423
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,599
so there's the idea that you know you

1424
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,760
track your thoughts that come up

1425
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,920
and then you sort of capture them but

1426
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,440
the question is well what's going on

1427
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,640
when i'm in the flow

1428
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,800
what's going on in my pre-reflective

1429
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,079
state when i'm in action

1430
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,280
and interaction a bit like now where in

1431
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,599
many ways that's what most of my life is

1432
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:54,160
and most people's life is and actually

1433
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,760
where maybe a lot of the interest is

1434
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,119
because that's where we struggle

1435
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,280
or have opportunities so i think this um

1436
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,440
question about how also is

1437
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,240
how are we when we're in this other sort

1438
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,440
of dynamic

1439
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,920
and how can we go back and revisit or

1440
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,599
explore

1441
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,480
what it is to be in action and what's

1442
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,359
going on there

1443
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,359
so i think that that this these same

1444
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:22,319
questions sort of feed back into that

1445
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,559
um related to the flow state and what it

1446
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:25,839
means to be a self

1447
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:28,240
are we most in touch with ourselves are

1448
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,000
we accessing ourselves being ourself

1449
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,040
most when we're

1450
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,440
writing a personal statement or when

1451
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,280
we're really focused on you know

1452
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,599
downhill skiing or a chess game

1453
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:39,839
the kinds of things that suzette mahali

1454
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,359
wrote about in flow

1455
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:43,599
and so during that downhill skiing or

1456
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,119
the chess game

1457
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:46,960
maybe somebody is not thinking about

1458
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,880
some of their somatosensory or their

1459
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:49,839
narrative self

1460
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:51,599
there's aspects of self that are

1461
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,839
actually specifically turned down to

1462
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:55,200
like almost zero

1463
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,559
and then there's a different focus but

1464
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:58,640
then maybe somebody might self-report

1465
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,119
after the skiing i'm so happy that's

1466
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:02,079
when i feel

1467
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:05,040
like myself and so what is this self

1468
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,400
that we're getting in touch with and how

1469
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,520
is that related

1470
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:11,119
to our um uh spontaneously arising

1471
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:14,960
thoughts blue and then anyone else

1472
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,800
so just to kind of comment on that and

1473
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,400
then tie it back into

1474
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,119
um like like what who what is the self

1475
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:22,880
that's doing the modeling right

1476
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,200
so the flow state is super interesting

1477
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:25,920
and

1478
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,720
it's like that is the space where the

1479
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,200
ego

1480
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,119
kind of drops away right like when

1481
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:32,640
you're in downhill skiing like you're

1482
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,920
not thinking about like

1483
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,760
what my colleagues thought about what i

1484
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,599
said at the business meeting

1485
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:39,920
like it's totally not at all in your in

1486
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,040
your like mental

1487
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,720
it's like all you're doing is focused on

1488
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,680
that task and especially in kinesthetic

1489
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,319
um like situations like dance and

1490
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:48,960
drumming

1491
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,799
and and all of these things which also

1492
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:53,280
tend to like alleviate the trauma

1493
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,200
experience right like so all these like

1494
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,760
where the flow state happens the like

1495
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,760
that's where there's really not that ego

1496
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,119
so there's not that

1497
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,280
um like self doing the modeling but then

1498
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,799
the ego might go back and be like i'm an

1499
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:06,160
awesome downhill skier

1500
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,240
right like so so there's this right like

1501
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,359
self-reflection

1502
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:12,480
on the flow state that that is like

1503
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,720
is that the integrator right so it just

1504
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,839
kind of maybe

1505
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:19,520
gives more um like rise to the ego

1506
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,400
doing the narrative or the modeling when

1507
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,920
you're doing that self

1508
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,160
self modeling or or self narration right

1509
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,559
yep really interesting i'll throw

1510
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,200
another

1511
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,240
question from marco in the chat

1512
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,280
marco wrote how about taking mutual

1513
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,000
inference more seriously and posit that

1514
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,760
mutualistic interactions

1515
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,960
are legitimate perceptual entities

1516
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,799
which may possess the potential to

1517
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:49,280
realize a markov blanket in turn

1518
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,079
what is the maximum markov blanket like

1519
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,520
i noted last session

1520
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,760
i don't think that the x or so kind of

1521
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,680
the logical boolean gate

1522
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,319
attitude to the schema and categories of

1523
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:02,000
realist instrumentalists

1524
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,839
um uh basically uh but

1525
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:09,040
i just can't read it live but yeah like

1526
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,200
it's should we be looking for a

1527
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,559
disjointness

1528
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:16,319
between realism and instrumentalism um

1529
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,720
that's kind of the topic of this paper

1530
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,680
so

1531
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,920
how do we take a realist approach to the

1532
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,359
instrumentalists

1533
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:26,720
um is almost what marco is

1534
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,880
uh getting out there but anyone can

1535
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,359
take a thought on that um thomas and

1536
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:35,680
then in s

1537
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,319
um i was mostly going to ask where is

1538
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:40,880
the chat

1539
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,160
where could i perhaps read this myself

1540
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,319
uh to try and sort out what exactly is

1541
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,440
uh

1542
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,359
oh it's the youtube live chat so if you

1543
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:50,480
just go to our

1544
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,640
twitter look at the most recent post

1545
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,400
you'll find the link to there but i'm

1546
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,000
not going to put it in the jitsi

1547
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,680
chat here because it will make like a

1548
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,119
swoosh sound but

1549
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:01,440
just go to the youtube link from our

1550
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,960
twitter um yeah

1551
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,000
thank you yes

1552
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,359
i just want to uh sort of like address

1553
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:10,400
that by

1554
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,520
sort of um throwing a question

1555
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,599
at it or sort of a comment actually um

1556
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:20,720
i want to say that again in that regard

1557
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:24,240
i want to just point out that we

1558
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,240
the neuroscientists are the only ones

1559
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,280
who have the cake

1560
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,559
and want to eat the cake and that means

1561
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:31,040
that

1562
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,079
amongst every scientist that is working

1563
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:34,880
with models

1564
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,000
across the world in every single science

1565
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,720
we neuroscientists are the only ones

1566
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,598
that are realists

1567
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,599
very nice and i'm gonna take that to

1568
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:48,960
this next question so

1569
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,799
as i understand that it's almost like

1570
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:52,559
there's the venn diagram of people who

1571
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:52,880
are

1572
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,920
studying models or using models and

1573
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,559
basically no one has a problem with oh

1574
00:57:58,559 --> 00:57:58,960
yeah

1575
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,960
the flow of water through this dam is

1576
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,400
going to be modeled with this kind of an

1577
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,280
oscillator

1578
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,880
everyone's pretty instrumental about and

1579
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,559
then you have people who are thinking

1580
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:07,119
about

1581
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,599
the brain and there it's kind of like

1582
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:10,720
the stakes are high

1583
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,040
because it's it's us on the table um

1584
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:13,760
dissecting

1585
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,559
ourself and so it's hard to step away

1586
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,079
from a realist interpretation from

1587
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:18,559
what's

1588
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:21,440
you know right inside so how do we step

1589
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,200
outside of that and then this is where i

1590
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,720
um put with uh alex's uh suggestions and

1591
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,280
prodding about where engineering fits

1592
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,319
into this and almost

1593
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:32,079
is engineering like radical

1594
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:33,359
instrumentalism

1595
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:34,720
when we're dispensing with any kind of

1596
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,480
realism and we just want to get it done

1597
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,200
within

1598
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,720
the time frame and the budget and the

1599
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,559
affordances that we have

1600
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,680
is that akin to engineering so blue

1601
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,880
steven and then anyone else

1602
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,079
so i i love that neuroscientists

1603
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:52,400
have their cake and want to eat it also

1604
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,680
and i just was like thinking and

1605
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,200
reflecting like maybe there are actually

1606
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,960
some other groups where that applies

1607
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:57,359
like

1608
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,880
medical doctors um also like

1609
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,920
kinesthesiologists right so anybody that

1610
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,680
kind of studies like the brain

1611
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,839
or the body like does it apply like they

1612
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:07,359
have the model they're also using the

1613
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:08,799
model like maybe they're not

1614
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:11,280
modeling the ma or modeling the model

1615
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,960
like within the model i don't i don't

1616
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,480
know like it's like it gets like very

1617
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,079
nested with neuroscience but

1618
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:18,559
but there maybe are some other um groups

1619
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,760
that are doing this as well

1620
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,920
great stephen i would

1621
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,359
i would actually question that because

1622
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:32,400
i'm having some challenges around

1623
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,480
working with complex adaptive system

1624
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,559
applications in other fields

1625
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:39,040
you know like social development and

1626
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:39,920
stuff

1627
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,599
and i think that this is the they may be

1628
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:44,480
the only ones that

1629
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,319
try and get the cake and eat it but

1630
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:48,799
everyone is just swimming in cake mix

1631
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:52,319
in a funny way because everyone assumes

1632
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:54,559
you can make a system model

1633
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,960
and that the system model can be a

1634
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,079
snapshot

1635
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,040
and you have flows of real things

1636
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,520
flowing it's very entity based

1637
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,720
and even the idea of the self

1638
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,160
and um the the idea of the self

1639
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,400
and there's a good paper on this by

1640
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,280
bolus

1641
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,920
and where he talks about the self is

1642
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,720
actually a social construct in itself

1643
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,880
about two and a half thousand years ago

1644
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,160
the idea of self

1645
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,799
was constructed and i have a sense of

1646
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:25,839
self

1647
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:29,119
so i'm in a society and if you go back

1648
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:30,400
to indigenous approaches

1649
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,280
i you are one of the land you and the

1650
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,559
land are one

1651
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:37,359
which is maybe a bit more like reality

1652
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:38,559
if we're gonna

1653
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:41,280
say reality but there is this challenge

1654
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,079
because

1655
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:45,680
everyone's using systems at some levels

1656
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,839
to make the models or we talk about that

1657
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:49,040
way so i

1658
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:52,319
kind of agree but i would also say that

1659
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:55,680
it's the the there is a paradigm

1660
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:00,000
challenge here about how to think about

1661
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,319
um what's going on in terms of how

1662
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:08,880
we are actually knowing about the world

1663
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,680
thanks steven um blue and then anyone

1664
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,839
else

1665
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,559
so that just reminded me like the self

1666
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:18,559
as a social construct

1667
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:21,359
um it's a super interesting point and i

1668
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:22,640
don't know if you guys are familiar with

1669
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,520
the work of

1670
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,160
jay garfield but he talks a lot about

1671
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:26,799
the work

1672
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:29,839
of um like or the development of the

1673
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:30,640
self like

1674
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,119
like becoming self aware or self

1675
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:33,920
consciousness

1676
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,400
like in terms of like a developmental

1677
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,240
aspect and like you don't realize

1678
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,799
like like the context that you realize

1679
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:42,000
that you are

1680
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,480
a self like that's distinct it's

1681
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,280
actually not

1682
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,280
yourself that you realize first you

1683
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,960
actually realize

1684
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,040
others so he talks about second person

1685
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,319
so like you

1686
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:54,720
as soon as you realize as an infant that

1687
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,640
there's a you who are going to come take

1688
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,520
care of me

1689
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,039
like there's a you out there that are

1690
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:00,400
going to feed me there's the you out

1691
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,359
there that are going to

1692
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:03,359
make me comfortable when i'm you know

1693
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:05,440
sick or wet or whatever like

1694
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,839
in in very infant hood in the human

1695
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:08,559
species

1696
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,880
as soon as we realize that there's a you

1697
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,680
that's when

1698
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,000
the dichotomy appears that there's me

1699
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,599
right like so it's just very interesting

1700
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:16,240
because it

1701
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,240
it starts as a social construct this

1702
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,000
idea of the self from a very very

1703
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,839
early age thanks blue

1704
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:28,559
and alex v yeah thanks

1705
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:32,000
i want to add from engineering domain

1706
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,599
that

1707
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:37,520
for now the system engineering have a

1708
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,720
sad joke that we can we can't include

1709
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:41,760
people

1710
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,920
to the scope of the system because we

1711
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,680
can't control people

1712
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,799
so okay we can control almost everything

1713
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:49,920
but not people

1714
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,760
in the loop so we are trying to

1715
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,039
go out of the way with it

1716
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:00,720
but but if

1717
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:04,799
engineering is a radical instrumentalism

1718
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:08,480
we can consider active inference

1719
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,359
framework

1720
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:12,480
which provides as it was said on

1721
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:16,480
agent level some models

1722
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,400
which provide this opportunity to

1723
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,079
include people

1724
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:23,200
to the scope of the system uh because

1725
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,559
and by organizing some communication

1726
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:27,200
structure

1727
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,480
around this agent and create some niche

1728
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,839
for them where we can

1729
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:37,200
communicate in uh some

1730
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,160
language of the domain we are working on

1731
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,200
and here comes

1732
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,240
to replace all stuff

1733
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:48,480
with languages and with ontologies

1734
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:53,119
and also for ontologies and knowledge

1735
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:56,400
life cycle management uh and it's

1736
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,160
if we consider it in engineering way and

1737
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,599
not trying to go uh

1738
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:07,200
down from agent level uh but trying to

1739
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:07,760
see

1740
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,240
or on agent environment and maybe it's

1741
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,440
as it was told that we can say

1742
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,799
about agent level how mind level

1743
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:23,119
and for this mind level uh the behavior

1744
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:26,640
of the agent is a correlate for his all

1745
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,000
kind of states under his

1746
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,200
marco blanket thanks

1747
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,680
alex it's almost like because you can't

1748
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:36,880
engineer the human

1749
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,640
you're engineering the inputs and the

1750
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,160
affordances that's where active

1751
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,599
inference comes into play it's like if

1752
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:42,640
you're going to do water

1753
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,640
engineering you're talking about making

1754
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,640
the canal and the dams and the

1755
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,760
measurement devices

1756
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,920
not going in there and engineering the

1757
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,760
water water interactions

1758
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,680
so engineering and instrumentalism is

1759
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,200
almost always

1760
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,359
at the periphery of an uncontrollable

1761
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:59,440
system interfacing between

1762
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,000
our regimes of order and attention and

1763
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:02,880
then a system

1764
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,559
whose dynamics are being modeled

1765
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:05,920
instrumentally because

1766
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:09,200
it's um the fringe it's what's not known

1767
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:13,118
so um ines and then dave

1768
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:16,559
yeah i think that's um that's about

1769
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:18,240
right because so we have a tendency to

1770
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:18,880
think that

1771
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,200
to take the realist approach if we come

1772
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,000
from the sciences

1773
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,760
of the mind and brain but then we would

1774
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,280
not commit the same kind of

1775
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,520
um would not have be have the same kind

1776
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,559
of attitude

1777
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:31,680
if we were trying to model uh

1778
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,960
a non-adaptive um system

1779
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,720
so i think that comes from the fact that

1780
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,160
we do see that there's a difference

1781
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,680
between adaptive and non-adaptive

1782
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:40,559
systems

1783
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:44,000
and that sort of like gives us um

1784
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,760
part of the motivation to think that

1785
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,039
because they're adaptive

1786
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:49,599
then they must be uh using the models

1787
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:50,160
that we

1788
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,079
are in order to explain them but i think

1789
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:54,559
this is a fallacy that sort of conflates

1790
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:58,640
um uh the the the explanation

1791
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:59,920
exponential

1792
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,400
so um but the point that i wanted to

1793
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,240
make uh was more of

1794
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,359
um coming back

1795
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:10,720
to the self as a social construct

1796
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,480
we can push that even a little bit

1797
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,440
further if we go back to matarana and

1798
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,119
varela with the autopay as this theory

1799
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:18,079
and i find this very

1800
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:21,280
useful uh because it's it's it's a nice

1801
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,280
exercise all of us take um cognition

1802
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,200
to be something that is an ontological

1803
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,480
property of

1804
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,680
uh the organism and this is precisely

1805
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,280
what matarana specifically

1806
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,079
uh challenges with the autopias's theory

1807
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:36,640
um

1808
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,799
it tells us that cognition is a

1809
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:39,839
construct

1810
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:42,000
that is in the eye of the scientists so

1811
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,839
cognition is not even something that has

1812
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,799
a reference

1813
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:47,680
um in the world which is super

1814
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:48,559
interesting because

1815
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,400
when we started constructing things like

1816
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,160
this that this is going to have direct

1817
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,240
implications for the way we see models

1818
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,520
uh what it tells us is that we

1819
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:00,799
observe behavior in

1820
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:02,559
uh in systems as they interact because

1821
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:04,240
they are adaptive systems that interact

1822
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,680
with the environment and we observe

1823
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,960
certain behavior and

1824
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,280
make sense of it by by by coming up with

1825
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,400
patterns

1826
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,480
um that's how we make sense of this

1827
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,480
behavior we come up with patterns and

1828
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,280
then

1829
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:18,160
we deem these patterns or this behavior

1830
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:18,559
as

1831
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:21,359
cognitive but we do this as scientists

1832
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:21,760
the

1833
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,240
system itself the organism itself is not

1834
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,920
cognitive this is not an ontological

1835
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:26,720
property

1836
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:29,520
of of the system so i think this is this

1837
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:30,880
is important to think about

1838
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,520
because this also allows us to now by

1839
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,680
taking the kind of same reasoning

1840
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,079
then we can apply this by saying that we

1841
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:39,760
can model we can observe

1842
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,240
this this behavior we can patent this

1843
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:42,880
behavior

1844
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,559
through the modeling techniques that we

1845
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:46,799
have but the modeling technique is not

1846
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:48,480
an ontological property

1847
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,359
of the organism

1848
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,920
thanks for that dave and then anyone

1849
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,119
else

1850
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:58,640
if you want a real grasp of where

1851
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,680
a self comes from you got to start with

1852
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,960
the newborn alum shore did some

1853
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,480
very detailed work on the creation of

1854
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,280
the self

1855
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,880
as part of the mother newborn dyad

1856
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:17,439
and the really intricate um

1857
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:20,719
not self modeling but us modeling

1858
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:24,000
and a constant dialectic

1859
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,080
of um

1860
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,600
alienation followed by reparation you

1861
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,000
know

1862
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,759
mommy dis disappoints the baby and it's

1863
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,759
the worst thing in the world the baby

1864
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:40,158
wants to kill mommy and then wants to

1865
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:40,560
eat

1866
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,679
mommy and wants to save mommy from the

1867
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:45,279
monsters

1868
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:47,120
well once you got a good grasp of that

1869
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,120
then you go and do uh

1870
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,759
ethological work and see how other

1871
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:54,319
creatures

1872
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,719
differentiate their children there's a

1873
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:59,040
lot of socialization a lot of

1874
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:03,679
creation of of the style of a newborn

1875
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:05,279
cult even though they can get up and run

1876
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:07,040
around pretty fast and then you come

1877
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,719
back and look at pathological cases with

1878
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:10,560
humans melanie klein was the first

1879
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,158
person who realized that you can

1880
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:14,799
psychoanalyze a child who cannot speak

1881
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:15,439
yet

1882
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:17,279
and really worked at that and figured

1883
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,198
out how you can find out what's going on

1884
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:20,158
in the kid who's the

1885
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:22,960
who's the the baby mad at by seeing how

1886
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,000
how he plays

1887
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,359
with uh toys how he plays with dolls

1888
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,920
um his pictures these kind of kids that

1889
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:30,880
can't

1890
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,120
uh speak can still draw and

1891
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,279
you know rip up pictures that they don't

1892
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:40,159
like and um

1893
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:44,479
there's a lot of poignance

1894
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:47,040
in the emergence of the self-creation of

1895
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,960
a self

1896
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,080
cool well um to kind of operationalize

1897
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,600
that and bring it back to a figure and a

1898
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,440
question in the chat

1899
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,480
this nested markov blanket uh

1900
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,880
self concept or in the neighborhood of

1901
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,320
the self

1902
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:05,199
someone writes in the chat can we

1903
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:06,800
measure markov blankets

1904
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,960
the way we measure or estimate any other

1905
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,560
physical entity

1906
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,159
i've heard carl fristen saying that

1907
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:14,080
every electron does have a markov

1908
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:14,719
blanket

1909
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:17,120
can we measure statistically speaking

1910
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,120
electrons markov blanket

1911
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,120
and i i think it might be related to

1912
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,120
some other points that marco has in the

1913
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,640
chat which we can bring up afterwards

1914
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,120
but

1915
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,960
it is really important if we're talking

1916
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,719
about markov blankets

1917
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:30,880
um and that's figure one is this this

1918
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,480
pink dashed line

1919
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,640
that um is uh and if that's how we're

1920
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,520
going to be

1921
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,480
modeling in the free energy principle

1922
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,560
how do we do inference on these markov

1923
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:41,199
blankets

1924
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:44,159
what does have this and um how do we go

1925
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:44,880
from there

1926
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,640
so um shannon and s

1927
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:52,480
yeah so this is a good question we

1928
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:55,280
we we can with a caveat measure the

1929
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:58,000
markov blanket of

1930
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,040
of a certain electron or certain neuron

1931
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:01,440
it's

1932
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:05,440
the s statistical boundary here

1933
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:08,159
and it's any states that you need to

1934
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:08,719
describe

1935
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:10,159
to in order in order to explain the

1936
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:12,640
behavior of what you want to model

1937
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,640
and you can kind of decide as a

1938
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,960
scientist at what level

1939
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,120
do you want to describe this behavior so

1940
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,000
your electrons markov blanket might not

1941
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,800
include the behavior of the body it

1942
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,280
might just

1943
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,239
include the neighboring electrons next

1944
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:30,799
to it or

1945
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,840
as far basically as far out as you need

1946
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,120
to explain the behavior

1947
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,800
at the level that you want to explain it

1948
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,960
so it's not a fact of

1949
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,840
of nature which is me agreeing like

1950
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,280
wholeheartedly with this instrumentalist

1951
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:43,920
perspective

1952
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,440
it's where you want to draw the boundary

1953
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,719
in order to explain the behavior that

1954
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:51,440
you're interested in

1955
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:55,839
thanks shannon and us

1956
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:00,080
yeah that's precisely right um i wanna

1957
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,360
just to say that

1958
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:04,159
uh marco blankets are not something that

1959
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:06,000
exists out there in the wild

1960
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,679
um so when we say that we can measure

1961
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:12,480
the markov blanket of a neuron it's i

1962
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,840
would probably just like

1963
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,800
formulate it differently we can apply um

1964
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,520
markov blanket as a statistical tool

1965
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,600
uh to the level of description of neuron

1966
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,520
which is the one i'm interested

1967
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,480
and it is precisely this special tool

1968
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,000
this statistical tool which

1969
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,239
does not have to correspond to physical

1970
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:31,679
boundaries of anything

1971
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:34,400
because um we get markov blankets by

1972
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,400
identifying the influences that certain

1973
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,040
states have

1974
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,920
in other states so that's how we find

1975
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,600
markov blankets they don't exist they

1976
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,719
are a way of us

1977
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:46,400
to um sort of like have a nice topology

1978
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,280
of how certain states are influencing

1979
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,960
other states and in the end we got would

1980
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:53,040
also get like a nice thing which is like

1981
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,280
how a certain system is coupled with

1982
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,560
another system and

1983
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:59,600
because of the it's skill-free um as uh

1984
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,000
as

1985
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,760
shannon was uh rightly pointing out

1986
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,440
because of the scale-free property of

1987
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,640
the markov blankets

1988
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:08,159
we can apply this statistical tool to

1989
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:10,400
whichever level of description we are

1990
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,280
interested in

1991
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,600
studying so we can apply this to the

1992
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:14,640
single-level

1993
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,880
neuron but we can also apply this to

1994
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,480
a column we can apply this to regions

1995
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,480
can apply to the brain as a whole we can

1996
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,000
apply it to the organism

1997
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,880
that is uh coupled with the environment

1998
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,560
and we can also apply this to

1999
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,880
social networks and things like that as

2000
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,560
long as there are interactions

2001
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,080
and influences um uh that are occurring

2002
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:38,880
between

2003
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,520
states then we can um we can apply this

2004
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,000
tool

2005
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,560
to explain how uh these influences are

2006
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,440
occurring

2007
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,520
um between the states and yes this would

2008
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,400
be a very instrumentalist reading

2009
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,520
and i think the only possible one

2010
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,640
cool and and marco um adds a few more

2011
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,120
points

2012
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,280
and says i don't buy the exclusionist

2013
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,159
categorization

2014
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:02,800
when it comes to fep because it

2015
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,239
functions both as a modeling

2016
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:07,199
technique and an ontological system and

2017
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:08,000
i think

2018
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,560
we're um hopefully conveying what you're

2019
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,719
writing and it's a discussion that is

2020
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:13,280
non

2021
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,960
it's a yes and with realism and

2022
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,800
instrumentalism and so

2023
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,800
um i hope we're bringing a lot of

2024
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,560
perspectives to bear

2025
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,880
on maybe where the fdp sits in this

2026
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,400
space and that's some of the

2027
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,239
great topics that were broached in the

2028
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:28,000
paper and some of the really important

2029
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,840
work that's being done so that we don't

2030
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,120
preemptively come

2031
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,280
hard on one side or have an exclusionist

2032
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,800
perspective and

2033
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,520
part of that is actually enacting that

2034
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:38,719
conversation

2035
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,400
not just having one really convincing

2036
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,159
thought that convinces us that it is

2037
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:45,120
way a or way b or neither a or b but

2038
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,719
actually bringing together

2039
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:48,320
different perspectives on the topic and

2040
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,480
then seeing where that goes so thanks

2041
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:50,960
everyone

2042
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,280
you know as always for participating

2043
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,159
which is actually

2044
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:56,400
enacts the pluralism through

2045
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,520
participation

2046
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:01,360
so stephen and then thomas

2047
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,199
we're kind of one good thing about this

2048
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,800
paper which

2049
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,760
is opening up even bigger aspects of

2050
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,520
complex adaptive systems

2051
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:12,880
applications so i feel like we're we're

2052
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,400
putting a lot of

2053
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,640
bigger ideas on the edge of some other

2054
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:17,760
fields of practice

2055
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,520
on this work that neuroscientist is

2056
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,120
doing but i think it's really valuable

2057
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,320
because

2058
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,320
there's this question of

2059
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:25,520
non-representational approaches

2060
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:29,199
um in social sciences which are kind of

2061
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:29,920
in that

2062
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,480
ways of trying to understand things

2063
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:33,600
around complex

2064
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,840
complexity has been used more and one of

2065
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,360
the big areas

2066
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,760
by michael quinn patton in qualitative

2067
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:40,800
research is

2068
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,920
there's this new work around principles

2069
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,080
focused evaluation

2070
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:50,000
which moves away from more sort of

2071
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:54,239
betterment or sort of final product

2072
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,960
evaluation this idea of looking at broad

2073
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:57,679
principles

2074
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:00,960
for projects which are evolving but

2075
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,000
haven't got a set of rules that can just

2076
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,400
be governed and replicated it's

2077
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,640
it's it's formed you know what it is

2078
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,239
it's not completely

2079
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:12,320
being formed from nothing but then

2080
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:13,600
you've got to work with the principles

2081
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,280
and i think that may

2082
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:18,480
reflect some of this um discussion

2083
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,239
that's going on here with with

2084
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:21,920
rules and principles because i'm now

2085
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,520
thinking well rules are probably

2086
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,600
something that's more realist

2087
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:30,159
and principles maybe

2088
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:33,760
are broader than that i don't know

2089
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,360
i think there's something around this

2090
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,760
broader area of complex adaptive systems

2091
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,840
in general and what it means to look at

2092
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,760
them and then this is one aspect of that

2093
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,840
awesome stephen thanks a lot thomas and

2094
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:49,840
ines

2095
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:55,280
yeah um so i wanted to quickly add on to

2096
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:59,040
what um shannon and enes were saying um

2097
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:02,159
in response the measurement question

2098
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:05,199
and in full agreement just to

2099
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:07,040
really answer the question can you

2100
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,199
measure a markov blanket in the same way

2101
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:10,560
that we can

2102
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,960
measure any other physical system that

2103
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:13,920
would then be a

2104
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:17,440
no because the markov blanket is part of

2105
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,199
our toolkit

2106
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:23,040
with which we measure the system

2107
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:26,800
um and then

2108
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,000
on the marcos

2109
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,360
commented on the exclusionary reading of

2110
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,440
uh realism and instrumentalism and uh

2111
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,440
either to pick one or the other

2112
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,759
um

2113
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,960
that's a very interesting point

2114
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,960
and i guess shows that the

2115
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,480
enumeration we had of different

2116
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,640
positions um

2117
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:55,840
wasn't exhaustive i had not personally

2118
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:01,040
really considered a pluralist account

2119
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,679
and i'm not sure exactly what that means

2120
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:07,440
still

2121
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,199
which is i guess part of why i didn't

2122
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:13,040
consider it um and i think i think that

2123
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,480
will really take some

2124
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:18,400
some um good spelling out of what

2125
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:22,960
pluralism really means here because

2126
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,760
the only way i can think of it is

2127
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:29,440
different strands of realism

2128
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,520
because i don't feel like you can get

2129
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,520
any form of realism if you actually take

2130
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,320
instrumentalism seriously

2131
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,719
in the sense that if you're saying well

2132
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:40,640
this is part of our scientific toolkit

2133
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,280
with which we're describing a system

2134
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:46,580
realism is cut off right then and there

2135
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:48,080
[Applause]

2136
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,880
but of course pluralism in the sense of

2137
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:51,280
let's

2138
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:53,360
discuss different ideas and look where

2139
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,719
that leads us

2140
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:57,040
is a different thing and we should

2141
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,719
definitely do that because otherwise you

2142
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:00,080
know we're not really

2143
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:04,080
going anywhere yeah that was a yeah

2144
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,960
very very interesting it's like

2145
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:09,199
conversational pluralism or a social

2146
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:10,000
pluralism

2147
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,199
exploratory pluralism is a slightly

2148
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:14,960
different kind of claim

2149
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,239
than the um other

2150
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:20,239
sub questions that pluralism could

2151
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:21,920
impinge upon

2152
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,520
an s and then anyone else who raised

2153
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,840
their hand

2154
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,320
okay so i wanted to address the question

2155
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,080
in the chat

2156
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,640
about whether we should be realist about

2157
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,840
free energy principle

2158
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:37,760
um and yeah i want to just start by

2159
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,679
saying that the free energy principle is

2160
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:40,880
a principle

2161
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,199
so we would expect it to have like

2162
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:44,800
something to say about

2163
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,840
uh a tell us of things some explanation

2164
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,040
that we would expect

2165
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,960
systems to behave in such a way and this

2166
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,880
is what we discussed last week

2167
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,320
there was a distinction between the

2168
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:57,360
furniture principle and process theories

2169
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,440
right process theories aim to describe

2170
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,480
processes

2171
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,800
uh that would explain a certain uh

2172
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:05,040
psychological or cognitive or neural

2173
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,639
phenomenon or something like that

2174
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:08,880
the free energy principle has something

2175
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,960
to say teleologically speaking

2176
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:13,440
so it has something to say about how we

2177
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,400
would expect

2178
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,120
an organism to behave towards something

2179
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,639
some ultimate goal

2180
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:21,120
right and this is for example uh that

2181
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:21,840
the system

2182
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,639
does not want to die wants to avoid

2183
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:26,239
uncertain states uh

2184
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:28,159
because it doesn't want to die so he

2185
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:30,080
wants to select the states that are

2186
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,040
going to be much

2187
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,400
much more favorable to um to their

2188
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,320
their existence uh in a particular

2189
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,639
situation so obviously the free energy

2190
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:39,840
principle

2191
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,400
has got these sort of like much more um

2192
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,760
is charged with

2193
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,040
with giving us an explanation about uh

2194
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,679
whichever we find the system doing the

2195
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:51,040
system is going to be

2196
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,920
um very likely is going to be evolving

2197
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:54,639
towards

2198
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:57,360
uh avoiding its dissipation so that's

2199
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,360
what we get from as opposed to

2200
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:01,760
the the process theories where we don't

2201
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:02,800
really get to tell us

2202
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,239
what we get is um a description of

2203
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:09,920
system of processes uh in systems

2204
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:13,280
that minimize prediction error but let's

2205
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,280
think about this and let's see what

2206
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,719
would be a realist

2207
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:19,600
uh take on the free energy principle

2208
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:20,239
right

2209
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:24,239
um so the furniture principle is about

2210
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:26,960
systems or adaptive systems it can also

2211
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,880
apply as we said to all natural systems

2212
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:29,199
but

2213
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:31,120
let's take the adaptive systems here

2214
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,239
because they're much more complex and

2215
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:33,920
that's what we are interested

2216
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,159
on um so the free energy principle is

2217
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:37,360
about systems that

2218
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:40,639
minimize free energy expectation right

2219
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:42,159
precisely because they want to do that

2220
01:21:42,159 --> 01:21:43,920
that's where we find the telos

2221
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:47,120
um so then i want to just to

2222
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,360
draw our attention to the fact that

2223
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,679
these explanation these tell us

2224
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:54,800
applies to all adaptive systems

2225
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,040
and that means that it applies to

2226
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,239
bacteria

2227
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:01,520
um and uh there's been also a paper with

2228
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,960
pristine and calvo

2229
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,000
that um it also applies to plants

2230
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,040
and um it also applies to systems with

2231
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,320
with nervous systems

2232
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:13,360
right so a realist account of the

2233
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,040
furniture principle would say that

2234
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:18,080
uh every single adaptive system is

2235
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,719
minimizing free energy that's a realist

2236
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:22,719
account of the free energy principle

2237
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:24,960
now the question that follows is the one

2238
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,480
that relates to the paper that

2239
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:30,400
uh thomas and i wrote is okay so then

2240
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,480
um our representation is going to be

2241
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,959
entailed

2242
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:37,360
in what level the representations need

2243
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,679
nervous systems

2244
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:41,760
because one because this is the free

2245
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,440
energy principle applies to

2246
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:46,000
all adaptive systems not only to the

2247
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,480
systems that have nervous systems

2248
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,120
so if we take the realist path about the

2249
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,679
free energy principle as something that

2250
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:56,560
uh systems really do they they minimize

2251
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,320
they attempt to minimize this free

2252
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:59,360
energy

2253
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:02,800
um then this applies to all

2254
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,520
uh adaptive systems so where does that

2255
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,320
leave us

2256
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:09,840
to the representation list account

2257
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,199
very thought provoking so maybe another

2258
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:15,840
way to say

2259
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,320
if i'm hearing it is like if it is the

2260
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,120
case

2261
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:22,320
that the brain for example is minimizing

2262
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:23,920
free energy so that's the realist

2263
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,239
take on the free energy principle then

2264
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:28,080
there have to be representations in the

2265
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:28,800
brain

2266
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,920
that correspond to

2267
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,880
free energy as being some sort of

2268
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,800
quantity that's being

2269
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,120
carried in the brain whereas to do

2270
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,440
instrumentalist free energy principle

2271
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,639
one doesn't need to have any specific

2272
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:47,040
um stance on whether representations of

2273
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,239
any kind exist

2274
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:50,560
because it's being clarified that it's

2275
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,080
just like well the linear regression

2276
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:55,040
exists on my calculator not in the brain

2277
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,159
so

2278
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:59,280
yeah is it is that

2279
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,199
i hope really okay stephen and then

2280
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:02,639
anyone else and also yeah

2281
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:03,920
great points happening in the chat

2282
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,080
there's a lot happening about

2283
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:09,199
um for example natural kinds are they

2284
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:10,480
disjoint or are they

2285
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,239
isomorphic with marcon blankets there's

2286
01:24:12,239 --> 01:24:13,760
a lot of great points that people read

2287
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:14,400
and consider

2288
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,520
there stephen and anyone else i think

2289
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,120
one of the advantages the free energy

2290
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,800
principle has and it's less clear once

2291
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,080
you start getting into the process

2292
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,360
theories is if

2293
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:26,880
if through this dynamical interf

2294
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,960
interplay between external states

2295
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,080
internal states

2296
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:33,040
and markov blanket states if it's

2297
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,080
working with

2298
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:37,920
entropy entropy can be no dimensional

2299
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:39,840
so you've got this advantage that it

2300
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,679
could be happening

2301
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:44,639
but and you could be inferring

2302
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:46,000
information by

2303
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,120
somehow extracting

2304
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:52,639
in whatever form somehow

2305
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:55,199
knowledge through a change in the

2306
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:56,560
randomness

2307
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,400
so it's by a change in the randomness

2308
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,679
that you get a signal there isn't

2309
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:01,040
actually a signal

2310
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,280
you may you may not have that problem

2311
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,440
with representationalism

2312
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,840
coming up even if free energy principle

2313
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:08,800
is actually

2314
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:12,880
kind of happening because it's not clear

2315
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,880
how much it's become something with

2316
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,080
dimensions

2317
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,000
so i think that the question then is

2318
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,440
once you

2319
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:22,080
go beyond that into the process theory

2320
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,679
maybe

2321
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:26,320
um yeah some parts of that as well are

2322
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:28,320
kind of dimensionless there's still that

2323
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:29,360
flow

2324
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,760
the nestedness that the nature of things

2325
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,760
traversed in between

2326
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,920
and then there is a sense that once you

2327
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,760
create structures that you do have

2328
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,199
physical structures and you get this

2329
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:41,920
realist and you have to make a choice

2330
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,520
so maybe i don't know that's just my

2331
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,520
thought on that

2332
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:48,239
and um it's almost like is the heart of

2333
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:48,960
the matter

2334
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,679
how something is or how we should act

2335
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:52,480
because if

2336
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,560
the heart of the matter is framed as

2337
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,480
being i won't be satisfied till i get

2338
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,320
the realist explanation i won't be

2339
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,159
satisfied with what an electron

2340
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:02,000
is until the heart of the matter has

2341
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,360
been reached whether it

2342
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,920
is a particle whether it is a field and

2343
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,440
then if the heart of the matter

2344
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,080
were actually framed in an

2345
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,719
action-oriented way

2346
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:13,040
so the heart of the matter is electrons

2347
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,639
you could go way down the rabbit hole

2348
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:16,400
and sub-electronic stuff

2349
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,920
but the heart of the matter is how we

2350
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,679
engage with electrons the heart of the

2351
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:21,440
matter with a person is how we engage

2352
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,080
with them

2353
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:24,159
in that case it might be possible to

2354
01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:25,520
have adequate

2355
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:28,480
if not excellent policy with a very

2356
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,480
partial instrumentalist reading

2357
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,080
you could say just with the models that

2358
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,600
we had in the 1980s

2359
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,679
we had instrumentalist models of the

2360
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:37,120
electron that allowed us to build

2361
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:39,199
transistors of this power that were

2362
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:40,560
required for this task

2363
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,520
so just taking the engineering take and

2364
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,120
so again by kind of making the heart of

2365
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,440
the issue about how to act rather than

2366
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,120
essence and identity

2367
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,719
some of these questions that are related

2368
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:53,520
to representationalism essentialism

2369
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:56,880
internalism reductionism all of that is

2370
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:57,840
aligned with

2371
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,600
the heart of the issue being those

2372
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,679
topics and so it's always a

2373
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:03,280
countervailing argument to take a

2374
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:04,320
relational

2375
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:07,280
or an interactive stance against that

2376
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:08,880
broader

2377
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:12,159
kind of philosophical gestalt versus the

2378
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:15,199
action-oriented turn the pragmatic turn

2379
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:18,239
engineering as a philosophy or as a

2380
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:20,000
as a way of life and then thinking about

2381
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,280
organisms as more like

2382
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:24,000
engineers in their niche like ecosystem

2383
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:24,639
engineers

2384
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:27,120
niche modification evolution is

2385
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:28,960
selecting for good engineers

2386
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,280
not the good philosopher not the bird

2387
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,000
who thinks

2388
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,120
about how to classify the seasons but

2389
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,560
the bird who reacts

2390
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:39,679
to the um niche in a way that leads to

2391
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:41,199
continued success

2392
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:44,480
so it's just very interesting like

2393
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:47,120
almost a question arising is we talked

2394
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,199
about these axes of variation

2395
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:51,280
and this paper in figure one or table

2396
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:54,000
one laid out the two by two

2397
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,600
and so we can kind of lay them out

2398
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,679
orthogonally here but there's a lot of

2399
01:27:57,679 --> 01:28:00,960
these dimensions and some combinations

2400
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,639
two-way combinations or three-way

2401
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:04,400
combinations might be

2402
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:07,760
um very elucidating considering well no

2403
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,360
one has thought about this combination

2404
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,000
of yes

2405
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,840
yes yes no or which of these axes are

2406
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:16,960
kind of tied up axiomatically

2407
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:20,080
that's pretty cool to think about if

2408
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:21,280
anyone raises their hand

2409
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:23,440
we can um take it a different way i'll

2410
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:24,639
just go through the final

2411
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:28,080
little slides that we had so one slide

2412
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:30,320
says where does design fit into all of

2413
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,280
this

2414
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,120
is design instrumental or realist and

2415
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,880
what about technology so we kind of

2416
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,080
talked about engineering

2417
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,400
but what about design and all of its

2418
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,000
meanings and then

2419
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,360
another branch we had explored a bit was

2420
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,040
we kind of talked about it earlier today

2421
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:47,280
as well is

2422
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:51,440
how can we really distill some of these

2423
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:55,360
uh claims and so that that could lay it

2424
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:56,159
out on a

2425
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:59,280
sort of shared table where we could come

2426
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:00,719
together with all of these different

2427
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:02,239
philosophical perspectives and

2428
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:04,159
experimentalist perspectives

2429
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:05,760
how could we reduce this to a set of

2430
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:08,000
claims where someone says actually

2431
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,560
um i disagree with claim two or i would

2432
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:12,400
like to add claim three

2433
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,800
and so that style of getting through

2434
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,320
these topics would be pretty

2435
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:19,280
cool so with about you know any amount

2436
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:20,719
of time that we want to have

2437
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:23,120
left what's something that somebody

2438
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:24,400
would like to

2439
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,639
pick up on or head off in direction of

2440
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:30,159
in s and then anyone else thanks

2441
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:32,320
yeah i can try to unpack a little bit uh

2442
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,480
claim number two

2443
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,960
so i think that here when we say that

2444
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:37,760
humans do

2445
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:39,920
inference i think that's precisely right

2446
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:41,120
but we can unpack this a little bit

2447
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:41,840
further

2448
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:45,440
we can say that humans are capable in uh

2449
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,840
everyday life because they are in

2450
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,679
culturated systems they're able to

2451
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:50,239
engage

2452
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:53,920
in inference uh reasoning these logics

2453
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,400
and concepts etc that we already uh

2454
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:59,600
mentioned right so that's what we can do

2455
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,080
but uh humans are also scientists and

2456
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:03,520
they also receive training

2457
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,920
um in modeling in general so to speak

2458
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:10,960
and once they do uh scientists

2459
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:13,040
uh can also do other kinds of inference

2460
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,000
which entail

2461
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,920
much more sophisticated kind of

2462
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:17,920
inference such as all these tools that

2463
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,120
we've been talking about like

2464
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:20,000
traditional bays

2465
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,719
and and and that kind of thing so i

2466
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:23,440
think that

2467
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:25,120
it's important to say that in everyday

2468
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,040
life we can engage in inference that

2469
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:27,440
kind of

2470
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:30,239
inference uh does entail um

2471
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:32,239
representational properties because we

2472
01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:34,400
are trying to build up a representation

2473
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,159
on the agent level about something that

2474
01:30:36,159 --> 01:30:37,600
we puzzled about

2475
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,000
and we can also do uh engaging this kind

2476
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,960
of inference as

2477
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,880
scientists with much more sophisticated

2478
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:45,520
kind of tools

2479
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:50,560
cool um so

2480
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:54,080
anyone else have any

2481
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:57,360
thoughts on that on this slide or let's

2482
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:59,520
just kind of give a quick another

2483
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:02,400
uh coat of paint on some of these topics

2484
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:02,960
because

2485
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:06,080
a lot has been raised in this

2486
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,719
paper um i'd like to return to the

2487
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:09,679
roadmap

2488
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:12,800
and just think about what this paper did

2489
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,600
and ask the authors what their next

2490
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:16,639
ideas

2491
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:19,040
just to any level of detail or however

2492
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:20,159
you want to convey it

2493
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:22,560
what are your next exciting questions in

2494
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:23,600
this area

2495
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:26,960
or how did finishing this paper

2496
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:29,440
prepare you for the next lines of

2497
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:30,880
research or investigation or

2498
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,080
collaboration that you're going to be

2499
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,559
involved in

2500
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:40,400
either either thomas or ness or anyone

2501
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,520
else how is it going to change their

2502
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,280
research after reading this paper

2503
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:45,840
actually

2504
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:50,880
um i'll go i'll go first then um

2505
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:54,400
well hopefully i'll soon be finishing up

2506
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,440
my phd

2507
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,920
and even more hopefully starting a

2508
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:00,080
postdoc to actually be able to continue

2509
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:00,800
all of this

2510
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:05,120
uh properly um but i'm now working on

2511
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:08,159
a paper on anticipation

2512
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:12,400
um and in part i am trying to

2513
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:16,159
put the free energy principle to use and

2514
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:19,199
i'm having a look into how the

2515
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:22,239
notion of an information geometry can

2516
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:23,520
help us

2517
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:27,120
explain formalize or

2518
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:29,840
describe

2519
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:33,920
the sorts of statistical patterns

2520
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:37,040
that agents become sensitive to when

2521
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:38,840
they

2522
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,880
anticipate

2523
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:43,600
so that's one of the lines that i'm

2524
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,600
hoping to make use of the

2525
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,199
free energy principle in an

2526
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:50,320
instrumentalist sense

2527
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:54,080
cool thanks for phrasing it within

2528
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:57,280
the uh framing of the paper i guess

2529
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:59,360
ines and then we'll kind of move into

2530
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,280
the non-author

2531
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:06,000
collaborator range go ahead dennis

2532
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:10,560
oh sorry you're muted

2533
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,080
here we go you can't hear me now yeah

2534
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:16,400
yep okay so one exciting thing that

2535
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:17,199
thomas and i

2536
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:20,320
are working on and as a follow-up uh

2537
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,080
together with uh with a with another

2538
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:22,800
colleague

2539
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,840
um is precisely on

2540
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:28,880
how to move forward in cognition um what

2541
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:29,280
would

2542
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:32,400
um this instrument uh

2543
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:36,159
would be put to a good use in

2544
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:39,199
understanding cognition uh as taking

2545
01:33:39,199 --> 01:33:42,639
taking models to be

2546
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:46,080
in a very instrumentalist kind of way so

2547
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:49,040
what we want to say now is uh that

2548
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:50,239
moving forward

2549
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:53,360
then models of cognition should not

2550
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:57,120
um attempt to uh capture or represent

2551
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,120
the properties of cognition of what

2552
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:00,320
cognition is

2553
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:03,199
but instead the very idiosyncratic

2554
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:04,719
patterns of activity

2555
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:08,560
in a particular system um so what we are

2556
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,880
challenging is the representational

2557
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,480
models of cognition

2558
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,440
that we don't think that um makes sense

2559
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:15,920
um

2560
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:19,120
because for one um cognition sorry

2561
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:22,480
for one cognitive scientific work is not

2562
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,560
a perspective from nowhere

2563
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:28,239
and for two um cognition is not

2564
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:30,960
a fixed structure in a closed system so

2565
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:32,000
we take cognition

2566
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,560
in a very kind of dynamical system

2567
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,880
stochastic system kind of way

2568
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:39,120
so then we are trying to now develop the

2569
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:40,159
sort of like

2570
01:34:40,159 --> 01:34:42,480
models that we think would be the most

2571
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:44,159
appropriate models to capture these

2572
01:34:44,159 --> 01:34:47,839
aspects of cognition

2573
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,000
sounds really interesting i look forward

2574
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,239
to hearing about how you keep the

2575
01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:55,040
general perspective while also diving

2576
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:56,159
into the minute

2577
01:34:56,159 --> 01:35:01,040
particulars stephen and then anyone else

2578
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,960
yeah this is i think it's helpful to

2579
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,080
hear this

2580
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:06,639
thinking about modeling because trying

2581
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:08,320
to bring modelling into other contexts

2582
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:09,920
so i'd be interested like

2583
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,679
when there was when thomas there was

2584
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:13,040
talking about

2585
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,600
using information geometry and to think

2586
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,639
about how to model

2587
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,960
systems and i think ines is saying the

2588
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:23,040
same thing is it that you're

2589
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:25,360
not thinking about modeling the system

2590
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,520
so you can describe

2591
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,600
the realism of the brain but it's like

2592
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:31,679
how can you get the dynamics so it could

2593
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:32,719
be useful

2594
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:36,320
in i don't know computational psychiatry

2595
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:36,719
or

2596
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:39,360
it could when you say system you're

2597
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:40,639
trying to see how the

2598
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:43,840
dynamics reveal

2599
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:46,560
not necessarily a realist interpretation

2600
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:47,760
of the brain

2601
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:50,159
in the bigger system but just something

2602
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:52,000
useful about the bigger system is it

2603
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:52,880
kind of like

2604
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:56,000
being more applied in some way

2605
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,280
to applications in in the world

2606
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:01,520
or is that i'll be curious on your

2607
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:04,239
thoughts on that

2608
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:08,400
yes um yeah okay so yeah so it's

2609
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,960
basically following exactly the same

2610
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:11,600
reasoning

2611
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:15,040
which is um coming from the view

2612
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:17,760
that we've come uh which is that

2613
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,280
cognition

2614
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:23,199
is um observed in in behavior in

2615
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:25,679
cognitive behavior right and we try to

2616
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:26,960
make sense of that

2617
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:28,480
but cognition is not something that is

2618
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:30,960
uh static is something that is dynamic

2619
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:34,560
and uh evolves in into a certain way

2620
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,920
because systems uh

2621
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,840
adapt because systems have this

2622
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:39,440
particular feature

2623
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:43,280
so um what we think

2624
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:46,159
it's important to look at is uh

2625
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:48,080
precisely how can we explain these

2626
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:49,040
dynamics

2627
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:52,560
of this cognitive behavior instead

2628
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:55,920
of from having models that aim to

2629
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:56,560
capture

2630
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,560
the properties of cognition in a very

2631
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,320
generalized kind of way

2632
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:04,159
but much more specified into how can we

2633
01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:06,080
explain this particular map this

2634
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:08,159
particular um

2635
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:11,119
cognitive activity and these can be

2636
01:37:11,119 --> 01:37:11,840
applied

2637
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:15,199
in in cognitive psychology labs but it

2638
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:16,320
can also apply

2639
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,880
this particular way of thinking where

2640
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:19,440
models

2641
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:21,920
should capture these dynamics and this

2642
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,440
is very much the dynamical system

2643
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:24,320
paradigm

2644
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:27,280
uh where models uh uh try to capture the

2645
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:28,080
dynamics

2646
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:31,280
um obviously this entails uh um

2647
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:34,400
a hypothesis and a theory about what we

2648
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:34,719
think

2649
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:36,639
is the best explanation for that

2650
01:37:36,639 --> 01:37:38,719
particular behavior that we observed and

2651
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:39,920
this could be like in

2652
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,719
again cognitive psychology labs in in in

2653
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:44,400
perceptual learning paradigms for

2654
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:45,040
example

2655
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:47,600
but it can also be as we spoke about uh

2656
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,600
last week this can also apply to

2657
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:52,400
um brain data analysis because that's

2658
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:53,520
precisely what

2659
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:55,920
we don't know is how the brain generates

2660
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:57,199
that kind of data

2661
01:37:57,199 --> 01:37:59,360
and then we can take different positions

2662
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:00,480
we can look at

2663
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:02,480
uh mapping the structures which is a

2664
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:03,920
very kind of like static

2665
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:05,520
kind of thing to do because we want a

2666
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:07,600
topology nice apology of like the brain

2667
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:08,400
as a map

2668
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:11,199
which is also very useful to have but is

2669
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:12,159
very descriptive

2670
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:14,159
so basically here we are dealing with

2671
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:15,520
description versus

2672
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:17,360
explanation because once you have a

2673
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:20,159
model that is a hypothesis driven

2674
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:21,920
then you have a theory that you want to

2675
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:24,239
test and that's what gets us

2676
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:27,760
into um all the variational base kind of

2677
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:29,440
area and where you need those kind of

2678
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,360
tools because we are working with a lot

2679
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:31,679
of

2680
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:33,760
theories and assumptions and each model

2681
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:35,280
is precisely going to be

2682
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:38,080
um a theory about what we think that

2683
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:40,239
perhaps has generated the data which is

2684
01:38:40,239 --> 01:38:41,199
what we actually have

2685
01:38:41,199 --> 01:38:44,560
access to so that's the kind of

2686
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:47,440
yeah overview

2687
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:49,840
here's one thought um anyone else can

2688
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:51,520
raise their hand on actually where this

2689
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:54,800
philosophy to clinical applications

2690
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:57,119
comes into effect so let's just say that

2691
01:38:57,119 --> 01:38:58,880
there's some debate like about

2692
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:01,679
molecular reductionism that's unresolved

2693
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:03,119
in philosophy land

2694
01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:04,800
and then that percolates into the

2695
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:07,280
clinics before the philosophy is even

2696
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:08,080
clarified

2697
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:10,480
like about genetic causation so you have

2698
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,400
genetic counselors who are doing genetic

2699
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:13,360
medicine

2700
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,199
while there still debates what is a gene

2701
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:16,560
and what is causation should we think

2702
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,719
about genetic reductionism or holism

2703
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:21,199
that uncertainty is actually in the

2704
01:39:21,199 --> 01:39:21,760
research

2705
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:24,080
paradigm in the comparability of results

2706
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:25,760
in the basic research is going to lead

2707
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:26,239
to

2708
01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:29,520
an uh inaccuracy in communication and

2709
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:31,679
in confidence at the clinical level in

2710
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:33,119
the genetic case

2711
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:36,719
now with as fep we're kind of talking

2712
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:38,480
about neuroimaging in a big way

2713
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,719
also other antaroceptive modalities are

2714
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:41,920
being expanded

2715
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:44,000
but really a lot of the foundation of

2716
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,040
this is in neuroimaging and neuroscience

2717
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:50,320
and so if there is a mess

2718
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:53,280
philosophically then the research is

2719
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:54,639
going to be less coherent the

2720
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:56,159
communication is going to be less clear

2721
01:39:56,159 --> 01:39:57,199
it's going to lead to clinical

2722
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:58,400
inaccuracy

2723
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:01,760
where as if it were the case that there

2724
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:04,080
was a clean philosophical way

2725
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:08,159
at least to even frame the situation

2726
01:40:08,159 --> 01:40:09,840
perhaps that could lead to more

2727
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,679
interoperable research

2728
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:14,320
agendas driven by those who do and do

2729
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:16,080
not wish to engage in the philosophy

2730
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:16,960
specifically

2731
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:18,320
and then increase clarity of like

2732
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,000
recommendation or of communication

2733
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,400
at the clinical level with people who

2734
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,239
are multiple steps away

2735
01:40:24,239 --> 01:40:26,800
from the paper but we could actually

2736
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,719
reference them this exact paper

2737
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:30,159
for example if someone said we're

2738
01:40:30,159 --> 01:40:31,920
hypothesizing that people who have this

2739
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,400
connectivity pattern in the dynamics of

2740
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:36,000
the spm it's not about how your brain's

2741
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,440
connected versus someone else it's

2742
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:40,320
hypothesis about a dynamical system just

2743
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,040
a thought

2744
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:51,840
an s and then anyone else

2745
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:54,719
yeah i actually just wanted to read out

2746
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:56,000
loud uh

2747
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,639
a quote by danielle dennett that i think

2748
01:40:58,639 --> 01:40:59,040
just

2749
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:01,760
really captures what you daniel uh was

2750
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:02,159
saying

2751
01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:04,000
not only in the clinical setting but

2752
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,280
also in in

2753
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:08,080
particular is referring to to science

2754
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:09,119
and i think that

2755
01:41:09,119 --> 01:41:11,600
yeah i very much agree i think it's very

2756
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:12,800
insightful he says

2757
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:17,119
um in his book that uh let me see if i

2758
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:21,440
oh goodness i lost it

2759
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:24,880
um so you can take a second to find it

2760
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:27,600
yes yeah

2761
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,600
anyone else can raise their hand um in

2762
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,440
the live chat people can provide any

2763
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:37,920
final thoughts or questions but this is

2764
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,199
just really an awesome

2765
01:41:39,199 --> 01:41:42,239
series i appreciate the authors for

2766
01:41:42,239 --> 01:41:44,159
joining us both sessions for all the

2767
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:46,960
participants who engaged with this

2768
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:49,520
paper and we're already seeing how this

2769
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,119
debate like is modifying the way we

2770
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:53,679
think about the topics so ines

2771
01:41:53,679 --> 01:41:57,119
oh yeah i've found the quote and

2772
01:41:57,119 --> 01:42:00,560
um well he tells us that um uh

2773
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:04,560
the topic of representation should be um

2774
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:06,480
oh no sorry it tells us there's no such

2775
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:09,520
thing as uh philosophy-free science

2776
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:10,800
there is only science whose

2777
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:13,360
philosophical baggage is taken on board

2778
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:15,520
without examination

2779
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:17,199
and i think that really nicely captures

2780
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:19,520
what you were saying daniel

2781
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:21,760
nice thanks a lot for sharing that

2782
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:23,840
shannon

2783
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:27,440
i think um at the risk of bringing a new

2784
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:28,639
topic with

2785
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:31,679
less than 15 minutes um to talk but this

2786
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:32,000
is

2787
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,280
a big question so

2788
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:37,280
i don't know in in neuroscience maybe

2789
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:38,719
there's this just

2790
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:41,600
pessimistic understanding that what the

2791
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:43,280
philosophers and neuroscientists say

2792
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:44,880
once it trickles down to the public it's

2793
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:45,440
going to be

2794
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:47,520
misconstrued so we're just like

2795
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,280
constantly

2796
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:51,199
reteaching the general public and if a

2797
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:52,320
doctor is con

2798
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:54,080
conversing with a patient they're

2799
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:55,600
constantly saying

2800
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:58,639
in this instance this is the thing

2801
01:42:58,639 --> 01:42:59,760
that's happening in our brain that

2802
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:01,520
matters for this diagnosis that we have

2803
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:02,639
to do to help you

2804
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:06,000
solve problem or something um

2805
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,000
but at a like a moral and societal

2806
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,199
level in every aspect of science this

2807
01:43:13,199 --> 01:43:14,880
debate between whether we're looking at

2808
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:16,320
a true

2809
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:19,679
natural kind or just something that we

2810
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:22,320
are taking a certain stance about as

2811
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,400
scientists as a society

2812
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:27,040
um has huge implications for policy i'm

2813
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:27,520
thinking

2814
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:31,360
of whether gender is real or not

2815
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:34,719
and it has huge implications for policy

2816
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:35,440
that like

2817
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:37,679
that very detrimental like it hurts

2818
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:38,639
people

2819
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:40,239
if you take a certain stance that

2820
01:43:40,239 --> 01:43:42,719
there's a certain gene that codes

2821
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:46,239
for a gender when

2822
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:48,560
that concept itself is is a definition

2823
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,719
that might not be a

2824
01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:53,679
complete scientific truth but some one

2825
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:54,880
somewhere wants to say there's a

2826
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,159
scientific truth

2827
01:43:56,159 --> 01:43:59,360
that gene means gender means policy

2828
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:00,480
means

2829
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,880
and then you just have this cycle um so

2830
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,320
even though this seems like a very you

2831
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:04,880
know

2832
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:06,880
maybe we could just say ah i don't agree

2833
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:08,159
with the philosopher or i don't agree

2834
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:10,000
with neuroscience and leave the debate

2835
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:13,840
um the fact that the debate exists

2836
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:16,480
permeates into the rest of society and

2837
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:17,760
culture and

2838
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:20,320
is it's important maybe to say that

2839
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:21,199
science

2840
01:44:21,199 --> 01:44:23,600
science maybe even as a whole isn't

2841
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:25,119
realist about the world

2842
01:44:25,119 --> 01:44:27,760
science is instrumentalist about the

2843
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:30,320
best way that we can interact

2844
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:33,600
in our world and you do have to bring in

2845
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,480
that baggage that daniel dennett was

2846
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:37,760
discussing and this would

2847
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:40,100
also include moral baggage

2848
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:41,360

2849
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:44,400
thanks shannon and i posted this book in

2850
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:44,960
the chat

2851
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:47,280
studying human behavior how scientists

2852
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,440
investigate aggression and sexuality

2853
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:52,560
by professor helen longno so taking a

2854
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:54,639
course with her in grad school and

2855
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:55,840
reading this book

2856
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:58,880
the way that it framed pluralism and

2857
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,520
the sciences and the different

2858
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:02,639
methodologies and just

2859
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:06,320
laid bare in some ways how these issues

2860
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:07,840
it's kind of like having the cake and

2861
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:09,760
eating it too it's like these are the

2862
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:10,719
issues that are

2863
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:14,159
so near and dear to our social reality

2864
01:45:14,159 --> 01:45:18,159
and so it's hard to take the right

2865
01:45:18,159 --> 01:45:21,360
stances philosophically when it's easy

2866
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:22,480
to

2867
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:25,440
um lose sight of what's really happening

2868
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,520
sometimes and just how things are

2869
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:29,679
and like of course it's the y chromosome

2870
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:31,520
it's like i mean it's an allusion to

2871
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:32,880
genetic reductionism

2872
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:35,119
but it's a little bit broader or it's

2873
01:45:35,119 --> 01:45:36,880
different than that and it's a yes and

2874
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:39,119
with genetic and non and it just goes so

2875
01:45:39,119 --> 01:45:40,320
much beyond

2876
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:43,040
a simple reductionist claim that it's

2877
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:44,320
easy to get lost

2878
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:47,760
so how can we even use active inference

2879
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:50,480
and the communication channels of public

2880
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:51,760
engagement

2881
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:54,560
to actually at least within our sub

2882
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:57,040
domains or

2883
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:59,840
informational niches at first how can we

2884
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:01,440
bridge that gap in a new way

2885
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,440
it's an interesting question stephen and

2886
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:06,239
then anyone else

2887
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:08,480
yeah thanks for this excellent

2888
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:11,040
conversation i suppose

2889
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:14,320
this question about whether we can not

2890
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:15,760
just take some realist

2891
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:19,440
neural correlation as our way in

2892
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:21,040
wasn't even an option before it was like

2893
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:22,480
it's pretty it was basically that was

2894
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:24,639
the only cake on the table

2895
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:26,960
so people just took it and now it's like

2896
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,159
well actually we can

2897
01:46:28,159 --> 01:46:30,080
we've got this other way of thinking you

2898
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:31,360
know so

2899
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:33,119
the rate the way we're doing it before

2900
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:34,480
isn't the only way

2901
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:36,960
it's just it was the only way so i think

2902
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:39,280
that's one thing and

2903
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:42,400
it's helping me because um

2904
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:45,920
i'm seeing people in this area of mental

2905
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:47,119
space psychology

2906
01:46:47,119 --> 01:46:50,639
trying to prove their field by saying

2907
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:52,639
say peripersonal space neurons are

2908
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:53,520
firing

2909
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:55,600
and they're not necessary they're trying

2910
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:56,960
to use this

2911
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:59,360
these brain processes as evidence you

2912
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:01,280
know and it's like if you don't show

2913
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:04,320
causal you know and i mean i even see

2914
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:05,440
that in my own

2915
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:07,199
thing i think there's a tendency for me

2916
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:09,360
in my work with spatial approaches

2917
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:12,080
how can i explain this and it's like and

2918
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:13,840
if you can't what you left with you're

2919
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:15,600
just left with

2920
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:18,480
well not a lot sometimes so this does

2921
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:18,880
give

2922
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:22,719
another way to make um use

2923
01:47:22,719 --> 01:47:25,920
of uh phenomenological

2924
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:28,960
wisdom i think so that's what that's

2925
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:30,560
what i'm taking away from this so thank

2926
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:31,199
you

2927
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:33,119
yeah thanks for connecting it to your

2928
01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:34,480
work and experience

2929
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:37,839
blue and thomas

2930
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:40,639
so i just wanted to thank enes for that

2931
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:41,679
quote um

2932
01:47:41,679 --> 01:47:43,280
i thought that that was like really deep

2933
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:45,280
and important and like a good

2934
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:46,960
understanding really of

2935
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:50,239
um the philosophy that's like behind

2936
01:47:50,239 --> 01:47:53,600
uh all of science might really enable

2937
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:57,119
um us to go forward as a society like

2938
01:47:57,119 --> 01:48:00,320
i've just noticed with like covet and um

2939
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:02,239
like at least in america and stuff

2940
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:04,560
that's been going on in our country like

2941
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:07,199
people are are upset that the science is

2942
01:48:07,199 --> 01:48:07,600
not

2943
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:10,239
right right like like what happens like

2944
01:48:10,239 --> 01:48:10,880
besides

2945
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:13,119
like they're very mad about like the

2946
01:48:13,119 --> 01:48:14,400
science continually

2947
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:17,119
updating itself which is kind of exactly

2948
01:48:17,119 --> 01:48:17,600
what

2949
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:20,080
science is supposed to do so i think

2950
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:21,520
maybe a good understanding of the

2951
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:22,560
integration with

2952
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:25,920
um philosophy and you know the evolution

2953
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:27,119
of science as

2954
01:48:27,119 --> 01:48:30,159
as a a thing a non-equilibrium steady

2955
01:48:30,159 --> 01:48:32,080
state that's continually being updated

2956
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:34,400
like as a system i think that that might

2957
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:36,639
um you know if it's pushed into

2958
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:38,480
like the mainstream it might enable

2959
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:40,639
people to be more accepting of

2960
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:44,239
science when it changes

2961
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:47,839
thomas thanks a lot blue

2962
01:48:48,239 --> 01:48:51,360
yeah um i think

2963
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:54,320
it's it's very true that at least the

2964
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:56,000
way we see it now if you

2965
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,679
start talking about questions like is

2966
01:48:57,679 --> 01:48:59,040
gender real or not

2967
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:02,159
that it has very um big impacts on

2968
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:04,159
policy and how we're going to change

2969
01:49:04,159 --> 01:49:05,119
things

2970
01:49:05,119 --> 01:49:09,280
um and i don't know maybe this is a

2971
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:12,239
typical instrumentalist thing to say but

2972
01:49:12,239 --> 01:49:13,520
i wonder if it should

2973
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:18,080
matter as much if it's not just

2974
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:21,440
we're seeing certain patterns of say

2975
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:24,639
injustice and

2976
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:28,239
we need to address

2977
01:49:28,239 --> 01:49:30,320
these patterns of injustice and try to

2978
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:31,599
create policies

2979
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:35,040
that remove that injustice regardless

2980
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:38,080
of whether the

2981
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:41,679
categories that um

2982
01:49:41,679 --> 01:49:44,719
we use in describing the population that

2983
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:46,960
is affected by the injustice

2984
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:50,480
latches on to something real or not

2985
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:52,080
i don't think that really matters that

2986
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:53,679
much it's

2987
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:56,400
it's sort of the moment when you get

2988
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:57,040
into

2989
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:59,679
the philosophical debate about gender

2990
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:01,599
when you're trying to

2991
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:04,800
um discuss policy i think you're doing

2992
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:08,000
policy making wrong

2993
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,719
i think that you should be looking at

2994
01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:11,040
what

2995
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:14,639
is going on is there injustice

2996
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:16,800
in this case we can say yes there is and

2997
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:18,560
how can we tackle that when you get into

2998
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:20,239
the philosophical debate you're doing

2999
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:21,280
something else

3000
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:24,480
that's also important but not for

3001
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:27,840
political policy making um

3002
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:31,520
and i think in some ways um what

3003
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:34,480
um i think yeah i think stephen said

3004
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:35,360
that

3005
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:38,560
um about trying to legitimize certain

3006
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:41,760
um parts of research

3007
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:44,960
by relating it to brain processes

3008
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:46,639
like oh the thing i'm doing is only

3009
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:48,239
really legitimate

3010
01:50:48,239 --> 01:50:50,320
if i can point at the brain and say like

3011
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:51,920
these things are doing the thing i'm

3012
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:53,360
talking about

3013
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:56,639
um i think you see a similar thing

3014
01:50:56,639 --> 01:50:59,880
with um the

3015
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:02,880
neurodiversity

3016
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:06,320
groups where people

3017
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:09,360
latch onto this scientific framework

3018
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:12,480
of oh well autism is all in the brain so

3019
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:14,320
it's real so now you have to take me

3020
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:16,000
seriously

3021
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,440
and i think that's in some sense

3022
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:22,000
it's nice to see that you know these

3023
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,599
things are being legitimized and people

3024
01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:25,280
are taking it more seriously

3025
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:28,560
in another sense it's not good because

3026
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:30,800
we're restricting ourselves very much to

3027
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:32,639
a very particular

3028
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:35,840
idea of what counts as real only if we

3029
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:38,639
find it in the brain

3030
01:51:38,639 --> 01:51:40,880
and as we've just been talking about

3031
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:42,320
just looking at the brain if you're

3032
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:43,040
trying to

3033
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:46,000
understand a broader picture of what an

3034
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,159
agent in an environment is doing

3035
01:51:48,159 --> 01:51:53,199
is um very narrow um

3036
01:51:53,199 --> 01:51:56,239
yeah that that was it

3037
01:51:56,239 --> 01:51:58,639
great thanks so much for sharing that i

3038
01:51:58,639 --> 01:51:59,360
just wanted to

3039
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:02,320
kind of build a little bit on that um

3040
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:03,520
you said like whether we think

3041
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:05,760
x is real there's so many issues

3042
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:08,000
yesterday today tomorrow is x real

3043
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,599
it becomes real when it has impact on

3044
01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:11,679
policy and what's so cool about active

3045
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:12,480
inference is

3046
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:15,360
we even use that term policy to talk

3047
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,000
about how

3048
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,040
things matter and we use the instruments

3049
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:20,960
of these different models the specific

3050
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:22,560
ones that we're talking about to talk

3051
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:24,239
about how things bear upon

3052
01:52:24,239 --> 01:52:27,440
policy and so the two things or two of

3053
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:28,880
the things that active inference can

3054
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:31,040
help us do is first off it helps us

3055
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:32,639
separate our preference

3056
01:52:32,639 --> 01:52:35,679
from our affordances from observations

3057
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:37,040
from our policy

3058
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:38,639
because it's really easy when talking

3059
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:40,320
about things that really matter climate

3060
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:40,800
change

3061
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:42,880
all these other things it gets quite

3062
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:45,119
blurred with what people's preferences

3063
01:52:45,119 --> 01:52:47,199
as far as their short-term affordances

3064
01:52:47,199 --> 01:52:49,679
long-term teleos um and then also it

3065
01:52:49,679 --> 01:52:51,280
gives us a forum

3066
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:52,639
and a shared understanding and

3067
01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:54,560
vocabulary for actually having that

3068
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:56,800
realism instrumentalism debate blue to

3069
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:58,480
what you said about this evolving state

3070
01:52:58,480 --> 01:52:59,679
of science developing

3071
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:02,639
state of science um you can veer off one

3072
01:53:02,639 --> 01:53:03,280
side

3073
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:04,719
and say well it's real today and what

3074
01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:06,320
they say is real tomorrow

3075
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:09,199
so maybe a realist stance lends itself

3076
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:10,800
towards kind of in-group thinking

3077
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:12,000
because if you're being told if the

3078
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,679
party tells you it's real today

3079
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:14,960
and the party tells you something new

3080
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:16,880
next year you better be a realist about

3081
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:17,280
that

3082
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:20,320
at least in terms of policy versus if we

3083
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:22,560
take a purely deconstructionist it's all

3084
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:23,679
instrumentalist

3085
01:53:23,679 --> 01:53:25,040
then some people are going to say wait

3086
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:26,719
but if it's not real like

3087
01:53:26,719 --> 01:53:29,280
i mean our virus is real we hope so so

3088
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:30,400
what is real

3089
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:32,239
and so that's the kind of questions that

3090
01:53:32,239 --> 01:53:33,679
we can have a discussion

3091
01:53:33,679 --> 01:53:36,880
that values people's perspective

3092
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,880
modes of communication modes of thinking

3093
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:40,639
being different roles

3094
01:53:40,639 --> 01:53:44,320
in complex adaptive systems together so

3095
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:47,920
really awesome discussion we're gonna

3096
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:51,040
land it on time but again

3097
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:52,880
thanks everyone for participating if

3098
