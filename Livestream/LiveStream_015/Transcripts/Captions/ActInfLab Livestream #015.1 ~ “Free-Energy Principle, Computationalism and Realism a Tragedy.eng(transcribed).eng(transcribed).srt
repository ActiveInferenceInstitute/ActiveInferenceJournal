live stream but here we are in 15 with a

36
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,200
rapid introduction

37

each other especially some of

39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,119
us who are new on the stream and then

40
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,080
we're going to be

41
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,560
kind of walking through the paper having

42
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,759
ideas having fun conversations and also

43
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,360

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,759
discuss more in 15.2 which will be like

45

lab my background is a lawyer and what

139
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,280
we're doing is engineering

140
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,520
systems that are socio-technical systems

141
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,840
so it's parameterization for technical

142
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,639
and

143
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,440
social elements of active inference

144
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,400
based systems

145
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,000

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,880
we can just begin where wherever people

153
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,440
have been

154

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,720
and or thomas um i just wanted to

173
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,680
ask how do you start by communicating

174
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,160
this

175
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,400
research or what led you to this

176
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,799
question

177
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,759
i'm going to kick out the ghost in esses

178
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,199
but um um yep so she should i take this

179
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,240
or do you wanna

180
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,400
but you're muted right now

181
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,680
sorry um yeah no thomas just go ahead

182
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,120
yeah

183
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,800
yeah um so i think the way

184
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,560
i got to the the idea of the paper is

185
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,199
that i'm

186
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,440
um primarily coming at it from a

187
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,039
radical inactivist perspective um

188
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,840
where there's a lot of

189
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,599
um antagonism towards

190
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:18,240
representations models and whatnot

191
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,720
um in the meantime i got very excited

192
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,400
about free energy principle and i've

193
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,240
been sort of trying to sort out where

194
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,240
that all fits what the models mean

195
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,440
what everything means in everything

196
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,000
that's being

197
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,919
said um and so ines and i were talking

198
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:34,639
about it

199
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,919
and um we started talking about

200
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,599
representations and models in the free

201
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,120
energy principle

202
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,160
and we figured out that

203
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,280
it really depends on how you interpret

204
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,720
the models and what exactly you take

205
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,450
the mathematics to mean um

206
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,960
[Music]

207
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,080
and based on that we just started

208
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,599
listing out the different options you

209
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,960
could have

210
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,199
and um what they mean and what we

211
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,960
personally thought about those what we

212
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,840
thought was

213
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,840
were good aspects less nice aspects

214
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,840
um and through all of that we

215
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,240
sort of came up with instrumentalism as

216
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,680
the uh

217
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,520
only path forward

218
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,520
awesome i'm sure we're gonna have a lot

219
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,720
of great

220
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,720
second thoughts and conversations on

221
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,400
that so anyone can

222
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,280
raise their hand but either an s or

223
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,719
thomas just to

224
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,479
lead into those who might not be

225
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,240
familiar with

226
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,919
long-running debates in the philosophy

227
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,000
of science or multiple possible

228
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,279
ways to interpret formalisms how do you

229
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,160
convey this instrumentalism realism

230
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,880
question and

231
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,240
motivate its importance

232
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,839
shall i take it thomas

233
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,600
sure okay um so

234
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
uh one thing that we thought was like

235
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,440
really interesting um to think about

236
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,720
is that um the majority

237
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,640
of the the accounts within the free

238
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
energy principle or process theories

239
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,600
uh they are very much realist so that's

240
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,080
what we

241
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,640
thomas and i started questioning and we

242
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,440
think that it's

243
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,279
it's interesting because uh there's been

244
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,360
other people also joining that

245
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,680
particular consensus that we also have

246
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,800
um

247
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,320
so we thought that this would be

248
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,160
something that we needed to look at

249
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,800
uh and the question just to sort of like

250
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,560
give a little bit of context on where we

251
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,760
are in the literature

252
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,279
is that the majority of the approach the

253
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,000
approaches were um on the realist camp

254
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,480
even those that were um coming from an

255
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,760
activism

256
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,600
and that's why we found things to be a

257
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,680
little bit strange because

258
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,880
the first question is whether one is

259
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,760
a licensed to take a realist account

260
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,399
from the

261
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,959
the fact that we can model uh the brain

262
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,959
or we can model the neural activity

263
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,760
or we can model um uh cognitive

264
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,040
cognitive activity

265
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,200
so that's the one question that we

266
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,560
wanted to to think about

267
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,240
and look at whether we are licensed to

268
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,399
take a realist stand and if we are what

269
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,399
is the argument what is the evidence to

270
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,200
think that

271
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,920
um this machinery that we we use in our

272
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,959
scientific model

273
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,000
modeling um can also be uh

274
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,720
exists somewhere in uh neuronal activity

275
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,040
or

276
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,240
cognitive activity so that was one thing

277
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,560
then the other thing was that it start

278
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,079
there started to be like a sort of like

279
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:28,480
a

280
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,680
wave that was taking um the free energy

281
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,000
to be

282
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,680
compatible with an activism and um

283
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,560
and it it it might we started thinking

284
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,000
about and questioning this because it

285
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,440
might be the case that

286
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,000
they may not be compatible after all

287
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,519
because as we know on the side of the

288
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,640
in activism uh there's like a claim

289
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,959
um against uh representations for

290
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:51,920
example

291
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,240
then on the predictive uh accounts of

292
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,079
cognition on the other side

293
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,800
you sort of need representations to get

294
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,760
your theory going

295
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,519
because you need to have predictions you

296
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,200
need to have prediction errors coming

297
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,920
so you need to rely on representational

298
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,800
machinery

299
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,360
so that's what we thought that it's

300
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,560
important for us to

301
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,959
question and think about whether it is

302
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,320
actually the case that

303
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,640
um these two things can be made

304
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,600
compatible

305
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,200
so on the one side the predictive

306
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,880
accounts of cognition which take uh

307
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,560
representations in a very literal

308
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,519
account

309
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,800
um and on the other side the inactivism

310
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,519
uh which uh for the majority of the

311
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,079
people on an

312
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,560
activism side uh representation

313
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,160
cognition doesn't come down or is not

314
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,120
all the way through

315
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,360
representational so this is sort of like

316
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,519
where we are navigating the literature

317
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,160
here

318
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,600
it's sort of like between the very

319
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,839
representational

320
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,800
um predictive accounts of cognition and

321
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,600
um and

322
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,519
the realism that that's a stand that

323
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,040
they kind of need to take and on the

324
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,560
other side the inactivism

325
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,880
which there's sort of like a tendency uh

326
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,399
recently to be made like sort of

327
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,720
compatible under the same roof

328
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,160
so to speak great thank you both for

329
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,639
contextualizing and everybody can raise

330
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,920
their hands so that we can make sure to

331
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,560
hear

332
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,279
from everybody's excitement here um but

333
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,480
yes the bigger

334
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,519
question is does making a model have a

335
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,320
realist

336
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,560
interpretation if you make a model of

337
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,000
the brain as a steam engine is it really

338
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,040
a steam engine

339
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,040
no but then if you make a model of it as

340
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,240
a free energy principle

341
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,000
corollary process theory is it really

342
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,519
that that's kind of the

343
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,440
discussion and there's a lot on the line

344
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,200
which we're gonna tease out so

345
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
shannon and then anyone else who raises

346
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,600
their hand

347
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,639
yeah so sort of jumping to the end of

348
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,720
the paper already

349
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,399
you say like the model in scientific

350
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,399
practice is a representation

351
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,160
of the nervous system to the extent that

352
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,639
it holds explanatory capacity

353
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,200
and i think um like a lot of

354
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,519
neuroscientists that i talked to

355
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,800
if you start bringing up you know the

356
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,720
representation or the representation

357
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,240
debate that's like ah that's

358
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,720
something that philosophers worry about

359
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,240
um but we know when we say

360
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,839
representation we just

361
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,839
kind of need a word

362
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,320
stand in for our conversation so we can

363
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,519
talk about

364
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,320
um like patterned activity of neurons

365
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,200
and we don't

366
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,360
care that it could stand separate or not

367
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,440
from

368
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,000
the situation or the environment but

369
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,760
it's useful

370
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,160
it's a useful word to use so that way we

371
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,560
can have language and talk about

372
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,480
the system or the pattern of activity

373
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,760
that we're interested in

374
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,160
that's associated with some behavior um

375
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,800
and i i just think that sounds right

376
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,519
like how you conclude it

377
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,639
and maybe i didn't have a question maybe

378
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,839
this was a moment where i had to comment

379
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:44,959
more of a question

380
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,040
so apologies but if that sparks some

381
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,279
conversation that would be great

382
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,000
it's something that stayed with you and

383
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,680
will change how you think about

384
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,680
even other kinds of models next time you

385
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,959
see a linear aggression

386
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,399
maybe you're going to wonder if it's

387
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,760
being used in a realist or an

388
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,800
instrumentalist

389
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,199
context so thanks for sharing it shannon

390
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,639
stephen and then anyone else

391
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,079
sort of one thing i think is quite

392
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,079
interesting is the

393
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,680
just like shannon was saying about you

394
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,360
know often a word gets used but then

395
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,800
it's kind of fuzzy and then it kind of

396
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,800
gets like hand waved away around

397
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,040
why it's maybe not that clear i think

398
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,480
this also may be

399
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,839
the same challenge comes up with

400
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,079
pragmatism because pragmatism is really

401
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,440
useful and it gets used in a lot of

402
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,720
context

403
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,000
but now because everything's slightly

404
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,839
pragmatic in the sense that it's all

405
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,880
about action

406
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,320
through the free energy principle it

407
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,920
becomes so cool

408
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,360
instrumentalism sort of helps in a way

409
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,519
get a bit of clarity when it's something

410
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,600
which is about theory so i wonder

411
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,000
i'd be interested to know about how the

412
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,519
pragmatism

413
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,320
um you know wasn't used as the word and

414
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,600
used a more sort of

415
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,160
clear unpacking i suppose

416
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,120
yeah great question so anybody authors

417
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,519
or

418
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,680
otherwise what is the relationship

419
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,600
between pragmatism

420
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,720
and utility and then instrumentalism

421
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,480
so we're using the instruments

422
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,399
ostensibly for pragmatic

423
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,079
ends but the authors chose to frame

424
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,000
the discussion in terms of realism

425
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,839
versus instrumentalism instead of

426
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,000
pragmatism versus say anti-pragmatism or

427
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,519
some other you know could be pragmatism

428
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,399
versus realism perhaps

429
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,560
so any authors or other hands

430
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,120
um i i don't mind saying just a few

431
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,680
words

432
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,000
um and then perhaps i'll end it over to

433
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,600
thomas but i just want to

434
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,639
um the one way that i think that it's

435
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,639
useful for me to think this

436
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,839
is um the use of representation so

437
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,360
in what sense are we using

438
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,279
representations because

439
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,279
um shannon was saying she was raising a

440
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,440
very good point it is very useful to

441
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,360
refer to these things that this activity

442
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,560
that's going on in

443
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,759
in the brain as a representations but i

444
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,880
think that um

445
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,000
what in what sense are using

446
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,920
representations is important because

447
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,079
if it's in a sort of a metaphor then

448
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,040
obviously there is

449
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,720
no problem because it is actually very

450
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,880
useful and we are building all of these

451
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,759
um

452
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,279
we are trying to make sense of all of

453
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,680
these data that we gather from the brain

454
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,480
uh and that's in some in some sense

455
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,160
building a representation because what

456
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,360
is a representation

457
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,600
representation is a is a sentence it's a

458
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,120
picture it's a map

459
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,959
these are kinds of representations why

460
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,160
is this problematic

461
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,480
it's because these are things that we as

462
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,759
human beings do

463
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,839
we do that in our daily lives and we do

464
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,120
that in our labs

465
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,120
so we build these representations to

466
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,680
make sense of uh the observations that

467
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,880
uh that we that we we do in our labs and

468
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,360
in our daily lives so then we can

469
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,079
obviously

470
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,199
use this word this concept but it

471
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,040
doesn't have the same meaning

472
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,320
or it does in the realist sense so i

473
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,240
think it comes down to how serious

474
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,959
are we in the use of these of these

475
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:01,759
words

476
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,000
are we using this in a literal sense in

477
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,520
the sense of like sentences

478
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,039
maps pictures that we as human beings

479
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,280
have and build and develop and the brain

480
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,400
also has them

481
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,240
or are we using in a metaphorical way

482
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,000
which is if it's in a metaphorical way

483
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,039
because it's useful

484
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,119
to use the concept then it should be

485
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,640
fine it's a metaphor

486
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,599
okay and that's it really interesting a

487
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,240
metaphor

488
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,319
is really an instrument when somebody

489
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,440
says that

490
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,679
this movie was you know was like it's

491
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,840
like an ocean of ideas or it was like an

492
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,200
ocean a simile

493
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,440
they're using that sentence

494
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,799
representation

495
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,000
instrumentally to convey a point to

496
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,120
you know communicate something that is

497
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,240
internal to the thinker and then

498
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,799
that is not meant to be interpreted

499
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:51,679
realistically

500
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,400
but in science where there's a strong

501
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:54,960
realist

502
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,080
kick amongst some people they think it

503
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,080
isn't science unless it's not

504
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,919
gonna be the realest most mechanistic

505
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,760
thing now whether it's

506
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,520
mechanism all the way down or what what

507
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,960
the lowest level mechanism is that's

508
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,840
sort of where

509
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,000
it the those realist ideas bottom out

510
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,600
but without going

511
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,720
that way it's just it is across fields

512
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,559
and across different media we ask

513
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,320
whether we're meaning something

514
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,640
really or instrumentally so any other

515
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,480
thoughts what was some like uh we have

516
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,000
oh yeah scott people can raise their

517
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,200
hand on shitsy because i'm not always

518
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,799
looking at the actual video screen so

519
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,120
thanks

520
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,039
scott and then anyone else i was just

521
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,559
wondering it's it's interesting

522
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,600
um in terms of the encoding and the

523
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,640
decoding

524
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,840
notion so if you have different

525
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,760
isms on either side of your encoding and

526
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,600
decoding that seems like where you have

527
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,080
the

528
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,960
problem potentially so someone's

529
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,799
encoding a communication

530
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,679
as a metaphor but it's taken not as a

531
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,760
metaphor but as a

532
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,880
something stronger and is decoded that

533
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,280
way

534
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,760
then then there's a miscommunication

535
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,760
one of the things that i've been trying

536
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,440
to fuss with and it feels like this is

537
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,880
that place

538
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,320
the painter kandinsky said that violent

539
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,520
societies yield

540
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,880
abstract art and i always wondered

541
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,960
whether that's reversible

542
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,840
whether abstraction is a form of

543
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,160
violence

544
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,799
and here that feels like that might be

545
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,919
relevant

546
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,559
because if i abstract something with one

547
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,240
ism

548
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,559
and then it's in my encoding of my

549
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,480
message and then it's decoded by someone

550
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,039
else who's decoding with a different ism

551
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,799
then that abstraction has led to a

552
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,480
violence in fact it might lead to

553
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,799
actual harm to that other person because

554
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,240
they may misinterpret

555
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,480
my message based on that schism of isms

556
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,480
that you have there i had to go there

557
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,559
but um anyways is that something

558
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,120
that that challenge of communication

559
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,679
across

560
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,440
boundaries feels like it's

561
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,840
invoked here and what might be some

562
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,000
strategies

563
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,039
for doing something about that

564
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,039
thanks scott for the great question

565
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,080
thomas and then

566
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,679
we just continue down the stack so

567
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,039
people can just throw up the hand raise

568
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,240
whenever they have a thought and we'll

569
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,880
get to everybody

570
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,000
yeah i think um these these three

571
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,960
comments really

572
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,440
uh together cut at the heart of the

573
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,400
matter

574
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,000
um i think that indeed from what i

575
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,120
have heard myself neuroscientists pretty

576
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,520
much

577
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,080
often know what they mean with

578
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,600
representation

579
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,880
and they don't take it to mean anything

580
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,360
much more robust than a sort of

581
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,240
correlation

582
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,919
between particular patterns of activity

583
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,760
and particular things that we see

584
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,520
happening um and it's more robust than

585
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,120
that but

586
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,520
not anyway what the philosophers take it

587
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,720
to mean

588
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,559
um but the issue is then

589
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,760
exactly in communication

590
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,520
where um it feels like

591
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,630
among neuroscientists it's a bit of an

592
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,440
[Music]

593
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,120
in insiders knowledge

594
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,200
that representation is sort of a

595
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,159
metaphor it's like

596
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,679
the computer metaphor as a whole

597
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,480
um it's a metaphor and you shouldn't

598
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,520
take it

599
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,039
uh in a realist way as we would say

600
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,080
um but when students

601
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,320
read a handbook this is not always that

602
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,600
obvious

603
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,480
and i've also talked to neuroscientists

604
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,520
that

605
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,000
really believed that the rats had a

606
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,440
literal map

607
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,440
in their brain like we have a sort of

608
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,559
jpeg on our computer

609
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,440
um because they were talking about

610
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,200
representational maps in the brain

611
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,440
and if you know a little bit about

612
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,600
philosophy

613
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,039
in this area philosophers take these

614
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,960
new scientists talk about

615
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,080
representations to mean

616
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,679
just about anything that they like um

617
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,720
so i think

618
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,159
that the the issue is indeed one if you

619
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,240
want to talk about that way of encoding

620
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,760
and decoding that

621
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,280
they encode a metaphor and some people

622
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,919
that are

623
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,520
in the know decode a metaphor

624
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,120
but many people don't and

625
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,760
i've noticed that exactly with the free

626
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,880
energy principle

627
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,000
where it feels like it gets very

628
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,320
muddy with what is metaphor and what

629
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,919
isn't and what people take to be

630
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,919
metaphor and what isn't

631
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,960
um and that sense my my main project

632
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,520
here

633
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,039
is is to try and create clarity um

634
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,360
in what it could possibly mean

635
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,720
and even if people completely disagree

636
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,000
with the position

637
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,039
i think at the very least i would like

638
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,120
just people to be more clear about what

639
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,960
they really mean

640
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,520
thanks thomas and really one of the

641
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,720
goals of these

642
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,480
discussions that we're having so we're

643
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,559
going to go to shannon stephen and s

644
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,640
yeah this is actually really great um

645
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,320
thomas and scott

646
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,559
i hadn't thought about it this way

647
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,320
before

648
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,320
so no one in the general public cares

649
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,480
about the representation words

650
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,559
that might not be true but like nobody

651
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,520
cares

652
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,720
but whenever science from a

653
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,919
neuroscientist

654
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,480
gets picked up by a journalist who then

655
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,400
makes the article with the headline that

656
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,520
says

657
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,720
your brain has models inside of it that

658
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,000
it's running and

659
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,679
you should learn music because it will

660
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,039
make you smarter but learning coding

661
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,320
won't make you smarter which

662
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,600
was like a headline recently um

663
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,919
but that translation process that scott

664
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,279
was talking about that encoding and

665
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:05,919
decoding

666
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,200
really gets stuck

667
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,440
and it doesn't get decoded when it gets

668
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,640
written about

669
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,240
in sort of like more

670
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
mainstream news outlets like maybe

671
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,000
someone's medium blog post that they're

672
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,880
writing

673
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,320
and they're a really dedicated grad

674
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,919
student who's grappling with these ideas

675
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,080
all the time and they're very clear

676
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,559
in their writing about what scientists

677
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,600
mean when they're talking about a

678
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,080
representation or a model

679
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,880
what this means for the actual brain

680
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,640
itself and then what this means for you

681
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,080
as a person just reading about it um

682
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,960
but that doesn't always come across in

683
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,440
like the headline on cnn

684
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,279
or or like the the the facebook feed

685
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,960
that's scrolling through

686
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,480
you know my adult parents computer

687
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:54,960
screen

688
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,159
and so being clear

689
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,760
you have to go through this step of

690
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,679
using it as a useful metaphor in

691
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:02,720
neuroscience

692
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,799
getting clear what the metaphors could

693
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,919
be if they're real

694
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,279
or just instrumental readings in

695
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,360
the philosophy camp and then like the

696
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,360
one more step is bringing the science

697
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,000
communicators

698
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,200
in and and getting them to to parse this

699
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,360
huge debate down into something that's

700
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,840
able to be distributed to folks who

701
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,240
aren't enmeshed in this every day

702
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,840
thanks shannon so stephen and that's

703
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,320
sasha

704
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,440
and well this clash is definitely um

705
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,360
a useful discussion because i think in

706
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,840
activism radical inactivism and

707
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,360
free energy are both trying to come in

708
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,760
and say it's not all in the head

709
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,600
so just like you're saying this the

710
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,120
challenge you've got is anyone and as

711
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,840
soon as people

712
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,679
talk about neuroscience and that it's

713
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,679
like there's just an assumption in our

714
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,679
culture that's all in the head

715
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,640
it's not even so that metaphor is like a

716
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,159
signpost

717
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,480
and then everything else becomes and is

718
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,480
it is it a film playing in my head and

719
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,679
it's like well wait a second it's the

720
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,679
mind-body environment with the dynamic

721
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,200
system it's about action

722
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,919
and they look at you with this like wait

723
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:06,480
so

724
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,200
it's like it's like it slips into that

725
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,360
so i think this is a really good

726
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,600
good point because like metaphors when

727
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,039
you embody them

728
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,159
are kind of like you inactively

729
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,919
understand what it's like to be inside

730
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,520
them but then when they just become like

731
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,200
a signpost

732
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,240
for what to do they lose all of that

733
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,880
kind of architecture so i think this is

734
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,960
this is quite valuable

735
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,799
yep the metaphors and the language

736
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,640
stephen and related to the science

737
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,760
communication point

738
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,640
it's uh oh well this is hardwired in or

739
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,520
the dna

740
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,000
codes for this protein it uses the

741
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,880
language

742
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,600
that's implicit in a very specific

743
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,640
understanding

744
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,039
and that metaphor gets over interpreted

745
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:49,919
and then you start

746
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,360
where's the ram in the brain you know

747
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,600
where's the gpu and then you start

748
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,960
building out this metaphor before you

749
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,200
know it you're way down the rabbit hole

750
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,840
with something that was basically in

751
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,120
terms of this paper

752
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,919
taking a realist reading on an

753
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:04,880
instrumentalist

754
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,960
project and again we just think about

755
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,320
other kinds of modeling if you did a

756
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,840
steam engine model of the brain it's not

757
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,120
a steam engine if you do a linear

758
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,960
regression it's not a linear regression

759
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,640
so if you do an active inference model

760
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,640
it's not an active inference brain

761
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,120
but that is very nuanced to communicate

762
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,880
because of the way that our language is

763
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,039
so ines and sasha than anyone else

764
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,080
yeah um i think these are very good

765
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,440
remarks i um

766
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,080
just wanted to um i think i have to

767
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,559
disagree just a tiny bit just to make a

768
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,000
point about i i think that there are

769
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,520
real issues and there are real dangers

770
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,760
in conceiving of uh in the ways that we

771
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,960
conceive

772
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,320
things and especially in the ways that

773
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,000
we use our language

774
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,840
and our concepts and particularly

775
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,520
looking at the concept of representation

776
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,200
but there are others that i can think of

777
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,039
i can think of the concept of hierarchy

778
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,640
for example that

779
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,320
could be a metaphor could be used in a

780
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,840
realist um way

781
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,480
uh there there's a there's new papers on

782
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,159
this which are very relevant and very

783
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:04,720
interesting

784
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,000
but what i want to say is that in the

785
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
particular case of the representation i

786
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,760
think there are real dangers

787
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,520
in using it's not just how the science

788
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,039
is communicated or

789
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,880
oh maybe this is not a problem for me to

790
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,799
deal with let's just philosophers handle

791
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,600
that that's not

792
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,679
real for my particular lab it's not

793
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,039
going to be an issue i think it's going

794
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,080
to be an issue

795
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,600
because i think the way that you

796
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
conceptualize however the processes are

797
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,039
going on in the brain

798
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,880
is going to dictate the way that you

799
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,919
design and you interpret the results

800
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,679
so i'm thinking for example there's a

801
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,039
bit in the paper where

802
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,200
we do we make a distinction between two

803
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,720
kinds of modeling

804
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,840
techniques that we can use and they have

805
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,240
two

806
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,360
very different goals ambitions worries

807
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,200
and they end up in very different

808
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,399
conclusions

809
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,520
and um so one of them

810
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,720
um takes up as for free that

811
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,960
there is information in the brain so

812
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,320
this kind of modeling

813
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,080
is the kind of modeling that uses

814
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,880
structural causal um

815
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,480
models and uh what they aim for is to

816
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,600
think about uh the the relations between

817
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:09,840
the

818
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,240
the nodes uh these are nodes that are

819
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,960
highly connected and the way that we

820
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,039
design and understand or interpret the

821
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,240
data coming from

822
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,200
those models is by the presence or

823
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,000
absence of

824
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,279
information now this means that we are

825
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,960
taking information for

826
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,200
free information for existing in the

827
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,120
brain so what kind of information are we

828
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,399
talking about is it the kind of

829
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,559
information that i also have in my model

830
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,000
because if it is then we're talking

831
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,240
about semantic information

832
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,720
and i mean it may be the case that the

833
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,279
brain

834
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,360
actually works with the very same kind

835
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,440
of information that i have in my model

836
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,559
but we need to prove that that's an

837
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,399
assumption

838
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,720
and this is how we are building our

839
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,080
models and i think that's

840
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,960
that's one worry now the other worry is

841
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,799
that in building these models that

842
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,480
that's the inactivist worry

843
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,880
uh which stephen was just mentioning

844
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,520
which is

845
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,720
if we say that well the cognition comes

846
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,480
down to this representation

847
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,640
representations happening in the brain

848
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,640
then so much for

849
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,440
the rest of uh cognition that is uh in

850
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,880
the body in the body being in an

851
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,320
environment so that this old is an

852
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,039
activist

853
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,679
sort of like tradition and i just wanted

854
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,440
to add that

855
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,880
cool thank you um we have sasha shannon

856
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,279
alex

857
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,960
um yeah thank you for explaining that

858
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,840
so well um and bringing this to the

859
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,360
forefront that

860
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,200
this is an issue to be grappled with i

861
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,120
think um from the neuroscience

862
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,000
background

863
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,279
uh yes it is just relegated to uh

864
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,480
philosophers to deal with uh

865
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,760
these bigger questions but um

866
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,919
leading to this uh going back to this

867
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,480
idea of encoding and decoding

868
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,360
it really does matter what is meant by

869
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,080
the phrase

870
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,120
and then how it's um decoded

871
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,640
and i think in the world of like

872
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,200
molecular neuroscience and um just

873
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,039
recording signals from the brain

874
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,880
we really think that um

875
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,720
[Music]

876
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,640
we're measuring something real about the

877
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,480
system whether or not that's what's

878
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,919
actually happening that's just one

879
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:22,960
measurement

880
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,000
of the overall behavior and

881
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,080
um to just lean into instrumentalism

882
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,640
it's a useful metaphor for what we're

883
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,519
seeing

884
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,039
but um obviously it

885
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,279
people don't have the training or the

886
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,679
decoding of the philosophy perspective

887
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:42,880
on what that means

888
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,240
and so um

889
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,399
i've never thought about it until this

890
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,200
paper um that this could be a real issue

891
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,399
even in my own work

892
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,320
so i think it's really important to um

893
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,519
get into the nuance of what we mean when

894
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,799
we use these metaphors thanks

895
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,399
sasha shannon alex

896
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,279
well okay yeah go ahead shane um yeah so

897
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,640
that's really great i

898
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,000
i didn't mean to say that like only

899
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,519
science communicators and philosophers

900
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,039
are

901
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,279
should worry about this question um but

902
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,480
i think so like something that that this

903
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,600
reminded me of in

904
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,159
sort of my field so i look at music

905
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,279
perception

906
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,919
um in the brain and i kind of have a

907
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,519
question of does the brain use internal

908
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,559
models

909
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,480
to predict timing mechanisms and

910
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,159
this metaphor that you brought up

911
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,159
that how it affects the assumptions that

912
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,399
you make and how you design or analyze

913
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,399
or interpret your experiment um

914
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,320
i think it also makes a case for

915
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,279
pluralism like if you're realist then

916
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,960
pluralist about realist approaches

917
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,279
if you're making metamorph metaphors

918
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,799
then pluralist about

919
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,399
the type of metaphor that could be

920
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,559
useful so we

921
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,080
thought or a lot of neuroscientists

922
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,600
still think there's a clock mechanism in

923
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,080
the brain

924
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,360
or a pacemaker that's just like tracking

925
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,440
rhythmic activity

926
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,519
but maybe there's this move now that

927
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,679
there's more of a bayesian mechanism

928
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:20,960
that's building up

929
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,840
a timing model that's now predicting

930
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,720
when

931
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,039
or what the next event will be that

932
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,159
occurs

933
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,440
and one of those might be more

934
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,760
explanatory useful

935
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,919
and the other one will fall away but i

936
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:34,799
don't know if

937
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,320
we can actually ever prove that there is

938
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,640
a bayesian mechanism in the brain

939
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,240
or that there is a clock model in the

940
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,159
brain i think as far as we can get

941
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,120
is that taking this approach is more

942
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,960
explanatorially useful

943
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,960
than taking the other approach

944
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,440
cool and it made me think from my

945
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,000
background

946
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,919
as an evolutionary biologist about the

947
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,440
question what is a gene

948
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,399
and that's a philosophical question that

949
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,679
they don't really discuss

950
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,519
too much in genetics departments but of

951
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,440
course the way that you consider what a

952
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,399
gene is

953
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,320
it's going to set up what you measure

954
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,000
who's included on the research project

955
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,599
how you write about it how you analyze

956
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:14,719
it i mean it's the

957
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,119
primary determinant so whether what's

958
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,639
happening with the electrical signals in

959
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,520
the brain

960
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,079
is part of a real model that is being

961
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:22,879
built out

962
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,480
or whether that is something like we're

963
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,918
just measuring the temperature but then

964
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,520
we're modeling something totally

965
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,280
separate and then also just quickly um

966
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,119
the pluralism it's easier to be

967
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:31,918
pluralistic

968
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,399
with metaphors because it's like we can

969
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,000
always write new poems we can always

970
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,918
have new metaphors we can always build

971
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,679
and do yes and with the metaphors

972
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,079
but realism it's a little harder to be

973
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,119
pluralist

974
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,918
because ostensibly it's not multiple

975
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:46,320
things

976
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,639
at once or potentially you know we can't

977
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,159
all be living our own truth for

978
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,879
what the brain is but we of course can

979
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,239
have our own perspectives

980
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,560
so actually it totally opens the door to

981
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,280
pluralism

982
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,599
in a really qualified way where we can

983
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,880
come together to talk about what's

984
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,599
useful

985
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,440
rather than debate about who's right

986
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,640
about how things are

987
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,680
so really nice framing so alex and then

988
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,078
in s

989
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,119
thanks for me as i came from

990
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,160
engineering world to

991
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,760
learning active inference

992
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,160
instrumentalism approach was an only way

993
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,119
starting to understand what what is

994
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,000
happening

995
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,800
uh because uh when i started to for

996
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,359
finding

997
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,079
and look at uh models uh in this

998
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,680
framework it was a way

999
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,800
and to for my mind to get the basics and

1000
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,680
trying to

1001
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,599
go deeper uh but as for this paper for

1002
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,000
me it's great because it gives

1003
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,720
great promotion for instrumentalism

1004
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,800
approach

1005
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,520
and i just think if there is a notion

1006
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,320
for

1007
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,359
radical instrumentalism

1008
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,000
if so can we use it and how it should be

1009
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,359
described

1010
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,480
uh and again for me

1011
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,720
honestly i don't care much about

1012
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,920
philosophy debates or even neuroscience

1013
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,960
debates

1014
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,359
i'm watching on a world around in terms

1015
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,400
of systems

1016
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,720
and trying to understand these systems

1017
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,680
basically as

1018
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,599
black boxes understand their behavior

1019
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,800
without understanding how this

1020
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,240
deep rabbit holes inside working

1021
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,520
so that's why

1022
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,680
it's interesting for me is for reading

1023
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,800
this paper and

1024
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,000
with discussions too thanks thanks

1025
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,160
alex so ines and then thomas

1026
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,960
yeah um i just wanted to add something

1027
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,400
to what you were just mentioning

1028
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,119
danielle

1029
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,480
um about um the the pluralist approach

1030
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,400
um i think that yeah you were you said

1031
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,520
that something that sounded

1032
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,480
very very right to me which is one can

1033
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:02,960
only

1034
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,040
take this pluralist or is it at least

1035
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,560
easier to take the pluralist

1036
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,079
route um if we are on the sort of the

1037
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:10,880
instrumentalist

1038
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,000
side um so for example uh with

1039
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,680
the example that we have we have in the

1040
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,119
paper with these two

1041
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,359
kinds of different modeling approaches

1042
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,160
that we can take

1043
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,320
like dynamical causal modelling or

1044
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,160
structural causal modeling

1045
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,079
if we take an instrumentalist approach

1046
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,920
then we can say that these two

1047
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,599
different sorts of modeling techniques

1048
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:30,960
they can work together

1049
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,920
where for example what you get from the

1050
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,599
structural cause of modeling which

1051
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,359
is you get like a sort of a nice

1052
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,800
topological description

1053
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,839
of the connections arranged in the brain

1054
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,119
as we get a nice map of that which can

1055
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,320
sort of combined with

1056
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,160
dynamical causal modeling where you get

1057
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,720
for example the dynamics

1058
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,800
in terms of states and how the activity

1059
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,720
occurs you can combine this in a

1060
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,040
pluralist way as long as you take this

1061
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,280
much more instrumentalist approach and

1062
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,240
you don't think

1063
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,320
you know it to be the case that what

1064
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,839
you're getting from

1065
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,839
these models is what is actually the

1066
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:10,960
case

1067
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,160
so i just wanted to add that yes

1068
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,680
like we have one instrument that helps

1069
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,680
us find the structure and topology the

1070
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,280
connectness we have another instrument

1071
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,079
that measures

1072
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,000
or helps us do inference on a slightly

1073
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,359
different attribute

1074
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:24,880
and it's not a philosophical debate

1075
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,880
whether it's actually just dynamics or

1076
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,400
actually just topology

1077
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
it's actually us investigating a system

1078
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
we care about and then that's what can

1079
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:32,800
bring

1080
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,680
people to the table so thomas and then

1081
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,118
scott david than anyone else

1082
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,000
yeah um i think that's i think that's

1083
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,960
really quite

1084
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,240
right um i've spoken about this paper

1085
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,320
with other people as well and some were

1086
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,599
worried

1087
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,800
um that instrumentalism was

1088
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,560
placing too strong of a limit

1089
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,000
on our scientific endeavors

1090
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,800
that if we say oh well we could only

1091
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,160
ever be instrumentalist

1092
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,440
then they would they said

1093
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,720
why do science at all if we can't really

1094
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,880
get at the heart of the matter

1095
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,599
if we can't actually add some sort of

1096
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,040
finish line

1097
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,480
say okay well now we have just

1098
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,760
an accurate description of what

1099
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,880
cognition is and

1100
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,040
how organisms navigate the environment

1101
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,880
um and i think that's a fair worry

1102
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,920
um i wonder if perhaps it's just a bit

1103
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,440
too ambitious

1104
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,480
uh but you know who knows what we can do

1105
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,480
in 100 years

1106
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,160
and i think i do think in that

1107
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,040
perspective it is important to

1108
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,440
see that the paper doesn't really get

1109
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,560
into

1110
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,960
that grander philosophy of science

1111
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,160
debate

1112
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,079
about model instrumentalism

1113
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,680
across the board right so

1114
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,280
it could very well be that at some point

1115
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,079
we'll get a model that really well

1116
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,160
describes everything that

1117
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,640
really happens in in an organism

1118
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,720
maybe the main point

1119
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,079
here as i take it anyway might disagree

1120
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,720
of course is that at the very least

1121
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,440
in the free energy principle you don't

1122
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,119
get that entailment of

1123
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,079
because we can model it the organism

1124
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,640
models as well um

1125
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,760
but it's not it could be that

1126
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,680
in the end we can take a realistic

1127
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,440
position on

1128
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,960
some other model in the future

1129
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,400
nice so we're not committed to yet this

1130
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,839
instrumentalist across the board

1131
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,599
we can be realist elsewhere and we can

1132
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,440
be realist in the future but you've laid

1133
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:57,839
out

1134
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,760
a research agenda and a logical

1135
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,000
structure for asking whether

1136
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,920
you know have we met some of these

1137
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,040
claims that were

1138
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,880
brought up in your paper on another

1139
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,400
topic or for free energy

1140
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,319
in the future on that note to quickly

1141
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:12,640
get

1142
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,480
back to what alex was saying

1143
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,839
it doesn't necessarily mean that we have

1144
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,200
to commit to radical instrumentalism

1145
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,920
we don't have to be that radical

1146
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,040
although that might be called

1147
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,760
engineering

1148
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,079
by some so maybe it already exists so

1149
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,960
scott and then in s

1150
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,800
yeah and along those lines so i

1151
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,640
mentioned before that i was an attorney

1152
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,839
so

1153
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:42,079
rhetoric is persuasive speech

1154
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,319
and it is what we attorneys produce

1155
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:47,760
and so it's interesting when you talk

1156
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,599
about instrumentalism and realism

1157
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,720
in terms of rhetoric so

1158
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,280
i used to say to my kids all the time

1159
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,599
that the only time you see reality is

1160
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,599
when you see paradox

1161
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,520
and any other time you're living inside

1162
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,839
a model

1163
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,920
and so that means that when people talk

1164
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,920
about resolving paradox what they're

1165
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,200
talking about is whose model wins

1166
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,800
but i always told my kids you should

1167
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,119
manage paradox not try to resolve it

1168
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,960
because that is reality so

1169
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,520
let me take that what i'm suggesting is

1170
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,760
metaphor may be reality in certain

1171
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,359
contexts

1172
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,119
because the management of the paradox

1173
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,200
happens through rhetorical speech the

1174
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,880
incommensurables are brought together

1175
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,720
with with

1176
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,760
with the rhetoric you you create a story

1177
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,960
to make it

1178
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,400
a thing right and so what i'm wondering

1179
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:40,720
is

1180
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,040
i'm i was thinking of the analogy of the

1181
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,640
well-tempered clavier when

1182
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,960
bach was tempering musical notes right

1183
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,800
there's all sorts of notes out there

1184
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,920
and then the scale was decided upon and

1185
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,839
now it's a scale and it's objective and

1186
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,920
it's mathematically demonstrable why

1187
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,240
it's

1188
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,240
a good scale but it's not the only scale

1189
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,920
and so that kind of idea of managing

1190
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,160
paradox through i guess it's

1191
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,079
instrumentalism because you're allowing

1192
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,599
for multiple

1193
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,920
approaches what i'm wondering is

1194
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,400
is there a preference for one or the

1195
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,599
other

1196
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,119
um in in trying to

1197
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,720
motivate change in in in groups and then

1198
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,280
the

1199
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,839
second part of that so that's one and

1200
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,359
then the other part is

1201
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,839
i beginning to understand that the i

1202
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:32,960
believe that the

1203
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,800
mind doesn't exist in the brain it

1204
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,000
exists in language

1205
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,880
and the brain is an antenna that's tuned

1206
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,000
into that

1207
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,319
so from that perspective can anything be

1208
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,960
other than instrumentalist

1209
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,800
so you made a claim about what the brain

1210
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,280
is so that was a realist claim about it

1211
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,560
but i yes great questions scott so we

1212
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,520
got an s

1213
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,759
blue

1214
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,119
um okay i just wanted to um add

1215
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,319
something to uh

1216
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,480
what thomas was saying actually uh

1217
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,000
whether we lose something

1218
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,880
when we take the instrumentalist part

1219
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,920
and

1220
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,319
i think that my concern is that i'm not

1221
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,200
sure if we can

1222
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,839
if we can um if you can even have the

1223
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,760
realist path

1224
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,599
and i don't i'm not sure if that's an

1225
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:22,960
option um

1226
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,720
so the reason being and i'm going to

1227
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,160
come back to the examples that we have

1228
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,680
in the paper because i think these are

1229
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,319
like

1230
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,720
practical you know useful examples are

1231
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,400
concrete examples that we can think

1232
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,359
about

1233
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,599
amongst ourselves even if we come from

1234
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:36,800
very different backgrounds

1235
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,720
but uh there are some scientists here

1236
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,000
some neuroscientists here and i think

1237
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,920
that's useful to you know come back to

1238
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,839
uh what we're really talking about uh

1239
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:44,960
with examples

1240
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,119
so with the two different kinds of

1241
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,400
modeling or

1242
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,480
let's say just two major ones that we

1243
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,160
refer to in the paper

1244
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,800
where uh you have one kind of modeling

1245
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,400
that is trying to capture

1246
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,440
a topological description of how things

1247
00:44:59,440 --> 00:44:59,920
are

1248
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,200
and then you have this other kind of

1249
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,079
modeling where you're trying to explain

1250
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,920
why things behave in the way that they

1251
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,440
do right and that's sort of like the

1252
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,520
more dynamical systems one

1253
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,960
um so in a sense in the in the dynamical

1254
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,000
systems one it's

1255
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,359
explanatory because you're trying to

1256
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,440
explain why things behave in the way

1257
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,040
that they do and the crucial point here

1258
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,119
that we also point out in the paper

1259
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,960
is that when you explain to answer the

1260
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,720
question why you need to have a theory

1261
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,880
you need to have on a hypothesis

1262
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,040
so this means that these models in

1263
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,800
dynamical causal modelling they are

1264
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,680
hypotheses dependent right so you are

1265
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,319
looking for an explanation as opposed to

1266
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:37,200
a description

1267
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,000
um in uh for example structural causal

1268
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,200
modeling

1269
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,960
attracting functional connectivity for

1270
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,720
example so what i want to say

1271
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,760
is that in these two particular

1272
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,040
ways of modeling things you already find

1273
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,040
two different uh two different goals and

1274
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,240
two different strategies one is

1275
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:54,880
descriptive

1276
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,640
the other one is explanatory now my

1277
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,079
question is um

1278
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,440
whether modeling this uh in this way we

1279
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,440
lose any explanatory attraction

1280
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,359
i don't think we do i think that this

1281
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,440
depends on what we are doing and how we

1282
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,359
are doing because if our research is

1283
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:10,160
going to be

1284
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,119
driven by a hypothesis then you're going

1285
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,040
to get this explanatory traction and let

1286
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,400
me just give you a very

1287
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,240
quick example so let's say that you are

1288
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,760
modeling a pendulum

1289
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,359
right you're modeling a pendulum and

1290
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,280
you're trying to explain uh so there are

1291
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,800
two things you can do with this you can

1292
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,560
describe the pendulum and you can also

1293
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,920
try to explain come up with an

1294
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,000
explanation for why the pendulum behaves

1295
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,960
the way that it does

1296
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,400
right um and um

1297
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,319
once you do the explanations obviously

1298
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:37,599
it's very obvious for us because it's a

1299
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:38,160
very simple

1300
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,800
uh system uh the explanation is gonna be

1301
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,319
on well that's the laws of physics

1302
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:43,599
obviously right

1303
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,800
but you have what you've just done is

1304
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,520
you've just

1305
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,400
explained what a pendulum is doing why

1306
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,079
the pendulum is behaving like that by

1307
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,440
using these two different ways of

1308
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,640
modeling the pendulum

1309
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,000
why it behaves in the way that you do

1310
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,280
and how it behaves in the way that you

1311
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,640
do you have your why

1312
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,359
by going to by using the laws of physics

1313
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:02,160
and

1314
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,040
you cannot say you cannot at any point

1315
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:05,520
say

1316
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,720
that the pendulum is representing

1317
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,760
the model and yet you explain

1318
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,520
why the pendulum is behaving the way

1319
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,359
they detect that it is

1320
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,200
so i just want to say that i'm not so

1321
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,359
sure that we should take the realist

1322
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,359
or that we need to take the realest part

1323
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:22,559
just on

1324
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,079
on the account that perhaps you lose

1325
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,839
explanatory attraction well we are

1326
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,559
explaining the natural world

1327
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,680
by modeling the natural world

1328
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,400
so i just wanted to add i'm gonna

1329
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,359
retrace

1330
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:38,640
that gem of an argument actually

1331
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,359
realism is looking for descriptions

1332
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,000
explanations about how things really are

1333
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,040
instrumentalism is testing hypotheses

1334
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,559
and then the key twist in the discussion

1335
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:51,359
in the argument

1336
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,480
is our hypotheses are about

1337
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,040
explanations of the system so we

1338
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,680
actually

1339
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,480
get the benefits really without the

1340
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,720
baggage of realism because we're

1341
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,599
hypothesis driven investigators as

1342
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:06,800
scientists

1343
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,480
searching for explanations through

1344
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,800
hypotheses so by centering

1345
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,960
the hypothesis quest we can be

1346
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,079
instrumentalists

1347
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,040
and get the realist fruit but if we act

1348
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,400
like we're realists like we're searching

1349
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,760
for an explanation or description of a

1350
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,559
system

1351
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,200
we get lost we're not hypothesis driven

1352
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,640
and we're trapped with all this baggage

1353
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,440
of realism

1354
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,400
so very clear and really thanks for

1355
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,359
sharing it we got

1356
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:34,800
blue thomas stephen

1357
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,280
so i hate to like jump off of that like

1358
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:37,920
wonderful

1359
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,200
um explanation by ines uh like regarding

1360
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,119
realism but i have to go back to

1361
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,200
uh what scott david just said about the

1362
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,319
mind and the brain because it's

1363
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,400
something that i think about a lot

1364
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,520
and um that i am

1365
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,880
pretty deeply involved in but um

1366
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,160
language uh cannot be where

1367
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,800
the mind exists and i'm not going to say

1368
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,400
that i think that the mind exists in the

1369
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,680
brain because i don't but

1370
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,319
i think that the mind also cannot exist

1371
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,960
in language because that just

1372
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,680
it totally um you know negates the

1373
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,680
experience of someone like helen keller

1374
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,760
who didn't acquire language until she

1375
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,160
was

1376
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,400
you know well into her late childhood so

1377
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,480
so before that did she have no mind

1378
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,400
like i don't think that that's fair but

1379
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,400
also like in any kind of

1380
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,200
trauma experience people don't have

1381
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:27,839
language

1382
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:31,280
for the trauma so were you mindless at

1383
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:31,920
that time

1384
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,079
or are do you have no mind to

1385
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,160
conceptualize the trauma so there are

1386
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,599
many experiences

1387
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,520
that happen on a very primal and very

1388
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,960
emotional level

1389
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,480
that cannot be explained or represented

1390
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,440
with language

1391
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,040
right so so i think that the the mind um

1392
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,119
can't exist there and then maybe to tie

1393
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,720
this back into

1394
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,319
the realist um the realist versus

1395
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:57,359
instrumentalist

1396
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,640
like is language real right like so

1397
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,720
so i mean i i'm one of these people that

1398
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,559
that really questions reality

1399
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,119
and what what is real like what can we

1400
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:07,839
take to

1401
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,839
to be a realistic representation and so

1402
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,160
language to me is an instrument

1403
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,280
so i mean it's something that like we

1404
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,680
it's it's not even it's it's a human

1405
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,559
concept

1406
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:21,760
so it doesn't exist outside of our

1407
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,960
perspective reality which i mean to me

1408
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,520
like

1409
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,200
it totally pushes the realist debate

1410
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,920
off the table because like what even is

1411
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,319
real

1412
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,559
and i have a neuroscience background but

1413
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:36,559
i know like even in neuroscience

1414
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:39,599
there are very wide schisms like people

1415
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:40,720
that think that

1416
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,079
reality is a concrete objective thing

1417
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,240
but i'm like you know reality exists

1418
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,839
here and like that's it

1419
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,400
right so so i'm on that other side of

1420
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,280
the wall

1421
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,040
um anyway that's it so sorry no

1422
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,880
questions just some thoughts

1423
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,680
thank you thomas stephen and then anyone

1424
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,839
else

1425
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,680
um i think my initial point was

1426
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:08,079
uh just to react to ines her beautiful

1427
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,119
explanation there and i really think

1428
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:11,920
that should have been

1429
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,000
in the paper because it's actually a

1430
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,640
really really good way to set it up

1431
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,760
um yeah that's really good

1432
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,800
as for the the where the mind

1433
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,480
is um and what's real i think um

1434
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,520
i'd love to chat on about that for

1435
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,839
probably hours i think it's very

1436
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,359
interesting

1437
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:36,880
and i think the inactivist perspective

1438
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,480
is a very nice

1439
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,599
middle passage between there's an

1440
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,720
objective reality uh that we are

1441
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,520
approaching

1442
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,960
or it's all in the mind um

1443
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,520
however i think really getting into that

1444
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,359
will probably take us a little bit too

1445
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:55,760
far

1446
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,960
away from uh active inference so i'll

1447
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,119
i'll leave it at that but uh

1448
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,520
yeah the you know the conversations were

1449
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,960
on the freeway

1450
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,280
all these fun keywords and side

1451
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,040
discussions the off-ramp so

1452
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:13,520
thanks for sharing it steven then marco

1453
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:15,839
yeah i mean the culture culture does

1454
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:16,720
come back to

1455
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,200
how we frame looking at reality so we

1456
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,440
tend to look at reality

1457
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,839
um either with a perspective and model

1458
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:24,800
or

1459
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,720
to get that perspective we use these

1460
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,359
tools because we're a very kind of like

1461
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:32,160
tool based kind of culture now um but i

1462
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,839
like in the paper it does say

1463
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:35,920
it says in that first abstract it

1464
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,520
remains disputed whether it's

1465
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,079
statistical models

1466
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,040
are scientific tools but then it says to

1467
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:43,880
describe

1468
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,240
non-equilibrium's steady-state systems

1469
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:46,960
so in a way

1470
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,200
non-equilibrium steady-state systems is

1471
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,839
kind of like a foundational

1472
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,599
ground that that that could be to some

1473
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:56,480
extent real

1474
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,200
it's the question of the models that are

1475
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,640
used to describe

1476
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,480
how they work that isn't real

1477
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,319
you know so i think that's also like

1478
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,319
this doesn't

1479
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,000
like there's still room for the idea

1480
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,839
that the brain at some level

1481
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:13,440
even though it's quite abstract is a

1482
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,520
non-equilibrium steady state system it's

1483
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,480
just

1484
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,559
that the models the statistical models

1485
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:21,200
shouldn't also be the

1486
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,440
i don't know the way that that system's

1487
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,119
doing its job so to speak so i think

1488
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,920
that's kind of

1489
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,680
and i suppose what that also then brings

1490
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,599
back is how do we get at that and this

1491
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:30,240
is where

1492
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,760
i'm quite interested in indigenous ways

1493
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,520
of knowing because well

1494
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,839
if you don't come from a perspectival

1495
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:37,359
root and if most of

1496
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,200
what if you come from other like

1497
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,599
metaphors is one level but other sort of

1498
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:42,880
swarming

1499
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,240
kind of um

1500
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:49,440
non-non-literal ways of knowing

1501
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,640
you know non-verbal maybe you that

1502
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,800
that's another avenue that opens up that

1503
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,319
says okay maybe we have to come at

1504
00:53:56,319 --> 00:54:00,640
it through other ways of modeling anyway

1505
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,640
thanks steven marco than anyone else

1506
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,599
hi thanks um so first of all uh just

1507
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,040
fair distortion i haven't fully read it

1508
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:09,359
yet

1509
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:12,559
um but um it's an initial discussion and

1510
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,400
and uh scott mentioned paradox and i'll

1511
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,280
take that up

1512
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,319
um i actually suspect that

1513
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:23,280
um the paradoxical interpretation might

1514
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,480
actually be the correct interpretation

1515
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,160
so we have a nice

1516
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,440
um table of possible interpretations for

1517
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,880
the fvp

1518
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,640
um a two by two uh table but but what if

1519
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,599
it's all of them

1520
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,000
right so so the fep especially in the

1521
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,319
elaborations and active inference

1522
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,400
is already kind of paradox because you

1523
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,000
already have these trade-offs between

1524
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,359
accuracy complexity or

1525
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,440
the epistemic and the pragmatic aspects

1526
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,480
so in kind of

1527
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,319
a weird way the whole discussion can

1528
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:51,200
flip up your other different

1529
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,319
interpretations

1530
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:55,440
seems to me to parallel the way that the

1531
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,799
let's say first deflationary the

1532
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:58,319
statistical densities in the brain

1533
00:54:58,319 --> 00:54:59,839
actually fulfill different roles

1534
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,359
depending on the actual relation with

1535
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:02,160
the world

1536
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,160
right when i'm actually just imagining

1537
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,599
about the world

1538
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,599
then the representative relation between

1539
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,440
the densities and the targets are not

1540
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,040
actually with respect to the world

1541
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,720
they're actually respect to each other

1542
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,520
in my brain right but nevertheless uh we

1543
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,040
still situate in the real world

1544
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,920
at the very least if we assume an

1545
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,160
objective reality as in a reality that

1546
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,280
is not dependent upon our interpretation

1547
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,680
until we act upon it then at least we

1548
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,319
can say

1549
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:31,359
that by virtue of fep at least what it

1550
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:32,400
suggests

1551
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,200
that the way that these models sorry the

1552
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,559
way that these statistical structures

1553
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:37,520
and densities are

1554
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,559
shaped are shapen by something that is

1555
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:41,440
real

1556
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,640
so in that sense i i personally um

1557
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,119
sorry i have a lot of allergies for for

1558
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:48,720
some stuff philosophy but

1559
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,960
um i i'm very much against this whole

1560
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,280
notion that the representational content

1561
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,319
or representations

1562
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:57,119
have to be adjudicated by some accuracy

1563
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,240
or correctness condition

1564
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,079
and i think it's exactly fp that

1565
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:01,280
challenges that

1566
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,040
right why the hell would that be

1567
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,799
reasonable that a reputation has to be

1568
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:05,599
correct

1569
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:08,480
rather it is that it is shaped by some

1570
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:08,880
sort

1571
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,760
of correctness right but if you would be

1572
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,280
stuck in that we would never get

1573
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,000
somewhere

1574
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,520
right as an organism it's not about

1575
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,359
being true or wrong to correct all the

1576
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:18,720
time it's about being so ratchet

1577
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,599
yourself

1578
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:22,880
in virtue of this adaptive imperative um

1579
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,119
i'm not sure where i'm going um i still

1580
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:26,240
have to properly

1581
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,040
observe everything but um maybe not

1582
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,480
actually type this up is what would you

1583
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:30,799
think

1584
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:34,000
of um instead of choosing one of the

1585
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:34,799
tables

1586
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:38,079
um cells one of these possibilities

1587
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:39,920
more embracing what is in my opinion

1588
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,440
applying the fap and saying that it's

1589
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,280
actually paradox if it's all of them and

1590
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,880
none of them

1591
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,240
thanks marco and i also agree the fep

1592
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,079
helps us by thinking about how the

1593
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:51,440
observations get to us

1594
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,880
whatever side of the blanket or the

1595
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,799
interface we're on we can take those

1596
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:55,920
observations with

1597
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,040
deathly seriousness instrumentally it's

1598
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,799
not that the actual movement of the

1599
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:02,480
water molecules is gonna kill you but

1600
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,079
there are temperatures that kill you

1601
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:05,839
and so we can take our measurements

1602
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,520
seriously and be

1603
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,119
instrumentalist from our side of the

1604
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,559
blanket and say yeah you know there

1605
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:12,640
might be a real system let's hypothesize

1606
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,400
as instrumentalists about what is out

1607
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,200
there

1608
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,040
but if we're waiting on our side of the

1609
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,400
blanket until we

1610
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,040
we have resolved what is quite literally

1611
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,040
on the other side of the blanket

1612
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,040
then it's going to be arguing about

1613
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,559
what's inside of a box that can't be

1614
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:27,280
opened

1615
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,599
and then policy failure is going to be

1616
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,359
the outcome so it's a really interesting

1617
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:32,799
point about how we're kind of using this

1618
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:34,240
fep scaffold

1619
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,240
to actually navigate this paradox so

1620
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,839
really cool there so annes

1621
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:41,839
scott thomas

1622
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:44,400
um okay i just wanted to add to uh what

1623
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,920
marco was saying i think

1624
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,319
it was a yeah it was a wonderful uh

1625
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:49,280
remark

1626
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,680
and i just wanted to because that also

1627
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,640
allows me to

1628
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,680
sort of like draw to highlight a point

1629
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,040
that we made in the paper

1630
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,640
that was also very fundamental and this

1631
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,680
is just that the fep in itself

1632
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,040
does not have to entail this table

1633
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,440
we can talk about the fep without

1634
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,280
talking about this table

1635
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,119
and that's a point that we try to make

1636
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,880
in the paper so this

1637
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,760
table only comes up as something that is

1638
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,520
relevant to us

1639
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,079
once we start talking about process

1640
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,079
theories or the corollary

1641
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:28,000
uh active inference because the fe

1642
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,119
p in itself uh comes from uh variational

1643
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:31,920
free energy

1644
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,000
which is a measure of the relational

1645
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,040
variation of

1646
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,760
uh free energy to attain model evidence

1647
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,079
in relational base

1648
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:41,760
so we don't have to talk about this

1649
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,280
table to talk about

1650
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,559
the fep okay and we don't even have to

1651
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:47,200
talk about

1652
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,760
active inference or process theories

1653
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,079
that's when we start talking about

1654
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,720
okay how is it that the system is

1655
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,599
minimizing free energy

1656
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:59,040
that's when we come up with these

1657
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,720
process theories

1658
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,200
to try to explain how is it that the

1659
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,079
system minimizes this free energy

1660
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:09,040
right and that's when we start bumping

1661
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,359
into these conceptualizations

1662
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:15,599
that um our explanations or our models

1663
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,000
that aim to explain the process by which

1664
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,559
the systems minimize free energy

1665
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:24,000
also exist in brain

1666
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,559
right so we don't have to take any

1667
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:28,319
really standard or any instrumentalist

1668
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:28,640
stand

1669
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,000
until we start talking about these

1670
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,119
process theories and i think that

1671
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:32,000
sometimes

1672
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,599
i think that it happens a lot that in

1673
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,280
the in the in the literature these

1674
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,079
things come

1675
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:39,359
conflated that the free energy principle

1676
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:41,839
necessarily entails active inference or

1677
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:44,160
necessarily entails or is compatible

1678
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,680
with process theories like prediction

1679
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,520
error minimization or predictive coding

1680
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,640
or protective process

1681
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,119
process and these are actually not

1682
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:52,640
there's no entailment

1683
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,040
between them as as we saw and as we as

1684
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,280
we try to point out in the paper

1685
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,640
if i could ask a question quick

1686
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,040
follow-up on that actually so

1687
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,920
let's say we're in the fep world then

1688
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,520
there's all these corollary process

1689
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,960
theories that are falsifiable we've

1690
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:07,839
talked about that

1691
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:10,559
um last week and in several other weeks

1692
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,960
what is it though that leads someone to

1693
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,280
accept or reject or be attracted or

1694
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,119
repulsed by the fep

1695
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:19,520
so within the fep we we know how to get

1696
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,960
from here to there and you're right

1697
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,319
there's no strict entailment

1698
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,160
it's actually a totally scientific

1699
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,839
empirical question

1700
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:29,280
but how do we get to that fep

1701
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,040
understanding that leads us to the

1702
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,400
downstream process theories

1703
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,520
um okay um i think that are i think that

1704
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,400
there are

1705
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,559
different goals and then at least for me

1706
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,000
it's useful for me to

1707
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
to to think about it like that so what

1708
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,680
we have what we gain

1709
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:49,359
we're talking about fep is that it gives

1710
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:49,839
us

1711
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:53,839
a much more sort of like a grasp or

1712
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:57,440
gets us closer to what things really are

1713
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,880
biologically speaking so what we get

1714
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,240
is we get these um these bounds between

1715
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:04,640
like

1716
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,160
life and death by the form of

1717
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,119
entropy so it is this key concept which

1718
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:13,440
is entropy that you do not get

1719
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,200
in process theories because precisely

1720
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,640
process theories are are

1721
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,720
in a different game they are in the game

1722
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,240
of uh explaining

1723
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,359
uh the processes by which uh cognition

1724
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:25,119
is is is an activity

1725
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:28,000
uh uh is conducted so it's the processes

1726
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,040
and the fep

1727
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,880
is on a different business which is the

1728
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,640
business of looking into stage that's

1729
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,240
why it comes much more related to

1730
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,960
dynamical systems theory

1731
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,440
so that's the point that we tried to

1732
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,160
make uh

1733
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,319
clear in the paper that it seems to us

1734
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:43,280
that comes

1735
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,839
very often conflated in the literature

1736
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,359
that there is an entailment i mean

1737
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:48,960
active inference is a corollary of the

1738
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,400
free energy principle

1739
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,760
so it is it is very important um

1740
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,720
precisely to tell us how it is that

1741
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,160
systems could be

1742
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,440
minimizing free energy

1743
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,640
but there is no necessarily entailment

1744
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,720
even though if you want to tell a

1745
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,880
much more detailed story then active

1746
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,599
inference becomes very useful

1747
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:14,559
thank you scott thomas anyone else who

1748
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:16,480
raises their hand

1749
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,839
thomas i think you had your hand up

1750
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:19,119
first is this something you want to jump

1751
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:21,839
in on

1752
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:28,960
no you okay you're meter thomas

1753
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:32,319
ah yeah my fault um unless you have

1754
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:33,359
something that's

1755
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,599
um not really related to the current

1756
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:37,359
conversation

1757
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:40,640
uh you can go first because um if it's

1758
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,480
related if it's related thomas go for it

1759
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,280
otherwise

1760
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,280
yeah yeah go for it um that i

1761
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,680
i noted some comments to a lot of the

1762
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,400
things people

1763
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,799
said uh um

1764
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:58,000
so regarding the question of what

1765
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,720
what we get from accepting the free

1766
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,319
energy principle

1767
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:05,810
um i'm honestly not very sure

1768
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:08,400
[Music]

1769
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,480
i'm still trying to figure that out and

1770
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,280
i'm i'm hoping we can get some

1771
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,559
very neat statistical models of

1772
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:19,920
behavioral dynamics

1773
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,119
and that we can somehow get a better

1774
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:23,599
grip

1775
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:28,960
on the patterns that we see

1776
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,240
um and then

1777
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:37,039
coming back to uh what uh marco said

1778
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:41,039
um if i understood

1779
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:44,079
um the story correctly

1780
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:47,280
by saying that um

1781
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,319
you know why not all of the options

1782
01:03:49,319 --> 01:03:50,880
simultaneously

1783
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,920
right so in some ways the model

1784
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,640
is a very neat description in another

1785
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,520
way

1786
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,559
the brain's model captures something is

1787
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:02,400
based on something real

1788
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:06,319
in the world um i think what happens

1789
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:07,760
there and this is this is something that

1790
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,760
i've seen in the literature as well

1791
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,640
um i don't remember who wrote about that

1792
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,280
but i've seen some people saying oh well

1793
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,039
you know it's the best of both worlds

1794
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:18,960
because we get both representationalism

1795
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,480
and activism

1796
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,559
um and i think the issue with that

1797
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:28,000
is that it assumes

1798
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,200
that realism is

1799
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:35,119
a valid position it assumes that

1800
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:39,680
we can talk about such a thing as a

1801
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:43,039
model in the brain in a non-metaphorical

1802
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:43,839
sense

1803
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:46,000
it assumes that there is a model in the

1804
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,119
brain

1805
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:49,760
which does or does not latch onto

1806
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,359
something real

1807
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:54,799
and i think in that sense um

1808
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:59,119
the way that you often see

1809
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:02,160
people talking in activism and the free

1810
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,160
energy principle

1811
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:08,079
together is by assuming realism

1812
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:12,319
and um ignoring the inactive criticisms

1813
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:16,000
of what realism entails um

1814
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,880
and it was the second point about

1815
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,280
whether we need to

1816
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,559
see representations as involving non

1817
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:27,680
evolving correctness conditions

1818
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:32,559
um i think that's a very fair point

1819
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:36,319
but my response to that would be

1820
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:39,680
that sort of comebacks comes back to our

1821
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,960
um talk about encoding decoding and

1822
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:46,160
language and being clear in general

1823
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:49,599
um we for

1824
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:52,880
the sake of our paper decided what

1825
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,920
we call representations involves

1826
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,000
correctness conditions

1827
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,960
um so if you have a different notion of

1828
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,240
representation

1829
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,920
that does not involve correctness

1830
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,400
conditions that's a totally different

1831
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:06,960
story

1832
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,160
and maybe those types of representations

1833
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,400
could be totally fine

1834
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,839
if all you mean with representation is a

1835
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:18,000
covariation relation between two

1836
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,599
different systems

1837
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:21,839
i'm not going to dispute whether that

1838
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:23,359
exists or not that seems

1839
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:28,319
fine but the problem is that

1840
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:31,319
if you are that liberal with what

1841
01:06:31,319 --> 01:06:32,799
representations

1842
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:36,480
mean um everyone's going to use them in

1843
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,160
different ways

1844
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,760
and you're going to get that

1845
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,799
we all use them but nobody really wants

1846
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:46,000
to talk about what they

1847
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,200
really mean and that's

1848
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,520
pretty pretty famously at least among

1849
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,039
philosophers

1850
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:56,480
described by bill ramsey in

1851
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:00,640
a 2007 book representations reconsidered

1852
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,160
i think it's called

1853
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:05,359
um so

1854
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:08,079
the reason to to say representations

1855
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:09,839
have correctness conditions is

1856
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:12,000
mostly just to get clear on the

1857
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,599
terminology

1858
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:16,160
right so just a signal of this is what

1859
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:16,799
we mean

1860
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:20,400
when we say representation and if your

1861
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,400
notion of representation does not have

1862
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,319
correctness conditions

1863
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:26,880
um that's something else to talk about

1864
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:27,680
and

1865
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,280
that's the another discussion is whether

1866
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,000
those are valid or not then

1867
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,160
thanks thomas and in an earlier

1868
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,680
discussion with um

1869
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,000
maxwell ramstad and others we had a

1870
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,119
conversation about how part of

1871
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:40,559
representations is that like

1872
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:42,400
they have to be able to be wrong or they

1873
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,920
have to be able to be off base otherwise

1874
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,280
they can't be on base

1875
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,440
we've so yes lots of other interesting

1876
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,319
work

1877
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:49,920
um scott if you would like and then

1878
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,799
stephen marco

1879
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:54,960
just said something going back to the

1880
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,480
earlier conversation

1881
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,599
it was when we were talking about the um

1882
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:02,319
the basically the again the ism schism

1883
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:03,680
and the ability to

1884
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,760
i'm staying with that and the ability to

1885
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,880
see inside another system

1886
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,720
and discern what was going on in the

1887
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,359
system it reminded me of the holographic

1888
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:14,000
principle

1889
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,839
and i started reading a paper another

1890
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:18,479
paper last night on why holography

1891
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:20,000
and it was just kind of an interesting

1892
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,920
notion that the markov blankets and the

1893
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,600
holographic principle bear

1894
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:28,000
a similarity in there's an opacity

1895
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,439
to them and so the internal states

1896
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:33,198
and the perception of those internal

1897
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:35,120
states from outside

1898
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:39,198
may be based on different isms

1899
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:41,279
and that's something that may not ever

1900
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:42,799
be um

1901
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:46,479
bridgeable i guess and it may not matter

1902
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,319
we're gonna talk to chris fields about

1903
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:50,399
holographs in march 2021

1904
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:52,080
right so coming up very soon thanks for

1905
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,439
this great point

1906
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:57,198
scott steven and marco

1907
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:01,679
yeah just to build on the um

1908
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,520
this idea that you go from free energy

1909
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,279
principle and then we go to this process

1910
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:07,439
theory so it's almost like at some point

1911
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:10,158
you've got to put dimensions on

1912
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:12,158
what's going on like there's an inside

1913
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:13,600
there's an outside there's

1914
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,399
so with active inference there's there's

1915
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:18,080
the idea that the stuff is going to go

1916
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,000
via the markov blanket and there's

1917
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,799
a way to know and that way of knowing

1918
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:23,279
it's

1919
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:26,560
still cut it's still to some extent

1920
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,839
dimensionless because um the

1921
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:32,880
there's there's no direct way to

1922
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,000
transmit

1923
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,560
the dimensional information it's only

1924
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,080
through this entropy

1925
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,600
and i know entropy is mentioned in the

1926
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,600
paper so i'm kind of interested in this

1927
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,880
idea of

1928
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,238
when you go from say

1929
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:49,839
the entropy in this kind of um

1930
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:52,640
general sort of non-dimensional sense

1931
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,198
it's just

1932
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:56,480
it's just a way of knowing um

1933
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,320
and then you've got this kind of high

1934
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,920
you talk about this idea of a low

1935
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,679
entropy state or high entry

1936
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:04,880
states but you've got this kind of this

1937
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,560
is sort of the jump between the two in a

1938
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:08,320
way where there's like how

1939
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,480
because with active inference it's the

1940
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,480
change in entropy

1941
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:15,280
which gives the way through the back

1942
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,560
door

1943
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,920
to encode knowledge so

1944
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,760
because it's through the change in

1945
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,120
entropy

1946
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,199
in relation to action in relation to

1947
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:26,800
sensorial data

1948
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,360
that you sort of somehow build up a

1949
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,640
dimensional

1950
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,440
understanding even if that understanding

1951
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,480
is only in the mind

1952
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,880
maybe not at the organism level so i

1953
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,000
suppose

1954
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,800
um i i think that may be what i know

1955
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,320
there's a new paper you brought out on

1956
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,440
skillful performance

1957
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,239
has just come out so maybe this is sort

1958
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:46,560
of

1959
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,880
opening up these other questions around

1960
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,199
entropy and

1961
01:10:50,199 --> 01:10:53,199
dimensionality and when you actually go

1962
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:56,320
from modeling changes to

1963
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:00,000
how do these changes

1964
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,960
relate to information or knowledge

1965
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,040
flowing or being generated

1966
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:08,320
you know from the blanket through to the

1967
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,040
generative model and the world yep

1968
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:11,679
stephen

1969
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:13,840
thanks a great point you're getting at

1970
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:14,880
this question which is

1971
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,040
how does the dimensionally compressed

1972
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,400
information from the world

1973
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,920
like a panorama that just presents

1974
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,000
itself get enriched through our

1975
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,840
experience and internal model

1976
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,199
into something that has what you're

1977
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:26,960
talking about is dimensionality

1978
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,560
and then it's a good question to ask how

1979
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,360
it relates to the

1980
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:33,520
thermostatistical lineage with entropy

1981
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,199
and some of these very pervasive

1982
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:37,120
top-level concepts so really well

1983
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:40,400
brought out marco

1984
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,760
um uh are you wondering um about about

1985
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:44,560
thomas's

1986
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:47,520
comments on my comments um if you could

1987
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,400
elaborate on

1988
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:51,840
first of all the um uh the criticism

1989
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:52,960
from an activism

1990
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,800
as he mentioned but but i would love to

1991
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,800
hear more about that especially

1992
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,840
in relation to um maxwell rancid another

1993
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,679
paper on an active tale of two densities

1994
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:05,120
um also about the correctness condition

1995
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,640
i understand that you have to choose a

1996
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,080
definition of representation

1997
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,159
and again i do understand that you have

1998
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,239
to respect the lineage in philosophy and

1999
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:12,719
what has

2000
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:15,360
been established as authoritative or

2001
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,239
conventional

2002
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:19,440
um but but um i i do

2003
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:23,120
believe that that there is a certain

2004
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,159
need i think

2005
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:26,239
to also revamp philosophy because i feel

2006
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,400
like there's always this kind of weird

2007
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,880
dynamic of like the two clubs in the

2008
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,080
school playground

2009
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,320
with euphosion science one is constantly

2010
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,920
trying to radically revolutionize the

2011
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:36,560
other

2012
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,040
but philosophy seems to be so stubborn

2013
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,960
in not allowing science to reflect

2014
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,120
to revolutionize them right they keep

2015
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,000
trying to

2016
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,239
the philosophers keep trying to you know

2017
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:47,199
to to to

2018
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:50,239
yank the rigid price out of the shell

2019
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:52,640
but vice versa somehow there seems to be

2020
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,480
no path we're not allowed to do that so

2021
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:54,880
so

2022
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,159
so for example why not let's this field

2023
01:12:58,159 --> 01:12:59,040
of science

2024
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,239
philosophy um gank that prior of

2025
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:03,360
representation having to have

2026
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,360
correctness conditions out of that shell

2027
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:06,719
because for example you can you can also

2028
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:08,320
just kind of play with it right not to

2029
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,360
correct his condition

2030
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,080
but uh saying that in the limit it

2031
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:12,640
should

2032
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:15,360
settle into correctness relation with

2033
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,159
the target

2034
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:17,520
as if it's kind of fixed point or

2035
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,679
attractive point right you can also say

2036
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:21,520
it's not a condition it's not a limit

2037
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,360
but it's a factor that contributes to

2038
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,440
that thing that we call representation

2039
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,960
right so so i think i would love to hear

2040
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,800
a discussion about that opening up the

2041
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,000
whole role

2042
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,679
rather than this essential property the

2043
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:35,600
role of the notion of correctness

2044
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,600
in relation to representations as

2045
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,360
situated in the world

2046
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,280
um and in turn i also want to again

2047
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,640
emphasize so

2048
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,520
even though that you're right in the

2049
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,280
difference between the coroner the many

2050
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:48,159
corollaries

2051
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:50,960
potential corollaries of fep versus fp

2052
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,000
itself where fap

2053
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,239
constrains a particular way we create

2054
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:55,440
process theories

2055
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,000
um and there's another thing that i

2056
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,080
think is not often enough

2057
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,760
talked about which is the kind of

2058
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,159
implied picture of sentient systems for

2059
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,800
example

2060
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,960
uh from fpp and its corollaries where we

2061
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,840
not often enough talk about the

2062
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:10,239
inter-relational

2063
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:12,960
um system the way that the systems

2064
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,800
incentive agents or complex systems

2065
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,400
relate to each other so it's more

2066
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,400
specifically for humans or

2067
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,080
us um we also self-model right

2068
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,840
and when we're self-modeling we need to

2069
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,440
model all the different structures we we

2070
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:25,920
possess

2071
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,800
and know what role they play in the big

2072
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,800
ecosystem that we are

2073
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,480
and so in the same way we can say that

2074
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,199
we in our self-modeling we also intuit

2075
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:36,000
or sense

2076
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,840
that some of those subsystems have a

2077
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,120
very instrumental

2078
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,199
right if for example you could say that

2079
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:42,960
the executive or

2080
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,120
attentional mechanisms of the prefrontal

2081
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,159
cortex

2082
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:48,719
is effectively instrumental and in a way

2083
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:50,000
realistic about itself

2084
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,320
but the fact that it has to organize

2085
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,600
regulate itself

2086
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,239
such that non let's say primary physical

2087
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:58,159
observables

2088
01:14:58,159 --> 01:14:59,920
needs to remain a certain bounds that

2089
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,679
seems to me instrumental because it

2090
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:03,040
doesn't matter if there really

2091
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:06,239
is some some quantity or some notion of

2092
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:07,040
stability

2093
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:09,120
of feeling good or feeling safe that

2094
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,159
doesn't matter

2095
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:12,640
right it's just settled in that way but

2096
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:13,760
at the same time

2097
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,159
if it does latch onto something real

2098
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:18,159
cool and maybe you can't elaborate upon

2099
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:18,800
it sorry yeah

2100
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,480
yeah it's all it's all good no you're

2101
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,760
bringing up okay so point one was

2102
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:22,480
related to

2103
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,960
inactive critiques point two was about

2104
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,400
correctness conditions moving beyond

2105
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:26,880
them

2106
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,719
point three is sentient systems so if we

2107
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:30,000
want a question that's answered let's

2108
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,440
just try to trace out the threads so

2109
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,320
that we can actually

2110
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,600
return to it because they're great

2111
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:36,800
points yeah it's great points marco

2112
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,679
is that good or is there more it's just

2113
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:40,800
what's the new ones the third point is

2114
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:41,440
more about

2115
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,360
in the process of self modeling we

2116
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,880
include the notion or

2117
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,199
or implicitly intuitive model of the

2118
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:48,000
notion of

2119
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,679
do these things have instrumental role

2120
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:51,040
or more of an epistemic

2121
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:54,239
realism right that that that way more

2122
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,440
that these theories are more about

2123
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,840
modeling processes of modeling

2124
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,600
rather than modeling essences and

2125
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,360
properties

2126
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:04,480
yes the relational all the way down type

2127
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,000
thinking so thanks marco really

2128
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,360
three sides of a very nuanced

2129
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,560
discussion and an ongoing questions so

2130
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,560
thomas than anyone else who wants to

2131
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:17,120
raise your hand

2132
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:22,080
yeah thanks for that um

2133
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:25,360
so i'm not sure i completely follow

2134
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,000
everything

2135
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,520
so um if i get it wrong just

2136
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:34,400
interrupt me and um let me know um

2137
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,760
so i think you mentioned

2138
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,960
um regulation like bodily regulation

2139
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,320
as a form of self-modeling right

2140
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:48,480
um so i think that

2141
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:53,520
accepting that bodily regulation

2142
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,719
is a form of self-modeling

2143
01:16:56,719 --> 01:17:00,880
is assuming the realist position

2144
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:06,000
the there is a clear effect that

2145
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,840
we see biological organisms

2146
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:11,040
self-regulate

2147
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:14,960
whether they do that by

2148
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,960
exploiting an internal model

2149
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,960
is another question entirely

2150
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,280
and that's exactly sort of the

2151
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,280
distinction between instrumentalism and

2152
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,640
realism

2153
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:32,800
that the paper tries to tease apart

2154
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,719
so it's almost that when you mentioned

2155
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:36,239
the um modeling

2156
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:37,760
the process of modeling is the

2157
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,400
instrumentalist side on marco's

2158
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,400
way of phrasing the third part and then

2159
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,080
the question about essences is the

2160
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:44,640
realist

2161
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,320
question so the movement towards

2162
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,480
instrumentalism is related to this

2163
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,360
relational

2164
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:52,960
insight so i think

2165
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,040
the issue is i didn't exactly get the

2166
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,880
relational insight

2167
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,480
that's the part that was a little fuzzy

2168
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,080
for me and i wasn't sure exactly what it

2169
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,520
was getting to yeah marco

2170
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,960
where do you see that relational just

2171
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,239
because it's something that comes up and

2172
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:06,080
and um it does sort of

2173
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:09,199
cross different idea or debates to

2174
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:10,400
so what does that mean to you or how

2175
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,239
does it play out here yeah so

2176
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:14,880
thanks so so often when we when you see

2177
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,480
literature on academics or friendship

2178
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:17,120
principle

2179
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,120
uh there's always a centerpiece of a

2180
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:21,760
market centerpiece of a certain system

2181
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,560
slash agents but the very rare one

2182
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,880
figure one

2183
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,320
i'm showing figure one just if you want

2184
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,239
to refer to this

2185
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:33,360
oh yeah exactly so it's always this but

2186
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,159
it's never

2187
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:36,480
this with another one that's like this

2188
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,360
it's very rare

2189
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:39,440
let me just see market blankets uh

2190
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,480
supplies or

2191
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,239
markup lengths of live paper that that

2192
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:43,840
does go into it but

2193
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,960
but very little and start the shockingly

2194
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,520
like these kind of philosophical papers

2195
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,080
um is there actually talk about um how

2196
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,760
market blankets interact with each other

2197
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,120
and the reflective of the mutual

2198
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,000
influence

2199
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,679
because in that process of mutual

2200
01:18:57,679 --> 01:18:59,679
influence how do you actually

2201
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:02,000
do that right how do you model the other

2202
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,080
models that you possess or are

2203
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,320
right you're not just it's not just in

2204
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,320
terms of properties as such it's also

2205
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,360
about the role they have

2206
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,520
the bigger inferential ecosystem but i

2207
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,280
guess maybe that that requires a leap of

2208
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,960
faith in active influence first right

2209
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,560
if you already assume that the dynamics

2210
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,400
are governed by inferential imperatives

2211
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,960
then you also have a small step to

2212
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,320
believing that

2213
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,080
in modeling each other they also need to

2214
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,360
model each other's inferential

2215
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,560
contributions

2216
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,640
which where we go again back to the

2217
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:29,600
decomposition

2218
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,480
of free energy principle uh formulation

2219
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,239
in terms of epistemic and pragmatic or

2220
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:35,600
the accuracy of complex

2221
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,600
right maybe one mode of engaging with

2222
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:38,719
the world

2223
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:41,280
or incorporating one particular set of

2224
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:41,920
systems

2225
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,000
of your total constitution will lead to

2226
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,120
more instrumentalist

2227
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,840
approach right when you're just um

2228
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,920
instrumentally engaging with something

2229
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,360
not assuming you have a correct view of

2230
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,000
something

2231
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,920
when you have a new game or some weird

2232
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,280
object you don't know what the hell it

2233
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:55,760
is

2234
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:58,080
you're not gonna engage with it based on

2235
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,760
a realist assumption

2236
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,040
you're gonna engage with it based on

2237
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,480
idea of i'm gonna figure out how to

2238
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,239
manipulate it i'm going to find all the

2239
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:06,320
instrumental points of latching onto it

2240
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:09,040
right and so no matter what you you

2241
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,080
cannot escape

2242
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:13,120
the the fuzziness or the vagueness or

2243
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,080
the fluidity

2244
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,639
of these so seeming dichotomies in my

2245
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:17,440
opinion

2246
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:19,679
and that's the relational aspect right

2247
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:20,800
that in terms

2248
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:23,360
of modeling and its many facets you need

2249
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,639
to understand the relations of these

2250
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:26,480
different systems as yourself model

2251
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,080
especially if you're extremely complex

2252
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,559
with humans

2253
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:34,080
playfulness human as a curious

2254
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:37,120
investigator playful insight

2255
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,520
relational thinking and a very something

2256
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:40,960
that kind of is personal

2257
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,679
and almost distinct from philosophy and

2258
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:44,480
or science

2259
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,480
it's the personal which is we're really

2260
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,560
studying this and we're people who have

2261
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:49,440
certain

2262
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,840
um valences towards different modes so

2263
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:52,880
pretty interesting

2264
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:56,320
um thomas in us

2265
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,040
yeah um so i think i think that's a very

2266
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,080
interesting

2267
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:03,440
question um and

2268
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:06,159
whether we approach something from an

2269
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:08,480
instrumentalist or realist perspective

2270
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:11,679
um but i think still

2271
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:14,719
that all i mean i might be way off base

2272
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:15,360
here but

2273
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,000
from what i hear it sounds like it's all

2274
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:18,800
still

2275
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:22,480
within the realm of realism and only

2276
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,239
when you

2277
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:28,800
take us to be

2278
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:33,360
modeling at all

2279
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,520
can you say about can you talk start

2280
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:36,400
talking about

2281
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:39,120
whether that modeling is instrumental is

2282
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,320
the realist

2283
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:43,840
so the instrumentalist position

2284
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:47,440
that um we defend in the paper is one in

2285
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,159
which we

2286
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:51,360
only model when we

2287
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,960
literally do so in the world when

2288
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,520
you're using your computer ram to start

2289
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:58,719
up a model

2290
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:01,840
or when you're drawing a diagram

2291
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:06,639
of when you're literally making models

2292
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:09,760
in any other sort of

2293
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,840
activity that you're doing you're not

2294
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,199
modeling

2295
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:16,560
you're doing the activity so

2296
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,120
in picking up a cup i am not modeling

2297
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:19,840
the cup

2298
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,960
when i'm not in any sense

2299
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:25,520
models are not relevant there i'm

2300
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,520
picking up a cup

2301
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,560
um and then

2302
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:32,480
i think the other point you made a

2303
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,080
little earlier

2304
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,840
about the interaction of science and

2305
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:38,639
philosophy and

2306
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:40,800
that it seems that philosophers are

2307
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,639
always trying to revolutionize science

2308
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:43,840
and science is not allowed to

2309
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,760
revolutionize philosophy

2310
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:48,800
um i think that's a fun point as a

2311
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:49,920
philosopher

2312
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:54,560
um but i think that

2313
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:59,840
i think that with the popularity of

2314
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,120
predictive processing

2315
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:05,520
and active inference in philosophy

2316
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:09,080
you see where science really is

2317
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:12,080
revolutionizing philosophy as well

2318
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:13,679
and i think especially in philosophy of

2319
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:15,679
cognitive science

2320
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:18,000
there's always going to be a

2321
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,320
bidirectional interplay

2322
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:24,239
um i wouldn't have been sitting here if

2323
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:26,320
it were not for the influence that

2324
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,320
science is having on philosophy of

2325
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:31,120
course i'm delving with

2326
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:35,040
into all of this um and then when you're

2327
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,760
talking specifically about the notion of

2328
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,639
representations

2329
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:40,960
um

2330
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:48,000
if scientific endeavors could make it

2331
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,040
extremely plausible to throw away the

2332
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:52,719
correctness conditions for

2333
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:54,960
uh representations then maybe that is

2334
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,639
something we need to

2335
01:23:56,639 --> 01:24:00,800
accept but the issue is that

2336
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:04,000
i think anyway just at first glance so

2337
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,840
representations are

2338
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:09,199
it's a word we use also outside of

2339
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:12,800
science right a picture that i draw as a

2340
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,840
representation of whatever it is a fancy

2341
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:17,199
drawing

2342
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:19,600
and there are certain features of the

2343
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,639
picture that i drew

2344
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:26,080
that are particularly relevant

2345
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,480
in making that picture a representation

2346
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,760
of whatever it is i drew

2347
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:34,320
now when you want to use that same word

2348
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:35,760
in science

2349
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,360
you might just say well none of that is

2350
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,840
important and

2351
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:43,040
we're going to drop some of the very

2352
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:46,560
important features of the picture and

2353
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,960
use it very differently in our science

2354
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,480
jargon

2355
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:53,840
that's fine but

2356
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:59,360
it's a little difficult to deal with um

2357
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,960
when we already have a notion of

2358
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:03,199
representation and what representations

2359
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:06,560
are in um just the regular

2360
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,920
dealings in the world but

2361
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:13,520
you could technically say sure you know

2362
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,679
we'll call it something else but it's

2363
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:17,600
something that we'll have to

2364
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,239
all agree on and then be clear about

2365
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:23,360
what that means or not

2366
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,760
thank you thomas so s and then anyone

2367
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,120
else so we have like little you know

2368
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,239
half an hour or so

2369
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:31,440
left so keep any thoughts prepare them

2370
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:32,800
get ready we can flip around to

2371
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,639
different slides in s then markup

2372
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:39,520
um yeah i just wanted to uh i first

2373
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:40,480
wanted to say the

2374
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,120
great points uh thomas uh yeah uh that's

2375
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,320
precisely what i'm gonna

2376
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,400
sort of like uh expand or try to explain

2377
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:47,679
a little bit on

2378
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:50,000
there's there's a a lot that that i'd

2379
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,639
like to say but let me just um

2380
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:55,360
go back to the self-modeling point as

2381
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:56,880
the bodily regulation

2382
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:59,600
so i'm really struggling to to

2383
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:00,400
understand

2384
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,600
what this means and the reason

2385
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:06,400
for that is because we need to motivate

2386
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:06,880
why

2387
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:10,239
would the body have to model itself

2388
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:14,159
so typically one starts this modeling um

2389
01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:17,679
sort of like um endeavor when we do not

2390
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:18,320
have

2391
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,880
direct access to things so we wonder

2392
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:21,440
about

2393
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,239
um what could be you know causes so i

2394
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:24,880
wonder

2395
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,600
why i'm really struggling to understand

2396
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:28,480
what this self

2397
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:31,600
modeling is because uh in terms of body

2398
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,159
bodily regulation because what is it

2399
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:34,719
that the

2400
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:38,880
body needs to model really because um

2401
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,639
we start modeling we want to model

2402
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:42,719
things when we don't have access to

2403
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:45,600
a true posterior when we do not have the

2404
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,679
causes so we need to find the posterior

2405
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:50,719
right but the so the self modeling seems

2406
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:52,080
like a little bit counterintuitive

2407
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,040
because

2408
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,280
it's it's the self that is right there

2409
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,880
so the body is right there so it's

2410
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:59,280
it sounds very counterintuitive to me to

2411
01:26:59,280 --> 01:26:59,920
think that

2412
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,320
that that should need any kind of like

2413
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,000
internal modeling um

2414
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,120
in in in the body um

2415
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,960
so the other point that i wanted to uh

2416
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,560
get back to uh was

2417
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,239
marco's point because marco seems to be

2418
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:14,960
like a little bit like worried about

2419
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,440
um you know the lack if i understood it

2420
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,880
correctly the lack of

2421
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:22,800
um having sort of like a a program or a

2422
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:23,920
framework

2423
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,120
that would allow us to get like things

2424
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,360
um an explanation there would be like

2425
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:30,800
much more relational

2426
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,440
all the way down um and how would we

2427
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,520
like link all of this together

2428
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,679
and then that's what when we came to to

2429
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:38,880
this slide i think

2430
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,480
so i just wanted to say like a few words

2431
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:43,440
on that i want to say that the

2432
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,920
okay so that the cool thing about macro

2433
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,639
blankets

2434
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:49,360
as we know is that uh well we can apply

2435
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:49,760
them

2436
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,840
uh regardless of the scale you can apply

2437
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,360
them to any scale

2438
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,520
and you can nest them and i think that

2439
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,880
this is something that

2440
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,040
um marco could be like a little bit

2441
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,440
worried about and

2442
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:02,960
perhaps this is not going to be you know

2443
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,719
the solution for what it was it was

2444
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:05,280
mentioning

2445
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,520
but maybe to get us like stuff in the

2446
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:08,480
direction so

2447
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:12,400
the idea is that um with markov blankets

2448
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,960
we um actually understand the relations

2449
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:15,760
between

2450
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:18,600
different aspects and levels of uh

2451
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,080
neurophysiology

2452
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:23,840
um as being uh uh together relate

2453
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,800
related in a multi-scale kind of system

2454
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,000
so basically the idea

2455
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,080
is that you can use a markup blanket to

2456
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,000
zoom into the level of description that

2457
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,040
you want to

2458
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,360
investigate but without losing sight

2459
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:36,880
that this particular level

2460
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,920
is already embedded in a multi-scale

2461
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:43,120
level uh system right so

2462
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:46,159
then this allows us to uh zoom in

2463
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:48,800
um up and down for example within the

2464
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:49,360
brain and

2465
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:52,000
uh that's a paper that i have um is

2466
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:52,880
going to be out soon

2467
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:55,760
so it allows us to zoom in and to zoom

2468
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:56,000
up

2469
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,679
and down in the brain but it also allows

2470
01:28:57,679 --> 01:28:59,840
us to zoom uh out to the organism and

2471
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,520
then get also the organism

2472
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,920
um in the environment so that's the a

2473
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,760
nice thing that we can do with the

2474
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:08,480
with the markov blankets where obviously

2475
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:09,920
the internal states and the active

2476
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,440
states are going to correspond to the

2477
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:13,040
level of description that we want to

2478
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:13,920
look at

2479
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,239
and then obviously we are going to look

2480
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:18,320
at the embeddedness of this system

2481
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,000
within its environment because its

2482
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,440
environment is going to be the external

2483
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:22,000
states

2484
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,199
and the sensory states so that's the

2485
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:26,560
cool thing that we can do with markov

2486
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:27,360
blankets is that

2487
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:31,120
it allows us to zoom in and out um um

2488
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:33,760
and up and down in a multi-scale uh

2489
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,520
system

2490
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:38,960
thanks yes great points and i think for

2491
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,239
this zooming in and out

2492
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:42,880
seems very relevant to a lot of our work

2493
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,320
and a lot of what's in the cutting edge

2494
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,080
so maybe we can have like a workshop or

2495
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:46,880
a

2496
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:48,400
panel or something like that or some

2497
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,480
we'll see it later but this is really

2498
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:51,520
interesting stuff

2499
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,920
so again maybe you know 20 30 minutes so

2500
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:54,800
if anyone has

2501
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:57,199
live chat comments marco then anyone

2502
01:29:57,199 --> 01:29:57,920
else who uh

2503
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,520
then stephen and then anyone else who

2504
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,960
raises their hand and then scott

2505
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:06,159
thanks um so she want to go back to uh

2506
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:08,400
models and multiple levels of skills and

2507
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:09,600
stuff so

2508
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,760
so um uh thomas says something about

2509
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:12,639
you're not modeling

2510
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:15,040
uh something you're just doing right um

2511
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:15,920
and i agree

2512
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:19,040
again like i said uh my my claim is that

2513
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,000
that that it

2514
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,920
varies over the situation context so

2515
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:23,360
again that's why i argue that you need

2516
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,280
to zoom out to taking the relation

2517
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,280
so if you take the paper um on active

2518
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,199
infinite curiosity with the

2519
01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:30,560
with the games right so first you're

2520
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,639
exploring you're just doing the game

2521
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:34,400
you're kind of allowing the statistical

2522
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,880
patterns as are impinged upon you

2523
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:39,520
to kind of accumulate shape and adjust

2524
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:40,639
each other etc

2525
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:42,080
and indeed at that point you're just

2526
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:44,400
doing and you're just at the emergency

2527
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,960
co-variation of relations etc but at a

2528
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:47,679
certain point

2529
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:50,480
there's some kind of transition you have

2530
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:51,920
a moment of insight

2531
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:55,360
the model sorry the let's say

2532
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:58,400
the picture more naive because in sense

2533
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,960
of the game kind of arises into your

2534
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:01,760
awareness as

2535
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:04,480
a complete picture and at that point

2536
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:05,199
you're able

2537
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:08,000
to at least hypothetically write down

2538
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,679
the model that you think that the game

2539
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:10,719
is governed by

2540
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:13,120
right and so you said something like

2541
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:15,120
we're only modeling when we're doing the

2542
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:16,000
computer thing

2543
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,760
and claiming that this is going to be a

2544
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,600
rotational model of the environment

2545
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,840
but the thing is what what's the chicken

2546
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:22,719
in the egg

2547
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:24,320
right if you're doing that game you're

2548
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:26,239
at the mercy of the patterns

2549
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:29,040
and then you obtain this internal

2550
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,400
understanding of how the model looks

2551
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:31,600
that allows you

2552
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,600
to create a computational model that

2553
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,199
means that the point where the model is

2554
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:36,639
substantiated is actually

2555
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:38,560
in the agent itself right and so that's

2556
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,080
why i talk about the relational thing

2557
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:40,719
and the and

2558
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:42,719
the sound regulation when you add a

2559
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:45,280
system are able to model yourself

2560
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,880
then you have different orders of that

2561
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,639
model the moment that it's just

2562
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:51,040
intuition just you're guided by the

2563
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,239
variational patterns

2564
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:54,239
just letting that be latched onto your

2565
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:55,679
actions and policy selection

2566
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:57,120
yeah it's not really maybe just maybe

2567
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:59,040
it's not the model then but the moment

2568
01:31:59,040 --> 01:31:59,440
that

2569
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:02,080
at this level above you're able to say

2570
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:02,639
that this

2571
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:06,000
is a model of that and this is the the

2572
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,679
systemic relation pragmatic relation

2573
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:09,280
then i think we should be able to say

2574
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:10,080
that's proper

2575
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:13,040
and model proper right and another thing

2576
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:13,920
so something

2577
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:16,239
thomas said about uh when science allows

2578
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:17,600
us to throw away the correctness

2579
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,239
condition

2580
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:20,400
i think we have that in psychology and

2581
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:21,280
in social as

2582
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:23,600
social psychology a lot of people can

2583
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:25,440
develop an understanding or a model or a

2584
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,320
stage of the world

2585
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:27,920
that is actually not governed by correct

2586
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:30,239
conditions if you i don't get political

2587
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:31,040
but you know

2588
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:32,480
you see in certain political areas where

2589
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,159
people seem to be governed not by

2590
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:35,440
truth conditions but more about

2591
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:37,600
pragmatic conditions right

2592
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:40,800
but which beliefs if adopted or which

2593
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,719
ideologies if adopted

2594
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:45,360
will i be better off in the world right

2595
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:46,960
that is not a correctness condition

2596
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:47,360
that's

2597
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,679
that is taking instrumentalist or

2598
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:52,159
pragmatic primacy for the sake of

2599
01:32:52,159 --> 01:32:55,520
your fundamental imperative of autocracy

2600
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:55,920
sort

2601
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:59,120
self-preservation etc um

2602
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:02,159
and so and and and and uh in this

2603
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:04,719
uh point about non-direct access so yeah

2604
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:06,560
we're oneself but it's most level motor

2605
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:07,199
skill

2606
01:33:07,199 --> 01:33:09,199
so there remains inferential distance

2607
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:10,880
between the locus of certain areas of

2608
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:12,639
yourself and other loca

2609
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:14,639
of yourself so the hypothalamus is

2610
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:16,719
crucial in in self-regulation in terms

2611
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:18,400
of guiding the

2612
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:20,719
endocrine system but obviously it's

2613
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:22,800
distant from the actual systems

2614
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:26,000
that is supposed in relation to right so

2615
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,920
there it needs to be an acknowledgement

2616
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:29,280
of the inferential relations and

2617
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:30,880
infrastructure distances

2618
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,360
by which the self as a whole learns to

2619
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,040
regulate itself

2620
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:38,560
um uh yeah i just

2621
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:41,040
leave it at that great thank you so in

2622
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:42,400
the last little bit let's

2623
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,800
think about tying threads up and

2624
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:45,679
phrasing things as

2625
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:47,199
what we wanted no it's great marco you

2626
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:48,719
did good

2627
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:50,639
and exploring what we want to do next

2628
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:52,480
week so we're raising questions to think

2629
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,280
about

2630
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:56,080
and for next week as we tie up some of

2631
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:57,280
these really awesome

2632
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:00,400
threads so stephen scott

2633
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:04,159
in s thomas

2634
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:07,199
nice um so

2635
01:34:07,199 --> 01:34:09,120
well i just wanted to sort of add on to

2636
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:10,320
this um

2637
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:11,600
or sort of maybe this is something that

2638
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,920
could come back to um

2639
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:16,400
this idea of representation i suppose it

2640
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:17,360
is ultimately

2641
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,560
seen as something that's in the brain

2642
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:24,080
and a model is also sometimes

2643
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:25,840
this is maybe where we get a problem is

2644
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,520
we kind of have this

2645
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:29,360
folk psychology that models are in the

2646
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:30,560
brain as well

2647
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:34,000
so if i think if we were to say models

2648
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,239
are in our niche so if we say we take

2649
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:37,840
this figure one

2650
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:42,080
the model is something we create in our

2651
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:45,199
external states in our niche that we

2652
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:47,199
work with and i have tools and we

2653
01:34:47,199 --> 01:34:49,679
manipulate out there

2654
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:53,280
and we engage with our active state

2655
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:55,520
sensory states internal states to work

2656
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:56,880
with

2657
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:00,000
um it can get rid of uh

2658
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,119
it helps to sort of um get around some

2659
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:03,679
of these

2660
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:05,920
challenges um and i think because i

2661
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,040
think that that is

2662
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:09,679
um the nature i think this is really

2663
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:11,280
useful thinking about correctness and

2664
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,520
accuracy of a model

2665
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:16,639
is when can that

2666
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:20,400
need for directness and accuracy be

2667
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:24,159
um loosen someone um

2668
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:25,600
because it might be that you don't have

2669
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,760
to model the body doesn't have to model

2670
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:29,920
its active states or model its sensory

2671
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:30,800
states or

2672
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:34,320
model those exactly but it's somehow

2673
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:36,639
using something like them

2674
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:39,119
and there's some sort of bigger model

2675
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:41,119
which we can try to use as a tool to

2676
01:35:41,119 --> 01:35:43,280
understand what that aggregates to so i

2677
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,239
think

2678
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:46,639
this is actually maybe opening up quite

2679
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:47,360
a

2680
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:50,719
rich thread thanks

01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,880
unraised skip excuse me thank you scott

2683
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:57,119
and

2684
01:35:57,119 --> 01:36:00,000
s thomas shannon

2685
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:05,440
okay so um i just um i think that uh

2686
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:07,280
it's important the question that um

2687
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:09,440
marco was rating so i just wanted to

2688
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:11,119
sort of highlight that and just like

2689
01:36:11,119 --> 01:36:13,119
sort of gesture to it for the next

2690
01:36:13,119 --> 01:36:13,840
session

2691
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,080
um so i think that uh marco was

2692
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:17,360
mentioning um

2693
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:20,480
this important self-regulation aspect um

2694
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,400
and i wonder and this is like a very

2695
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,159
embodied kind of thing it's not you know

2696
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:26,080
available to our conscious level so we

2697
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,679
don't know what's happening so it's not

2698
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:29,040
available to conscious

2699
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,400
consciousness and i was trying to

2700
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,400
dispute that idea that it needs to be

2701
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:33,920
to entail some kind of like modeling

2702
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,320
aspects because for us to you know

2703
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,080
for you to tell modeling aspects it's

2704
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:39,920
because there is not a direct access to

2705
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:41,199
the body

2706
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:43,040
and i think that one follow-up question

2707
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:45,360
to that would be to think about

2708
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:47,679
what self-modeling would mean on a

2709
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:48,639
conscious level

2710
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:50,639
do we ever do that do we need to

2711
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:52,560
self-model on a conscious level

2712
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,639
right because if we do then perhaps

2713
01:36:54,639 --> 01:36:56,080
there is like a sort of like a barrier

2714
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:56,560
between

2715
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,719
the self and what i think so it's kind

2716
01:36:58,719 --> 01:36:59,840
of weird so i would

2717
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:01,840
really like to discuss that um with

2718
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:03,280
everyone and

2719
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,280
um yeah and the other question that i

2720
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,520
think that would be nice to discuss next

2721
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:10,400
week is to actually get down to the

2722
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,360
nitty-gritty

2723
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:14,239
to the detailed technical details um

2724
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:15,520
that would allow us

2725
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:17,280
potentially to think these things are

2726
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:18,960
what thomas and i had in mind in the

2727
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:19,600
paper

2728
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:22,639
which is whether from the fact that

2729
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:26,000
we can be trained uh to use for example

2730
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,280
variational uh

2731
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:30,560
base to uh attain likelihood

2732
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:32,639
of uh model evidence which is like what

2733
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:34,719
we do vision inference and modeling

2734
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:36,800
that kind of thing and also from the

2735
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:37,760
fact that

2736
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:40,320
we as human beings in our daily life we

2737
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,159
can think and engage in sort of like

2738
01:37:42,159 --> 01:37:43,840
abductive reasoning to

2739
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:47,119
wonder and make inferences about what

2740
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:49,280
what we think is the most likely case of

2741
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,880
things around us

2742
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,639
from the fact that we as scientists can

2743
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:54,080
do that and we as you know

2744
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:56,320
regular people in daily life can do that

2745
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,320
does it follow that the nervous system

2746
01:37:58,320 --> 01:37:58,800
itself

2747
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:01,920
or the body itself does that and engage

2748
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:04,320
in those kind of like tools

2749
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:06,800
so those would be mine yeah nice i'm

2750
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,719
already capturing them on a slide so

2751
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:10,159
we're definitely going to get to them

2752
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:10,960
ines

2753
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:14,239
thomas shannon marco oh sorry yeah

2754
01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:17,840
thomas shannon market yeah thanks

2755
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:18,240
um

2756
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:21,349
[Music]

2757
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:24,960
i have a lot in answer uh to what marco

2758
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:25,840
was saying so

2759
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:28,880
i'll try to slim that down

2760
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:31,920
um as a very

2761
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:35,440
quick probably not to um

2762
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:37,199
convince you but just as a description

2763
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:39,119
of how i would see things

2764
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:41,520
um if you're playing a game and at some

2765
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:43,119
point you figured out

2766
01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:46,080
the patterns of the game and you're able

2767
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,080
to make a model of it

2768
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:50,000
i would say where the model is

2769
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,760
instantiated

2770
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:55,760
is when you draw the model out

2771
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:59,199
that drawing you made the description of

2772
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:00,320
the patterns

2773
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:03,520
is the model and when you're producing

2774
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,760
that drawing that you can share with

2775
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:06,880
other people that other people have

2776
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:07,679
access to

2777
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:12,320
you are modeling um

2778
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:15,280
any other modeling models are never in

2779
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:16,159
the brain

2780
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:19,600
models are never in the head models

2781
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:23,040
are in the world

2782
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,800
in our interaction with the world and

2783
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,159
only exist because

2784
01:39:26,159 --> 01:39:28,560
of our social cultural heritage in which

2785
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:30,560
we have learned to use models

2786
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:33,600
sort of what ines was getting to as well

2787
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:36,480
um and then when you say when you're

2788
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:38,480
talking about

2789
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,800
some people being led not by correctness

2790
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,320
conditions

2791
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:45,600
um i think that's that's very fair and i

2792
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:46,000
think

2793
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,280
none of us are generally led by

2794
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:51,280
correctness conditions in most of what

2795
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:54,239
we do except for science when we

2796
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:57,679
give it our best shot um

2797
01:39:57,679 --> 01:40:00,080
we're just doing stuff but the most

2798
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:01,280
important thing there

2799
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:04,639
is not whether that means then that we

2800
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:05,679
need to

2801
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:08,960
change representation for it to mean

2802
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:10,560
something not involving correctness

2803
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:11,920
conditions

2804
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:14,800
but maybe that means that the notion of

2805
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:15,840
representation

2806
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:19,280
isn't really applicable here and

2807
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:21,440
instead of changing the words we use we

2808
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:22,560
just use a word

2809
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:25,920
that is more appropriate to what people

2810
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:28,000
are really latching on to

2811
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,360
and i think that'll be just

2812
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:32,000
communicatively maybe an easier strategy

2813
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
instead of continuously changing the

2814
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,360
word to fit

2815
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:37,040
our current understanding and just sort

2816
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:38,719
of come up with a different word that

2817
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:41,360
gets better

2818
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:45,280
some deo logisms and also our growing

2819
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:47,199
terms list

2820
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:51,440
shannon then

2821
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:54,639
um thanks for all of that discussion

2822
01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:58,000
i'm wondering if in search of terms that

2823
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,639
would better fit our description is the

2824
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:01,159
term

2825
01:41:01,159 --> 01:41:04,159
expectation more

2826
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:07,679
or less vague than saying representation

2827
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:10,960
or a model and what i'm thinking of

2828
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:14,159
is when you're standing your body has a

2829
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:16,000
certain expectation that you'll remain

2830
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,360
standing

2831
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:21,040
if you're standing in a room you expect

2832
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,520
like you at a conscious level maybe

2833
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:25,520
expect to stay standing but also

2834
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:27,520
um you know your cerebellum and muscles

2835
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:29,600
and your trunk are expecting to

2836
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:32,320
be in a certain relation to each other

2837
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:34,000
because the ground's not moving

2838
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,199
so they're just maintaining you know

2839
01:41:35,199 --> 01:41:37,199
some standard standing posture maybe a

2840
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:38,960
little bit of

2841
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:42,159
balance side to side if you

2842
01:41:42,159 --> 01:41:43,520
feel like you're standing still on a

2843
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:46,320
train and then the train starts moving

2844
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:48,000
when your expectation was to stand up

2845
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,760
straight now you've

2846
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:52,480
have a deviation from that expectation

2847
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:54,800
your cerebellum your motor cortex all of

2848
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:57,040
the muscles in your trunk and your legs

2849
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:58,639
react or

2850
01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:00,400
predict that they should have been

2851
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:01,840
standing upright

2852
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:03,360
predict that they should have been in a

2853
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:04,719
certain relation to each other stand up

2854
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:05,600
right

2855
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:08,800
and they either update that prediction

2856
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:13,040
or they act to change the world so in

2857
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:14,800
if it acting to change the world then

2858
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,239
all of your muscles will

2859
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:17,840
tense up in a different way to keep

2860
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:20,080
yourself standing upright

2861
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,239
if they're just accepting the prediction

2862
01:42:22,239 --> 01:42:24,080
that you shouldn't be standing already

2863
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:28,000
you'll fall over and i just wonder

2864
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,880
is it helpful to say that your body has

2865
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:33,119
a model of standing

2866
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:35,119
or like an s says your body just is in

2867
01:42:35,119 --> 01:42:37,280
direct access to itself

2868
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:39,760
so even if there's an expectation of

2869
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:41,360
standing upright

2870
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:45,199
there's still

2871
01:42:46,239 --> 01:42:47,760
like maybe it doesn't help to call it a

2872
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:49,679
model but there could be correctness

2873
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:51,440
conditions in that case if you called it

2874
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:52,880
a model and

2875
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:54,880
like if you're so far out if you're so

2876
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:56,159
far out of allostasis

2877
01:42:56,159 --> 01:42:58,159
right then you're in an incorrect

2878
01:42:58,159 --> 01:43:00,080
correct correctness condition for

2879
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:00,960
standing

2880
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:03,280
and so to respond to that perturbation

2881
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:05,520
is to bring it back to that

2882
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:07,600
that correctness condition and i don't

2883
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:08,639
know i don't know

2884
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:10,800
i guess does expectation help or is that

2885
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:11,920
just even more vague

2886
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:14,239
than saying that you have your body has

2887
01:43:14,239 --> 01:43:17,040
a model of itself

2888
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:21,679
fun thanks shannon uh marco and s

2889
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:24,320
yeah actually um what channel says very

2890
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:25,280
nice because

2891
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:27,119
i think again that re-emphasizes the

2892
01:43:27,119 --> 01:43:28,400
importance of

2893
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:30,320
of distinguishing the kind of

2894
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,080
operational constituents

2895
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:34,560
of how models play a role in agents so

2896
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:36,000
what she was describing seems to me like

2897
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:36,800
the interaction

2898
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:40,320
of of um how the uh

2899
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:43,440
afferent and efferent expectations and

2900
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:45,199
data have to interact and that indeed i

2901
01:43:45,199 --> 01:43:46,239
agree that that doesn't have to be

2902
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:47,199
called a model

2903
01:43:47,199 --> 01:43:50,400
i would just see that as um the element

2904
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:51,360
or the operation

2905
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:54,400
of inferential interactions right and

2906
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,960
and kind of a zeroth order or a proto

2907
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:58,159
model maybe

2908
01:43:58,159 --> 01:44:01,280
but again um it's on top of that when

2909
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:01,920
you have the

2910
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:03,600
kind of order above that where i think

2911
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:05,040
you would have to say that

2912
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:06,719
there is a model because then there's

2913
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:08,719
also the modeling of how these infrared

2914
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:10,000
constituents

2915
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,679
relate to the world that has the model

2916
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:13,119
be modeled too

2917
01:44:13,119 --> 01:44:15,440
uh for example sometimes we interact

2918
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:16,320
with the world

2919
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,320
in weird ways and we notice it and we

2920
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:20,000
have to actively reflect about how

2921
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,199
we were guided by our actions i mean

2922
01:44:23,199 --> 01:44:24,560
i don't know which philosopher was but

2923
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:25,600
you know philosophy about self

2924
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:26,400
examination

2925
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:28,639
examining your beliefs assumption if

2926
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:30,239
that's not modeling i don't know what it

2927
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:30,880
is

2928
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:34,320
um and and um he has raised some very

2929
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:35,119
nice points

2930
01:44:35,119 --> 01:44:38,400
um so the rule of consciousness uh

2931
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:41,119
too about conscious of regulation and i

2932
01:44:41,119 --> 01:44:42,320
i personally believe

2933
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:44,960
i am one of those people does attribute

2934
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:47,119
a function to consciousness or at least

2935
01:44:47,119 --> 01:44:49,520
attribute a functional drive that led to

2936
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:51,440
the emergence of consciousness

2937
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:54,880
where by the sheer fact that it is

2938
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:57,119
uh the kind of the apex of higher and

2939
01:44:57,119 --> 01:44:59,119
higher levels of modeling

2940
01:44:59,119 --> 01:45:01,920
similarly how multi-sensory integration

2941
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:03,600
is a consequence of this

2942
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:06,639
in the very same way um it seems

2943
01:45:06,639 --> 01:45:08,080
it seems stands to reason especially if

2944
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:10,320
you look at works like graziano's

2945
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:12,880
attention schema modeling that's the

2946
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:13,520
very

2947
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:15,840
drive that led to motorcycle integration

2948
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:16,800
and consciousness

2949
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,880
is the need to model that which is below

2950
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:20,800
that um i'm sure there's some there's

2951
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,480
some activation papers for that too

2952
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:24,639
um i forgot in response to what it was

2953
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:26,159
but also wrote down somewhere

2954
01:45:26,159 --> 01:45:29,199
that um it's relevant to take also mel's

2955
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:31,199
paper in this discussion about models

2956
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:32,800
because i think what's very beautiful

2957
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:34,480
there in contrast to this discussion is

2958
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:35,199
the

2959
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:37,920
diversity of nuances regarding what a

2960
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:40,400
model can be and what they are useful

2961
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:42,000
right although that would probably stand

2962
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,920
at us with a lot of inactivists but you

2963
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:45,520
can draw a lot of parallels between the

2964
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:47,119
different roles and values that model

2965
01:45:47,119 --> 01:45:48,400
could play and have

2966
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:50,560
for a scientist and the various ways

2967
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:51,520
that models as

2968
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:54,639
embodied could be useful right for

2969
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:55,600
example some are

2970
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:58,639
good for for conceptual exploration some

2971
01:45:58,639 --> 01:45:58,960
are

2972
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:01,600
more truth-oriented some are more to

2973
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,199
kind of integrate different things and i

2974
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:04,800
think these are all valid ways to look

2975
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,000
at models

2976
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,639
um and they survive simply by virtue

2977
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:10,639
again by virtue of what free energy

2978
01:46:10,639 --> 01:46:12,639
principle entails is that

2979
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:15,520
the the success of these models is what

2980
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:16,960
leads them to persist right and the

2981
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:17,440
success

2982
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:19,520
in terms of their pragmatic and

2983
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:20,880
epistemic contributions

2984
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:23,119
to minimizing or reducing variation free

2985
01:46:23,119 --> 01:46:24,000
energy

2986
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,400
right and so it's like oh wait yeah alex

2987
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:27,440
uh john says

2988
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:29,760
a recent paper right or well one of them

2989
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,920
had the recent paper on it's not about

2990
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:32,960
it it's about

2991
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:34,560
uh what must be true if you've gotten

2992
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:36,239
there actually right so what must be

2993
01:46:36,239 --> 01:46:37,119
true

2994
01:46:37,119 --> 01:46:40,000
yes yeah yeah x constant so so given

2995
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,199
that we have

2996
01:46:41,199 --> 01:46:43,360
bernoulli assume models what must be

2997
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:45,440
true uh given that we have them

2998
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:48,159
right so the answer would be the uh they

2999
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:49,440
got there because apparently they

3000
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:50,239
contributed

3001
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:52,800
to a reduction of variation free energy

3002
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,520
right

3003
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:55,679
um also i thomas i gotta say i think

3004
01:46:55,679 --> 01:46:56,960
it's it's kind of one of those uh

3005
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:57,520
disagree

3006
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:00,080
uh agree to disagree things because i i

3007
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:03,040
i i feel a sense a bit of an axiomatic

3008
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:05,119
commitment to models simply cannot be

3009
01:47:05,119 --> 01:47:06,239
embodied

3010
01:47:06,239 --> 01:47:07,840
um although i would love to continue

3011
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:09,760
that discussion and i also

3012
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:11,679
think that adapting a language is key

3013
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:14,000
and again taking the the norm of

3014
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,679
principle free energy

3015
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:17,840
it's the philosophers who disagree most

3016
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:19,360
people use it like the way that

3017
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:21,440
i've been describing right folks

3018
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:23,199
psychology and scientists use

3019
01:47:23,199 --> 01:47:24,080
representation

3020
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:26,560
in less of a seemingly anal status

3021
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:28,480
rigorous notion of correctness condition

3022
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:31,199
it is simply a part of a bigger picture

3023
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:31,600
of

3024
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:33,920
how their value should be assessed so i

3025
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:35,440
i and i think in general it's a it's

3026
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:37,360
example of niche construction we are

3027
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:38,880
embedded in a world of language we're

3028
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,239
our linguistic bodies

3029
01:47:40,239 --> 01:47:42,000
so adapting a language instead of

3030
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,239
throwing it away seems to me a far more

3031
01:47:44,239 --> 01:47:45,679
reasonable approach

3032
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:47,600
um especially if you want to confu if

3033
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:49,360
you want to avoid confusion so yeah i'll

3034
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:50,000
leave it

3035
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,280
well it's always interesting to

3036
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:54,159
re-listen to one's live stream

3037
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:57,119
because while we're speaking we think a

3038
01:47:57,119 --> 01:47:58,080
certain way

3039
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:00,800
it's a different mode and um and s you

3040
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:01,360
really

3041
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:03,840
have a finesse with constructing

3042
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:06,239
philosophical arguments on the fly

3043
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:09,280
as many other people embody and the way

3044
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:10,320
that that is done

3045
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:12,719
performatively stephen i'm sure also you

3046
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:14,320
know resonates but like

3047
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:15,520
the way it's done for the first time

3048
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:17,119
performatively is very different than

3049
01:48:17,119 --> 01:48:18,480
hearing it

3050
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:21,199
in a different state of mind it's like

3051
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:22,560
it lines up

3052
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:24,800
in the moment but then a different

3053
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:26,000
moment and then

3054
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,760
it's like because that's so it's really

3055
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:29,119
interesting points like are we self

3056
01:48:29,119 --> 01:48:30,159
modeling

3057
01:48:30,159 --> 01:48:31,199
when you're improv when you're

3058
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:33,280
improvising are you self-modeling or are

3059
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:34,800
you doing are you just controlling your

3060
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,239
larynx

3061
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:37,920
where is consciousness fitting into all

3062
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:40,239
of that those are really great questions

3063
01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:42,960
in s and then any like closing thoughts

3064
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:43,840
we could go

3065
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,679
anyone else who wants to speak in us and

3066
01:48:45,679 --> 01:48:47,440
then feel free to drop off whenever you

3067
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:49,119
want

3068
01:48:49,119 --> 01:48:51,760
um okay i just wanted to sort of like

3069
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:52,239
address

3070
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:55,280
uh marcos and then address uh shannon um

3071
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:57,520
point very good points um so there was

3072
01:48:57,520 --> 01:48:58,960
one thing that marcus said that uh

3073
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:00,800
strike me very very interesting because

3074
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,800
you were saying um about that we need to

3075
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:04,239
so you need to choose the models the

3076
01:49:04,239 --> 01:49:06,320
models that are more um you know

3077
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:07,119
suitable

3078
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:10,560
um and i think that um by saying that

3079
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:11,840
obviously we're taking a realist

3080
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:14,159
a a realist perspective as in thinking

3081
01:49:14,159 --> 01:49:15,920
that there are actually those models in

3082
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:17,440
the body or in the brain

3083
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:19,440
so that's sort of like what thomas and i

3084
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:20,800
challenge so i just want to

3085
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,400
sort of like give my two cents on that

3086
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:24,320
particular thought and say that

3087
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:26,880
i don't think the success in is choosing

3088
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:28,400
um in choosing models

3089
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:30,719
but it's more like the success is in

3090
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:31,520
choosing

3091
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:33,760
the most desired states that are going

3092
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:35,760
to get you what you want which is like

3093
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:36,159
you know

3094
01:49:36,159 --> 01:49:38,159
avoidance of dissipation entropy

3095
01:49:38,159 --> 01:49:39,840
uncertainty and all of that

3096
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:43,119
um so states are preferable models don't

3097
01:49:43,119 --> 01:49:43,599
exist

3098
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:45,920
so that's kind of like my take on that

3099
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:47,679
and then i just wanted to also address

3100
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:49,440
what shannon was saying which was really

3101
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,239
interesting because

3102
01:49:50,239 --> 01:49:52,000
i thought that it seemed to me that

3103
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,360
channel was trying to you know

3104
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:55,599
build up like in okay let's just really

3105
01:49:55,599 --> 01:49:57,520
get down to hands-on and see like

3106
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:59,679
how do we really apply these things that

3107
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:01,040
we are discussing here

3108
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:03,840
into like for example my lab um and i

3109
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:04,880
really like that

3110
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:07,280
um one thing that i think that is

3111
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:10,000
interesting that happens um uh

3112
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,840
that i see happening a lot with my

3113
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:13,040
conversations is that

3114
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:16,960
we don't even see how we are already

3115
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:18,800
sort of like in completely and fully

3116
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:20,000
enculturated

3117
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,480
in a way that we speak about the body

3118
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:24,080
and the brain and cognition

3119
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:26,719
in general with so many assumptions that

3120
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:28,560
these things exist because it's just the

3121
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:30,239
way that we've been enculturated

3122
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:32,560
um so as uh shannon was describing oh i

3123
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:34,000
think that wonder if maybe its

3124
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,159
expectation is a better word right

3125
01:50:36,159 --> 01:50:37,920
and then like it strike me because i was

3126
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:39,280
thinking about it

3127
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:41,679
okay um so the body has got this

3128
01:50:41,679 --> 01:50:42,960
expectation but

3129
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:46,320
from what from what

3130
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:47,920
so is that is there like because for the

3131
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:49,280
body to have a certain sort of

3132
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,119
expectation i would probably think that

3133
01:50:51,119 --> 01:50:52,480
maybe the body would need to be like

3134
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:54,320
sort of like separated from the brain so

3135
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:55,760
it had what would have like some kind of

3136
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:56,080
like

3137
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:59,199
expectation um or

3138
01:50:59,199 --> 01:51:01,920
um uh some kind of like inbuilt system

3139
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:02,480
where the

3140
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:03,840
the body becomes like sort of a

3141
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:05,679
humunculus and also has its own

3142
01:51:05,679 --> 01:51:07,280
expectations so

3143
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:09,520
detached i i i was like a little bit

3144
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:11,040
like i'm not sure uh

3145
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:14,560
what to do um with that um

3146
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:16,960
so um yeah so that that would be like a

3147
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:17,679
point on

3148
01:51:17,679 --> 01:51:19,440
on whether the body's got this

3149
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:20,880
expectation and um

3150
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:24,880
and um and and and how i think that it

3151
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:27,280
another way to think that would be to

3152
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:28,159
think that

3153
01:51:28,159 --> 01:51:30,719
the whole organism is evolving towards

3154
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:31,920
something

3155
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:33,679
right there's a sort of like at least

3156
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:35,440
like one goal that is

3157
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:38,560
shared by all living systems right of

3158
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:38,960
course

3159
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:41,199
interactions are very idiosyncratic

3160
01:51:41,199 --> 01:51:43,040
we're really context dependent but

3161
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:44,560
there's like one goal there's like sort

3162
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:45,119
of like

3163
01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:47,119
in general times shared by all living

3164
01:51:47,119 --> 01:51:48,960
systems is that they don't want to die

3165
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:49,920
so the the

3166
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:52,800
so it is evolving towards uh sort of

3167
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:54,639
like avoiding this dissipation

3168
01:51:54,639 --> 01:51:57,520
so whatever whatever the state the body

3169
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:58,320
is at

3170
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:00,639
it's it's got to it's got to be dealing

3171
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:02,080
with uncertainty right

3172
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:04,159
either so then shannon was giving this

3173
01:52:04,159 --> 01:52:05,440
the example of like oh

3174
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:07,840
it's standing so so is it there's an

3175
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:09,040
expectation of like a certain

3176
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:10,800
expectation regardless to

3177
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,599
in regard to being um standing i think

3178
01:52:13,599 --> 01:52:14,960
it's more of like the state

3179
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:18,000
that the the organism itself is

3180
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
which is either certain or uncertain

3181
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,840
it's stable or is not stable

3182
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:24,719
it's it's it's in in in it's it's it's

3183
01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:26,320
fulfilling sort of like

3184
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:28,719
a a state that is going to you know lead

3185
01:52:28,719 --> 01:52:30,239
me to to the next

3186
01:52:30,239 --> 01:52:33,119
stage so i think that would be like a a

3187
01:52:33,119 --> 01:52:33,760
a sort of

3188
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:37,119
better way to describe the behavior

3189
01:52:37,119 --> 01:52:40,000
um that is entailed in in yeah in this

3190
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,840
cognitive activities that we do

3191
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:44,159
because i'm not sure how to think like

3192
01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:46,400
the body itself expecting something but

3193
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:48,400
maybe i'm just i i missed

3194
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:51,520
um i missed something here

3195
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:54,239
bill thanks so much for that shannon

3196
01:52:54,239 --> 01:52:55,199
marco and then

3197
01:52:55,199 --> 01:52:56,840
anyone else who wants to give the last

3198
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:58,239
thought

3199
01:52:58,239 --> 01:53:00,719
great thanks for that ness i think um

3200
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:03,679
where you sort of ended where you have

3201
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:06,400
like most organisms have an expectation

3202
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:08,320
of being in a more stable state

3203
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:11,199
than a more unstable state depending on

3204
01:53:11,199 --> 01:53:12,719
the context and depending on

3205
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:15,199
the environment and everything um but

3206
01:53:15,199 --> 01:53:16,880
the point you made about enculturation

3207
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:18,560
like how does the body have an

3208
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:19,679
expectations

3209
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:22,800
um and i guess when i said the body i

3210
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:23,360
kind of

3211
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:26,400
was implicitly including the the brain

3212
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:30,159
so if when your body's actually upright

3213
01:53:30,159 --> 01:53:31,119
your brain and

3214
01:53:31,119 --> 01:53:33,920
your muscular system have an expectation

3215
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:35,360
of being stable in that upright

3216
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:39,280
position and i think enculturation um

3217
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:42,560
we could also just talk about

3218
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:46,880
um like the development of

3219
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:49,280
certain structures or expectations or

3220
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:50,719
situatedness or something

3221
01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:52,560
so the same way like enculturation gives

3222
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,960
us an expectation for a certain

3223
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:57,920
form of language our body just by

3224
01:53:57,920 --> 01:53:59,840
existing in the world and being in

3225
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:02,080
standing states in lots of different

3226
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:03,119
contexts

3227
01:54:03,119 --> 01:54:05,199
develops an expectation of what a stable

3228
01:54:05,199 --> 01:54:06,840
standing state would be like

3229
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:09,119
um but i think where you ended sort of

3230
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:11,040
on

3231
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:12,639
this like constant evolution sort of

3232
01:54:12,639 --> 01:54:14,000
away from death or away from

3233
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,760
perturbation or towards stability i

3234
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:16,880
think that

3235
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:20,719
that covers and that was helpful

3236
01:54:20,719 --> 01:54:23,520
thank you shane marco and then any other

3237
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:25,840
comments

3238
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:28,320
thanks um regarding anticipation in the

3239
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:29,280
body um

3240
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:30,719
some examples i'm not sure if this

3241
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:32,800
translate is normally dutch but

3242
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:35,199
you know if you've heard of it or or

3243
01:54:35,199 --> 01:54:36,080
pork

3244
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:39,280
soup is eaten with a

3245
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:40,960
spoon but most people will say fork

3246
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:42,320
especially when you're kids in

3247
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:43,280
kindergarten

3248
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:45,679
so um that is more of a linguistic

3249
01:54:45,679 --> 01:54:47,520
example because it relies on

3250
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:51,360
a notion of rhyme which you feel to it

3251
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:52,960
and the prediction error is again

3252
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:54,320
contingent upon the model or the

3253
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:56,159
linguistic policy you have

3254
01:54:56,159 --> 01:54:59,840
um but also just in in general um

3255
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:03,119
for example with brain relations or

3256
01:55:03,119 --> 01:55:04,639
i don't know imagine you're at a bar

3257
01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:06,239
someone really drunk comes to you

3258
01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:08,560
and there's a really big guy with scary

3259
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:10,880
tattoos and there's no words need to be

3260
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:12,639
exchanged but if he comes really close

3261
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:13,280
to you

3262
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:15,199
grabs you tightly in the shoulder

3263
01:55:15,199 --> 01:55:16,400
there's gonna be expectations and it's

3264
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:17,760
felt in the body

3265
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:19,280
and a lot of these expectations

3266
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:20,719
especially imagine you're a racist you

3267
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:21,599
know and and

3268
01:55:21,599 --> 01:55:24,320
and someone colored comes to you so then

3269
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:25,440
you will feel a

3270
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:27,280
physical response of anticipating a

3271
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:29,280
certain action or something

3272
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:31,440
but because it's a contingent of

3273
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:32,800
uncertain racist beliefs which in

3274
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:33,679
culture

3275
01:55:33,679 --> 01:55:35,119
there clearly needs to be a certain

3276
01:55:35,119 --> 01:55:36,800
interrelation between the models with

3277
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:37,199
the

3278
01:55:37,199 --> 01:55:38,960
abstractions that you've gathered

3279
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:40,480
through culture and

3280
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:42,880
the physically or viscerally felt

3281
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:44,719
anticipation of an action

3282
01:55:44,719 --> 01:55:47,679
and so i think in a lot of ways what i'm

3283
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:49,199
trying to say is that a lot of the

3284
01:55:49,199 --> 01:55:51,679
physically embodied anticipations

3285
01:55:51,679 --> 01:55:54,880
clearly are contingent upon abstract or

3286
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:57,199
model or representations of something

3287
01:55:57,199 --> 01:55:58,719
because if not we wouldn't have these

3288
01:55:58,719 --> 01:56:01,040
visceral bodies so i think a lot of

3289
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:03,360
my personal qualms and activism is often

3290
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:05,199
they look at the manifestations the tip

3291
01:56:05,199 --> 01:56:06,960
of the iceberg the marks

3292
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:09,679
the labels but but not the necessary

3293
01:56:09,679 --> 01:56:12,000
path that it has to have taken to get to

3294
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,480
that manifestation um

3295
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:16,080
and you said also about you know we

3296
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:17,599
don't need models we just get to our

3297
01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:18,800
preferred states

3298
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,239
but then you get the problem of how do

3299
01:56:20,239 --> 01:56:21,679
you get to your preferred states it's

3300
01:56:21,679 --> 01:56:23,440
not that easy i want a million dollars

3301
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:24,880
and a happy family but

3302
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:27,280
you know how do i get there and so it's

3303
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:29,119
gonna be contingent on a lot of

3304
01:56:29,119 --> 01:56:31,920
complicated detours and i simply don't

3305
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:34,000
believe that you can escape the notion

3306
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,040
of a model

3307
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:37,599
if you let go of the whole um correct

3308
01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:39,199
this condition but i i don't think you

3309
01:56:39,199 --> 01:56:39,840
can escape

3310
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:41,920
at least a model in the broadest sense

3311
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:43,679
as nell's paper i think nicely alludes

3312
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:44,800
to

3313
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:47,040
especially with these examples of

3314
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:48,560
getting to preferred states given the

3315
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:50,239
complexity of our worlds and given the

3316
01:56:50,239 --> 01:56:53,679
cultured reality of that experience

3317
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:54,880
thanks mark so i would love to talk

3318
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:57,040
about that next time yeah awesome well

3319
01:56:57,040 --> 01:56:59,520
on discord or however we can continue

3320
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:01,599
some text brewing and thinking and it's

3321
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:02,800
awesome because it's just like a

3322
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:04,080
snapshot

3323
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:06,080
into our learning and thought on all

3324
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:07,760
these very important questions

3325
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:11,520
so stephen scott in us

3326
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:13,520
thanks well i suppose one thing in this

3327
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:14,880
mention there and this is

3328
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:16,639
this is quite rich is maybe how does

3329
01:57:16,639 --> 01:57:19,599
expectations can expectations always be

3330
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:21,679
and to some extent they can't by

3331
01:57:21,679 --> 01:57:23,440
minimizing uncertainty

3332
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:25,679
it's like a backdoor way to get is it

3333
01:57:25,679 --> 01:57:27,280
you know so it's kind of

3334
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:29,840
um but i do think there's something

3335
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:31,520
quite interesting about

3336
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:33,920
um another way of thinking about

3337
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:35,040
representations

3338
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:38,719
beyond the model and beyond

3339
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:40,960
some internal brain state and that's

3340
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:42,320
where not but there's something called

3341
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:44,159
mental space psychology which is quite

3342
01:57:44,159 --> 01:57:45,280
interesting about

3343
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:47,440
how we might be constructing and

3344
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:49,040
designing

3345
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:51,440
um understandings of a space now i'm not

3346
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:52,880
going to mention that now but that that

3347
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:53,280
just

3348
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:56,000
something that comes up is is there's

3349
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:56,639
maybe there's

3350
01:57:56,639 --> 01:57:59,440
other mechanisms for modeling that we

3351
01:57:59,440 --> 01:57:59,840
work

3352
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:03,599
with which is in between

3353
01:58:03,599 --> 01:58:06,560
just the body moving and it being in the

3354
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:07,440
brain but

3355
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:10,320
is is everything tied to this active

3356
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:12,320
state sensory states

3357
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:14,719
relationship so it has to be capitulated

3358
01:58:14,719 --> 01:58:16,239
at some level

3359
01:58:16,239 --> 01:58:19,440
using our sensor and using our actions

3360
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:21,360
so there has so anything that's

3361
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:23,840
represented in a way we think it

3362
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:27,119
is somehow being capitulated in this

3363
01:58:27,119 --> 01:58:29,360
active inference process it's not

3364
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:32,400
being just happened offline

3365
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:34,000
so to speak without any kind of

3366
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,760
embodiment yeah thanks

3367
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:37,520
thanks stephen and the good news is you

3368
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:39,040
only have to mention the keyword wants

3369
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:40,320
for the ai

3370
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:44,239
so scott and then in s

3371
01:58:44,239 --> 01:58:46,560
one thing i was thinking about is you

3372
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:48,080
know we talked about this as a

3373
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:51,119
way uh method of analysis of existing

3374
01:58:51,119 --> 01:58:53,599
systems biological systems etc

3375
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:57,280
and it's also uh the thing that's

3376
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:58,960
what i've been doing historically is

3377
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:01,440
creating synthetic markov blankets

3378
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:03,199
and i think i alluded that that before a

3379
01:59:03,199 --> 01:59:04,960
contract is essentially a synthetic

3380
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:06,239
markov blanket

3381
01:59:06,239 --> 01:59:10,159
that creates a being pursuant to the

3382
01:59:10,159 --> 01:59:12,639
attributes in the contract and so you're

3383
01:59:12,639 --> 01:59:14,639
taking two different systems

3384
01:59:14,639 --> 01:59:16,880
and linking them harmonically coupling

3385
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:19,199
them through a set of expectations

3386
01:59:19,199 --> 01:59:21,760
that are documented in the contract and

3387
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:22,960
so one of the things that's kind of

3388
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:24,480
interesting to me is that idea of

3389
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:26,560
realism versus instrumentalism

3390
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:28,960
i think it goes away in the context of

3391
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:30,159
synthetic

3392
01:59:30,159 --> 01:59:32,480
systems because you're essentially

3393
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:33,679
instrumenting

3394
01:59:33,679 --> 01:59:36,719
a system from whole cloth saying

3395
01:59:36,719 --> 01:59:38,719
hey we're going to correct create this

3396
01:59:38,719 --> 01:59:40,000
entity

3397
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,679
and it's going to have these attributes

3398
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:43,440
like a corporation doesn't exist except

3399
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:44,480
through the corporate law and the

3400
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:46,639
attributes that are assigned to it by

3401
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:49,520
shared meaning but it's all fiction but

3402
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:51,920
it's a very broadly shared fiction

3403
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:53,760
and so it's interesting that notion of

3404
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:55,599
what we use as descriptors

3405
01:59:55,599 --> 01:59:58,719
for existing living forms

3406
01:59:58,719 --> 02:00:01,520
and those things that we set up to

3407
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:02,000
create

3408
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,520
niches in a sense for the new synthetic

3409
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:07,199
forms and that's something that

3410
02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:09,599
i find intriguing with this model from

3411
02:00:09,599 --> 02:00:10,239
the paper

3412
02:00:10,239 --> 02:00:12,960
is that it's when it's taken to the

3413
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:13,760
synthesis

3414
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:17,040
of new forms it changes i think it

3415
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:18,719
changes that analysis because it's not a

3416
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:21,360
question of discovery but of creativity

3417
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:22,719
in terms of the setting up

3418
02:00:22,719 --> 02:00:25,119
of the attributes in the markov blanket

3419
02:00:25,119 --> 02:00:26,159
thanks

3420
02:00:26,159 --> 02:00:28,560
scott if i could rephrase that it'd be

3421
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:30,320
like the realist is focused on those

3422
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:31,520
essences of the world they're going to

3423
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:32,800
try and describe what's already out

3424
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:34,560
there that's like big databases of our

3425
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,119
current

3426
02:00:35,119 --> 02:00:37,119
legal systems but once we're in

3427
02:00:37,119 --> 02:00:38,560
instrument landia

3428
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:41,280
we're talking about designing apparently

3429
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:43,119
arbitrary

3430
02:00:43,119 --> 02:00:46,239
fictions and then manifesting them and

3431
02:00:46,239 --> 02:00:47,280
enacting them

3432
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:49,280
and so there the rate limiting step once

3433
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:51,440
you're taking the instrumentalist turn

3434
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:53,760
is literally the innovation and the

3435
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:55,280
narrative build up and how much

3436
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:57,119
collaboration you can achieve

3437
02:00:57,119 --> 02:00:58,800
pragmatically without getting into the

3438
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:00,560
realist allowing people to have a

3439
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:02,080
different take on what is quote really

3440
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:03,119
happening

3441
02:01:03,119 --> 02:01:06,159
so really interesting and it may allow

3442
02:01:06,159 --> 02:01:07,599
for the design

3443
02:01:07,599 --> 02:01:11,199
of scale-free interventions in that case

3444
02:01:11,199 --> 02:01:12,719
right because you're not just relying on

3445
02:01:12,719 --> 02:01:13,520
what happened

3446
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:16,560
naturally but rather you can create some

3447
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:18,560
predictive possibilities

3448
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:21,679
by the way you design one level to

3449
02:01:21,679 --> 02:01:23,599
allow for the engagement on a scale

3450
02:01:23,599 --> 02:01:24,719
freeway thanks

3451
02:01:24,719 --> 02:01:27,119
all right ns and then all the last

3452
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:29,040
comment

3453
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:31,040
okay so i know that we are already a

3454
02:01:31,040 --> 02:01:32,719
little bit over time and i do have

3455
02:01:32,719 --> 02:01:34,400
another meeting so i'm just going to try

3456
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:36,159
to be like super concise

3457
02:01:36,159 --> 02:01:38,480
and i just want to say like one final

3458
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:39,520
remark regarding

3459
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:43,040
regarding the realism instrumentalism

3460
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:46,320
so uh i just want to say that um imagine

3461
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:47,520
that i have a model

3462
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:49,679
i just have built the model to

3463
02:01:49,679 --> 02:01:51,760
understand or make sense of brain data

3464
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:53,280
for example that i collected from the

3465
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:54,159
scan

3466
02:01:54,159 --> 02:01:56,400
um i can have two this is a

3467
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:57,760
philosophical attitude

3468
02:01:57,760 --> 02:02:00,000
i can have either one or the other i can

3469
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,119
go and say no

3470
02:02:01,119 --> 02:02:03,679
my model uh but that uses all these

3471
02:02:03,679 --> 02:02:04,239
tools

3472
02:02:04,239 --> 02:02:05,760
all these mathematical and conceptual

3473
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:07,840
tools um is actually

3474
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:09,360
the how the brain is working and

3475
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:11,679
generating that data it's not only on my

3476
02:02:11,679 --> 02:02:13,360
model it's actually how it is

3477
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:16,480
or i can say that no this is actually my

3478
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:18,880
tools that we as a scientific community

3479
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:19,840
have built

3480
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:22,159
to make sense of the data that we

3481
02:02:22,159 --> 02:02:23,440
actually have access to

3482
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:25,920
and try to generate the the the activity

3483
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:27,360
that we don't have access to so we need

3484
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:28,480
to infer it

3485
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:30,480
right so just one comment on that

3486
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:31,760
particular distinction

3487
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:33,199
and then another thing that i wanted to

3488
02:02:33,199 --> 02:02:35,599
um get to is that uh marco was saying

3489
02:02:35,599 --> 02:02:36,800
that

3490
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:39,599
oh i can't i can't see how we can how we

3491
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:40,800
don't have models

3492
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:42,400
how to get from one state to the other

3493
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:44,080
and that kind of thing i just want to

3494
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:45,520
say that in that regard

3495
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:47,119
that we don't have models we do have

3496
02:02:47,119 --> 02:02:49,119
representations on the agent level

3497
02:02:49,119 --> 02:02:51,199
i mean we think we use abductive reason

3498
02:02:51,199 --> 02:02:53,199
we have we we use logics we have

3499
02:02:53,199 --> 02:02:53,920
concepts

3500
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:56,159
we do make representations we represent

3501
02:02:56,159 --> 02:02:57,840
things we can we can do that on the

3502
02:02:57,840 --> 02:02:58,880
agent level

3503
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:00,960
so scientists do it we in our daily

3504
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:02,320
lives do that

3505
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:04,960
um and that is totally fine no one is

3506
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:06,000
disputing that

3507
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:09,119
the dispute is precisely on whether the

3508
02:03:09,119 --> 02:03:10,960
underlying mechanisms of

3509
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:14,960
what allows for us to do that such as

3510
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:17,280
the body in the environment with the

3511
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:18,639
nervous system

3512
02:03:18,639 --> 02:03:20,719
actually themselves also have that

3513
02:03:20,719 --> 02:03:22,560
capacity

3514
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:24,560
so that's the question about models

3515
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:26,000
models on the agent level

3516
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,480
yes on the underlying mechanisms of what

3517
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:30,239
allows us to model

3518
02:03:30,239 --> 02:03:31,840
that's a different story that i'm not

3519
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:33,520
convinced about

3520
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:35,840
um and then about how do we get like

3521
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:37,760
from one state to the other

3522
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:40,880
i think that we choose

3523
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:43,199
we think we use again uh reason

3524
02:03:43,199 --> 02:03:44,400
abductive reason

3525
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:46,960
uh we have representation we also use

3526
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:48,880
all of these intellectual machinery that

3527
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:49,520
we can

3528
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:51,520
and have because we are enculturated

3529
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:52,880
systems well

3530
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:56,400
and um and living beings read language

3531
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:59,360
and we choose how we get from one state

3532
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:01,280
to the next

3533
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:03,599
and then that can be all mapped out with

3534
02:04:03,599 --> 02:04:05,440
you know dynamical causal models

3535
02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:08,880
if we want to so i just wanted to finish

3536
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:10,480
with that thanks so much

3537
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:13,199
thanks everybody for this really fun

3538
02:04:13,199 --> 02:04:14,719
discussion i'm glad that we

3539
02:04:14,719 --> 02:04:16,480
opened so many great threads in point

3540
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:18,560
one i'm gonna provide a technical wish

3541
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:19,920
anyone can drop off they want to provide

3542
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:21,760
a technical wish and then a

3543
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:24,079
concluding thought so the one technical

3544
02:04:24,079 --> 02:04:26,000
one is it'd be fun to have an automated

3545
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:26,719
system

3546
02:04:26,719 --> 02:04:28,800
for philosophical classification of

3547
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,320
statements even if only within the

3548
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:31,840
domain specific fep

3549
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:33,840
so a statement like the brain has to

3550
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:35,679
maximize the a matrix

3551
02:04:35,679 --> 02:04:38,800
is a really if the brain is it

3552
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:40,639
is a policy selector or something like

3553
02:04:40,639 --> 02:04:42,079
that is a realist

3554
02:04:42,079 --> 02:04:43,520
take even if the person has some other

3555
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:45,040
perspective but in that sentence

3556
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:45,840
grammatically

3557
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:48,239
versus we use this version of spm to

3558
02:04:48,239 --> 02:04:49,280
model this it's like it's an

3559
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:50,000
instrumentalist

3560
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,400
sentence so classifying sentences and

3561
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:54,000
then even just like kind of like a time

3562
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:55,199
series like shading our

3563
02:04:55,199 --> 02:04:57,920
live stream by the way that people are

3564
02:04:57,920 --> 02:04:59,520
speaking with an underlying generative

3565
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:01,199
model and then are they speaking

3566
02:05:01,199 --> 02:05:03,920
from a position of implicitly like are

3567
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:06,400
people speaking from a position of um

3568
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:10,079
you know pronouns in one way or in some

3569
02:05:10,079 --> 02:05:10,719
other way

3570
02:05:10,719 --> 02:05:12,480
these are things that are like emitted

3571
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:14,560
states that could be inferred

3572
02:05:14,560 --> 02:05:16,320
from linguistic patterns and then the

3573
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:17,920
concluding um thought was

3574
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:19,360
scott david talk about paradox he's

3575
02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:21,360
talked about it before steven brought up

3576
02:05:21,360 --> 02:05:23,119
that humans are like a tool culture

3577
02:05:23,119 --> 02:05:24,480
everybody not just

3578
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:26,079
digital culture humans are like a

3579
02:05:26,079 --> 02:05:27,520
handiwork tool

3580
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:30,400
people and so thomas said what do we

3581
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:31,920
lose with instrumentalism and so that's

3582
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:33,119
really just to conclude by saying

3583
02:05:33,119 --> 02:05:35,119
that's what's on the table is do we just

3584
02:05:35,119 --> 02:05:37,119
cut our ties with reality

3585
02:05:37,119 --> 02:05:39,520
do we fight for realism and whatever

3586
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:41,440
that is lost along the way there

3587
02:05:41,440 --> 02:05:43,040
or do we cut our ties with reality and

3588
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:44,560
go fully instrumentalist where does that

3589
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:45,760
leave us adrift

3590
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:47,520
if we have a really good ship where do

3591
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:49,360
we steer it because now we're going to

3592
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:50,880
be in more direct contact

3593
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:52,800
with our preferences with our governance

3594
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:53,920
structures because we're going to be

3595
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:54,800
really clear

3596
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:56,560
that science isn't like advancing some

3597
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:57,840
noble truth agenda

3598
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:00,480
per se it's something a lot more cns

3599
02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:01,199
thank you

3600
02:06:01,199 --> 02:06:02,880
it's something that's more on the um

3601
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:04,560
utilitarians the technological it's an

3602
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:05,199
engineering

3603
02:06:05,199 --> 02:06:07,119
development if the fep is within the

3604
02:06:07,119 --> 02:06:08,639
realm of philosophy and engineering but

3605
02:06:08,639 --> 02:06:09,040
not

3606
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:11,840
academia for example it's not too

3607
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:13,679
foreign of a world that could exist

3608
02:06:13,679 --> 02:06:15,679
which would be different for an idea

3609
02:06:15,679 --> 02:06:17,280
than other kinds of ideas

3610
02:06:17,280 --> 02:06:18,960
and then it's the heart of the matter

3611
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:20,400
and is the heart of the matter how

3612
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:21,760
things are or is it how things are

3613
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:22,960
related to each other

3614
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:24,800
so that's which story we're in at that

3615
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:26,800
top level is the heart of the matter

3616
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:27,199
that

3617
02:06:27,199 --> 02:06:28,639
instrumentalism sidestepping the

3618
02:06:28,639 --> 02:06:30,239
question you're losing everything

3619
02:06:30,239 --> 02:06:31,440
because the heart of the matter is how

3620
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:33,679
things essentially are well

3621
02:06:33,679 --> 02:06:35,280
instrumentalism is only sidestepping

3622
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:37,360
that target of what the heart of things

3623
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:38,239
are if you think that's

3624
02:06:38,239 --> 02:06:40,239
essence but if you think that the heart

3625
02:06:40,239 --> 02:06:42,400
of how things are is relational

3626
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:43,920
then maybe you can be a realist about

3627
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:45,840
instrumentalism you say it's really

3628
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:47,280
i'm really making this scientific model

3629
02:06:47,280 --> 02:06:48,480
it's really the code that i put on the

3630
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:49,199
paper

3631
02:06:49,199 --> 02:06:50,320
this is really the conversation we're

3632
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:52,639
happy happening and all these sort of

3633
02:06:52,639 --> 02:06:54,320
things like that so just it was really

3634
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:54,560
an

3635
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:57,199
awesome discussion much appreciated all

3636
02:06:57,199 --> 02:06:58,960
of you active infra

3637
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:02,239
lobbers and uh we hope to see other

3638
02:07:02,239 --> 02:07:03,760
people participate in the future if

3639
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:04,800
you're listening this far

3640
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:06,800
you probably could come on one of these

3641
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:07,840
conversations

3642
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:10,159
hopefully so thanks for participating

3643
02:07:10,159 --> 02:07:11,119
everyone

3644
02:07:11,119 --> 02:07:13,760
and the forum is in your calendar event

3645
