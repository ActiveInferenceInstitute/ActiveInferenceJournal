"Speaker 1","00;00;24;19","00;00;51;20","Hello. Welcome. It is September 14th, 2022 and we're in active livestream number 48.2. Welcome to the Active Inference Institute. We're participatory online institute that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at some of the links on the slide. This is a recorded and an Archived livestream, so please provide feedback so we can improve our work."
"Speaker 1","00;00;52;17","00;01;25;02","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we'll follow video etiquette for livestreams. Head over to active inference dot org to learn more about how to participate in learning groups and projects such as livestreams and others. Well, we are in our third discussion around this paper communication as socially extended, active inference and ecological approach to communicative behavior. From 2021 by Remy Tyson and Pierre Poirier."
"Speaker 1","00;01;25;26","00;01;56;23","And last week in 48.1. With the very same fellows in the conversation, we had some explorations into different aspects of the paper. Perhaps we can each say hello again and something if we want to, that we remember from last week, or that we'd like to explore today and then we can just be right in it. So I'm Daniel."
"Speaker 1","00;01;56;28","00;02;28;11","I'm in California and I'm interested to look towards the latter half the back nine of the paper and see where we go, which is kind of what we do in twos usually. And I just have a feeling that the exit from the slide on this one may put our communication and situated ness in a different place than where we were before."
"Speaker 1","00;02;29;05","00;02;36;22","And I'll pass it to Blue."
"Speaker 2","00;02;37;02","00;02;43;03","I'm a little I'm not."
"Speaker 1","00;02;43;03","00;02;46;28","I heard the initial part, then lost the blue."
"Speaker 2","00;02;48;04","00;03;17;24","Yeah. Can you hear me now? Yes. How about that? I am a blue and I'm a researcher in New Mexico and I am excited to dig back in to this paper. I think we left a lot of things to wonder about last week. And and yeah, excited to get to maybe more into the meat of the paper itself as opposed to just discussing tangential ideas and our past study."
"Speaker 3","00;03;17;24","00;03;52;24","Ex Blue I'm denim here in Calgary. I'm interested in seeing whether or not the big road map that I think that this paper provides also can be explained as a big score as as in a kind of a musical analogy because I'm really interested in the, in the interplay in the interaction between orchestration and arrangements. We yesterday there was a math string that where our guest was really good sort of describing the arrangement part of of what's going on and act of inference potentially."
"Speaker 3","00;03;53;10","00;04;09;08","And so I'm really kind of interested in looking at that because I think from a transmission versus ecological standpoint, we're kind of looking at the difference between mono and stereo. So I'm wondering if we should maybe look at that through that lens as capacity."
"Speaker 4","00;04;09;08","00;04;43;10","Remi I'm off limits, though. I'm a researcher at Cam in Montreal and I'm the author of the paper, and I'm looking forward to discussing the paper more in detail and maybe go to towards the later parts of the paper and maybe talk about a bit about language and linguistic communication, which is a big piece that is looming behind the paper, but it's not really that much discussed in it."
"Speaker 4","00;04;43;10","00;04;55;27","But I think that's what that that's what an account of communication aims to go towards. So I hope we'll have the chance to discuss it a little bit."
"Speaker 1","00;04;56;09","00;05;24;11","Let's go to language. It's what we're using, among other modalities, but we are using language and so that sounds like a great place to start. So what was in the paper regarding language and what was not in the paper regarding language?"
"Speaker 4","00;05;24;11","00;05;57;13","Yeah. So the the idea was to open a window at the end of the paper towards that language. So we talked a bit about conventional forms of communication and we know that most people believe that language is conventional. So we tried to tie the are or the ideas that we put forward in the paper with work by Hampstead in a paper of 2016 about conventional affordances."
"Speaker 4","00;05;57;13","00;06;31;10","So we tried to say that that linguistic community, the conventional nature of the language comes from the conventional affordances that are generated in the, in the communicative interaction. So that's what, that's a way to point toward language in our account. And we talked a bit about the act, so different types of active language, so informative or or declarative and interrogative interactive."
"Speaker 4","00;06;31;11","00;06;56;25","So these kinds of distinctions, we try to account for them in our framework. So are these are various parts of what we consider to be language that we try to treat in the paper. But there's a lot of things that we couldn't discuss, obviously, because it was like in the in the small section and the at the end we cannot like explain all of language, even in a paper or in a book."
"Speaker 4","00;06;56;25","00;07;05;04","So, so in this one section, that would be obviously way too ambitious."
"Speaker 1","00;07;05;04","00;07;29;01","What are we looking to explain or what is needed for language to be encompassed or at home or native to the ecological view rather than the transmission view, or in addition to the transmission view? Read me first then others."
"Speaker 4","00;07;30;07","00;08;06;13","Yeah. A point that is interesting is that the transmission of you comes with the press opposition about what has to be explained by a theory of of language. It comes with the idea that we have to account for the meaning of the the expressions that are used first. So we have to understand whether the meaning of the words that we use and how these meanings are encoded in the in the brains and the heads of the of the speakers of the language."
"Speaker 4","00;08;06;27","00;08;37;29","But that's misleading from the point of view that we adopt in the papers. So this it's kind of hard to see what we have to explain in order to explain language, because for so long we have based in we have been in the the the transmission view and so we are used to believe that in order to explain language, we have to explain these kinds of the contents that language transmits."
"Speaker 4","00;08;38;25","00;09;01;14","So but if we do away with these contents, it's kind of the open the question of how do we account for language. It becomes kind of open in a new way. And I don't really know exactly what we have to account for in order to account for language, because it kind of changes our view of what language is."
"Speaker 4","00;09;01;24","00;09;12;27","So I think there's a lot of open space in there in this question of how do we account for language if we do where we're with the transmission, you."
"Speaker 1","00;09;16;15","00;09;22;26","D or blue."
"Speaker 3","00;09;22;26","00;09;23;14","You got blue."
"Speaker 2","00;09;23;26","00;09;56;24","That's so I just looking back over the paper, I think it might be useful to maybe delineate the, the specific types of language interactive versus imperatives and like the specific, the specificities underlying each one of those right now that that would be maybe a good place to to just dove into the meat of the paper."
"Speaker 1","00;09;56;24","00;10;36;16","How can we see these different types of speech? Speech acts as shaping the field of affordances. What is being done ecologically with these different speech behaviors as opposed to the enabling aspect of the transmission view? I think they're fairly clear within the transmission view what these statements are about. And as you pointed out, it's almost like hard to escape viewing what these speech behaviors are by the content, like if not their content quite literally, then what would they be about?"
"Speaker 1","00;10;36;26","00;11;07;17","Even talking about what they're about, but informative would be sharing a proposition or a some reducing someone's uncertainty about the state of something in the world. I'm feeling this way or that way. Is this much and so on for other statements, because indeed they're defined by the content and their structure. So ecologically, I mean, what might these types of speech behaviors be doing?"
"Speaker 4","00;11;09;04","00;11;51;07","Yeah, these these are the types of acts of language are well accounted for in their in the transmission view. But there are some questions that remain about the imperative form of communication, because it's it's not clear that interactive communication can be understood as a form of transmission of content, because we have the feeling that when we come in something or request something, we are not transmitting information or we are not aiming at changing the mental states of the person that we are talking to."
"Speaker 4","00;11;51;07","00;12;27;16","We are aiming at making them do something in the world directly. So so there is there's kind of a mismatch there, it seems. So obviously the people in the transmission, you will have an answer. They will say that like when I have some, for instance, the desire or the intention that something is the case, I then an imperative act of communication is my transmitting this intention or this desire to that person who then as this desire or this intention, and then can bring about the state of affairs that I intend to achieve."
"Speaker 4","00;12;27;29","00;12;48;25","But it's not I'm not sure. Obviously, you can delve into details, but I'm not sure that's exactly what we want to do when we state when we when we produce an imperative vector of language, obviously we won't. We just don't just want that that person as the intention of doing something. We want the the thing done in the world."
"Speaker 4","00;12;48;25","00;13;22;28","So I believe that the imperatives kind of communication is not really well accounted for in the transmission view. And what's interesting is that in a way, the imperative form of communication is like the basic form of communication in our framework, because that what's what a communication is, is acting through the behavior of somebody else, by affecting its field of affordances, so that we can we can go back to, like the forms of animal communication that we described earlier in the paper."
"Speaker 4","00;13;22;28","00;13;46;28","And these are all can all be considered to be imperative forms of comedy or proto imperative forms of communication. So that's like the starting point. And we, we achieve these acts on the behavior of somebody else by altering their field of affordances to make them something to do something. But how do we account for informed, informative acts of communication?"
"Speaker 4","00;13;47;04","00;14;18;13","And an idea that we put forward in the paper is that and informal the kind of acts of communication that that we consider to be informative will be acts that aim to construct or alter a shared field of affordances in in a way that is more durable than just an immediate imperative act of language. So what we are doing, we are changing the layout of the context that we take for to be relevant to our joint action."
"Speaker 4","00;14;18;24","00;14;45;24","And this is changing of affordances do not have to be immediately acted upon. I can say, oh, there's something in the in the context that's relevant. It does not necessarily call for action immediately, but it's something that is like in the background of our context of action. And so it's change. It changes the shared field of affordances, but it's not directly soliciting an action from the interlocutor, as would be the case for the imperative act of language."
"Speaker 4","00;14;45;24","00;15;21;07","So in a way, it's like as this in the beginning, an informative, active language is like a long term imperative or a dispositional imperative. We put something in the context, we say, Oh, that's relevant. We can act on it at some point, but it's not necessarily immediately to be acted upon. So that's how we can like put the idea that, okay, we can change our context of action, what we can take to be relevant in the context of action, and we can come back to it later and when when it's relevant and act on it."
"Speaker 4","00;15;21;07","00;15;45;01","But it's not something that is to be acted upon immediately. And so that's like the, the, the difference between imperative and formative begins to do to be discern there where an imperative is like I'm seeing that this so this F audience should be acted upon immediately and informative is like I'm putting this in the context it changes the layout of affordances."
"Speaker 4","00;15;45;19","00;16;11;11","So for instance there would be, I don't know, I have to come up with an example, but if I inform you of something, I'm putting I'm changing the layout of the audience that we take for granted in the context of our interaction. And it changes in the long term, the interaction and it can like drive the interaction in various ways, but it's not something to be acted directly immediately."
"Speaker 4","00;16;11;11","00;16;50;27","So that's the basic distinction and that's like the beginning of a distinction between informative and imperative. And I can say a few words about interrogative too. So as we said and, and communication is acting typically acting through the behavior of somebody else. Bye bye. But by altering its field about for a dance and interrogative, it's interesting because it's exactly the distinction between imperative and interrogative is really similar to the distinction between pragmatic value and epistemic value in active inference."
"Speaker 4","00;16;51;04","00;17;14;20","So for instance, when we produce an action that aims to maximize pragmatic value, we are trying to, for instance, to do to make the state of the world correspond to a prediction of our directors model. And when we make something which is guided by epistemic value, what we try to do is we're trying to reduce uncertainty, uncertainty about our our niche, for instance."
"Speaker 4","00;17;14;29","00;17;41;24","But so in a way, so for instance, when I'm eating something, I'm, I'm maximizing my my artist and my pragmatic value because I'm, for instance, reducing and prediction error that I'm angry and I want to. So that's a basic example. But when I'm exploring my environment, when I'm making a visual aid to explore my needs. So that would be an epistemic action, so to speak."
"Speaker 4","00;17;41;29","00;18;08;16","So interrogative acts of language are exactly analogous to epistemic actions, but they are epistemic actions through the behavior of somebody else. So instead of, for instance, by myself exploring the niche, exploring the field about audience, I can produce this act that will make the other person disclose to me an element of the field of audience that can then reduce my uncertainty about what is the context of our action."
"Speaker 4","00;18;08;24","00;18;25;02","So that's really the distinction between interactive and interrogative is really to be understood along the line of the distinction between pragmatic value and epistemic value. So that's a beginning to an introduction to these these distinctions in the, in the types of vector language."
"Speaker 2","00;18;28;12","00;18;59;05","Things start me you totally you totally read my mind there about what I wanted to to elaborate on the my question was like very poorly framed. Yeah. I think that that's very useful for especially in the goal directed aspect of imperative versus interrogative or informative like what, how they interact with our maybe we don't have a joint goal versus we do have a joint goal, or the goal is to develop some shared state of a shared mental state."
"Speaker 2","00;18;59;26","00;19;03;06","So that was really helpful. Thank you."
"Speaker 1","00;19;03;13","00;19;37;11","Another note is that the informative behavior is like the base class of the transmission view because it seems to be like it's updating one on the details. Like what if I'm saying there is a gallon of milk in the fridge? Truly what else could be conveyed other than the content? So it seems like the most natural. And then there are specific kinds of content like sharing the content that you have a question or sharing the content that you would like somebody to act."
"Speaker 1","00;19;37;23","00;20;30;08","And so in that way, as you described, many forms of speech behavior are well accounted for in the transmission view, and that accounting is actually kind of a callback to that mouth stream for with David Spivak about accounting system. So these are like accounting models. And then you highlighted that imperative in the inactive and ecological view on communication that the imperative is perhaps the basic form of communication and that can be seen developmentally through a child and the kinds of communications that they may engage in, as well as from an evolutionary perspective, with the kinds of audio or chemical or physical stigma and marks that different kinds of creatures use to communicate within and across"
"Speaker 1","00;20;30;08","00;20;58;07","species. So those are action oriented communications, as we can then say, all action oriented communication or all communication we can say is action oriented in, in and out this way. So then imperative becomes the base class shaping the field of affordances. If that's what the ecological view on communication is, is going to be most natural with kinds of expressions that we can say are imperative."
"Speaker 1","00;20;58;28","00;21;31;25","And then informative updates are like one step removed from direct action requests. So saying turn the handle to the left is an imperative. If you said, I'm going to inform you about two things, the handle can be turned to the left, and if this happens, you may want to turn the handle. Those are breaking down a capacity for action into sequential or modular or re composable statements."
"Speaker 1","00;21;32;22","00;22;09;25","But those statements are like hiding the consequences of action. And so in that way, we we can have an action oriented view on communication and then see different kinds of other behavior as like modified or truncated or censored or hidden action modification. And that may or may not entail needing to even explain how meaning is represented, transmitted or received."
"Speaker 1","00;22;09;25","00;22;10;14","Yes, Romney."
"Speaker 4","00;22;12;27","00;22;35;23","That's exactly it. So that that's really the the idea extended very well. And other example that we that we often use it with here is the the joint action of cooking a meal with various people. So like an example we used in the last discussion, the example of moving a couch to another example, maybe to change a bit our intuitions about communication."
"Speaker 4","00;22;35;23","00;22;58;08","So when people cooking a meal together, we can suppose that some people and some of the suppose that we're in the kitchen of one of the that person and the other doesn't know exactly where all the things are. And so at first the person could say, there's flour in there in the in the cupboard or in the pantry and saying that that's an important informative item language."
"Speaker 4","00;22;58;08","00;23;18;22","But that could that's like that might be a hidden imperative insofar as at some point in the interaction in the cooking of the meal, the flour might be needed. And at this point, this alteration of the field of affordances, this appearance of the flour, as in affordances in the context, might drive the action of the person when the flour is needed."
"Speaker 4","00;23;18;22","00;23;58;11","At the certain point, the person will have the software dense in this field and will go to to to seek it if it's necessary at that point. So the informative is, as I said, something like this positional or long term imperative. So some something of a hidden imperative that can drive behavior in the long term. So, so it's like at the beginning this distinction is more it's a distinction of like is this effort tends to be acted upon immediately by you or is it posed in the context and can like alter the dynamic without being directly acted upon immediately."
"Speaker 4","00;23;58;11","00;24;26;12","So that's out would be the distinction is drawn. And yeah, I, I think that that's, that's how we try to to account for informative without describing it as transmitting a content or an information. So that's that's the idea. And I think that you explain it very well in your in your in your. Yeah. In your explanation."
"Speaker 1","00;24;26;12","00;25;02;19","Okay. Yeah, it's very interesting. It's just another consequence of centering action. So many things, the pragmatic turn, pragmatism earlier than the so-called pragmatic turn in the neurosciences and all of the developments in cognitive science. In many cases, it's been like an information or an inference view yielding to an action view, and that just played out differently on different frontiers."
"Speaker 1","00;25;03;20","00;25;36;21","And it feels like in a way, language is like the stronghold of information views because it's like so amenable to syntactic and discourse analysis in and composition, ality and all these features that we see in formal models and in computer systems that it feels like, oh, maybe all the funny stuff that people do and say, we'll figure that one out to Blue."
"Speaker 1","00;25;36;26","00;25;41;27","And then Dean."
"Speaker 2","00;25;41;27","00;26;06;01","So I just wonder about like mimicry, which is something that we see like in the animal kingdom a lot. And like whether that is imperative, I mean, sometimes I guess it can be imperatives like watch me do this and then you do it, but not always. So sometimes it's like, you know, an animal will see another animal do something."
"Speaker 2","00;26;06;01","00;26;29;17","And then they try it too. And so what? I don't know. I just don't know how to look at in the terms of teaching and learning and like shared goal directness, like what is maybe the role of mimicry and how does that like what is the effect on the field of affordances to just open up like you see someone do something and then your field of affordances opens to that is also possible for me?"
"Speaker 2","00;26;29;17","00;26;36;12","Or does that not have maybe like a semantic analog? I don't know."
"Speaker 4","00;26;36;12","00;27;25;28","Yeah, that's a really good question. And often people with either the transmission of you will adopt the view that the main driver of the evolution of language in human societies was the transmitting of of knowledge and of skills, for instance, then of various types of activities. So that's like a clear example where it seems that the transmission of you as a story to say when, if we, if we take for granted that like in imitating somebody or, or, or learning something to somebody is in effect transmitting a knowledge or a certain kind of, of, of mental state or cognitive cognitive state."
"Speaker 4","00;27;26;09","00;27;55;03","So there's clearly something interesting there for the transmission of you. But I think that an alternative possible, that analysis you just heard added it is the idea that you when you're interacting with somebody and specifically with somebody of your own species, seeing this person do something can open new affordances for yourself. For instance, if I see I see somebody that looks like me do something."
"Speaker 4","00;27;55;12","00;28;19;28","I'm I have learned that when somebody looks like me, does something usually be with a little bit of effort. I can do it too. So somebody doing something is a way of opening, opening up new affordances for me and trying to achieve it. So in many case, mimicry will not necessarily be communicative. That is because an organism can do something without."
"Speaker 4","00;28;19;28","00;28;48;06","I mean, no is not communicating nothing to anybody, but it happens that somebody else watches it and imitates it. So in that case, there's not necessarily communication, but in cases where there is communication involved, I think we can analyze in this, analyze it, just as you said, that is saying that the action of the organism opens up a new life audience for the person who's watching it, doing it."
"Speaker 4","00;28;48;06","00;29;16;05","And usually in cases of explicit skill learning for instances the experts will, like, do the thing more deliberately, more slowly, more explicitly to like, show what are the relevant movement. That as to be made in order to achieve so that like making more salient the kind of of of movement that has to be made to to to succeed in the in performing their skill."
"Speaker 4","00;29;16;12","00;29;33;26","So I think that's a way that we can understand this kind of skill learning in the transformation of the affordances that are available to the person that's receiving the, the communication, that that's how I would that I think I would analyze it."
"Speaker 1","00;29;33;26","00;30;06;26","One simple example kind of building on this, making certain actions deliberate then Dean, in order for your thoughts, even showing something deliberately, verbally calling attention or just the position of the body for a physical skill, it shapes the field of affordances, specifically where somebody can look. So if you're like, okay, I'm going to swing the bat, and then now I'm going to show you what my hand you know, this isn't usually how I do it, but I'm going to show you how I was holding it at that time."
"Speaker 1","00;30;07;19","00;31;04;09","You have shaped their field of ocular motor affordances and and that is what enables their generative model to update. And so nowhere in that account is I'm transmitting that this is to be held between these two fingers, let alone counterfactuals, like, here's what you do if your hand is slippery. But but by bodily posture, including vocal box bodily posture, we can have an integrated account of mimicry, skill transfer again, transfers playing way too strongly into a transmission view, but skill resonance or something similar that helps recognize the cognitive entities learning process then."
"Speaker 3","00;31;04;09","00;31;29;20","Okay, well, I want to take what you're saying, but I'm going to put a little bit of a weird flex on it because I want to try to combine Bluetooth pen and Remi's pen and Daniel's pen into one kind of question that comes back to the paper. So like the last 5 minutes of the conversation has been focused on the back of and as typing when it pertains to language and communication and blue."
"Speaker 3","00;31;29;20","00;31;57;26","Bringing mimicry in is a is a form of as person. A lot of the emphasis in the paper, which is on the part of communication in language. So here's my question. I went back and read the paper again and I caught myself asking, What do I hear when I'm reading something? Or I'm listening to someone? What do I hear as both processor and the producer?"
"Speaker 3","00;31;58;17","00;32;31;15","As we mentioned, off camera, an arranger of something being signaled, which I'm picking up on and decoding. So rather than just leave it there a part that for a second because I think that's that the the of what I want to ask as a processor and a producer as an arranger, I can hear things in mono, I can hear things in stereo, I can even hear things if I go to my Apple Music in spatial audio."
"Speaker 3","00;32;31;15","00;33;22;17","So that is a field of affordances, a question as opposed to a source of affordances question And if I only limit myself to the source, I'm going to be asking all of type questions, right? So if I want to stay in the as of if I want to be able to hold up two things at once, at a minimum, the stereo or the spatial, that's when I get to the ecological, even if it's specific ecological because I'm not collapsing down to a single source as my point of contact, which then asks leads me to ask the fact that communication can be formed as an of types, meaning mono stereo, spatial mimicry, interrogation, the fact that"
"Speaker 3","00;33;22;17","00;34;04;25","it can be broken out into those things, does that introduce self production into the self processing in your paper? Because I know there's a heavy emphasis on the above on the processing, but I wonder if you keep the as when blue brings it up or when Daniel brings it up. If we're if we're keeping an eye on that, even a specific ecological level, are we not, when we hear something, producers as well."
"Speaker 1","00;34;04;25","00;34;07;21","What are we producing?"
"Speaker 3","00;34;07;21","00;34;41;14","I have no idea. But I know I hear something even when I read what you're typing. I'm not just hearing the tap. Tap, I'm hearing something. We are product produced. We are produce like it's changing. I'm hearing that I'm not reading that. So if I incorporate that, what am I doing? And I'm not the expert on communication, so I wonder what the expert can tell me about them."
"Speaker 4","00;34;41;14","00;34;51;05","Yeah, that's a good question. Um, yeah. I'm not sure what to say about Lucas."
"Speaker 1","00;34;51;09","00;34;54;12","Then we'll continue."
"Speaker 2","00;34;54;12","00;35;17;11","So I wonder if what you're hearing, Dean, has anything to do with the internal monologue. So, like, as you are reading something, then you are also hearing something. And so it's like there's this internal, I mean, like I have a very I'm a talker person. And so I like I have a strong internal monologue like all the time running like even getting ready in the morning."
"Speaker 2","00;35;17;11","00;35;35;00","Okay, I need to get my shoes and get my purse and my keys and I have to pack my lunch and like all these things, right? Like that happen. So I'm constantly hearing that like, as if I'm saying it maybe to myself, even though I'm not speaking, but but I wonder what you know. So I definitely am a producer of whatever I am reading."
"Speaker 2","00;35;35;00","00;35;55;24","Like I reproduce it. I read pretty set that right. So I represent in my own mind my own internal monologue. But I wonder, like I know not everyone has this internal monologue and so so what is that then. The same for the people that don't perhaps have this internal monologue. I mean, maybe they carry around a picture of all the things that they need to get ready in the morning."
"Speaker 2","00;35;56;02","00;35;56;24","So yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;35;58;15","00;36;27;12","Justin Yeah. And I think you bring up a good point. Is it a monologue or is that a stereo log? Is it a Quadra Phonic log for some people? I mean, I mean, there was an availability way back when maybe even before some of you were born, there was Quadra Phonic Sound. I remember that you album in Quadrant Phonic Sound and like to my simple ears, I didn't understand what that even meant."
"Speaker 3","00;36;27;12","00;37;04;10","Just because they were able to break it out into four parts didn't didn't change what I was well producing and processing. So for the fact that we can type it like that, like not tape it up and literally turn it into tapes, is the part where I don't really have the background to be able to explain how that that ability, that field of affordances as opposed to examining this as a single source of affordances changes the the communication game because it doesn't it certainly does speak to mimicry."
"Speaker 3","00;37;04;25","00;37;33;22","And what we can and cannot pick up is certainly speaks to Daniel's point about but about what happens when when layers appear and disappear because we narrow down what we're picking up on versus have have both of our ears working, even though we think it's our eyes that are doing all the skating. Right. So, again, I'm not I'm not trying to ask the impossible question."
"Speaker 3","00;37;33;22","00;38;11;22","I'm just curious in the sense of producer and processor and what that arrangement is dependent upon, what what Daniel brought it up in, in the last livestream circumstances matter. So but as a hearer, I wonder, I wonder if we, if we, if we know enough about ourselves to really be able to, to, to give this anything more than it is, as Rami kindly pointed out in the paper, give this more than sort of a big roadmap view."
"Speaker 3","00;38;13;07","00;38;18;18","If we if we are taking context into consideration."
"Speaker 1","00;38;18;18","00;38;19;00","Thank you."
"Speaker 4","00;38;19;09","00;38;43;28","Let me yeah, I think the discussion about the internal monologue is really interesting. And there's a lot of things that you said that in that order, I think, really interesting. But I want to go back to the the idea of the monologue. And there are some people who believe that, like Chomsky, you believe that language is not even for communication."
"Speaker 4","00;38;43;28","00;39;15;18","It's about structuring thought. And so there's there are people who believe that the language is, first and foremost something that is a property of the structure of our thoughts and not a property of systems of communication and so there's this idea that like the the the inner monologue comes first and then comes the communication of this inner monologue in the in communication."
"Speaker 4","00;39;15;27","00;39;43;27","So we have this basic that is once a what's more inherent in the transmission view that we have our train of thought. We are we have our that in our speech that we that we have in our heads. And then we translate this in our speech, in overt speech that is then taken by somebody else. And I think that this gets the priorities wrong."
"Speaker 4","00;39;44;04","00;40;12;27","And between outer speech and in their speech and there's been a lot of work in the philosophy by Wilfred Sellers and by others in, in psychology, like if you go to key would say that the first form of speech is overt speech that is then internalized in in that becomes like that becomes inner. But first, in the beginning there's only overt speech."
"Speaker 4","00;40;13;08","00;40;42;15","A child that learns language does not have an inner speech. There is only outer speech that expressed directly the child's speech. The child then do things with his words in its environment and does not directly automatically as the corresponding inner monologue in its head. And there's a process that's really interesting. I think that is where we see that beginning to happen, where the child speaks to itself alone, when there's nobody else around."
"Speaker 4","00;40;42;15","00;41;09;07","And so there's this transition where language is used in communicative interaction. And at some point the child use language alone. And there's a question of why, why does it do? And I think that our view of communication is really interestingly linked with use of of inner monologue as self cueing or self regulation. And so the child can auto regulate."
"Speaker 4","00;41;09;07","00;41;38;19","It's still about for a dance when it's alone, when there's nobody else around. And in time this in the outer zone for this outer monologue but alone monologue becomes overt because the child learns to not necessarily produce the sound that correspond to the producing of these acts. And there's there's this integration that's there is this internalization of outer discourse that becomes inner discourse."
"Speaker 4","00;41;38;19","00;42;05;02","And there's a lot of cute anecdotes about that. My nephew is a I have a nephew, the son of my my sister and is like when is is about to go to sleep is in his bed and every night is like rehearsing the events that are happening in the day. And you're seeing like the the comments that that he the rules the norms that he heard in the oh I don't have to do that."
"Speaker 4","00;42;05;02","00;42;28;13","I must do that. And so he's like rehearsing, saying what happened in the day so that this outer monologue, when he's alone in his bed is like the beginning of inner thought. We're seeing is starts out in the open and at some point this this outer monologue will become internalized and we won't hear he his thoughts out in the open."
"Speaker 4","00;42;28;13","00;42;57;03","But I think that's like the process that it takes. And there's also the idea another point that we, for instance, when we read it, usually we read silently. So we read what's written and we have the corresponding inner monologue. But it's known that in ancient times when people were reading, usually they were reading automatically aloud, loud, loudly, and it took a training in order to be able to read without speaking the words."
"Speaker 4","00;42;58;16","00;43;22;26","And so, so like in middle age and I'm not perfectly sure it's, it's, it's, it's certainly accurately we should verify it. But I believe that that's true. And it seems that I heard that. So it seems that first there's the outer monologue, the outer dialog, and then there's the outer monologue, and then there's the inner monologue that comes after that."
"Speaker 4","00;43;23;03","00;43;36;20","And I think that's more the the true direction of priority between inner monologue and other monologue."
"Speaker 2","00;43;36;20","00;44;06;03","So I just have a cute anecdote about, about learning, learning to talk. So I have two kids and they're super different. My son did as your nephew did, when he would be in his crib, talking to himself, talking to his stuffed animals and kind of recreating events in a similar way. He also babbled a lot like a lot of like just always like just saying nothing from the time he was tiny and has an incredible vocabulary."
"Speaker 2","00;44;06;03","00;44;25;00","I mean, now he's six, but people are like, wow, how old is this kid? I mean, this reading at three and just is like very, very verbal. And my my daughter is super different. So she did not really babble, but she signed like crazy. And they both went to the same school. They both teach them the same signs like tap, say milk and cracker and cheese."
"Speaker 2","00;44;25;00","00;44;46;00","And, you know, bathroom and all the things. So like they both went to the same daycare, same nature environment, and she picked up the signing much more than my son ever did. Has maybe one or two science. She's like 20. Like, I had to go learn the signs and before she could sign, she would just like stand in the kitchen and scream, like, just unable to communicate whatever it was that she wanted."
"Speaker 2","00;44;46;09","00;45;07;23","And it's so odd. Like, they're just like two totally different kids. But she when she was learning Chinese, I had a parent teacher conference with the two and they both and learning Chinese. Now they're in private school that they've been learning for like eight years. So when she was first starting to learn, she wouldn't speak in class. And the teacher and I had a conference and the teacher said, like, I am concerned about your daughter."
"Speaker 2","00;45;07;23","00;45;24;01","She doesn't participate in class, like she doesn't have to take Chinese. It's not mandatory. If you wanted to put her in a different class so she could have a silent grade. And I was like, Oh, so it occurred to me like and I knew that she and, and because she didn't babble and like I would, somebody handed her a lollipop."
"Speaker 2","00;45;24;01","00;45;42;05","She was like two and she said, Say thank you. And she did the sign for it. But, but, I mean, she really did not speak like would not form clear words unless she knew she could see them perfectly. And so I Senator tutoring with the Chinese tutor like just twice, three times. And then it began like she was like listening."
"Speaker 2","00;45;42;05","00;45;55;18","Can I repeat this to my engage with this word correctly. And she just was very more much more careful in that. But both kids, as soon as they could talk, talked in their sleep like crazy. So anyway, there's like you start."
"Speaker 1","00;45;57;29","00;46;44;03","A stories the development of the self cueing and self speaking is very interesting even earlier on in behavioral analysis and behaviorism, like in B.F. Skinner's work, there's extensive exploration of how covert monologues and covert speech and societies of mind. And then I guess more recently it's become better understood how electrical activity in the body and in the brain are still initiated during covert speech like it's done audible speech, but actually in various ways it still is embodied."
"Speaker 1","00;46;45;21","00;47;19;28","And then this question of reading perhaps is another area where we're talking about in this language area, what is similar or different with listening to speech, participating in speech audibly? Is it different if it's read or Braille? How does the modality and the media influence some of these things in?"
"Speaker 3","00;47;19;28","00;47;55;04","Again, I think the proportions of two ears to one mouth is something that we need to kind of really hold on to in this idea of single source and monologue versus what potentially is a stereo log in a field of affordances as opposed to a single source. I don't know why why we've been I don't know what advantages are given by having an ability to hear in stereo, but it must be better than having a single year or a single a single reception site."
"Speaker 3","00;47;56;01","00;48;22;07","And yet we we don't have two mounts. So again, I think it's understandable why from a transmission point of view, a deliverer standpoint, we always collapse back to a source, a single source. But if we flip that and now think about it from the receiving standpoint, how does that how does that change our sense of what communication is?"
"Speaker 3","00;48;22;07","00;48;48;15","Because it doesn't change if I cover one of my years or if I have an earbud in and it cancels. And yet something fundamentally must change in terms of communication and the joint action, even if it's monologue in my own head versus dialog or trialogue required to log. Now again, I haven't done any research to try to try to figure out what other people have done in terms of looking at that."
"Speaker 3","00;48;48;15","00;49;24;07","But to your point, though, Renee, in terms of let's get this, we can get past transmission. We're going to try to get past the idea of what is being delivered and being trying to gain a deeper appreciation of what is being heard. So blue. I tell you a little story I had a loquacious son is in his thirties now, but he's actually, as he's gotten smarter and wiser, speaks less like occasionally he gets out of a developing words silence that could serve an entire community."
"Speaker 3","00;49;24;27","00;49;46;14","And I find that really fascinating. I don't have to comment on it. It's just you notice that as people no more, they maybe they sign more, maybe they find other ways to to make their point. And it goes back to that timing your take thing. So yeah."
"Speaker 1","00;49;46;14","00;50;16;11","Great. There's so many references like the true way is the one that can't be spoken of or those who do do and those who can't teach all these kinds of funny, you know, poking fun at different archetypes and so on and how that's related to wisdom. The two ears and one mouth, which you've been referencing throughout the conversations, and the Quadra Phonic Sound, Quadrophenia I'm sure it was amazing."
"Speaker 1","00;50;16;28","00;51;03;22","Drum And it, it is true that the enrichments and the spatial nature of heard sounds, soundscapes is it's like something that can't be turned off like the receiver. All of our receiving is bilateral visual nostrils and smell receptive is heavily multi-layered. It is, but it has a coarse bilateral symmetry. But the mouth, as our action states needs generative cohesion."
"Speaker 1","00;51;03;22","00;51;24;02","Perhaps just the just so story, but I don't know of any cases where there are now there are some bodily sounds that are bilateral, like perhaps the vibration of a cricket. So it's not that like sound production can't be bilateral."
"Speaker 4","00;51;24;13","00;51;24;20","Right?"
"Speaker 1","00;51;25;19","00;51;58;15","It's just that wherever sound production is localized on the sender, when we when we highlight content in its transmission, where does that account begin? What has to begin with the content and the representation in the sender? And then you could ask whether it was fully or partially or deceptively recognized by the recipients, potentially when we censor the recipients action, but even calling them a recipient kind of puts them onto a back foot."
"Speaker 1","00;51;58;15","00;52;45;09","We're just centering the agents engagement ecologically and they're interfacing with fields and affordances. Then we we do see that stereophonic enrichments of everything. And no matter how narrow or how many. Shannon bits or column are going off bits, it doesn't really matter because it's going to be unpacked in a generative model that brings in aspects that aren't and don't need to be in the signal and hence aren't or don't need to be in our account of the signaling."
"Speaker 3","00;52;45;09","00;53;13;04","Just think I'm trying to bring back the inference into the act of inference here, because the active part is definitely the transmission piece. So thank you for for reinforcing that. But I do I do wonder when we do bring the inference back, why are our sensing affordances are those bilateral forms? There must be some advantage to that. And so is it."
"Speaker 3","00;53;13;04","00;53;38;26","As Blue pointed out, because of as not just the heavy emphasis on the old, well, what was the product of my transmission? How am I pulling in this communication? And what advantages are there to not getting strung out or hung up on the mano log? The single source."
"Speaker 1","00;53;38;26","00;54;04;17","One thing that makes me think about is in caricature disinfo representations of bug vision, insect vision. It will look like they're seeing many separate cells, whereas if one were just to take a breath and think about their own visual experience, we don't see two fields of view, so it's like not really making sense why an insect would see multiple."
"Speaker 1","00;54;05;03","00;54;30;02","So the visual field because there's quote objects out there. We have all of these different ways that we can talk about how we know that we're experiencing an integrated generative model like the blind spot, the differences in visual acuity, in the peripheral vision, color vision in the periphery, ocular motorcycle aids in the way that attention is suppressed during secreting so that it's not causing just nausea."
"Speaker 1","00;54;30;11","00;54;56;12","All these features are really important and they point beyond a photon transmission view of vision into this generative stereophonic vision. And then in the audio setting, having multiple aural offices and also even covering them up like they're still transduction through the skull. And so on."
"Speaker 1","00;54;58;17","00;55;31;25","We are also seeking to flesh out a generative model of sounds in our environments. So if we cover our ears like that, proprioception will help us understand that even if something sounds kind of quiet, we actually can recognize that it's still a loud noise. Or if we have one ear in a pillow, we could recognize that something is happening even though if it is being heard differently on both sides."
"Speaker 1","00;55;31;25","00;56;10;02","So having multiple sensors is very compatible with a unified generative model experience because it forces one to abstract beyond any sensor reading. If you have one midline thermometer, then that's your point. Estimate for temperature. Or you could have like a Gaussian blur. Like I'm just less confident about the temperature further from my one central sensor. But maybe I'm it's a tight Gaussian, maybe it's very broad, but this is the best estimate."
"Speaker 1","00;56;11;03","00;56;57;01","Why would I have any other estimate centered anywhere else when you have to thermometers? Now, there's a generative modeling question about whether it's going to be a Gaussian with a peak in the middle or whether you're going to have a peak more on one side and have it just go through the other depending on those sensor readings. But at that point, you're ending up with some distributions which if we think of that distribution as like what is experienced, as like maybe the product of the sensing process that distributions enrichment is of a different type and yet of a different simplicity then any number of sensor readings in terms of what their raw information are."
"Speaker 1","00;56;57;25","00;57;20;20","So it seems very relevant this to ears, one mouth not just for listening twice as much as we speak, but for listening twice as actively as we speak or something like that. What do you think about census, Remmy?"
"Speaker 4","00;57;20;20","00;58;18;09","Yeah, I think that. I think that you you explained it well, it's yeah, I think it's useful to, as you said, to have sensory channels that can be active, because I think that's an argument from how we in its in its book in 2013 book on predictive predictive mind. I think it says that if you have a tribunal and you're trying to establish the culpability of the of a convict, you you hope that you have multiple independent sources of information, because if these sources of information are influenced each other, you have a less reliable I would say I forget the world at the moment in my years unknowingly in English."
"Speaker 4","00;58;18;09","00;58;48;04","So I forget the word. But you have less reliable information about the about the the the the case. So like it's useful from, from a reliability standpoint to to have multiple independent source of information. So, so that that may be an expression of why we have that maybe an explanation of there also of the relative modularity of of perception."
"Speaker 4","00;58;48;04","00;59;20;12","So there are we know that there are limits to that modularity, but there is a certain degree of independence in the different sensory modalities that we have. So yet about the two here is that obviously, I think maybe if we had if our auditory sensory system was only devised to communicative interaction, maybe it would be okay to just have one here, one because we could like we know who's talking to us."
"Speaker 4","00;59;20;12","00;59;52;17","And so we, we can direct our, our sensory apparatus so that there this communicative signal. But because we use our ears not just to to attuned to a communicative interaction, but also to know what's in our surroundings, it's really clearly more useful to have that to to have a greater reception from from information anywhere around us. So I maybe if if addition was only about communication, it would be okay to have just one ear."
"Speaker 4","00;59;52;17","01;00;07;22","But because we want to know as precisely what's happening there and at the same time know what's happening there, maybe it's it's it's there. It has been more useful to have these two here, two years on both sides. So maybe this is something about that that."
"Speaker 1","01;00;08;11","01;00;36;20","You have one short and then Dean is there are also animals with anatomy so that they can direct to their ears, which is seemingly very analogous to the ocular motor skating. It's like an audio sunshade and it just the human form outside of the ear wiggling, which is maybe slightly vestigial representation of that. But we have opted for a strategy with fixed ear positioning for the mobile neck, which also makes a cage."
"Speaker 1","01;00;36;20","01;00;42;02","So that's kind of our low speed audio skating thing."
"Speaker 3","01;00;43;15","01;01;04;13","Yeah, I think the only advantage I could see to having two models is that I could eat the French fries and drink milkshake at the same time and I don't know what that would be like, that just overpowering. But what I think is interesting is in dot one, Bluett brought up the idea of, So how do we make sure that there's a difference between content and context?"
"Speaker 3","01;01;04;13","01;01;31;11","And I think whether it's two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, whatever, there must be some advantage to the form because as I said, even if you cover one of those intakes, it's not just a redundancy issue, it's a recursion issue. It creates that ability to see context here context and smell context. I don't believe we would have those things."
"Speaker 3","01;01;31;27","01;01;48;28","And as I said, I think I'd get overwhelmed with context and having both French fries and milkshake, it would just blow me up. So but that that's just a statement that says as little self do not give people to models, it can be overpowering. Well."
"Speaker 1","01;01;49;07","01;02;36;21","One aspect might return us to the question of composition already it seems like visual composition and temporal composition in music and in heard speech as speaking in terms of generative models have highly fact or sizable or sparsely connected generative models famously connected to like the where and the what streams in visual neuroanatomy. And that's been explored in some active inference papers with awareness and whiteness as being factor sizable in the generative model because it really is the case that different layers can host different."
"Speaker 1","01;02;36;21","01;03;12;00","What's. And so it makes sense to have those two totally separate taste and smell which are there are more midline though there are two nostrils. I'm not totally sure on whether there's like, you know, one or two smell chambers or anything composition, chemical bouquets seems quite difference. Like two paintings that you like next to each other or to songs in succession that you like."
"Speaker 1","01;03;12;00","01;04;21;08","Or it's a little bit different than to smells or tastes sequentially or composed. And so maybe these more sometimes called basil, sensory or cognitive features are less affable. And this kind of relates to a, a cognitive stack where verbal and symbolic communication is like the tip of the iceberg, supported by biological processes that are differently or less affable and at first only pointed towards like through metaphors and speech, butterflies in my stomach and so on, but then ultimately entirely inexpressible, maybe with some stop in between, like being able to express through the body, like what it's like to do a certain bodily position or have a certain experience or be in a certain physiological state."
"Speaker 1","01;04;23;08","01;05;11;19","And this kind of casts a light on the transmission view, complementing the ecological view. The transmission view is like down, propagating symbolic communication and seeking for that to apply all the way on down, whereas a more bottom up and arguably eco evo devo informed perspective is grounded in the ecological setting and then allows for the crystallization of symbolic processes, including communicated symbolic processes which are aren't they supposed to be the stronghold of the transmission view?"
"Speaker 1","01;05;11;19","01;05;58;17","But then if even that phenomena can be captured within an ecological frame, then there's an extremely strong basis for the integrative cohesion of an ecological view, as opposed to extremely piecemeal and question begging transmission view. Like we talked about symbiosis and by osmosis in live stream 47, so will we see verbal communication and behavior as something that is enabled and with analogy, but not the same as cellular transduction?"
"Speaker 1","01;05;59;03","01;06;20;18","Or are we going to seek a cellular transduction explanation based on verbal behavior? Let's return to some of our topics. All right. Few areas to go blue. Any thoughts? Just anywhere you want."
"Speaker 2","01;06;20;18","01;06;43;17","Yeah. So I just wanted to follow up on what you said. And I just think that the beauty of the ecological approach to understanding communication is that communication between cells, bit semiotic representation or other, and between animals, maybe with gestures, maybe interspecies communication like, you know, you tell your cat, come here and the cat comes or dog or whatever."
"Speaker 2","01;06;43;24","01;07;21;12","So I think that that the ability to model systems, like all systems is very important. Like if, if the transmission view is not capable of representing all of the situations from cell to cell communication to human to dog communication and, and all along the line, I think that maybe it's in the way that the ACP inactive in France is still free and it's like doesn't have but I mean it's across any hierarchical temporal or cognitive scale."
"Speaker 2","01;07;21;22","01;07;32;21","I think that that the way that we view communication also needs to be broadly applicable."
"Speaker 1","01;07;32;21","01;07;33;10","Yes, really."
"Speaker 4","01;07;34;10","01;08;19;16","So yeah, that's the that's the aim. But clearly some people will say that sophisticated linguistic communication can thus be accounted for in terms of in terms of the ecological communication, because, as Daniel said, the symbolic communication characteristic of language seems to be too removed from the kind of basic interaction described by the ecological approach. So there's this like there's a lot of work to be done still to to really explain these the high level linguistic interactions that we have in our in terms of the of ecological in active communication."
"Speaker 4","01;08;19;23","01;08;51;01","But yeah, there's another example of, of communication, as you said we can that come to me before a communicative interaction between cells. But there's also there's been the work on communication between between and how plants perceive their their environment. In terms of affordances, there's been work on that. And so I think that there's it's just to say that there's it's another and another way in which we can develop the ecological approach."
"Speaker 4","01;08;51;10","01;09;34;17","And it seems that that if yeah. If any, any, any organisms, that organism that behaves in the organism will have a field of avoidance. And it seems that if it wants to act on other organisms in its environment, it will act in affecting its field of audience. And it looks like the kind of communication that is at play between trees, for instance, which alerts each other about, for instance, the threats in the, in the forest or sources of, of useful resources in the the ground."
"Speaker 4","01;09;34;23","01;10;03;24","So these kinds of modifications of of of of the yeah, of the I don't know exactly the mechanisms by which these the these these these communication take place, but we can also see them as modifications of, the field of affordances of tree. So I think that that was when I saw that I was really I thought it was really cool that the trees behaved at a really, really slower timescale, obviously."
"Speaker 4","01;10;03;24","01;10;30;12","But like behavior when they go in the sand, like their their roots in certain directions and things like that, we can see it as them exploring, their environment, them reacting to a field of avoidance that that they. So obviously that that's also controversial because there's all this debate about the cognitive status of of plants. And they do do they have a consciousness or a left thing."
"Speaker 4","01;10;30;12","01;10;51;21","But I think that we can see that they probably have something like a field of avoidance. And it seems that they can communicate with each other via these modifications of their field about power dense without us having to say that they are transmitting content, which would be really weird from the standpoint of a plant."
"Speaker 1","01;10;51;21","01;10;52;12","Thank you, blue."
"Speaker 2","01;10;53;23","01;11;19;26","So just like if you haven't seen the plant robot created by the MIT Media Lab, like, check it out because the plant, like they connected it to a set of wheels and a motor and literally will wheel itself back and forth from window to window, like searching for sunlight. So, so mean when you modify the field of affordances of a plant, it will it will take advantage of this affordances for movement or any other kind of thing."
"Speaker 2","01;11;19;26","01;11;53;20","And as to the complexity of like linguistic communication, okay. But like also like the complexity of cellular communication, especially in like developmental biology and all of the growth factors, signaling cues. And I mean it's highly complex and like the re combinatorial aspect is also incredibly crazy. Like I think it would take a lot to convince me that linguistic communication is more sophisticated or more advanced than biological communication in a developing organism."
"Speaker 2","01;11;54;03","01;11;57;22","I'm not sold on that."
"Speaker 1","01;11;57;22","01;12;00;06","Thanks, Steve."
"Speaker 3","01;12;00;06","01;12;28;21","Remy, can you help me understand a little bit more about the the influence piece in the joint action? If if I'm in Madrid, a lot of people who are trying to get my attention, I'm not I'm not I don't speak Spanish very well, just barely get by. And so a lot of times things are spoken to me and there is there seems to be a break in terms of the amount of sensing."
"Speaker 3","01;12;28;21","01;12;52;04","I get. And so that joint action could you maybe especially in the light of that earlier part where you talked about young kids, it appears they're talking to themselves, but they're talking to the world and maybe they're not influencing the world, but they would like to you maybe talk about that sort of sensing side of that joint action."
"Speaker 4","01;12;53;11","01;13;26;25","Yeah. So I think that what kids that alone are doing, they're not they learn to talk by talking to each other and affecting other persons. But when they learn to talk to each other, what they're doing, they're they're influencing themselves. I Think that that's the part about self cueing for what they're doing. They're, they're modifying their own field of affordances with their with their this is in their speech and that's how they the they they don't to self cue and self-regulate themselves by bringing some some images in mind or things like that."
"Speaker 4","01;13;26;25","01;13;58;11","So that's the I think that's what happens when the when the child learns to do to speak alone. And there's obviously a lot more to say about that when there's. So the question of of the of different languages when you're in another country and you don't so you're you're spoken to and you're not understanding correctly. But you you you pick up some some parts of what's said."
"Speaker 4","01;13;58;19","01;14;36;13","So I think that, um, I think that the, the learning of a language is often is up and understood as the, the, the, as the, as the learning code. So learning a set of associations between, between meanings and between forms that can be either written or spoken. But I think that in the approach that we're we are advancing here, learning the language is really more like learning, learning a skill."
"Speaker 4","01;14;36;24","01;15;08;29","So you learn you're learning to to speak and learning to understand and interact correctly in a given language. As you're learning to do anything else, you're learning to play a game. You're learning to like play hockey or play soccer or whatever is the same kind of learning. And you're learning to interact in that kind of game. And probably there's a similarity between various languages and because it's, there's, there's a similarity there's yeah."
"Speaker 4","01;15;09;08","01;15;35;11","Like, like very I would, I could talk about Wittgenstein there once, once again. But like there's this the various languages resemble each because they have this, this family resemblance. So because you have this familiarity with their speaking in a language, even when you're in another place where you don't understand the language, you have a basic grasp of some of the structures of the game that is being played."
"Speaker 4","01;15;35;11","01;16;01;06","And so from that context, you can get to understand some of the things that are said, understand, understand some of the things that are expected of you because you have this grasp of what kind of game is played when we speak our language. And so even if you're in in them in another country, when you don't speak the language from the context in which you find yourself you may be able to piece some things together."
"Speaker 4","01;16;01;23","01;16;25;24","Obviously, if you're like just in a place with absolutely no context, you're in a white room, completely empty and somebody is talking to you. You have no context. Probably you won't understand anything. But if you're in a context where you can understand that in some games of of there's some, some goals that are that are in place and some people around you are trying to achieve some goals."
"Speaker 4","01;16;25;29","01;16;52;07","You can apply your understanding the game that you play in your own language through this new language. And so you can get some things you can understand some things about what's what's what you have to do and how you should behave and how you can respond. But I think that that's a better way of understanding the kind of limited understanding that you have in this kind of interactions rather than in you having a code of your language."
"Speaker 4","01;16;52;07","01;17;11;29","And then you try to apply this code in this you I think that that then the idea of learning a skill, how to play a game is a better analogy to understanding how you come to learn a language and how you come to apply this this knowledge in other contexts where the language that is spoken is not the same that you that you're mastering."
"Speaker 3","01;17;12;13","01;17;22;21","Does that kind of confirm that it couldn't be content first, that it would have to be context bound?"
"Speaker 4","01;17;22;21","01;17;52;07","Yeah, in my view, the context is a central element in in in any interaction and in any cooperative communicative interaction. I think it's the it in the context, what I call the context in the paper appears as a shared of audience. So that's the audience that are present in the, in the, in the environmental context in which you find yourself in with the other person."
"Speaker 4","01;17;52;15","01;18;20;04","And that's, that's this element that often exists. The communicative interaction is a great, great source of constraint on the communicative interaction. So yeah, when you, when you're, you come to speak with somebody, you're almost never like in the absolutely context free place. You're always in a restaurant in there in I don't know, in the bus, in the in the in the grocery store."
"Speaker 4","01;18;20;06","01;18;42;29","You're somewhere and there's this basic set of affordances that are shared that you understand that you can do this, you cannot do that. And this this set of constraints offered by this charge feel about finances really drives and constrains, how the communicative interaction will unfold. So I think that even if you're in another country, a friend, the context will be hard to pick up."
"Speaker 4","01;18;42;29","01;19;04;12","But sometimes there will be shared context that you can get a grasp on and that you can that can save, that can lead to a I'm sorry, I'm losing my words. I can lead to an interaction that is that is optimal."
"Speaker 1","01;19;04;12","01;19;45;01","I brought it in the physical Rosetta Stone as a special case of of low context asynchronous. One can imagine there would be a million different contexts by which the analysis of the stone could have been accelerated, such as a person reading any of them, the rules or descriptions being enacted, or a labeled image, or any number of contexts that we would use to interpret and act upon the texts that we read in this setting where we were historically from the creation."
"Speaker 1","01;19;45;15","01;20;16;02","Then there's still was residual context, and it turned out that that was enough to interpret the symbolic materials. But this is not like the base communication case that we then need to see all communication and all learning and education of languages and active inference ontology as being like a Rosetta Stone, like the definitions of words are not codes to crack."
"Speaker 1","01;20;16;23","01;21;06;12","They're like inside jokes or ways of communicating on a sports team that have to do with the context of the setting and asynchronous modifications in the environments, especially symbolic asynchronous modifications which are relatively new, potentially existing in modern form for several hundreds to several thousands of years, depending on how we think about it. Symbolic asynchronous modification is although context communication, whereas even the interpretations of asynchronous symbolic communication still uses and embodies their context in the perception."
"Speaker 1","01;21;06;23","01;21;53;08","So we know that we have stereophonic communication just because we're stereophonic, even if we are getting just a morse code symbol. But it is a non non-controversial here. But interestingly, it sounds like elsewhere that we would want to think about communication broadly as, being action oriented and embedded rather than kind of like reverse engineered from the kinds of artifacts that we have today with quite literally computer codes and other kinds of, you know, Turing computers and so on."
"Speaker 1","01;21;53;08","01;21;55;15","Okay."
"Speaker 4","01;21;55;15","01;22;13;03","I think that you often they explain the idea that the ideas that I'm trying to convey really better than me then, you know, I'm not really fluent in English. So I thank you for explaining better than me the idea that I'm trying to say thank you."
"Speaker 1","01;22;13;24","01;22;24;15","I appreciate it. You wrote the paper and so it's unsurprising. It seems novel and I couldn't say in any other way."
"Speaker 2","01;22;24;15","01;22;35;04","Even when you speak English, Daniel can still like better than than you communicate more effectively. The idea is that you're trying to convey, even when English as your first language well."
"Speaker 1","01;22;35;17","01;23;23;11","Context is non-fungible. So I don't think that there can be a best or a final communication. It's just like a best or a final species or state for an ecosystem to be in. And I guess in the last 25 minutes or however, now that our ecosystem has been modified, however it has been in these conversations and through reading and opening up threads, how will it shape our field of affordances and how will we stream and play differently in."
"Speaker 3","01;23;23;11","01;23;55;05","So I'm curious from all from all three of you as a strategy, if you want to get past monologue, what do you do? How many times do you play play in play? So as an example of like a real pertinent one right now, the way that the live streams have been set up, I've always been sort of a pre brief an introduction with the authors, a play and then a play, a debrief piece to this."
"Speaker 3","01;23;55;14","01;24;23;06","And so the communication is never left as a, as a one off exercise. I just read the paper. There's a, there's, there is affordances set up to interact with information to be able to receive it at multiple different time points. Because I think in the DOT one, you said we could look at it as slices of time, but that's probably not accurate in terms of of the dynamic that's in play."
"Speaker 3","01;24;23;14","01;24;57;10","So one of the things the Active Insurance Institute also does is has textbook group. Now, I've not been a part of the text group, book group, and I don't know whether they do it in sets of three as well to create that kind of triangulation so that the interaction with the communication doesn't become monolithic or monastic or here's, here's the words that have come down now off the mount, accept them and start start carrying them out."
"Speaker 3","01;24;57;10","01;25;27;29","Even though you don't have a context, right? That chiseling them into the stone doesn't increase their priority. At least if you don't. The context. So what I'm curious about from the three of you is if you want to get past instructional ism in terms or if you want to get past transmission, is there a basic requirement to have multiple reinterpretations or at least the opportunity to reinterpret like that from a communication standpoint?"
"Speaker 3","01;25;28;10","01;25;47;15","Do we must we have reflection and time for that? We have to have time built in for that. Or are we are we then bound to a transmit of state all anybody can answer yes."
"Speaker 1","01;25;47;15","01;25;50;15","Bloopers."
"Speaker 2","01;25;50;15","01;26;16;25","So it's not like in the way that we have reflection like we have a pre brief and then the actual brief and then and then the reflection time in the livestream series. So, so not in that way but, but I do think that in this in effective communication there is like reflection as an essential component of that, like communication."
"Speaker 2","01;26;16;25","01;26;39;05","When you have a conversation, it's shouldn't be about just waiting for your turn to talk. I mean, there should be some reflection of what the other person is saying in what you're saying. Back to them like, Hello, how are you doing today? I want scrambled eggs. Like if that was a conversation went, it wouldn't be it wouldn't work, right?"
"Speaker 2","01;26;39;05","01;26;53;24","Like so there has to be some element of reflecting back what the other person is saying to you in communication that's effective. It's not just this like Tower of disjointed blocks being built."
"Speaker 1","01;26;53;24","01;26;54;14","Yes. For me."
"Speaker 4","01;26;55;15","01;27;22;07","Yeah. I think I think that what you said to do is is interesting. And the really important element of cooperative communication is that when you're talking to somebody, when you're in the dialog, you have to concede a part of your autonomy. You have to accept to be regulated by the other person. And that's, I think, where some people, ooh, like talk past each other and don't listen to each other."
"Speaker 4","01;27;22;08","01;27;49;06","An interaction that happens really often some friends don't like. It seems like when when they're waiting, they're just waiting. When they're listening, they're just waiting to see what they want to say. So these people don't like don't respect the kind of pragmatic principle of like you have to to pay attention to what the other person is saying and to have a proper to have a correct communicative interaction, you have to concede the like."
"Speaker 4","01;27;49;06","01;28;14;25","You have to accept that your field of life audience is regulated by the person who's talking to you. You have to let yourself be influenced, be constrained by the person that was talking to you just because you you have to listen to it and you have to refrain from like turning away and go go do something else. So you have to like it's it's really just accepting, conceding a part of your autonomy."
"Speaker 4","01;28;14;25","01;28;50;08","And that's another idea from people always in that kind of approach of language where there's in communicative interaction and cooperative interaction, but in communicative interaction in particular, you have to write in a bit a part of your field about for a dance to participate in this interaction and listen. Because suppose that what I'm saying is really boring to you and you just want to go eat your piece of cake in the, in the fridge like us to, in order to participate, to maintain the interaction, you have to inhibit this."
"Speaker 4","01;28;50;14","01;29;09;24","There's that forward to the solicitation and to a to to let me regulate your your your field about for a dance. And so there's this part of like I can that I concede something in order to maintain the interaction and when there is no no more interest or I'm not able to to I don't want to to be regulated."
"Speaker 4","01;29;09;24","01;29;49;21","And there's another solicitation outside the interaction that's more interesting to me. But then I will leave the interaction. But to maintain the interaction you have to have a and a capacity of inhibition that exert the executive some form of what would be called executive control to be able to listen and take what the person is saying. If you don't have that, you're just going to think about something else and not let yourself be take be constrained by the communicative acts of the other person."
"Speaker 1","01;29;49;21","01;30;29;10","So back to Dean's point about multiple art and multiplayer communication and engagements when we only have one communication, then it can feel like a transmission, like the Rosetta Stone transmitted from the past. We don't get a dot two or a dot one on the Rosetta Stone structuring learning groups and other activities and relationships and cooperative communication as something unfolding."
"Speaker 1","01;30;29;28","01;31;15;23","Bumping into each other twice says something about those particles that bumping together just once dozens. It's almost like what I say once is an accident, twice as a coincidence three times is a party or something like that. So especially with three, because one three there may be a enough of recurrent engagements and interweaving to support reflection development to de-emphasize any single of those events, because none of them are even half of the total series of three."
"Speaker 1","01;31;16;10","01;31;43;12","So none of them can even be said to be a plurality or a majority if the .01 and two were to vote to vote one of them out or something like that. And I think it does point towards the reality of our continued interaction with materials and then towards structures that allow us to engage naturally."
"Speaker 4","01;31;44;03","01;32;25;20","Remy I think that's what communicating in there repetitively the same people, what it achieves, it's, it obviously it shapes the generative model, it aligns them in some way. So we come share expectations and share fields of affordances. So it clearly eases communicative interaction because we don't have to communicate as much when we there. There's this tradeoff between if you have a lot of shared context, you don't have you don't have to communicate as much."
"Speaker 4","01;32;25;20","01;32;56;21","And if you don't have a lot of shared context, you have to communicate more to, to, to, to a yeah. As a useful to have a productive interaction. And so what I think we we have done is we have aligned our different models in ways that helps us understand each other better than we did at the beginning. For instance, we can refer to things that we said in the past we can say, Oh, well, when you said that."
"Speaker 4","01;32;58;04","01;33;34;06","So I think that's relevant now. And so we can make can point to relations, to things that we said earlier. So there's this and there's this continual easing of communication when you have repetitive, communicative interaction, somebody that's I think that I think is the way we can come to believe that the people we are living with, we can read each other's mind with or without talking, because there's so much shared context that something can happen and it can make us think some something that is shared without us even saying anything."
"Speaker 4","01;33;34;06","01;33;50;07","So There's this in this context come to be really complex and really, really deep. And so yeah, interacting repetitively obviously is, is communication."
"Speaker 1","01;33;50;07","01;34;30;16","Okay, so we can meet multiple times due preparation, engagement and reflection before, during and after a communication and structure communication so that there are multiple such kind of peaks and troughs. We can talk about aligning or synchronizing in the general synchronous sense, not making it identical, but rather coordinating our generative models through perception and learning. As you mentioned it helps us understand each other better."
"Speaker 1","01;34;31;03","01;34;50;27","Like a goal of a communication could be epistemic let's get to know each other and. It could also have an element of pragmatic value, like let's take epistemic action to find out if a collaboration is relevant here and then we're going to engage in these pragmatic actions."
"Speaker 4","01;34;51;26","01;35;30;28","Remmy Yeah, and I think that a lot of interaction that we share in our academic and elite linguistic and advanced societies really often look like transmission interaction. So we are seeing things that we're thinking to each other. But I think that these epistemic are communicative in terms of transmission. These communicative transmission interactions are are the way they are because they are explicit aims of the interaction in which we are engaged."
"Speaker 4","01;35;30;28","01;35;57;27","That is, we are transmitting content now when we're talking to each other because in a way that that's the goal of the interaction. But in other contexts like it's because we have come get these practices that we have developed that we can have these, these goals that can drive an interaction. And if we're at the grocery store, if we're at another context, we're doing something, something else."
"Speaker 4","01;35;57;27","01;36;27;20","But when we're in academic contexts, often the goal of the interactions is talking about ideas, transmitting some, some, some contents, transmitting some, some, some theories, for instance, extending theories, explaining arguments. And so these interactions, we look at them and we're like, that's clearly there's we're transmitting content when we're talking. But the idea is that this is really a small subset of the cases of communicative interaction that we engage in in everyday life."
"Speaker 4","01;36;27;29","01;37;00;15","And we take these as paradigmatic cases of communicative interaction. And when they are really the pinnacle of the linguistic civilization, we're in a really rarefied context where academic discussions are not what we do in everyday settings. When we talk to each other and we we do this, it's because it's an explicit aim of our interaction now that we do this."
"Speaker 4","01;37;00;15","01;37;25;16","But in other cases, in many most cases, when we speak to each other, that's not the aim. The explicit aim is not to transfer some information or talk about theories. It's about doing things together. And now we're doing something together. We're talking about active inference, but it looks as if it can be understood in in terms of content sharing and content transmission."
"Speaker 4","01;37;25;16","01;37;37;21","But that's because it's the goal of of our interaction. It's not because it's the nature of communication. And I don't know if I'm being clear yet."
"Speaker 1","01;37;38;11","01;37;39;19","Dingyadi or Henry, but."
"Speaker 3","01;37;40;16","01;38;03;10","I just I think I don't want to put my philosopher's cap on, but I will. Just briefly, I think we use language of communication to save time. It's an exploitation strategy. And so think when we put a 13 week set of parentheses around a learning moment or opportunity, we oftentimes get it, get the cart ahead of the horse."
"Speaker 3","01;38;03;10","01;38;51;19","Don't we don't see the pragmatics because we're busy transmitting. And what ends up happening is the plan forward that affords that exploitation or optimization or savings of time jumps ahead of practice to participate in the permeate. Now we can see that's a luxury. But is it if we don't respect the fact that people maybe don't necessarily learn as well when they're handed the plan, as opposed to given an opportunity to build one or form one themselves through preparation, participation, permeation, we could go away from this live stream and each of us could literally now design a better plan as opposed to Remi came to us with a plan."
"Speaker 3","01;38;51;24","01;39;19;13","What really came to us what was a sketch. And then we craft participated and permeated that network that the sophistication of whatever comes out of that in terms of a go for each one of us is orders of magnitude greater because somebody didn't say, Oh, well, I've only got 13 weeks. I don't have the luxury to be able to be pragmatic about this."
"Speaker 3","01;39;20;10","01;39;48;14","So there I'll, I'll take my hat off again. I don't mean to sermonizing, but I think when we actually feel what it's like to let the plan naturally evolve and become a part of the ecology as opposed to driving the ecology, the single source, it changes everything. And over and over again, every time we have one of these three set live streams, it reinforces what you could do."
"Speaker 3","01;39;48;14","01;40;18;01","And again, you don't even have to be on the the zoo as long as you get over the amount of time to see and sense what it's like to prep, participate. And I think the most important one of all, stick around for the premiere because that's where the real nuggets seem to to Daniels metaphor of icebergs, things float to the surface when you give it enough time."
"Speaker 3","01;40;18;01","01;40;37;08","But I understand there's also a 13 week window. And when paying thousands of dollars to to sit in your class and come on, exploit the daylights out of your communication. And I just don't know that people don't realize that they're cutting off their noses to spite their they're learning."
"Speaker 1","01;40;38;01","01;41;29;19","So interesting a lot their permeation letting it pervade our generative model or percolate, letting those messages be passed, letting that ripple or the perturbation take effect slower and deeper levels and it is really a challenge when the logistical and transmission aspects of communication are scaffolded. And those are like the metadata fields that have to be filled out, the boxes that have to be checked, and they can feel constraining."
"Speaker 1","01;41;29;19","01;41;44;20","Yet simply removing them is not a positive solution. And so the path of least action for many learning scenarios is to replicate the prior."
"Speaker 3","01;41;45;13","01;41;45;20","You're."
"Speaker 1","01;41;46;28","01;42;32;14","Over the decades a professor who might teach the same class in the same way. And there's pros and cons to that. In fact, some of the most enlightened learning communities have like a vibrancy that transcends an almost ironically static learning experience. Like, we all read this thing. So it's not that that I think the mode of communication and cooperation in education that we're exploring here means that every single experience is going to be like some kind of full attention, transformative depth psychology."
"Speaker 1","01;42;33;12","01;43;22;03","I think it would feel more normal and natural and just like participating in a cool ecosystem that works with that individual's situation, what else can we add or where can we go? Where is active inference in all of this? Where do you see active inference? Not like, you know, what are your intentions with my child, but where is active inference in your further research agenda?"
"Speaker 4","01;43;22;03","01;44;22;08","Remmy I think it gives the, the like a all encompassing framework and yeah, the, the, the, the abstract ness of their framework allows us to apply it to, as we said, lights come and get the communication between cells and communication between like countries or, or groups of individuals with this multi-scale property of active and friends I think is really useful in the, in allowing us to describe communicative interaction, these various kinds of, of free energy, minimizing agents and I so there's this that's, that's useful."
"Speaker 4","01;44;22;15","01;44;54;29","I think that yeah, the, the, the learning mechanisms that are that are at work in active inference are really useful also to explain how communicative interaction is conducted in our repeated communicative interaction can lead to a form of synchronizing of degenerative models, as has been explored by Vasyl in the paper and in 2020, I think. So I think that's that's really useful."
"Speaker 4","01;44;54;29","01;45;32;29","And there's a lot of a lot of things that that I think we can take from the active inference framework. And yet the the idea that all I think this fundamental intuition is that all all action is screen energy minimization that's trivial that this but I think there's a pragmatist insights in active inference that we can use to to to support the pragmatist view of communication."
"Speaker 4","01;45;32;29","01;45;57;25","Yeah. That everything that an organism does it does it to minimize it through energy and active inference is no different. And a communicative active inference as a of active inference also aims to minimize the free energy of an overturned denizen. And so when an organism tries, it finds itself in a situation where it's there's a lot of free energy or there's a lot of error prediction."
"Speaker 4","01;45;57;25","01;46;31;23","It will try to engage in its and intervene its environment in order to bring itself back in the available, viable states. And so all these ideas and when we apply them to communication, I think they lead not necessarily by implication, but I think the there's a path to these ideas, the to the pragmatic view of communication the idea that communication is another form of is just a mechanism of regulation of organisms in order to minimize their free energy."
"Speaker 4","01;46;31;23","01;47;08;25","I think there is this kind of basic biological and understanding of the behavior of organism. I think it leads us more toward the pragmatist view of communication rather than toward the the more informational or transmission view that is that is more at home in our like really a highly advanced and complex linguistic interaction. And I think that this like basic biologic framework is a good place to start to understand communication in the pragmatist, you."
"Speaker 1","01;47;10;20","01;47;39;29","A very nice answer all I'll read a comment from Stephen and then we can give a thought on it well as provide some closing thoughts. So Stephen wrote Explicit aims of interaction are important and can be invisible. Thus communication appears to be based on transmission. Should we identify the context through the affordances or via naming the water like the water we swim in?"
"Speaker 1","01;47;40;24","01;48;01;12","That is is the context and the explicit aims apparent via the affordances? Or is there a special source that flavors? The cultural waters in which we are swimming? Yes, in special sauce."
"Speaker 3","01;48;01;20","01;48;28;21","Real quick on that, I think what maybe he did build on what Remi just said. I think perhaps active inference opens up that space is to the to the idea of a special sauce. It doesn't guarantee that there will be one, and it certainly doesn't promise. But what it does do is it says what are the possibilities within this, not just what are we collapsing down to?"
"Speaker 3","01;48;29;03","01;48;58;18","I mean, throughout this series, I've been talking a lot about, well, we can't leave the absolutes, the things that we've experience out of this equation. But I think what the what I think the active inference affords is that those relativity, those in those those entanglements and those entanglements always to be determined can be moved towards and and maybe accepted with with more abundance if we use active inference."
"Speaker 3","01;48;58;18","01;49;01;06","But that's just my optimistic take on."
"Speaker 1","01;49;04;12","01;49;27;06","Do you have any other closing words before we hear some final thoughts from the others? Excellent. Okay. Blue or Remi with some final thoughts. How's this? How will it permeate with you?"
"Speaker 4","01;49;27;06","01;49;52;23","Okay. So I'll go ahead. So, yeah, I was really happy to have the chance to talk about the paper with you. I think that one of the most important things that I take home is that now I have a really salient solicitation to go see the planet robots in action. So like, and the second that I close the Zoom meeting, I'm going to go see that."
"Speaker 4","01;49;53;02","01;50;21;21","That's really something that I'm taking from the citizen discussion. But yeah, no, it was really interesting to see different perspectives, different backgrounds and what, what these different differing backgrounds can bring to a discussion that is. I think that was really enlightening for me and I was really happy to, to be there."
"Speaker 2","01;50;21;21","01;50;48;12","Just say thanks for coming. I mean, we really enjoyed this discussion. And for me, I think what will permeate is like the, you know, everything I think about now, I just like think about how can I model this in terms of active events? And I feel like this paper will, you know, influence maybe way that I think about communication, which is a big part of modeling active influence period, especially like in a multi-agent dynamical system."
"Speaker 2","01;50;48;12","01;51;00;21","So I think I will probably leverage the psychological approach in the way that I think about it going forward. So I appreciate the opportunity to learn about it."
"Speaker 1","01;51;00;21","01;52;05;21","Awesome. My closing thought. What I'm left with here is active inference as about affordances. It is about the content of the model is about affordances and active inference is affordances. It allows us to realize epistemic and pragmatic value today and in the future. And in that way we can see it as a gripper and gripped, just like we could talk about the hand as gripper and gripped, whether it's holding hands or grabbing an object and, especially in this thought to some very nice points added on language as gripper and gripped and this kind of breakaway verbal community of research and scholarly education and academia, and recognizing that breakaway community and skill as something that's crystallizing"
"Speaker 1","01;52;05;21","01;52;43;26","out of a much more inclusive and pragmatic oriented niche. And I think that will be a win win framing because it will help ground what can be abstract and lofty discussions and also elevate and bring what bring attention and support to some areas and types of communication that are absolutely natural in the field of affordances view and the ecological view, but are not always respected so highly under like a symbolic transmission view."
"Speaker 1","01;52;44;13","01;53;07;24","And the closing image for me is making the source. I'm just imagining it's like, I don't know, SpongeBob SquarePants or someone's trying to cook and make the sauce, but we're adding things and it's more just like happening in this diffuse of space. And in a way, all kitchens are in fluids. That's why we can smell what we're cooking."
"Speaker 1","01;53;07;24","01;53;30;10","But it's different enough that the sauce stays in the pan. And I think the social and action of active inference is when the sauce is spilling out of the pan. All right, Remy, you're always welcome back, so hopefully you'll share some developments in this line. Good luck with the rest of your work."
"Speaker 3","01;53;31;18","01;53;32;10","Thanks to all of you."
"Speaker 1","01;53;32;29","01;53;33;29","All right. Farewell."
"Speaker 4","01;53;35;12","01;53;37;19","My."
