"00;01;33;02","00;01;35;22","fellows in the conversation,","1"
"00;01;35;22","00;01;38;11","we had some explorations into","1"

"00;01;41;14","00;01;44;19","Perhaps we can each say hello again","1"

"00;01;47;00","00;01;48;29","that we remember from last week,","1"
"00;01;48;29","00;01;51;19","or that we'd like to explore today.","1"
"00;01;51;23","00;01;54;08","And then we can just be right in it.","1"
"00;01;55;03","00;01;57;04","So I'm Daniel.","1"
"00;01;57;04","00;01;58;21","I'm in California","1"

"00;02;02;22","00;02;06;01","half the back nine of the paper","1"
"00;02;06;19","00;02;08;24","and see where we go,","1"
"00;02;08;24","00;02;10;03","which is kind of what we do","1"
"00;02;10;03","00;02;12;21","in Dot Two's usually.","1"
"00;02;13;07","00;02;15;13","And I just have a feeling that","1"

"00;02;20;09","00;02;22;23","may put our communication","1"

"00;02;49;12","00;02;53;23","Yeah, I am a blue","1"

"00;02;55;25","00;02;58;03","and I am excited to dig","1"

"00;03;00;17","00;03;01;08","I think we left","1"

"00;03;06;25","00;03;08;24","excited to get to maybe more","1"
"00;03;08;24","00;03;10;23","into the meat of the paper itself","1"
"00;03;10;23","00;03;12;08","as opposed to just","1"
"00;03;12;08","00;03;14;17","discussing tangential ideas.","1"
"00;03;15;15","00;03;17;00","And I'll pass today.","1"
"00;03;18;01","00;03;18;16","Thanks Blue.","1"
"00;03;18;16","00;03;21;08","I'm I'm here in Calgary.","1"
"00;03;21;08","00;03;22;02","I'm interested in","1"
"00;03;22;02","00;03;23;01","seeing whether or not","1"
"00;03;23;01","00;03;23;29","the big road map","1"
"00;03;23;29","00;03;24;23","that I think that","1"
"00;03;24;23","00;03;26;16","this paper provides","1"
"00;03;26;16","00;03;29;28","also can be explained as a big score, as","1"
"00;03;30;04","00;03;30;17","as in a","1"
"00;03;30;17","00;03;32;26","kind of a musical analogy,","1"
"00;03;32;26","00;03;35;08","because I'm really interested in the,","1"
"00;03;35;08","00;03;36;03","in the interplay","1"
"00;03;36;03","00;03;36;26","or the interaction","1"
"00;03;36;26","00;03;39;07","between orchestration and arrangements.","1"
"00;03;39;07","00;03;40;14","We yesterday","1"
"00;03;40;14","00;03;42;13","there was a math string","1"
"00;03;42;13","00;03;44;18","that where our guest was","1"
"00;03;45;17","00;03;47;15","really good at sort of","1"
"00;03;47;15","00;03;50;05","describing the arrangement part of","1"
"00;03;50;05","00;03;51;15","of what's going on","1"
"00;03;51;15","00;03;53;16","and active inference potentially.","1"
"00;03;53;16","00;03;55;01","And so I'm really kind of interested","1"
"00;03;55;01","00;03;55;24","in looking at that","1"
"00;03;55;24","00;03;56;20","because","1"
"00;03;56;27","00;03;59;18","I think from a transmission versus","1"
"00;03;59;19","00;04;00;26","ecological standpoint,","1"
"00;04;00;26","00;04;02;16","we're kind of looking at the difference","1"
"00;04;02;16","00;04;04;17","between mono and stereo.","1"
"00;04;04;17","00;04;06;19","So I'm wondering if we should maybe","1"
"00;04;06;19","00;04;09;15","look at that through that lens capacity.","1"
"00;04;09;15","00;04;10;08","Remi","1"
"00;04;12;04","00;04;14;19","I I'm though I'm","1"
"00;04;14;27","00;04;18;07","a researcher at Cannes in Montreal","1"
"00;04;18;07","00;04;21;16","and I'm the author of the paper,","1"
"00;04;21;16","00;04;22;23","and I'm looking forward","1"
"00;04;22;23","00;04;26;06","to discussing the paper more in detail","1"
"00;04;26;06","00;04;28;07","and maybe go to","1"
"00;04;28;07","00;04;31;00","towards the later parts of the paper","1"
"00;04;31;05","00;04;32;27","and maybe talk about a bit","1"
"00;04;32;27","00;04;34;11","about the language","1"
"00;04;34;11","00;04;36;16","and linguistic communication,","1"
"00;04;36;16","00;04;38;11","which is a big piece","1"
"00;04;38;11","00;04;40;28","that is looming behind the paper,","1"
"00;04;40;28","00;04;42;02","but it's not really","1"
"00;04;42;02","00;04;43;17","that much discussed in it,","1"
"00;04;43;17","00;04;46;02","but I think that's the way to that.","1"
"00;04;46;06","00;04;46;18","That's what","1"
"00;04;46;18","00;04;49;06","an account of communication aims to","1"
"00;04;49;22","00;04;50;15","go towards.","1"
"00;04;50;15","00;04;52;04","So I hope we'll have","1"
"00;04;52;04","00;04;55;27","the chance to discuss it a little bit.","1"
"00;04;56;14","00;04;58;26","Let's go to language.","1"
"00;04;59;13","00;05;01;00","It's what we're using,","1"
"00;05;01;00","00;05;03;01","among other modalities.","1"
"00;05;03;15","00;05;06;00","But we are using language and","1"
"00;05;06;18","00;05;07;23","so that sounds like a","1"
"00;05;07;23","00;05;10;12","great place to start.","1"
"00;05;10;12","00;05;11;25","So what was in the paper","1"
"00;05;11;25","00;05;13;15","regarding language","1"
"00;05;13;15","00;05;16;03","and what was not in the paper regarding","1"
"00;05;16;03","00;05;24;13","language?","1"
"00;05;24;17","00;05;25;03","Yeah. So","1"
"00;05;26;15","00;05;27;23","the the idea","1"
"00;05;27;23","00;05;29;26","was to open a window","1"
"00;05;30;29","00;05;32;02","at the end of the paper","1"
"00;05;32;02","00;05;33;02","towards that language.","1"
"00;05;33;02","00;05;35;22","So we talked a bit about conventional","1"
"00;05;36;25","00;05;39;10","forms of communication and we know that","1"
"00;05;39;18","00;05;41;03","most people believe","1"
"00;05;41;03","00;05;43;00","that language is conventional.","1"
"00;05;43;00","00;05;45;13","So we tried to tie","1"
"00;05;45;13","00;05;47;21","the are are","1"
"00;05;47;21","00;05;50;10","the ideas that we put forward","1"
"00;05;50;10","00;05;53;01","in the paper with work by Hampstead","1"
"00;05;53;20","00;05;55;22","in a paper of 2016","1"
"00;05;55;22","00;05;57;19","about conventional affordances.","1"
"00;05;57;19","00;06;00;05","So we tried to say that","1"
"00;06;00;21","00;06;02;20","that the linguistic community,","1"
"00;06;02;20","00;06;04;24","the conventional nature of the language","1"
"00;06;04;24","00;06;05;05","comes","1"
"00;06;05;05","00;06;06;02","from the","1"
"00;06;06;02","00;06;07;15","conventional affordances","1"
"00;06;07;15","00;06;10;23","that are generated in the, in the,","1"
"00;06;11;01","00;06;12;25","the communicative interaction.","1"
"00;06;12;25","00;06;13;15","So that's what,","1"
"00;06;13;15","00;06;14;01","that's the","1"
"00;06;14;01","00;06;15;03","way to point","1"
"00;06;15;03","00;06;17;16","toward language in our account.","1"
"00;06;18;03","00;06;18;28","And","1"
"00;06;19;22","00;06;22;04","we talked a bit about the act.","1"
"00;06;22;04","00;06;23;09","So different types","1"
"00;06;23;09","00;06;26;01","of active language, so","1"
"00;06;26;06","00;06;28;07","informative or","1"
"00;06;28;07","00;06;29;15","or declarative","1"
"00;06;29;15","00;06;31;18","and interrogative imperative.","1"
"00;06;31;18","00;06;32;25","So these kinds of distinctions,","1"
"00;06;32;25","00;06;35;03","we try to account for them","1"
"00;06;35;03","00;06;36;03","in our framework.","1"
"00;06;36;03","00;06;39;14","So are these are various parts","1"
"00;06;39;14","00;06;40;16","of what we considered","1"
"00;06;40;16","00;06;41;16","to be language","1"
"00;06;41;16","00;06;43;09","that we tried to treat in the paper.","1"
"00;06;43;09","00;06;44;14","But there's a lot of things","1"
"00;06;44;14","00;06;45;09","that we","1"
"00;06;45;18","00;06;48;02","couldn't discuss, obviously,","1"
"00;06;48;02","00;06;49;17","because it was like in the","1"
"00;06;49;17","00;06;51;12","in the small section","1"
"00;06;51;12","00;06;51;20","and the","1"
"00;06;51;20","00;06;53;02","at the end we cannot like explain","1"
"00;06;53;02","00;06;54;21","all of language.","1"
"00;06;54;21","00;06;54;28","Yeah.","1"
"00;06;54;28","00;06;56;27","Even in their paper or in their book","1"
"00;06;56;27","00;06;57;10","and so,","1"
"00;06;57;10","00;06;58;20","so in the small section,","1"
"00;06;58;20","00;07;00;02","that would be obviously way","1"
"00;07;00;02","00;07;05;09","too ambitious.","1"
"00;07;05;09","00;07;07;12","What are we looking to explain","1"
"00;07;07;20","00;07;10;12","or what is needed for language to be","1"
"00;07;12;07","00;07;14;06","encompassed or at home","1"
"00;07;14;06","00;07;17;26","or native to the ecological view,","1"
"00;07;19;15","00;07;21;25","rather than the transmission view,","1"
"00;07;21;25","00;07;27;19","or in addition to the transmission view?","1"
"00;07;27;19","00;07;30;16","Read me first then others.","1"
"00;07;30;16","00;07;30;23","Yeah.","1"
"00;07;30;23","00;07;34;03","A point that is interesting is that","1"
"00;07;34;03","00;07;36;09","the transmission view comes with the","1"
"00;07;38;14","00;07;40;07","opposition about what","1"
"00;07;40;07","00;07;42;29","has to be explained by a theory of","1"
"00;07;44;08","00;07;45;07","of language.","1"
"00;07;45;07","00;07;46;16","It comes with the idea","1"
"00;07;46;16","00;07;48;25","that we have to account for the meaning","1"
"00;07;51;10","00;07;52;05","of the","1"
"00;07;52;05","00;07;54;01","the expressions that are used first.","1"
"00;07;54;01","00;07;54;27","So we have to understand","1"
"00;07;54;27","00;07;56;05","whether the meaning","1"
"00;07;56;05","00;07;59;06","of the words that we use and how","1"
"00;07;59;18","00;08;00;08","these meanings","1"
"00;08;00;08","00;08;01;02","are encoded","1"
"00;08;01;02","00;08;02;07","in the, in the brains","1"
"00;08;02;07","00;08;04;14","and the heads of the","1"
"00;08;04;14","00;08;06;19","of the speakers of other language.","1"
"00;08;07;03","00;08;09;14","But that's","1"
"00;08;09;14","00;08;11;09","misleading from the point of view","1"
"00;08;11;09","00;08;12;29","that we adopt in the papers.","1"
"00;08;12;29","00;08;16;18","So this it's kind of hard to say","1"
"00;08;17;11","00;08;18;23","what we have to explain","1"
"00;08;18;23","00;08;19;17","in order to explain","1"
"00;08;19;17","00;08;21;10","language, because for so long","1"
"00;08;22;18","00;08;24;12","we have based in","1"
"00;08;24;12","00;08;25;09","we have","1"
"00;08;25;10","00;08;29;18","been in the the the transmission view.","1"
"00;08;29;18","00;08;32;06","And so we are used to believe","1"
"00;08;32;06","00;08;33;21","that in order to explain language,","1"
"00;08;33;21","00;08;35;00","we have to explain these kinds","1"
"00;08;35;00","00;08;36;13","of contents.","1"
"00;08;36;13","00;08;39;09","That language transmits so","1"
"00;08;39;14","00;08;42;05","but if we do away with these contents,","1"
"00;08;42;13","00;08;45;12","it's kind of the open the question of","1"
"00;08;45;20","00;08;47;05","how do you account for language.","1"
"00;08;47;05","00;08;49;13","It becomes kind of open in a new way.","1"
"00;08;50;01","00;08;52;02","And I don't really know","1"
"00;08;52;02","00;08;54;18","exactly what we have to account","1"
"00;08;54;18","00;08;57;01","for in order to account for language,","1"
"00;08;57;01","00;08;59;19","because it kind of changes","1"
"00;08;59;19","00;09;02;00","our view of what language is.","1"
"00;09;02;00","00;09;05;10","So I think there's a lot of open space","1"
"00;09;06;23","00;09;09;16","in there in this question of","1"
"00;09;09;16","00;09;10;23","how do we account for language","1"
"00;09;10;23","00;09;11;29","if we do away","1"
"00;09;11;29","00;09;14;05","with the transmission, you.","1"
"00;09;16;20","00;09;23;02","D or blue.","1"
"00;09;23;02","00;09;28;20","You got blue.","1"
"00;09;28;20","00;09;29;18","So I just looked,","1"
"00;09;29;18","00;09;30;21","looking back over the paper,","1"
"00;09;30;21","00;09;33;05","I think it might be useful to","1"
"00;09;33;22","00;09;37;29","maybe delineate the the specific types","1"
"00;09;37;29","00;09;39;26","of language interactive","1"
"00;09;39;26","00;09;41;26","versus imperatives","1"
"00;09;41;26","00;09;43;17","and like the specific,","1"
"00;09;43;17","00;09;45;07","the specificities underlying","1"
"00;09;45;07","00;09;46;28","each one of those right now","1"
"00;09;46;28","00;09;49;11","that that would be maybe a good place to","1"
"00;09;49;12","00;09;51;04","to just dove into the meat of the paper.","1"
"00;09;52;06","00;09;52;15","So","1"
"00;09;57;00","00;09;57;28","how can we see","1"
"00;09;57;28","00;10;00;11","these different types of speech?","1"
"00;10;00;11","00;10;02;05","Speech acts","1"
"00;10;02;05","00;10;04;12","as shaping the field of affordances.","1"
"00;10;05;02","00;10;08;07","What is being done ecologically","1"
"00;10;08;23","00;10;11;29","with these different speech behaviors","1"
"00;10;13;14","00;10;16;03","as opposed to the","1"
"00;10;16;03","00;10;17;27","enabling aspect","1"
"00;10;17;27","00;10;19;04","of the transmission view?","1"
"00;10;19;04","00;10;20;27","I think they're fairly clear","1"
"00;10;20;27","00;10;22;18","within the transmission view","1"
"00;10;22;18","00;10;26;12","what these statements are about.","1"
"00;10;26;25","00;10;27;20","And as you pointed out, it's","1"
"00;10;27;20","00;10;29;04","almost like hard to escape","1"
"00;10;29;04","00;10;30;08","viewing","1"
"00;10;30;08","00;10;32;12","what these speech behaviors are","1"
"00;10;32;20","00;10;33;12","by the content,","1"
"00;10;33;12","00;10;34;23","like if not their content","1"
"00;10;34;23","00;10;35;11","quite literally,","1"
"00;10;35;11","00;10;37;02","then what would they be about?","1"
"00;10;37;02","00;10;38;19","Even talking about what they're about,","1"
"00;10;38;19","00;10;41;03","but informative would be sharing","1"
"00;10;41;03","00;10;44;08","a proposition, an or a some reducing","1"
"00;10;44;08","00;10;45;24","some of the uncertainty about the state","1"
"00;10;45;24","00;10;47;12","of something in the world.","1"
"00;10;47;12","00;10;50;03","I'm feeling this way or that way.","1"
"00;10;50;04","00;10;51;19","Is this much","1"
"00;10;52;21","00;10;55;19","and so on for other statements,","1"
"00;10;55;29","00;10;56;19","because indeed","1"
"00;10;56;19","00;10;58;26","they're defined by the content","1"
"00;10;59;10","00;11;00;28","and their structure.","1"
"00;11;00;28","00;11;02;26","So ecologically,","1"
"00;11;02;26","00;11;05;05","I mean, what might these types","1"
"00;11;05;05","00;11;09;14","of speech behaviors be doing?","1"
"00;11;09;14","00;11;10;02","So these","1"
"00;11;11;04","00;11;12;22","these types of active language","1"
"00;11;12;22","00;11;14;28","are well accounted for in their","1"
"00;11;15;13","00;11;17;05","in the transmission view.","1"
"00;11;17;05","00;11;18;22","But there are some questions","1"
"00;11;18;22","00;11;19;11","that remain","1"
"00;11;19;11","00;11;19;19","about","1"
"00;11;19;19","00;11;22;03","the imperative form of communication,","1"
"00;11;22;03","00;11;26;17","because it's it's not clear","1"
"00;11;26;20","00;11;29;01","that interactive communication","1"
"00;11;29;04","00;11;30;03","can be understood","1"
"00;11;30;03","00;11;32;15","as a form of transmission of content,","1"
"00;11;32;26","00;11;36;02","because we have the feeling that when we","1"
"00;11;36;27","00;11;37;27","come in something","1"
"00;11;37;27","00;11;40;04","or request something, we are not","1"
"00;11;41;23","00;11;43;04","transmitting information","1"
"00;11;43;04","00;11;44;26","or we are not","1"
"00;11;46;17","00;11;48;07","aiming at changing","1"
"00;11;48;07","00;11;50;13","the mental states of the person","1"
"00;11;50;13","00;11;51;13","that we are talking to.","1"
"00;11;51;13","00;11;53;18","We are aiming at making them","1"
"00;11;53;18","00;11;56;00","do something in the world directly.","1"
"00;11;56;00","00;11;56;24","So so there is","1"
"00;11;56;24","00;11;59;02","there's kind of a mismatch there,","1"
"00;11;59;02","00;12;00;14","it seems.","1"
"00;12;00;23","00;12;02;23","So obviously","1"
"00;12;03;25","00;12;04;26","people in the transmission","1"
"00;12;04;26","00;12;06;16","you will evidence or they will say that","1"
"00;12;06;16","00;12;08;14","like when I have,","1"
"00;12;08;14","00;12;10;17","for instance, that desire","1"
"00;12;10;17","00;12;11;09","or the intention","1"
"00;12;11;09","00;12;12;26","that something is the case,","1"
"00;12;12;26","00;12;14;27","I then an imperative","1"
"00;12;14;27","00;12;15;27","act of communication","1"
"00;12;15;27","00;12;17;22","is my transmitting this intention","1"
"00;12;17;22","00;12;18;19","or this desire","1"
"00;12;18;19","00;12;20;00","to that person that we then","1"
"00;12;20;00","00;12;21;28","as this desire or this intention,","1"
"00;12;21;28","00;12;24;10","and then can bring","1"
"00;12;24;10","00;12;26;05","about the state of affairs","1"
"00;12;26;05","00;12;28;05","that I intend to achieve.","1"
"00;12;28;05","00;12;30;24","But it's not I'm not sure.","1"
"00;12;31;04","00;12;32;16","Obviously, you can delve into details,","1"
"00;12;32;16","00;12;33;13","but I'm not sure that's","1"
"00;12;33;13","00;12;34;24","exactly what we want to do.","1"
"00;12;34;24","00;12;35;17","When we","1"
"00;12;35;23","00;12;36;15","state we","1"
"00;12;36;15","00;12;38;09","when we produce an imperative active","1"
"00;12;38;09","00;12;40;25","language, obviously we won't.","1"
"00;12;41;27","00;12;42;18","We just","1"
"00;12;42;18","00;12;44;05","don't just want that the person","1"
"00;12;44;05","00;12;46;00","as the intention of doing something.","1"
"00;12;46;00","00;12;49;01","We want the thing done in the world.","1"
"00;12;49;01","00;12;52;10","So I believe that the imperative","1"
"00;12;52;10","00;12;53;24","kind of communication","1"
"00;12;53;24","00;12;55;00","is not really","1"
"00;12;55;00","00;12;55;21","well accounted","1"
"00;12;55;21","00;12;58;00","for in the transmission view.","1"
"00;12;58;00","00;13;00;16","And what's interesting is that in a way,","1"
"00;13;00;16","00;13;02;17","the imperative form of communication","1"
"00;13;02;17","00;13;02;27","is like","1"
"00;13;02;27","00;13;03;24","the basic form","1"
"00;13;03;24","00;13;05;29","of communication in our framework,","1"
"00;13;06;09","00;13;10;01","because that what's what a communication","1"
"00;13;10;01","00;13;12;19","is, is acting through the behavior","1"
"00;13;12;19","00;13;13;16","of somebody else,","1"
"00;13;13;16","00;13;15;12","by affecting its field of avoidance","1"
"00;13;15;12","00;13;19;05","so that we can we can go back to, like,","1"
"00;13;19;05","00;13;21;07","the forms of animal communication","1"
"00;13;21;07","00;13;23;04","that we describe earlier in the paper.","1"
"00;13;23;04","00;13;23;29","And these are all","1"
"00;13;23;29","00;13;25;05","can all be considered","1"
"00;13;25;05","00;13;25;23","to be","1"
"00;13;25;23","00;13;27;25","imperative forms of comedy or proto","1"
"00;13;27;25","00;13;29;28","imperative forms of communication.","1"
"00;13;29;28","00;13;34;09","So that's like the starting point.","1"
"00;13;34;09","00;13;35;01","And we,","1"
"00;13;35;01","00;13;37;10","we achieve these acts under the purview","1"
"00;13;37;10","00;13;37;29","of somebody else","1"
"00;13;37;29","00;13;40;03","by altering their field of affordances","1"
"00;13;40;08","00;13;42;14","to make them something, to do something.","1"
"00;13;42;14","00;13;43;19","But how do we account","1"
"00;13;43;19","00;13;45;26","for informed, informative","1"
"00;13;45;26","00;13;47;11","acts of communication?","1"
"00;13;47;11","00;13;48;12","And an idea","1"
"00;13;48;12","00;13;50;09","that we put forward in the paper","1"
"00;13;50;09","00;13;53;01","is that an informal","1"
"00;13;53;20","00;13;54;27","the kind of","1"
"00;13;55;02","00;13;56;01","acts of communication","1"
"00;13;56;01","00;13;58;04","that that we consider to be informative","1"
"00;13;58;04","00;14;01;05","will be acts that aim to construct","1"
"00;14;01;22","00;14;04;14","or alter a shared field of affordances","1"
"00;14;04;22","00;14;06;00","in a way","1"
"00;14;06;00","00;14;07;05","that is more durable","1"
"00;14;07;05","00;14;08;11","than just an immediate","1"
"00;14;08;11","00;14;10;07","interactive act of language.","1"
"00;14;10;07","00;14;11;12","So what we are doing,","1"
"00;14;11;12","00;14;12;26","we are changing","1"
"00;14;12;26","00;14;15;13","the layout of the context","1"
"00;14;15;13","00;14;16;18","that we take for","1"
"00;14;16;18","00;14;18;19","to be relevance to our joint action.","1"
"00;14;19;00","00;14;21;17","And this is changing of affordances","1"
"00;14;21;23","00;14;23;19","do not have to be immediately","1"
"00;14;23;19","00;14;24;14","acted upon.","1"
"00;14;24;14","00;14;25;05","I can say, oh,","1"
"00;14;25;05","00;14;26;29","there's something in the in the context","1"
"00;14;26;29","00;14;27;28","that's relevant.","1"
"00;14;27;28","00;14;29;26","It does not necessarily call","1"
"00;14;29;26","00;14;31;07","for action immediately,","1"
"00;14;31;07","00;14;32;13","but it's something that is like","1"
"00;14;32;13","00;14;33;16","in the background","1"
"00;14;33;16","00;14;35;07","of our context of action.","1"
"00;14;35;07","00;14;36;05","And so it's change.","1"
"00;14;36;05","00;14;36;24","It changes","1"
"00;14;36;24","00;14;38;10","the shared field of affordances, but","1"
"00;14;38;10","00;14;40;02","it's not directly","1"
"00;14;41;08","00;14;42;03","soliciting an","1"
"00;14;42;03","00;14;42;23","action from the","1"
"00;14;42;23","00;14;44;10","interlocutor, as would be the case","1"
"00;14;44;10","00;14;46;01","for the imperative act of language.","1"
"00;14;46;01","00;14;48;09","So in a way,","1"
"00;14;48;12","00;14;51;12","it's like as this in the beginning,","1"
"00;14;51;12","00;14;53;24","an informative, active language is like","1"
"00;14;54;10","00;14;56;02","a long term imperative","1"
"00;14;56;02","00;14;58;06","or a dispositional imperative.","1"
"00;14;58;09","00;14;59;26","We put something in the context,","1"
"00;14;59;26","00;15;01;00","we say, Oh, that's relevant.","1"
"00;15;01;00","00;15;02;28","We can act on it at some point,","1"
"00;15;02;28","00;15;05;02","but it's not necessarily immediately","1"
"00;15;05;05","00;15;06;17","to be acted upon.","1"
"00;15;06;17","00;15;10;03","So that's how we can like put the,","1"
"00;15;10;03","00;15;10;25","the idea that, okay,","1"
"00;15;10;25","00;15;13;02","we can change our context of action,","1"
"00;15;13;14","00;15;14;09","what we can take","1"
"00;15;14;09","00;15;16;14","to be relevant in the context of action.","1"
"00;15;16;14","00;15;18;18","And we can come back to it","1"
"00;15;18;18","00;15;19;24","later when,","1"
"00;15;19;24","00;15;21;13","when it's relevant and act on it.","1"
"00;15;21;13","00;15;22;17","But it's not something","1"
"00;15;22;17","00;15;24;14","that is to be acted upon immediately.","1"
"00;15;24;14","00;15;26;15","And so that's like the, the,","1"
"00;15;27;01","00;15;28;18","the difference","1"
"00;15;28;18","00;15;30;20","between imperative and formative","1"
"00;15;30;20","00;15;33;02","begins to do to be","1"
"00;15;33;02","00;15;35;11","discerned there where an imperative is","1"
"00;15;35;11","00;15;36;10","like I'm","1"
"00;15;36;10","00;15;37;22","seeing that this, so","1"
"00;15;37;22","00;15;38;12","this affordances","1"
"00;15;38;12","00;15;40;07","should be acted upon immediately","1"
"00;15;40;07","00;15;41;19","and informative is like I'm","1"
"00;15;41;19","00;15;43;03","putting this in the context,","1"
"00;15;43;03","00;15;45;06","it changes the layout of affordances.","1"
"00;15;45;24","00;15;47;00","So for instance,","1"
"00;15;48;05","00;15;48;22","there would be","1"
"00;15;48;22","00;15;50;23","a, I don't know","1"
"00;15;50;23","00;15;52;17","if to come up with an example,","1"
"00;15;52;17","00;15;54;07","but if I inform you of something,","1"
"00;15;54;07","00;15;55;17","I'm putting","1"
"00;15;55;17","00;15;57;12","I'm changing the layout of the audience","1"
"00;15;57;12","00;15;58;26","that we take for granted","1"
"00;15;58;26","00;16;01;06","in the context of our interaction.","1"
"00;16;01;06","00;16;03;02","And it changes","1"
"00;16;03;02","00;16;04;26","in the long term, the interaction,","1"
"00;16;04;26","00;16;06;17","and it can like drive","1"
"00;16;06;17","00;16;08;01","the interaction in various ways,","1"
"00;16;08;01","00;16;10;08","but it's not something to be acted","1"
"00;16;10;08","00;16;11;18","directly immediately.","1"
"00;16;11;18","00;16;13;28","So that's the basic distinction.","1"
"00;16;14;05","00;16;17;03","And that's like the beginning","1"
"00;16;17;03","00;16;17;28","of a distinction","1"
"00;16;17;28","00;16;20;02","between informative and imperative.","1"
"00;16;20;17","00;16;22;02","And I can say a few words","1"
"00;16;22;02","00;16;23;27","about the interrogative too.","1"
"00;16;23;27","00;16;27;14","So as we said and,","1"
"00;16;27;14","00;16;29;16","and communication is acting","1"
"00;16;30;06","00;16;30;29","typically acting","1"
"00;16;30;29","00;16;33;05","through the behavior of somebody else","1"
"00;16;33;05","00;16;34;18","bye bye","1"
"00;16;35;04","00;16;37;20","by altering its field about audience","1"
"00;16;37;26","00;16;39;12","and the interrogative.","1"
"00;16;39;12","00;16;40;03","It's interesting","1"
"00;16;40;03","00;16;42;16","because it's exactly the distinction","1"
"00;16;42;16","00;16;45;04","between imperative and interrogative is","1"
"00;16;45;21","00;16;46;23","really similar to the","1"
"00;16;46;23","00;16;47;15","this distinction","1"
"00;16;47;15","00;16;48;29","between pragmatic value","1"
"00;16;48;29","00;16;50;04","and epistemic value","1"
"00;16;50;04","00;16;51;10","and active inference.","1"
"00;16;51;10","00;16;52;05","So, for instance,","1"
"00;16;52;05","00;16;54;04","when we produce an action","1"
"00;16;54;04","00;16;57;10","that aims to maximize pragmatic value,","1"
"00;16;57;11","00;16;59;05","we are trying to, for instance, do","1"
"00;17;00;13","00;17;01;04","to","1"
"00;17;01;28","00;17;04;02","make the state of the world correspond","1"
"00;17;04;02","00;17;06;03","to a prediction of our derivative model.","1"
"00;17;06;03","00;17;07;28","And when we make something","1"
"00;17;07;28","00;17;09;21","which is guided by epistemic value,","1"
"00;17;09;21","00;17;10;18","what we try to do","1"
"00;17;10;18","00;17;12;08","is trying to reduce in certain","1"
"00;17;12;08","00;17;13;23","uncertainty about our","1"
"00;17;13;23","00;17;15;05","our niche, for instance,","1"
"00;17;15;05","00;17;18;06","but so in a way, so for instance,","1"
"00;17;18;06","00;17;20;10","when I'm eating something, I'm,","1"
"00;17;20;10","00;17;22;29","I'm maximizing my,","1"
"00;17;22;29","00;17;24;20","my interest in my pragmatic value","1"
"00;17;24;20","00;17;26;05","because I'm, for instance,","1"
"00;17;26;05","00;17;28;13","reducing a prediction error","1"
"00;17;28;13","00;17;30;12","that I'm hungry and I want to.","1"
"00;17;30;12","00;17;32;10","So that's a basic example.","1"
"00;17;32;10","00;17;34;13","But when I'm exploring my environment,","1"
"00;17;34;13","00;17;35;28","when I'm making a visual","1"
"00;17;35;28","00;17;38;04","aid to explore my needs.","1"
"00;17;38;04","00;17;40;21","So that would be an epistemic","1"
"00;17;40;21","00;17;42;05","action, so to speak.","1"
"00;17;42;05","00;17;43;20","So interrogative","1"
"00;17;43;20","00;17;44;17","acts of language","1"
"00;17;44;17","00;17;47;21","are exactly analog to epistemic actions,","1"
"00;17;47;27","00;17;49;15","but they are epistemic actions","1"
"00;17;49;15","00;17;51;12","through the behavior of somebody else.","1"
"00;17;51;12","00;17;53;25","So instead of, for instance, by myself","1"
"00;17;54;00","00;17;56;00","exploring the niche, exploring the field","1"
"00;17;56;00","00;17;58;12","about audience, I can produce this act","1"
"00;17;58;19","00;18;00;08","that will make the other person","1"
"00;18;00;08","00;18;01;13","disclose to me","1"
"00;18;01;13","00;18;04;00","an element of the field of audience that","1"
"00;18;05;00","00;18;06;04","can then reduce my","1"
"00;18;06;04","00;18;07;02","uncertainty about","1"
"00;18;07;02","00;18;08;29","what is the context of our action.","1"
"00;18;08;29","00;18;10;21","So that's really the distinction","1"
"00;18;10;21","00;18;11;18","between interactive","1"
"00;18;11;18","00;18;13;10","and interrogative is really","1"
"00;18;13;10","00;18;14;00","to be understood","1"
"00;18;14;00","00;18;15;10","along the line of the distinction","1"
"00;18;15;10","00;18;16;19","between pragmatic value","1"
"00;18;16;19","00;18;18;04","and epistemic value.","1"
"00;18;18;04","00;18;19;05","So that's","1"
"00;18;19;10","00;18;21;08","a beginning to an introduction to these","1"
"00;18;21;08","00;18;24;13","these distinctions in the in the types","1"
"00;18;24;13","00;18;29;08","of acts of language.","1"
"00;18;29;08","00;18;29;23","Don't start me.","1"
"00;18;29;23","00;18;31;13","You totally you totally read my mind.","1"
"00;18;31;13","00;18;33;14","They're about what I wanted","1"
"00;18;33;14","00;18;35;12","to, to elaborate on,","1"
"00;18;35;12","00;18;36;04","even though my question","1"
"00;18;36;04","00;18;38;08","was like very partly framed.","1"
"00;18;38;08","00;18;38;17","Yeah,","1"
"00;18;38;17","00;18;40;27","I think that that's very useful for","1"
"00;18;41;08","00;18;41;29","especially in","1"
"00;18;41;29","00;18;43;05","like the goal directed","1"
"00;18;43;05","00;18;45;29","aspect of imperatives","1"
"00;18;46;00","00;18;48;23","versus interrogative or informative","1"
"00;18;48;28","00;18;50;00","like what,","1"
"00;18;50;00","00;18;52;08","how they interact with our maybe","1"
"00;18;52;15","00;18;54;02","we don't have a joint goal versus","1"
"00;18;54;02","00;18;55;05","we do have a joint goal","1"
"00;18;55;05","00;18;56;23","or the goal is to develop","1"
"00;18;56;23","00;18;57;26","some shared state","1"
"00;18;57;26","00;19;00;03","of a shared mental state.","1"
"00;19;00;03","00;19;01;02","So that was really helpful.","1"
"00;19;01;02","00;19;03;06","Thank you.","1"
"00;19;03;19","00;19;06;04","Another note is that the informative","1"
"00;19;07;06","00;19;09;16","behavior is like","1"
"00;19;09;25","00;19;13;12","the base class of the transmission view","1"
"00;19;13;25","00;19;15;23","because it seems to be like it's","1"
"00;19;15;23","00;19;18;06","updating one on the details.","1"
"00;19;18;06","00;19;18;26","Like what","1"
"00;19;18;26","00;19;19;24","if I'm saying","1"
"00;19;19;24","00;19;23;01","there is a gallon of milk in the fridge?","1"
"00;19;23;01","00;19;24;26","Truly what else could be conveyed","1"
"00;19;24;26","00;19;25;27","other than the content?","1"
"00;19;25;27","00;19;28;01","So it seems like the most natural.","1"
"00;19;28;01","00;19;29;06","And then there are specific","1"
"00;19;29;06","00;19;32;15","kinds of content like","1"
"00;19;33;10","00;19;34;05","sharing the content","1"
"00;19;34;05","00;19;35;02","that you have a question","1"
"00;19;35;02","00;19;36;04","or sharing the content","1"
"00;19;36;04","00;19;38;00","that you would like somebody to act.","1"
"00;19;38;00","00;19;40;18","And so in that way, as you described,","1"
"00;19;41;08","00;19;42;28","many forms of speech behavior","1"
"00;19;42;28","00;19;44;13","are well accounted for","1"
"00;19;44;13","00;19;45;23","in the transmission view,","1"
"00;19;45;23","00;19;46;05","and that","1"
"00;19;46;05","00;19;47;18","accounting is actually kind","1"
"00;19;47;18","00;19;48;10","of a callback","1"
"00;19;48;10","00;19;51;27","to that mouth stream for David Spivak","1"
"00;19;52;11","00;19;53;26","about accounting system.","1"
"00;19;53;26","00;19;57;10","So these are like accounting models.","1"
"00;19;57;10","00;20;00;27","And then you highlighted that imperative","1"
"00;20;01;19","00;20;05;08","in the inactive and ecological view,","1"
"00;20;05;08","00;20;08;06","all communication that the imperative is","1"
"00;20;08;14","00;20;10;25","perhaps the basic form of communication,","1"
"00;20;10;25","00;20;13;12","and that can be seen developmentally","1"
"00;20;13;12","00;20;15;14","through a child","1"
"00;20;15;27","00;20;17;09","and the kinds of communications","1"
"00;20;17;09","00;20;18;13","that they may engage","1"
"00;20;18;13","00;20;19;25","in, as well","1"
"00;20;19;25","00;20;21;14","as from an evolutionary perspective,","1"
"00;20;21;14","00;20;24;29","with the kinds of audio or chemical","1"
"00;20;24;29","00;20;26;10","or physical stigma","1"
"00;20;26;10","00;20;27;22","and marks that different","1"
"00;20;27;22","00;20;28;17","kinds of creatures","1"
"00;20;28;17","00;20;30;00","use to communicate within","1"
"00;20;30;00","00;20;31;07","and across species.","1"
"00;20;31;07","00;20;32;04","So those are action","1"
"00;20;32;04","00;20;34;13","oriented communications,","1"
"00;20;35;09","00;20;36;13","as we can","1"
"00;20;36;13","00;20;37;27","then say, all action","1"
"00;20;37;27","00;20;39;26","oriented communication","1"
"00;20;39;26","00;20;41;08","or all communication","1"
"00;20;41;08","00;20;42;08","we can say is action","1"
"00;20;42;08","00;20;44;16","oriented in an obvious way.","1"
"00;20;44;16","00;20;46;14","So then imperative becomes","1"
"00;20;46;14","00;20;48;17","the base class","1"
"00;20;48;17","00;20;50;14","shaping the field of affordances.","1"
"00;20;50;14","00;20;52;03","If that's what the ecological view on","1"
"00;20;52;03","00;20;53;22","communication is,","1"
"00;20;53;22","00;20;55;08","is going to be most natural","1"
"00;20;55;08","00;20;56;16","with kinds of expressions","1"
"00;20;56;16","00;20;59;04","that we can say are imperative.","1"
"00;20;59;04","00;21;02;02","And then informative updates","1"
"00;21;02;25","00;21;03;14","are like","1"
"00;21;03;14","00;21;04;10","one step","1"
"00;21;04;10","00;21;07;05","removed from direct action requests.","1"
"00;21;07;22","00;21;08;24","So saying","1"
"00;21;08;24","00;21;09;20","turn the handle to","1"
"00;21;09;20","00;21;11;29","the left is an imperative.","1"
"00;21;12;17","00;21;13;08","If you said,","1"
"00;21;14;15","00;21;14;25","I'm going to","1"
"00;21;14;25","00;21;15;28","inform you about two things,","1"
"00;21;15;28","00;21;17;29","the handle can be turned to the left.","1"
"00;21;17;29","00;21;19;21","And if this happens,","1"
"00;21;19;21","00;21;21;18","you may want to turn the handle.","1"
"00;21;21;18","00;21;24;05","Those are breaking down a capacity","1"
"00;21;24;05","00;21;28;04","for action into sequential or modular","1"
"00;21;28;04","00;21;30;06","or re composable","1"
"00;21;31;10","00;21;32;23","statements.","1"
"00;21;32;28","00;21;36;03","But those statements are like hiding","1"
"00;21;36;20","00;21;39;03","the consequences of action.","1"
"00;21;39;03","00;21;40;11","And so in that way, we","1"
"00;21;40;11","00;21;41;27","we can have an action","1"
"00;21;41;27","00;21;44;16","oriented view on communication","1"
"00;21;44;16","00;21;47;11","and then see different kinds of other","1"
"00;21;48;06","00;21;50;26","behavior as like","1"
"00;21;50;26","00;21;54;29","modified or truncated or censored","1"
"00;21;54;29","00;21;58;23","or hidden action modification.","1"
"00;22;00;03","00;22;02;18","And that may or may not entail needing","1"
"00;22;02;18","00;22;04;19","to even explain","1"
"00;22;04;19","00;22;06;01","how meaning is represented,","1"
"00;22;06;01","00;22;10;01","transmitted or received.","1"
"00;22;10;01","00;22;13;04","Yes, from me.","1"
"00;22;13;04","00;22;14;00","That's exactly it.","1"
"00;22;14;00","00;22;16;07","So the that's really the","1"
"00;22;16;21","00;22;18;05","the idea extended very well.","1"
"00;22;18;05","00;22;19;02","And another example","1"
"00;22;19;02","00;22;22;01","that we that we often use here is the","1"
"00;22;22;15","00;22;25;03","the joint action of cooking a meal","1"
"00;22;25;12","00;22;26;20","with various people.","1"
"00;22;26;20","00;22;28;16","So like an example,","1"
"00;22;28;16","00;22;30;13","we use that in the last discussion,","1"
"00;22;30;13","00;22;32;01","the example of moving a couch","1"
"00;22;32;01","00;22;32;29","to another example","1"
"00;22;32;29","00;22;34;08","maybe to change a bit","1"
"00;22;34;08","00;22;35;28","our intuitions about communication.","1"
"00;22;35;28","00;22;37;00","So when people are cooking","1"
"00;22;37;00","00;22;38;01","a meal together,","1"
"00;22;38;01","00;22;40;13","we can suppose that some people,","1"
"00;22;40;13","00;22;41;14","some of the","1"
"00;22;41;14","00;22;42;02","so suppose","1"
"00;22;42;02","00;22;43;06","that we're in the kitchen","1"
"00;22;43;06","00;22;44;20","of one of the person","1"
"00;22;44;20","00;22;45;16","and the other doesn't know","1"
"00;22;45;16","00;22;47;21","exactly where all the things are.","1"
"00;22;47;21","00;22;49;23","And so at first the person could say","1"
"00;22;49;23","00;22;52;05","there's flour in there in the","1"
"00;22;52;22","00;22;54;18","in the cupboard or in the pantry","1"
"00;22;54;18","00;22;56;23","and saying that that's an important","1"
"00;22;56;23","00;22;58;13","and informative language.","1"
"00;22;58;13","00;22;59;07","But that could","1"
"00;22;59;07","00;22;59;27","that's like","1"
"00;22;59;27","00;23;01;11","that might be a hidden","1"
"00;23;01;11","00;23;04;14","imperative insofar as at some point","1"
"00;23;04;14","00;23;05;16","in the interaction","1"
"00;23;05;16","00;23;06;27","in the cooking of the meal,","1"
"00;23;06;27","00;23;08;19","the flour might be needed.","1"
"00;23;08;19","00;23;09;20","And at this point,","1"
"00;23;09;20","00;23;10;18","this alteration","1"
"00;23;10;18","00;23;11;24","of the field of affordances,","1"
"00;23;11;24","00;23;13;20","the appearance of the flour","1"
"00;23;13;20","00;23;14;24","as an affordances","1"
"00;23;14;24","00;23;16;04","in the context might drive","1"
"00;23;16;04","00;23;17;21","the action of the person","1"
"00;23;17;21","00;23;18;28","when the flour is needed.","1"
"00;23;18;28","00;23;20;04","At a certain point,","1"
"00;23;20;04","00;23;21;15","the person will have this software","1"
"00;23;21;15","00;23;25;08","dense field and will go to to to seek it","1"
"00;23;25;09","00;23;26;21","if it's necessary at that point.","1"
"00;23;26;21","00;23;28;24","So the informative is,","1"
"00;23;28;24","00;23;29;19","as I said,","1"
"00;23;29;19","00;23;33;15","something like a dispositional or long","1"
"00;23;33;15","00;23;35;00","term imperative.","1"
"00;23;35;00","00;23;37;06","So something of a hidden imperative","1"
"00;23;37;25","00;23;39;14","that can drive behavior","1"
"00;23;39;14","00;23;40;25","in the long term.","1"
"00;23;40;25","00;23;42;19","So so it's like at the beginning","1"
"00;23;42;19","00;23;43;19","this distinction is more","1"
"00;23;43;19","00;23;46;11","is a distinction of like","1"
"00;23;46;17","00;23;48;26","is this effort tends to be acted upon","1"
"00;23;49;16","00;23;51;01","immediately by you or","1"
"00;23;51;01","00;23;53;04","is it posed in the context","1"
"00;23;53;10","00;23;54;08","and can","1"
"00;23;54;08","00;23;55;03","like alter","1"
"00;23;55;03","00;23;55;24","the dynamic","1"
"00;23;55;24","00;23;57;09","without being directly","1"
"00;23;57;09","00;23;58;16","acted upon immediately.","1"
"00;23;58;16","00;24;00;18","So that's out there would be","1"
"00;24;00;18","00;24;02;02","the distinction is drawn.","1"
"00;24;02;02","00;24;03;23","And yeah, I,","1"
"00;24;03;23","00;24;05;06","I think that that's,","1"
"00;24;05;06","00;24;06;19","that's how we try to to","1"
"00;24;06;19","00;24;08;02","account for informative","1"
"00;24;09;07","00;24;10;15","without","1"
"00;24;10;26","00;24;12;10","describing it as","1"
"00;24;12;10","00;24;13;16","transmitting a content","1"
"00;24;13;16","00;24;15;02","or an information.","1"
"00;24;15;02","00;24;16;20","So that's that's the idea.","1"
"00;24;16;20","00;24;17;27","And I think that you explain it","1"
"00;24;17;27","00;24;21;05","very well in your in your in your your.","1"
"00;24;21;27","00;24;23;03","Yeah.","1"
"00;24;23;03","00;24;26;19","In your explanation.","1"
"00;24;26;19","00;24;29;10","But yeah, it's very","1"
"00;24;29;14","00;24;30;08","interesting.","1"
"00;24;30;08","00;24;33;02","It's just another","1"
"00;24;33;02","00;24;36;13","consequence of centering action.","1"
"00;24;36;13","00;24;39;23","So many things, the pragmatic turn,","1"
"00;24;40;19","00;24;42;13","pragmatism earlier","1"
"00;24;42;13","00;24;43;23","than the so-called pragmatic","1"
"00;24;43;23","00;24;45;28","turn in the neurosciences","1"
"00;24;45;28","00;24;47;04","and all of the developments","1"
"00;24;47;04","00;24;50;06","in cognitive science.","1"
"00;24;50;06","00;24;52;11","In many cases, it's been like","1"
"00;24;53;15","00;24;56;04","an information or an inference view","1"
"00;24;57;01","00;24;59;09","yielding to an action view,","1"
"00;24;59;24","00;25;00;27","and that just played out","1"
"00;25;00;27","00;25;03;27","differently on different frontiers.","1"
"00;25;03;27","00;25;05;26","And it feels like in a way,","1"
"00;25;05;26","00;25;08;20","language is like the stronghold","1"
"00;25;09;05","00;25;11;16","of information views","1"
"00;25;12;21","00;25;15;00","because it's like so amenable","1"
"00;25;15;00","00;25;18;05","to syntactic and discourse analysis","1"
"00;25;18;26","00;25;20;29","in a and composition ality","1"
"00;25;21;13","00;25;22;28","and all these features","1"
"00;25;22;28","00;25;25;24","that we see in formal models and in","1"
"00;25;25;24","00;25;26;23","computer systems","1"
"00;25;27;26","00;25;28;17","that it feels","1"
"00;25;28;17","00;25;29;09","like, oh, maybe","1"
"00;25;29;09","00;25;30;08","all the funny stuff","1"
"00;25;30;08","00;25;32;09","that people do and say,","1"
"00;25;32;09","00;25;34;28","we'll figure that one out to","1"
"00;25;36;16","00;25;37;02","Blue.","1"
"00;25;37;02","00;25;42;04","And then Dean.","1"
"00;25;42;04","00;25;44;25","So I just wonder about","1"
"00;25;44;25","00;25;46;19","like mimicry,","1"
"00;25;46;19","00;25;48;05","which is something that we see","1"
"00;25;48;05","00;25;50;17","like in the animal kingdom a lot.","1"
"00;25;51;05","00;25;54;06","And like whether that is imperative,","1"
"00;25;54;06","00;25;54;27","I mean, sometimes","1"
"00;25;54;27","00;25;57;17","I guess it can be imperatives like","1"
"00;25;57;17","00;25;59;11","watch me do this and then you do it,","1"
"00;25;59;11","00;26;01;04","but not always.","1"
"00;26;01;04","00;26;03;15","So sometimes it's like,","1"
"00;26;03;17","00;26;04;05","you know,","1"
"00;26;04;05","00;26;04;21","an animal,","1"
"00;26;04;21","00;26;06;06","we'll see another animal do something.","1"
"00;26;06;06","00;26;07;24","And then they try it too.","1"
"00;26;07;24","00;26;09;24","And so what?","1"
"00;26;09;24","00;26;10;16","I don't know.","1"
"00;26;10;16","00;26;12;21","I just don't know how to look","1"
"00;26;12;21","00;26;13;13","at it","1"
"00;26;13;13","00;26;15;13","in the terms of teaching and learning","1"
"00;26;15;13","00;26;17;15","and like shared goal directness.","1"
"00;26;17;15","00;26;19;26","Like what is maybe the role of mimicry","1"
"00;26;19;26","00;26;21;00","and how does that like","1"
"00;26;21;00","00;26;21;25","what is the effect","1"
"00;26;21;25","00;26;23;15","on the field of affordances?","1"
"00;26;23;15","00;26;24;19","Does it just open up","1"
"00;26;24;19","00;26;25;28","like you see someone do something","1"
"00;26;25;28","00;26;26;23","and then your field of","1"
"00;26;26;23","00;26;28;10","affordances opens to","1"
"00;26;28;10","00;26;29;23","that is also possible for me?","1"
"00;26;29;23","00;26;30;22","Or does that","1"
"00;26;30;22","00;26;33;12","not have maybe like a semantic analog?","1"
"00;26;33;17","00;26;36;18","I don't know.","1"
"00;26;36;18","00;26;38;02","Yeah, that's a really good question.","1"
"00;26;38;02","00;26;42;00","And often people with either","1"
"00;26;42;03","00;26;43;11","the transmission view","1"
"00;26;43;11","00;26;45;17","will adopt the view","1"
"00;26;45;17","00;26;47;06","that the main driver","1"
"00;26;47;06","00;26;50;07","of the evolution of language in human","1"
"00;26;50;07","00;26;52;14","societies was the transmitting of","1"
"00;26;53;08","00;26;55;22","of knowledge and of skills,","1"
"00;26;55;22","00;26;56;14","for instance,","1"
"00;26;56;14","00;26;59;04","then of, of various types of activities.","1"
"00;26;59;04","00;27;00;03","So that's like a,","1"
"00;27;01;08","00;27;03;09","a clear example where it seems","1"
"00;27;03;20","00;27;04;24","that the transmission view","1"
"00;27;04;24","00;27;07;18","as a story to say","1"
"00;27;08;00","00;27;10;10","when, if we, if we take for granted","1"
"00;27;10;10","00;27;11;15","that like","1"
"00;27;11;29","00;27;15;25","in imitating somebody or, or,","1"
"00;27;16;13","00;27;17;05","or learning","1"
"00;27;17;05","00;27;19;13","something to somebody is in effect","1"
"00;27;19;13","00;27;22;20","transmitting a knowledge or a certain","1"
"00;27;22;20","00;27;23;06","kind of,","1"
"00;27;23;06","00;27;26;04","of, of mental state or cognitive state.","1"
"00;27;26;14","00;27;29;01","So there's clearly","1"
"00;27;29;11","00;27;30;14","something interesting there","1"
"00;27;30;14","00;27;31;21","for the transmission of you,","1"
"00;27;31;21","00;27;32;25","but I think that's","1"
"00;27;32;25","00;27;35;08","an alternative possible analysis.","1"
"00;27;35;08","00;27;38;12","You just heard that it is the idea","1"
"00;27;38;12","00;27;40;00","that you","1"
"00;27;40;00","00;27;42;02","when you're interacting with somebody","1"
"00;27;42;08","00;27;44;24","and specifically with somebody of your","1"
"00;27;44;26","00;27;46;06","of your own species,","1"
"00;27;46;06","00;27;47;14","seeing this person do","1"
"00;27;47;14","00;27;49;16","something can open","1"
"00;27;49;17","00;27;51;13","new affordances for yourself.","1"
"00;27;51;13","00;27;52;00","For instance,","1"
"00;27;52;00","00;27;52;26","if I see I see","1"
"00;27;52;26","00;27;54;12","somebody that looks like me","1"
"00;27;54;12","00;27;55;19","do something.","1"
"00;27;55;19","00;27;58;00","I'm I have learned that when","1"
"00;27;58;16","00;28;00;26","somebody looks like me, does something","1"
"00;28;01;01","00;28;03;16","usually be with a little bit of effort.","1"
"00;28;03;16","00;28;04;12","I can do it too.","1"
"00;28;04;12","00;28;06;06","So somebody doing","1"
"00;28;06;06","00;28;08;23","something is a way of opening,","1"
"00;28;08;23","00;28;10;19","opening up new affordances for me","1"
"00;28;10;19","00;28;11;28","and trying to achieve it.","1"
"00;28;11;28","00;28;14;05","So in many case,","1"
"00;28;14;05","00;28;15;03","mimicry will not","1"
"00;28;15;03","00;28;17;07","necessarily be communicative.","1"
"00;28;17;07","00;28;18;22","That is because an organism","1"
"00;28;18;22","00;28;20;04","can do something without.","1"
"00;28;20;04","00;28;23;04","I mean, no, it is not communicating","1"
"00;28;23;04","00;28;24;09","nothing to anybody,","1"
"00;28;24;09","00;28;25;01","but it happens","1"
"00;28;25;01","00;28;26;28","that somebody else watches it and","1"
"00;28;27;27","00;28;28;16","imitates it.","1"
"00;28;28;16","00;28;28;24","So in","1"
"00;28;28;24","00;28;29;03","that case,","1"
"00;28;29;03","00;28;31;20","there's not necessarily communication,","1"
"00;28;31;23","00;28;32;15","but in cases","1"
"00;28;32;15","00;28;34;21","where there is communication involved,","1"
"00;28;34;21","00;28;37;03","I think we can analyze and analyze it,","1"
"00;28;37;18","00;28;38;16","just as you said.","1"
"00;28;38;16","00;28;41;14","That is saying that","1"
"00;28;41;14","00;28;44;05","the action of the organism opens up","1"
"00;28;44;05","00;28;45;04","and you have far","1"
"00;28;45;04","00;28;47;23","for the person who's watching it,","1"
"00;28;47;24","00;28;48;12","doing it.","1"
"00;28;48;12","00;28;51;12","And usually in cases of explicit","1"
"00;28;52;11","00;28;55;07","skill learning, for instance,","1"
"00;28;55;07","00;28;57;07","the experts will like do the thing","1"
"00;28;57;07","00;28;58;09","more deliberately,","1"
"00;28;58;09","00;28;59;03","more slowly,","1"
"00;28;59;03","00;29;01;18","more explicitly to like show","1"
"00;29;01;18","00;29;03;00","what are the relevant movement","1"
"00;29;03;00","00;29;05;12","that has to be made in order to achieve","1"
"00;29;05;12","00;29;06;21","so that like","1"
"00;29;06;21","00;29;07;28","making more salient","1"
"00;29;07;28","00;29;10;00","the kind of, of the, of movement","1"
"00;29;10;00","00;29;13;03","that has to be made to, to,","1"
"00;29;13;03","00;29;14;25","to succeed in the","1"
"00;29;14;25","00;29;16;18","in performing their skill.","1"
"00;29;16;18","00;29;18;24","So I think that's a way","1"
"00;29;18;27","00;29;20;08","that we can understand","1"
"00;29;20;08","00;29;21;01","this kind of skill","1"
"00;29;21;01","00;29;22;18","learning in the transformation","1"
"00;29;22;18","00;29;23;18","of the affordances","1"
"00;29;23;18","00;29;25;12","that are available to the person","1"
"00;29;25;12","00;29;28;01","that's receiving the the communication,","1"
"00;29;29;18","00;29;30;07","that that's","1"
"00;29;30;07","00;29;32;28","how I would I think I would analyze it.","1"
"00;29;34;02","00;29;36;15","One simple","1"
"00;29;36;15","00;29;38;09","example kind of building on this, making","1"
"00;29;38;09","00;29;39;25","certain actions deliberate,","1"
"00;29;39;25","00;29;43;04","then being interested for your thoughts,","1"
"00;29;43;22","00;29;46;13","even showing something deliberately,","1"
"00;29;47;22","00;29;49;17","verbally calling attention,","1"
"00;29;49;17","00;29;51;21","or just the position of the body","1"
"00;29;51;21","00;29;53;22","for a physical skill.","1"
"00;29;53;22","00;29;55;15","It shapes the field of affordances,","1"
"00;29;55;15","00;29;57;27","specifically where somebody can look.","1"
"00;29;58;15","00;29;59;24","So if you're like, okay, I'm","1"
"00;29;59;24","00;30;01;12","going to swing the bat","1"
"00;30;01;12","00;30;02;09","and then now I'm going to show you","1"
"00;30;02;09","00;30;03;09","what my hand","1"
"00;30;03;09","00;30;03;19","you know,","1"
"00;30;03;19","00;30;05;00","this isn't usually how I do it,","1"
"00;30;05;00","00;30;05;24","but I'm going to show you how","1"
"00;30;05;24","00;30;07;25","I was holding it at that time.","1"
"00;30;07;25","00;30;08;19","You have shaped","1"
"00;30;08;19","00;30;09;16","their field","1"
"00;30;09;16","00;30;12;10","of ocular motor affordances and","1"
"00;30;12;17","00;30;14;07","and that is what enables","1"
"00;30;14;07","00;30;17;14","their generative model to update.","1"
"00;30;17;14","00;30;21;06","And so nowhere in that account is","1"
"00;30;22;08","00;30;24;00","I'm transmitting that","1"
"00;30;24;00","00;30;25;03","this is to be held","1"
"00;30;25;03","00;30;27;00","between these two fingers,","1"
"00;30;27;00","00;30;27;20","let alone","1"
"00;30;27;20","00;30;28;26","counterfactuals, like,","1"
"00;30;28;26","00;30;29;18","here's what you do","1"
"00;30;29;18","00;30;32;03","if your hand is slippery.","1"
"00;30;32;03","00;30;35;04","But but by bodily posture,","1"
"00;30;35;19","00;30;38;11","including vocal box bodily posture,","1"
"00;30;39;02","00;30;41;11","we can have an integrated account of","1"
"00;30;42;26","00;30;45;13","mimicry, skill transfer","1"
"00;30;45;13","00;30;46;20","again, transfers playing","1"
"00;30;46;20","00;30;46;29","way too","1"
"00;30;46;29","00;30;49;16","strongly into a transmission view, but","1"
"00;30;51;01","00;30;53;27","skill resonance or something similar","1"
"00;30;54;12","00;30;55;20","that helps recognize","1"
"00;30;55;20","00;30;59;06","the cognitive entities learning process","1"
"00;31;00;26","00;31;04;15","then.","1"
"00;31;04;15","00;31;05;14","Okay, well,","1"
"00;31;05;14","00;31;06;19","I want to take what you're saying,","1"
"00;31;06;19","00;31;07;17","but I'm going to put a little bit","1"
"00;31;07;17","00;31;08;21","of a weird flex on it","1"
"00;31;08;21","00;31;10;22","because I want to try to combine","1"
"00;31;10;22","00;31;13;12","Blues PIN and Remi's pin and Daniel's","1"
"00;31;13;12","00;31;15;29","pin into one kind of question","1"
"00;31;15;29","00;31;17;06","that comes back to the paper.","1"
"00;31;17;06","00;31;18;24","So like the last","1"
"00;31;18;24","00;31;21;03","5 minutes of the conversation","1"
"00;31;21;03","00;31;22;09","has been focused on","1"
"00;31;23;08","00;31;24;17","the back of","1"
"00;31;24;17","00;31;26;06","and as typing","1"
"00;31;26;06","00;31;27;02","when it pertains","1"
"00;31;27;02","00;31;29;02","to language and communication","1"
"00;31;29;02","00;31;31;21","and blue bringing mimicry and is a","1"
"00;31;32;00","00;31;35;10","is a form of as person","1"
"00;31;35;10","00;31;37;05","who a lot of the emphasis in the paper","1"
"00;31;37;05","00;31;39;11","which is on the art","1"
"00;31;39;14","00;31;40;24","of communication and language.","1"
"00;31;40;24","00;31;44;07","So here's my question.","1"
"00;31;44;07","00;31;45;26","I went back and read the paper again","1"
"00;31;45;26","00;31;47;25","and I caught myself asking,","1"
"00;31;47;25","00;31;50;04","what do I hear","1"
"00;31;50;04","00;31;51;07","when I'm reading something?","1"
"00;31;51;07","00;31;53;13","Or I'm listening to someone?","1"
"00;31;53;13","00;31;55;21","What do I hear","1"
"00;31;55;21","00;31;58;02","as both processor and the producer?","1"
"00;31;58;23","00;31;59;29","As","1"
"00;32;00;14","00;32;03;05","we mentioned off camera, an arranger","1"
"00;32;03;12","00;32;06;07","of something being signaled,","1"
"00;32;06;14","00;32;09;05","which I'm picking up on and decoding.","1"
"00;32;10;04","00;32;10;27","So","1"
"00;32;12;02","00;32;13;06","rather than just leave it","1"
"00;32;13;06","00;32;14;21","there a part that for a second","1"
"00;32;14;21","00;32;16;10","because I think that's that","1"
"00;32;16;10","00;32;18;20","the the of what I want to ask","1"
"00;32;19;08","00;32;20;17","as a processor","1"
"00;32;20;17","00;32;22;05","and a producer as an arranger,","1"
"00;32;22;05","00;32;24;23","I can hear things in mono,","1"
"00;32;24;23","00;32;26;18","I can hear things in stereo,","1"
"00;32;26;18","00;32;27;14","I can even hear things","1"
"00;32;27;14","00;32;29;00","if I go to my Apple Music","1"
"00;32;29;00","00;32;30;23","in spatial audio.","1"
"00;32;31;21","00;32;32;18","So","1"
"00;32;33;22","00;32;35;16","that is a field of affordances,","1"
"00;32;35;16","00;32;38;01","a question as opposed to a source","1"
"00;32;38;01","00;32;39;04","of affordances question","1"
"00;32;39;04","00;32;40;17","And if I only limit myself","1"
"00;32;40;17","00;32;41;23","to the source,","1"
"00;32;41;23","00;32;42;25","I'm going to be asking","1"
"00;32;42;25","00;32;45;11","all the above type questions,","1"
"00;32;47;01","00;32;47;17","right?","1"
"00;32;48;00","00;32;50;28","So if I want to stay in the as of","1"
"00;32;51;04","00;32;51;24","if I want to be able","1"
"00;32;51;24","00;32;53;02","to hold up to things","1"
"00;32;53;02","00;32;53;19","at once,","1"
"00;32;53;19","00;32;55;28","at a minimum, the stereo or the spatial,","1"
"00;32;56;21","00;32;58;17","that's when I get into the ecological,","1"
"00;32;58;17","00;32;59;16","even if it's","1"
"00;32;59;21","00;33;01;27","specific ecological because I'm not","1"
"00;33;02;12","00;33;05;22","collapsing down to a single source","1"
"00;33;06;02","00;33;08;07","as my point of contact,","1"
"00;33;09;13","00;33;12;02","which then asks leads me to ask the fact","1"
"00;33;12;02","00;33;12;24","that communication","1"
"00;33;12;24","00;33;16;08","can be formed as an of types, meaning","1"
"00;33;16;26","00;33;20;01","mono stereo or spatial","1"
"00;33;20;01","00;33;22;07","mimicry interrogation.","1"
"00;33;22;07","00;33;24;12","The fact that it can be broken out","1"
"00;33;24;12","00;33;27;02","into those things, does that introduce","1"
"00;33;27;19","00;33;31;19","self production into the self processing","1"
"00;33;33;00","00;33;34;12","in your paper?","1"
"00;33;34;12","00;33;36;08","Because I know there's a heavy emphasis","1"
"00;33;36;08","00;33;39;14","on the above on the processing,","1"
"00;33;40;06","00;33;43;00","but I wonder if you keep the as","1"
"00;33;43;05","00;33;44;15","when blue brings it up","1"
"00;33;44;15","00;33;46;17","or when Daniel brings it up.","1"
"00;33;46;17","00;33;46;29","If we're","1"
"00;33;46;29","00;33;47;28","if we're keeping an eye on that,","1"
"00;33;47;28","00;33;50;02","even a specific ecological level,","1"
"00;33;51;03","00;33;53;12","are we not, when we hear something,","1"
"00;33;53;12","00;34;05;02","producers as well.","1"
"00;34;05;02","00;34;07;29","What are we producing?","1"
"00;34;07;29","00;34;09;05","I have no idea.","1"
"00;34;09;05","00;34;10;05","But I know I hear something","1"
"00;34;10;05","00;34;12;07","even when I read what you're typing.","1"
"00;34;12;07","00;34;14;18","I'm not just hearing the tap any tap,","1"
"00;34;15;15","00;34;16;23","I'm hearing something.","1"
"00;34;16;23","00;34;19;01","We are product","1"
"00;34;19;01","00;34;20;04","produced,","1"
"00;34;20;24","00;34;22;19","we are produce like it's changing.","1"
"00;34;22;19","00;34;25;04","I'm hearing that","1"
"00;34;25;04","00;34;25;29","not","1"
"00;34;26;23","00;34;28;02","reading the.","1"
"00;34;28;02","00;34;30;16","So if I incorporate that,","1"
"00;34;30;16","00;34;31;24","what am I doing?","1"
"00;34;31;24","00;34;34;04","And I'm not the expert on communication,","1"
"00;34;34;04","00;34;36;05","so I wonder what the expert","1"
"00;34;36;05","00;34;41;19","can tell me about them.","1"
"00;34;41;19","00;34;44;05","Yeah, that's a good question.","1"
"00;34;44;05","00;34;44;22","Um,","1"
"00;34;46;10","00;34;47;02","yeah.","1"
"00;34;47;02","00;34;49;23","I'm not sure what to say about.","1"
"00;34;50;22","00;34;54;18","Luc first and then we'll continue.","1"
"00;34;54;18","00;34;57;05","So I wonder if what you're hearing,","1"
"00;34;57;06","00;34;57;15","Dean,","1"
"00;34;57;15","00;34;58;22","has anything to do","1"
"00;34;58;22","00;35;01;10","with the internal monologue.","1"
"00;35;02;00","00;35;02;12","So like,","1"
"00;35;02;12","00;35;04;16","as you are reading something,","1"
"00;35;04;16","00;35;06;21","then you are also hearing something.","1"
"00;35;07;00","00;35;09;03","And so it's like there's this internal,","1"
"00;35;09;03","00;35;09;26","I mean,","1"
"00;35;10;11","00;35;12;29","like I have a very I'm a talker person","1"
"00;35;12;29","00;35;13;22","and so I like","1"
"00;35;13;22","00;35;13;29","I have","1"
"00;35;13;29","00;35;15;04","strong internal monologue","1"
"00;35;15;04","00;35;16;15","like all the time running like through","1"
"00;35;16;15","00;35;17;18","even getting ready in the morning.","1"
"00;35;17;18","00;35;18;24","Okay, I need to get my shoes","1"
"00;35;18;24","00;35;19;25","and get my purse","1"
"00;35;19;25","00;35;21;13","and my keys and I have to pack my lunch.","1"
"00;35;21;13","00;35;23;03","And like all these things","1"
"00;35;23;03","00;35;23;25","like that happen.","1"
"00;35;23;25","00;35;26;04","So I'm constantly hearing that like,","1"
"00;35;26;04","00;35;27;29","as if I'm saying it maybe to myself,","1"
"00;35;27;29","00;35;29;21","even though I'm not speaking, but,","1"
"00;35;29;21","00;35;31;23","but I wonder what you know.","1"
"00;35;31;23","00;35;33;27","So I definitely am a producer","1"
"00;35;33;27","00;35;35;05","of whatever I am reading.","1"
"00;35;35;05","00;35;36;11","Like I reproduce it.","1"
"00;35;36;11","00;35;38;05","I reproduce it though, right?","1"
"00;35;38;05","00;35;40;05","So I have in my own","1"
"00;35;40;05","00;35;42;04","mind my own internal monologue.","1"
"00;35;42;04","00;35;43;03","But I wanted to like","1"
"00;35;43;03","00;35;43;21","I know not","1"
"00;35;43;21","00;35;45;21","everyone has this internal monologue","1"
"00;35;46;02","00;35;48;02","and so so what is it then?","1"
"00;35;48;02","00;35;50;09","The same for the people that don't","1"
"00;35;50;18","00;35;52;08","perhaps have this internal monologue.","1"
"00;35;52;08","00;35;53;00","I mean, maybe they carry","1"
"00;35;53;00","00;35;54;13","around a picture of all the things","1"
"00;35;54;13","00;35;55;02","that they need","1"
"00;35;55;02","00;35;57;01","to get ready in the morning. So yeah.","1"
"00;35;58;20","00;36;00;07","Justin Yeah.","1"
"00;36;00;07","00;36;02;15","And I think you bring up a good point.","1"
"00;36;02;15","00;36;03;22","Is it a monologue?","1"
"00;36;03;22","00;36;05;25","Is it a stereo log?","1"
"00;36;05;25","00;36;08;13","Is it a Quadra Phonic log","1"
"00;36;08;13","00;36;09;19","for some people?","1"
"00;36;09;19","00;36;10;01","I mean,","1"
"00;36;10;01","00;36;11;18","I mean, there was an availability","1"
"00;36;11;18","00;36;13;08","way back when, maybe","1"
"00;36;13;08","00;36;15;09","even before some of you were born,","1"
"00;36;15;09","00;36;17;14","there was Quadra Phonic Sound.","1"
"00;36;17;14","00;36;19;27","I remember that album in Quadrant Phonic","1"
"00;36;20;04","00;36;22;07","Sound and like","1"
"00;36;23;04","00;36;26;08","to my simple years, I didn't understand","1"
"00;36;26;17","00;36;27;18","what that even meant.","1"
"00;36;27;18","00;36;28;02","Just because","1"
"00;36;28;02","00;36;29;25","they were able to break it out","1"
"00;36;29;25","00;36;33;04","into four parts, didn't didn't change","1"
"00;36;33;04","00;36;36;10","what I was producing and processing.","1"
"00;36;36;27","00;36;39;28","So for the fact that we can type it","1"
"00;36;40;10","00;36;41;03","like that,","1"
"00;36;41;03","00;36;43;05","like not tape it up and literally","1"
"00;36;43;05","00;36;45;26","turn it into tapes, is the part","1"
"00;36;46;01","00;36;48;09","where I don't really have the background","1"
"00;36;48;09","00;36;50;02","to be able to explain","1"
"00;36;50;02","00;36;52;02","how that that ability","1"
"00;36;52;02","00;36;53;18","that field of affordances","1"
"00;36;53;18","00;36;54;21","as opposed to","1"
"00;36;54;21","00;36;55;17","examining this","1"
"00;36;55;17","00;36;57;29","as a single source of affordances","1"
"00;36;58;22","00;37;01;27","changes the the communication game","1"
"00;37;02;06","00;37;02;25","because it doesn't it","1"
"00;37;02;25","00;37;05;00","certainly does speak to mimicry","1"
"00;37;05;00","00;37;07;01","and what we can and cannot pick up.","1"
"00;37;07;11","00;37;09;24","It certainly speaks to Daniel's point","1"
"00;37;09;24","00;37;12;20","about about what happens when","1"
"00;37;13;00","00;37;14;14","when layers","1"
"00;37;14;14","00;37;16;11","appear and disappear","1"
"00;37;16;11","00;37;18;13","because we narrow down","1"
"00;37;18;28","00;37;21;06","what we're picking up on versus","1"
"00;37;21;06","00;37;23;19","have have both of our ears working,","1"
"00;37;23;19","00;37;26;00","even though we think it's our eyes","1"
"00;37;26;25","00;37;28;07","that are doing all the skating.","1"
"00;37;28;07","00;37;28;27","Right.","1"
"00;37;29;02","00;37;32;26","So again, I'm not I'm not trying to ask","1"
"00;37;32;26","00;37;33;27","the impossible question.","1"
"00;37;33;27","00;37;34;19","I'm just","1"
"00;37;34;20","00;37;36;21","curious in the sense of producer","1"
"00;37;37;07","00;37;38;27","and processor","1"
"00;37;38;27","00;37;41;06","and what that arrangement is","1"
"00;37;41;24","00;37;43;06","dependent upon, what","1"
"00;37;43;06","00;37;44;10","what the because Dan,","1"
"00;37;44;10","00;37;45;04","you brought it up in","1"
"00;37;45;04","00;37;46;24","in the last livestream","1"
"00;37;46;24","00;37;48;01","circumstances matter","1"
"00;37;49;20","00;37;52;24","so but as a hearer","1"
"00;37;52;24","00;37;55;13","I wonder I wonder if we if we","1"
"00;37;55;21","00;37;58;27","if we know enough about ourselves","1"
"00;38;00;05","00;38;01;00","to really be able to,","1"
"00;38;01;00","00;38;01;23","to, to","1"
"00;38;01;23","00;38;03;27","give this anything more than it is,","1"
"00;38;05;02","00;38;07;03","as Rami kindly pointed out in the paper,","1"
"00;38;07;11","00;38;08;27","give this more than","1"
"00;38;08;27","00;38;11;27","sort of a big roadmap deal.","1"
"00;38;13;12","00;38;15;18","If we if we are taking context","1"
"00;38;15;18","00;38;18;24","into consideration.","1"
"00;38;18;24","00;38;19;16","Thank you.","1"
"00;38;19;16","00;38;22;20","Let me.","1"
"00;38;22;20","00;38;23;22","Yeah, I think the discussion","1"
"00;38;23;22","00;38;26;07","about the internal monologue","1"
"00;38;26;07","00;38;27;21","is really interesting.","1"
"00;38;27;21","00;38;29;02","And there's a lot of things","1"
"00;38;29;02","00;38;29;29","that you said that","1"
"00;38;29;29","00;38;31;10","that I think really interesting.","1"
"00;38;31;10","00;38;33;11","But I want to go back to the","1"
"00;38;33;11","00;38;34;28","idea of the monologue.","1"
"00;38;34;28","00;38;35;21","And","1"
"00;38;36;22","00;38;38;15","there are some people who believe","1"
"00;38;38;15","00;38;41;17","that, like Chomsky, you believe that","1"
"00;38;41;17","00;38;44;05","language is not even for communication.","1"
"00;38;44;05","00;38;45;28","It's about structuring thought.","1"
"00;38;45;28","00;38;47;12","And so there's there are people","1"
"00;38;47;12","00;38;48;15","who believe that","1"
"00;38;48;15","00;38;51;19","the language is, first","1"
"00;38;51;19","00;38;52;08","and foremost","1"
"00;38;52;08","00;38;53;18","something that","1"
"00;38;53;18","00;38;54;28","is a property","1"
"00;38;54;28","00;38;56;14","of the structure of our thoughts","1"
"00;38;56;14","00;38;58;00","and not a property","1"
"00;38;58;00","00;39;00;19","of systems of communication and","1"
"00;39;01;14","00;39;05;04","so there's this idea that like the","1"
"00;39;06;17","00;39;08;02","the the","1"
"00;39;08;02","00;39;10;04","inner monologue comes first","1"
"00;39;10;04","00;39;12;03","and comes the communication","1"
"00;39;12;03","00;39;14;04","of this inner monologue in the","1"
"00;39;14;09","00;39;16;03","in communication.","1"
"00;39;16;03","00;39;20;09","So we have this basic that is once a","1"
"00;39;20;13","00;39;22;09","what's more inherent","1"
"00;39;22;09","00;39;23;22","in the transmission view","1"
"00;39;23;22","00;39;25;17","that we have our train of thought.","1"
"00;39;25;17","00;39;28;08","We are we have our","1"
"00;39;28;26","00;39;30;00","in our speech that we that","1"
"00;39;30;00","00;39;30;25","we have in our heads.","1"
"00;39;30;25","00;39;31;16","And then","1"
"00;39;31;16","00;39;33;24","we translate this in our speech, in","1"
"00;39;33;24","00;39;36;08","overt speech that is then","1"
"00;39;36;08","00;39;37;23","taken by somebody else.","1"
"00;39;37;23","00;39;40;26","And I think that this gets","1"
"00;39;41;16","00;39;44;02","the priorities wrong.","1"
"00;39;44;09","00;39;45;14","And between outer","1"
"00;39;45;14","00;39;46;14","speech and inner speech","1"
"00;39;46;14","00;39;47;00","and there's been","1"
"00;39;47;00","00;39;49;06","a lot of work in the philosophy by","1"
"00;39;50;05","00;39;53;15","Wilfred Sellers and by others","1"
"00;39;53;15","00;39;56;15","in in psychology, like if you go ski,","1"
"00;39;57;04","00;39;58;17","we say that","1"
"00;39;58;17","00;40;01;18","the first form of speech is overt speech","1"
"00;40;01;22","00;40;05;00","that is then internalized in in","1"
"00;40;05;17","00;40;06;23","that becomes like","1"
"00;40;07;24","00;40;09;02","that, that becomes inner.","1"
"00;40;09;02","00;40;10;06","But first,","1"
"00;40;10;06","00;40;11;10","in the beginning,","1"
"00;40;11;10","00;40;13;14","there's only overt speech.","1"
"00;40;13;14","00;40;15;06","A child that learns language","1"
"00;40;15;06","00;40;16;18","does not have an inner speech.","1"
"00;40;16;18","00;40;18;07","There is only outer speech","1"
"00;40;18;07","00;40;20;08","that is expressed directly","1"
"00;40;20;20","00;40;21;17","the child's speech.","1"
"00;40;21;17","00;40;22;12","The child","1"
"00;40;22;12","00;40;23;28","then do things with his words","1"
"00;40;23;28","00;40;24;25","in its environment","1"
"00;40;24;25","00;40;26;28","and does not directly, automatically","1"
"00;40;26;28","00;40;28;14","as the","1"
"00;40;28;14","00;40;29;23","corresponding inner","1"
"00;40;29;23","00;40;31;01","monologue in its head.","1"
"00;40;31;01","00;40;32;03","And there's a process","1"
"00;40;32;03","00;40;32;29","that's really interesting.","1"
"00;40;32;29","00;40;36;00","I think that is","1"
"00;40;36;00","00;40;38;15","where we see that beginning to happen,","1"
"00;40;38;15","00;40;41;01","where the child speaks to itself alone,","1"
"00;40;41;01","00;40;42;22","when there's nobody else around.","1"
"00;40;42;22","00;40;43;09","And so","1"
"00;40;43;09","00;40;44;09","there's this transition","1"
"00;40;44;09","00;40;45;18","where language is used","1"
"00;40;45;18","00;40;46;29","in communicative interaction.","1"
"00;40;46;29","00;40;48;05","And at some point","1"
"00;40;48;05","00;40;51;00","the child use language alone.","1"
"00;40;51;00","00;40;53;01","And there's a question of why,","1"
"00;40;53;01","00;40;53;26","why does it do?","1"
"00;40;53;26","00;40;55;12","And I think that our view","1"
"00;40;55;12","00;40;56;25","of communication is really","1"
"00;40;58;08","00;41;00;20","interestingly linked with use of","1"
"00;41;01;00","00;41;02;06","of the inner","1"
"00;41;02;06","00;41;03;25","monologue as self cueing","1"
"00;41;03;25","00;41;05;13","or self regulation.","1"
"00;41;05;13","00;41;08;14","And so the child can","1"
"00;41;08;14","00;41;09;13","actually regulate.","1"
"00;41;09;13","00;41;10;18","It's still about for a dance","1"
"00;41;10;18","00;41;12;05","when it's alone,","1"
"00;41;12;05","00;41;13;26","when there's nobody else around.","1"
"00;41;13;26","00;41;16;26","And in time this in the outer","1"
"00;41;17;29","00;41;21;12","zone for this outer monologue but alone","1"
"00;41;21;12","00;41;22;21","monologue","1"
"00;41;22;25","00;41;25;24","becomes overt because the child learns","1"
"00;41;25;24","00;41;27;24","to not necessarily produce","1"
"00;41;27;25","00;41;29;29","the sound that correspond","1"
"00;41;29;29","00;41;31;19","to the producing of these acts.","1"
"00;41;31;19","00;41;32;16","And there's there's","1"
"00;41;32;16","00;41;33;22","this integration that's","1"
"00;41;33;22","00;41;35;23","there is this internalization of","1"
"00;41;36;12","00;41;37;16","our third discourse","1"
"00;41;37;16","00;41;38;24","that becomes in our discourse.","1"
"00;41;38;24","00;41;40;15","And there's a lot of","1"
"00;41;40;15","00;41;41;24","cute anecdotes about that.","1"
"00;41;41;24","00;41;45;04","My nephew is a I have a nephew,","1"
"00;41;45;12","00;41;46;04","the son of my","1"
"00;41;46;04","00;41;47;10","my sister","1"
"00;41;47;10","00;41;49;12","and is like when is","1"
"00;41;49;12","00;41;51;06","is about to go to sleep.","1"
"00;41;51;06","00;41;52;03","He's in his bed.","1"
"00;41;52;03","00;41;55;16","And every night is like rehearsing","1"
"00;41;55;16","00;41;56;06","the events","1"
"00;41;56;06","00;41;57;13","that happen in in the day","1"
"00;41;57;13","00;41;59;21","and you seeing like the","1"
"00;41;59;21","00;42;02;11","the comments that that the rules","1"
"00;42;02;11","00;42;03;28","the norms that he heard in the","1"
"00;42;03;28","00;42;05;07","oh I don't have to do that","1"
"00;42;05;07","00;42;06;05","I must do that.","1"
"00;42;06;05","00;42;07;19","And so he's like, we're you","1"
"00;42;07;19","00;42;09;01","what happened in the day?","1"
"00;42;09;01","00;42;11;05","So this outer monologue","1"
"00;42;11;05","00;42;12;20","when he's alone in his bed","1"
"00;42;12;20","00;42;14;26","is like the beginning of inner thought.","1"
"00;42;14;26","00;42;16;19","We're seeing is starts","1"
"00;42;18;05","00;42;19;18","out in the open and","1"
"00;42;19;18","00;42;20;23","at some point this","1"
"00;42;20;23","00;42;21;08","this outer","1"
"00;42;21;08","00;42;23;11","monologue will become internalized","1"
"00;42;23;18","00;42;26;18","and we won't hear the he's his thoughts","1"
"00;42;27;21","00;42;28;20","out in the open.","1"
"00;42;28;20","00;42;29;12","But I think","1"
"00;42;29;12","00;42;31;20","that's like the process that it takes.","1"
"00;42;31;20","00;42;34;00","And there's also the idea another point","1"
"00;42;34;08","00;42;36;23","that we, for instance, when we read,","1"
"00;42;37;05","00;42;39;12","usually we read silently,","1"
"00;42;39;12","00;42;40;15","so we read","1"
"00;42;40;15","00;42;41;05","what's written","1"
"00;42;41;05","00;42;42;19","and we have the corresponding","1"
"00;42;42;19","00;42;43;09","inner monologue.","1"
"00;42;43;09","00;42;46;04","But it's known that in ancient times","1"
"00;42;46;04","00;42;47;11","when people were reading,","1"
"00;42;47;11","00;42;48;14","usually they were reading","1"
"00;42;48;14","00;42;50;03","automatically aloud,","1"
"00;42;50;03","00;42;53;16","loud, loudly, and it took a training","1"
"00;42;53;27","00;42;54;13","in order","1"
"00;42;54;13","00;42;55;07","to be able","1"
"00;42;55;07","00;42;57;08","to read without speaking the words.","1"
"00;42;58;23","00;43;00;19","And so, so like in middle age","1"
"00;43;00;19","00;43;02;26","and I'm not perfectly sure it's","1"
"00;43;02;26","00;43;06;05","if it's certainly accurately we should","1"
"00;43;06;27","00;43;07;26","verify it.","1"
"00;43;07;26","00;43;10;04","But I believe that's that's true.","1"
"00;43;10;12","00;43;12;04","And it seems that they heard that.","1"
"00;43;12;04","00;43;13;19","So it seems that","1"
"00;43;13;19","00;43;15;19","first there's the outer monologue,","1"
"00;43;15;19","00;43;17;20","the outer dialog,","1"
"00;43;17;20","00;43;19;25","and then there's the outer monologue,","1"
"00;43;19;25","00;43;22;01","and then there's the inner monologue","1"
"00;43;22;01","00;43;23;09","that comes after that.","1"
"00;43;23;09","00;43;25;12","And I think that's more the","1"
"00;43;25;19","00;43;27;14","the true direction of priority","1"
"00;43;27;14","00;43;28;22","between inner","1"
"00;43;28;22","00;43;30;00","monologue and other monologue","1"
"00;43;33;29","00;43;36;25","flow.","1"
"00;43;36;25","00;43;37;16","So I just","1"
"00;43;37;16","00;43;39;25","have a cute anecdote","1"
"00;43;39;25","00;43;41;16","about, about learning, learning to talk.","1"
"00;43;41;16","00;43;42;24","So I have two kids","1"
"00;43;42;24","00;43;44;21","and they're super different.","1"
"00;43;44;21","00;43;47;05","My son did as your nephew did me","1"
"00;43;47;05","00;43;49;00","like would be in his crib","1"
"00;43;49;00","00;43;50;07","talking to himself,","1"
"00;43;50;07","00;43;51;16","talking to his stuffed","1"
"00;43;51;16","00;43;54;06","animals and kind of recreating events","1"
"00;43;54;25","00;43;56;15","in a similar way.","1"
"00;43;56;15","00;43;59;19","He also babbled a lot like a lot of like","1"
"00;43;59;26","00;44;01;06","just always bluff above about like","1"
"00;44;01;06","00;44;01;29","just saying","1"
"00;44;01;29","00;44;03;26","nothing from the time he was tiny","1"
"00;44;03;26","00;44;06;09","and has an incredible vocabulary.","1"
"00;44;06;09","00;44;07;13","I mean, now he's six,","1"
"00;44;07;13","00;44;08;07","but people are like,","1"
"00;44;08;07","00;44;09;05","wow, how old is this kid?","1"
"00;44;09;05","00;44;10;04","I mean, he's reading at three","1"
"00;44;10;04","00;44;12;11","and just is like very, very verbal.","1"
"00;44;12;11","00;44;15;14","And my my daughter is super different.","1"
"00;44;15;22","00;44;17;22","So she did not really babble,","1"
"00;44;17;22","00;44;19;17","but she signed like crazy.","1"
"00;44;19;17","00;44;21;03","And they both went to the same school.","1"
"00;44;21;03","00;44;22;06","They both teach them","1"
"00;44;22;06","00;44;23;24","the same signs like say,","1"
"00;44;23;24","00;44;25;07","milk and cracker and cheese","1"
"00;44;25;07","00;44;26;12","and you know, bathroom","1"
"00;44;26;12","00;44;27;17","and all the things.","1"
"00;44;27;17","00;44;28;02","So like","1"
"00;44;28;02","00;44;29;29","they both went to the same daycare,","1"
"00;44;29;29","00;44;31;12","same environment,","1"
"00;44;31;12","00;44;32;25","and she picked up the signing","1"
"00;44;32;25","00;44;34;12","much more than my son ever did.","1"
"00;44;34;12","00;44;35;29","Has maybe one or two signs.","1"
"00;44;35;29","00;44;36;28","She's like 20.","1"
"00;44;36;28","00;44;38;21","Like, I had to go learn the signs","1"
"00;44;38;21","00;44;40;00","and before she could sign,","1"
"00;44;40;00","00;44;41;00","she would just like stand","1"
"00;44;41;00","00;44;42;22","in the kitchen and scream,","1"
"00;44;42;22","00;44;44;17","like just unable to communicate","1"
"00;44;44;17","00;44;46;15","whatever it was that she wanted.","1"
"00;44;46;15","00;44;48;14","And it's so odd.","1"
"00;44;48;14","00;44;48;29","Like,","1"
"00;44;49;07","00;44;50;00","they're just like two","1"
"00;44;50;00","00;44;51;04","totally different kids.","1"
"00;44;51;04","00;44;53;12","But she when she was learning Chinese,","1"
"00;44;53;26","00;44;55;11","I had a parent teacher conference","1"
"00;44;55;11","00;44;55;21","with the two","1"
"00;44;55;21","00;44;56;22","and they're both in learning","1"
"00;44;56;22","00;44;57;08","Chinese now.","1"
"00;44;57;08","00;44;57;29","They're in private school","1"
"00;44;57;29","00;44;58;17","and they've been learning","1"
"00;44;58;17","00;44;59;19","for like eight years.","1"
"00;44;59;19","00;45;01;14","So when she was first starting to learn,","1"
"00;45;01;14","00;45;03;03","she wouldn't speak in class.","1"
"00;45;03;03","00;45;04;13","And the teacher and I had a conference","1"
"00;45;04;13","00;45;05;21","and the teacher said like, Oh,","1"
"00;45;05;21","00;45;07;29","I am concerned about your daughter.","1"
"00;45;07;29","00;45;09;08","She doesn't participate in class.","1"
"00;45;09;08","00;45;10;17","Like she doesn't have to take Chinese.","1"
"00;45;10;17","00;45;11;21","It's not mandatory.","1"
"00;45;11;21","00;45;12;17","If you wanted to put her","1"
"00;45;12;17","00;45;13;10","in a different class","1"
"00;45;13;10","00;45;14;03","and she could have a silent","1"
"00;45;14;03","00;45;14;27","reading grade","1"
"00;45;14;27","00;45;18;26","and I was like, Oh, so it occurred to me","1"
"00;45;19;04","00;45;20;21","like and I knew that she and,","1"
"00;45;20;21","00;45;22;02","and because she didn't babble","1"
"00;45;22;02","00;45;22;27","and like I would,","1"
"00;45;22;27","00;45;24;07","somebody handed her a lollipop.","1"
"00;45;24;07","00;45;24;29","She was like two","1"
"00;45;24;29","00;45;26;22","and she said, Say thank you.","1"
"00;45;26;22","00;45;27;23","And she did the same for it.","1"
"00;45;27;23","00;45;28;03","But, but,","1"
"00;45;28;03","00;45;30;08","I mean, she really did not speak","1"
"00;45;30;08","00;45;31;27","would not form clear words","1"
"00;45;31;27","00;45;33;01","unless she knew","1"
"00;45;33;01","00;45;35;00","she could see them perfectly.","1"
"00;45;35;00","00;45;36;20","And so I said at a tutoring","1"
"00;45;36;20","00;45;37;24","with the Chinese tutor,","1"
"00;45;37;24","00;45;39;20","like just twice, three times.","1"
"00;45;39;20","00;45;41;00","And then it began,","1"
"00;45;41;00","00;45;42;10","like she was like listening.","1"
"00;45;42;10","00;45;44;00","Can I repeat this to my engage","1"
"00;45;44;00","00;45;45;20","with this word correctly.","1"
"00;45;45;20","00;45;47;18","And she just was very more","1"
"00;45;47;18","00;45;49;04","much more careful in that.","1"
"00;45;49;04","00;45;50;11","But both kids,","1"
"00;45;50;11","00;45;51;18","as soon as they could talk,","1"
"00;45;51;18","00;45;53;27","talked in their sleep like crazy.","1"
"00;45;53;27","00;45;55;23","So Anyway, there's like kids start","1"
"00;45;58;04","00;46;01;06","like stories.","1"
"00;46;01;06","00;46;03;22","The development of the self cueing","1"
"00;46;04;18","00;46;08;04","and self speaking is very interesting.","1"
"00;46;08;20","00;46;11;07","Even earlier on","1"
"00;46;11;07","00;46;15;02","in behavioral analysis and behaviorism,","1"
"00;46;15;16","00;46;16;06","like in B.F.","1"
"00;46;16;06","00;46;18;23","Skinner's work, there's extensive","1"
"00;46;19;10","00;46;22;11","exploration of how covert","1"
"00;46;22;29","00;46;24;17","monologues and covert","1"
"00;46;24;17","00;46;26;22","speech and societies of mind.","1"
"00;46;27;11","00;46;29;27","And then I guess more recently","1"
"00;46;30;04","00;46;30;23","it's become","1"
"00;46;30;23","00;46;31;18","better understood","1"
"00;46;31;18","00;46;34;17","how electrical activity in the body","1"
"00;46;34;17","00;46;36;16","and in the brain are still","1"
"00;46;36;16","00;46;39;26","initiated during covert speech like.","1"
"00;46;39;26","00;46;41;14","It's not an audible speech,","1"
"00;46;41;14","00;46;43;05","but actually in various ways","1"
"00;46;43;05","00;46;45;13","it still is embodied.","1"
"00;46;45;27","00;46;48;20","And then this question of reading","1"
"00;46;49;03","00;46;51;06","perhaps is another area","1"
"00;46;51;22","00;46;53;20","where we're talking about","1"
"00;46;53;20","00;46;57;19","in this language area,","1"
"00;46;57;19","00;46;59;19","what is similar or different","1"
"00;46;59;19","00;47;01;12","with listening","1"
"00;47;01;12","00;47;04;11","to speech, participating in speech","1"
"00;47;04;11","00;47;05;25","audibly?","1"
"00;47;06;06","00;47;08;16","Is it different if it's read or Braille?","1"
"00;47;09;13","00;47;11;10","How does the modality","1"
"00;47;11;10","00;47;13;06","and the media influence","1"
"00;47;14;11","00;47;16;16","some of these things you","1"
"00;47;17;04","00;47;17;21","and","1"
"00;47;20;03","00;47;20;26","again.","1"
"00;47;20;26","00;47;23;06","I think the proportions of two ears","1"
"00;47;23;06","00;47;24;03","to one mouth","1"
"00;47;24;03","00;47;24;22","is something","1"
"00;47;24;22","00;47;27;10","that we need to kind of really","1"
"00;47;27;10","00;47;28;05","hold on to","1"
"00;47;28;05","00;47;30;05","in this idea of single source","1"
"00;47;30;05","00;47;32;01","and monologue versus","1"
"00;47;32;01","00;47;33;27","what potentially is a stereo log","1"
"00;47;33;27","00;47;35;13","in a field of affordances","1"
"00;47;35;13","00;47;40;24","as opposed to a single source.","1"
"00;47;40;24","00;47;42;23","I don't know why why we've been","1"
"00;47;42;23","00;47;43;26","I don't know what advantages","1"
"00;47;43;26","00;47;45;21","are given by having","1"
"00;47;45;21","00;47;48;07","an ability to hear in stereo, but","1"
"00;47;48;08","00;47;49;23","it must be","1"
"00;47;49;23","00;47;52;09","better than having a single year","1"
"00;47;52;09","00;47;53;20","or a single receipt,","1"
"00;47;53;20","00;47;56;07","a single reception site.","1"
"00;47;56;07","00;47;58;29","And yet we we don't have two mouths.","1"
"00;47;58;29","00;48;02;11","So again, I think it's understandable","1"
"00;48;02;16","00;48;04;02","why from a","1"
"00;48;04;02","00;48;05;20","transmission point of view,","1"
"00;48;05;20","00;48;07;21","the deliverer standpoint,","1"
"00;48;07;21","00;48;11;08","we always collapse to a source,","1"
"00;48;11;14","00;48;12;20","a single source.","1"
"00;48;12;20","00;48;13;17","But if we","1"
"00;48;13;17","00;48;14;09","flip that","1"
"00;48;14;09","00;48;15;22","and now think about it","1"
"00;48;15;22","00;48;17;10","from the receiving standpoint,","1"
"00;48;18;20","00;48;19;10","how does that","1"
"00;48;19;10","00;48;21;12","how does that change our sense of what","1"
"00;48;21;12","00;48;22;13","communication is?","1"
"00;48;22;13","00;48;23;05","Because","1"
"00;48;24;08","00;48;25;00","it doesn't change","1"
"00;48;25;00","00;48;26;29","if I cover one of my years","1"
"00;48;26;29","00;48;28;02","or if I have an earbud in","1"
"00;48;28;02","00;48;29;13","and it cancels.","1"
"00;48;29;13","00;48;30;15","And yet something","1"
"00;48;30;15","00;48;32;10","fundamentally must change","1"
"00;48;32;10","00;48;33;12","in terms of communication","1"
"00;48;33;12","00;48;34;26","and the joint action,","1"
"00;48;34;26","00;48;37;22","even if it's monologue in my own head","1"
"00;48;38;03","00;48;40;20","versus dialog or trialogue","1"
"00;48;41;02","00;48;42;00","required to log.","1"
"00;48;42;00","00;48;43;02","Now again,","1"
"00;48;43;02","00;48;44;12","I haven't done any research","1"
"00;48;44;12","00;48;44;28","to try","1"
"00;48;44;28","00;48;46;03","to try to","1"
"00;48;46;03","00;48;46;15","figure out","1"
"00;48;46;15","00;48;47;26","what other people have done in terms","1"
"00;48;47;26","00;48;48;21","of looking at that.","1"
"00;48;48;21","00;48;50;29","But to your point, though, Renee,","1"
"00;48;51;00","00;48;51;25","in terms of","1"
"00;48;51;25","00;48;52;26","let's get this,","1"
"00;48;52;26","00;48;55;05","you can get past transmission.","1"
"00;48;55;05","00;48;56;02","We're getting trying","1"
"00;48;56;02","00;48;57;04","to get past the idea","1"
"00;48;57;04","00;48;59;05","of what is being delivered","1"
"00;48;59;05","00;49;01;21","and being trying to gain a deeper","1"
"00;49;01;21","00;49;03;28","appreciation of what is being heard.","1"
"00;49;04;25","00;49;06;22","So blue.","1"
"00;49;06;22","00;49;08;13","I'll tell you a little story","1"
"00;49;09;22","00;49;11;01","I have a loquacious son","1"
"00;49;11;01","00;49;12;19","is in his thirties now,","1"
"00;49;12;19","00;49;13;23","but he's actually, as he's","1"
"00;49;13;23","00;49;16;29","gotten smarter and wiser, speaks less","1"
"00;49;17;24","00;49;19;07","like a occasionally","1"
"00;49;19;07","00;49;21;14","he gets out of a developing words","1"
"00;49;21;14","00;49;22;00","silence","1"
"00;49;22;00","00;49;24;12","that could serve an entire community.","1"
"00;49;25;02","00;49;27;15","And I find that really fascinating.","1"
"00;49;27;15","00;49;30;04","I don't have to comment on it.","1"
"00;49;30;04","00;49;32;14","It's just you notice that as people know","1"
"00;49;32;14","00;49;35;24","more, they maybe they sign more,","1"
"00;49;35;26","00;49;37;23","maybe they find other ways","1"
"00;49;37;23","00;49;39;29","to to make their point.","1"
"00;49;40;09","00;49;41;21","And it goes back to that timing","1"
"00;49;41;21","00;49;43;04","your take thing.","1"
"00;49;43;07","00;49;46;20","So yeah.","1"
"00;49;46;20","00;49;48;01","Great.","1"
"00;49;48;01","00;49;49;06","There's so many","1"
"00;49;49;06","00;49;51;15","references like the true way","1"
"00;49;51;15","00;49;54;06","is the one that can't be spoken of or","1"
"00;49;54;06","00;49;55;14","those who do do","1"
"00;49;55;14","00;49;56;21","and those who can't teach","1"
"00;49;56;21","00;49;59;00","all these kinds of funny,","1"
"00;49;59;00","00;49;59;10","you know,","1"
"00;49;59;10","00;50;01;13","poking fun at different archetypes","1"
"00;50;01;13","00;50;02;13","and so on.","1"
"00;50;02;13","00;50;04;00","And how that's related to wisdom.","1"
"00;50;05;06","00;50;05;21","The two","1"
"00;50;05;21","00;50;08;29","ears and one mouth,","1"

"00;50;30;25","00;50;33;24","is it's like something that can't be","1"
"00;50;34;03","00;50;35;27","turned off.","1"
"00;50;35;27","00;50;37;05","Like the receiver.","1"
"00;50;37;05","00;50;40;09","All of our receiving is bilateral","1"

"00;51;03;29","00;51;06;00","Perhaps just a just so story,","1"

"00;51;56;18","00;51;57;12","a recipient kind of","1"

"00;52;24;16","00;52;26;18","it doesn't really matter","1"

"00;52;45;15","00;52;45;26","Just think","1"
"00;52;45;26","00;52;47;18","I'm trying to bring back the inference","1"
"00;52;47;18","00;52;48;24","and to the active inference here,","1"
"00;52;48;24","00;52;49;15","because the active part","1"

"00;53;39;02","00;53;40;14","One thing that makes me think about","1"

"00;53;43;20","00;53;45;23","representations of bug vision,","1"

"00;54;30;17","00;54;32;20","All these features are really important,","1"

"00;54;45;23","00;54;47;12","having multiple","1"
"00;54;48;11","00;54;50;13","aural orifices","1"

"00;54;54;21","00;54;58;24","through the skull and so on.","1"
"00;54;58;24","00;55;01;09","We are also seeking to flesh out","1"

"00;55;02;00","00;55;05;06","model of sounds in our environments.","1"
"00;55;05;29","00;55;08;19","So if we cover our ears","1"
"00;55;09;03","00;55;11;14","like that, proprioception","1"
"00;55;11;14","00;55;13;05","will help us understand that","1"
"00;55;13;05","00;55;15;00","even if something sounds kind of quiet,","1"
"00;55;15;00","00;55;15;29","we actually","1"
"00;55;15;29","00;55;17;09","we can recognize that","1"
"00;55;17;09","00;55;19;08","it's still a loud noise.","1"
"00;55;19;08","00;55;22;16","Or if we have one ear in a pillow,","1"
"00;55;23;01","00;55;24;19","we could recognize","1"
"00;55;24;19","00;55;25;24","that something is happening,","1"
"00;55;25;24","00;55;27;28","even though if it is being heard","1"
"00;55;27;28","00;55;32;01","differently on both sides.","1"
"00;55;32;01","00;55;34;26","So having multiple sensors","1"
"00;55;37;06","00;55;39;12","is very compatible","1"

"00;55;46;12","00;55;48;28","beyond any sensor reading.","1"
"00;55;48;28","00;55;51;13","If you have one midline thermometer,","1"

"00;55;56;24","00;55;59;01","Or you could have like a Gaussian blur.","1"
"00;55;59;21","00;56;00;21","Like I'm just less","1"

"00;56;02;14","00;56;04;18","from my one central sensor.","1"
"00;56;04;18","00;56;05;26","But maybe I'm","1"
"00;56;05;26","00;56;07;18","maybe it's a tight Gaussian,","1"
"00;56;07;18","00;56;08;23","maybe it's very broad,","1"
"00;56;08;23","00;56;10;08","but this is the best estimate.","1"
"00;56;11;10","00;56;12;14","Why would I have any","1"
"00;56;12;14","00;56;15;03","other estimate centered anywhere else","1"
"00;56;15;03","00;56;17;23","when you have two thermometers?","1"
"00;56;17;23","00;56;18;27","Now, there's a generative","1"
"00;56;18;27","00;56;20;05","modeling question","1"
"00;56;20;05","00;56;21;01","about whether it's","1"
"00;56;21;01","00;56;21;29","going to be a Gaussian","1"
"00;56;21;29","00;56;22;29","with a peak in the middle","1"
"00;56;22;29","00;56;24;00","or whether you're going to have a peak","1"
"00;56;24;00","00;56;25;08","more on one side","1"
"00;56;25;08","00;56;25;21","and have it","1"
"00;56;25;21","00;56;26;20","just go through the other","1"
"00;56;26;20","00;56;28;28","depending on those sensor readings.","1"
"00;56;28;28","00;56;30;10","But at that point,","1"
"00;56;30;10","00;56;32;16","you're ending up with some distributions","1"
"00;56;33;16","00;56;35;06","which if we think of that distribution","1"
"00;56;35;06","00;56;36;18","as like what is experienced,","1"
"00;56;36;18","00;56;37;01","as like","1"
"00;56;37;01","00;56;39;20","maybe the product of the sensing process","1"
"00;56;40;20","00;56;42;20","that distributions enrichment","1"
"00;56;43;09","00;56;45;14","is of a different type","1"
"00;56;47;01","00;56;49;02","and yet of a different simplicity","1"
"00;56;49;23","00;56;52;26","then any number of sensor readings","1"
"00;56;53;29","00;56;54;27","in terms of what","1"
"00;56;54;27","00;56;57;07","their raw information are.","1"
"00;56;58;02","00;57;01;02","So it seems very relevant this to ears,","1"
"00;57;01;02","00;57;02;08","one mouth","1"
"00;57;02;08","00;57;03;19","not just for listening","1"

"00;57;17;02","00;57;18;09","What do you think about sensors?","1"
"00;57;18;09","00;57;18;28","Rami","1"
"00;57;20;25","00;57;22;06","Yeah, I think that","1"
"00;57;22;06","00;57;24;17","you you explained it well.","1"
"00;57;25;18","00;57;26;18","It's","1"
"00;57;27;18","00;57;29;06","yeah, I think it's useful,","1"
"00;57;29;06","00;57;32;01","as you said, to have multiple sensory","1"
"00;57;32;01","00;57;34;08","channels that can be active,","1"
"00;57;35;03","00;57;37;08","because I think that's an argument","1"
"00;57;37;08","00;57;40;14","from how we and it's in its book","1"
"00;57;40;24","00;57;43;09","in 2013 book on predictive,","1"
"00;57;43;24","00;57;44;15","predictive mind.","1"
"00;57;44;15","00;57;47;06","I think he says that","1"
"00;57;47;06","00;57;49;02","if you have a","1"
"00;57;50;08","00;57;51;25","tribunal and you're","1"

"00;58;03;07","00;58;05;00","because if these sources of information","1"
"00;58;05;00","00;58;06;24","are influenced each other,","1"
"00;58;06;24","00;58;09;16","you have a less reliable","1"
"00;58;11;02","00;58;12;10","I would say","1"
"00;58;13;11","00;58;14;22","I forget the world","1"
"00;58;14;22","00;58;17;09","at the moment in my years, unlikely","1"
"00;58;17;27","00;58;18;16","in English.","1"
"00;58;18;16","00;58;19;17","So I forget the word.","1"
"00;58;19;17","00;58;22;14","But you have a less reliable and","1"
"00;58;23;15","00;58;25;11","the information about","1"
"00;58;25;11","00;58;28;20","the about the the","1"
"00;58;28;20","00;58;30;10","the the case","1"
"00;58;30;10","00;58;32;05","so like it's useful from","1"
"00;58;32;05","00;58;35;03","from a reliability some point to to have","1"
"00;58;35;03","00;58;36;25","multiple independent","1"
"00;58;36;25","00;58;38;12","source of information","1"
"00;58;38;12","00;58;41;00","so so that may be an expression of why","1"
"00;58;41;08","00;58;43;23","we have that maybe an explanation of","1"
"00;58;44;24","00;58;46;17","the relative modularity","1"
"00;58;46;17","00;58;48;10","of of perception.","1"
"00;58;48;10","00;58;49;05","So there are","1"
"00;58;49;05","00;58;50;06","we know that there are","1"
"00;58;50;06","00;58;51;18","limits to that modularity,","1"
"00;58;51;18","00;58;52;10","but there is a","1"

"00;58;59;08","00;59;01;20","modalities that we have.","1"
"00;59;02;02","00;59;03;27","So yes, about the two","1"
"00;59;03;27","00;59;04;25","here is that obviously,","1"
"00;59;04;25","00;59;06;26","I think maybe if we had","1"
"00;59;07;03","00;59;10;21","if our auditory sensory system","1"
"00;59;10;21","00;59;12;22","was only devised to","1"
"00;59;12;22","00;59;14;13","communicative interaction, maybe to","1"
"00;59;14;13","00;59;16;15","it would be okay to just have one here","1"
"00;59;16;15","00;59;18;05","when because","1"
"00;59;18;05","00;59;18;24","we could like","1"
"00;59;18;24","00;59;20;17","we know who's talking to us.","1"
"00;59;20;17","00;59;22;21","And so we, we can direct our,","1"
"00;59;23;20","00;59;25;12","our sensory","1"
"00;59;25;12","00;59;27;29","apparatus to do this communicative","1"
"00;59;29;14","00;59;30;09","signal.","1"
"00;59;30;09","00;59;32;19","But because we use our ears","1"
"00;59;32;19","00;59;34;06","not just to, to attuned","1"
"00;59;34;06","00;59;35;23","to a communicative interaction,","1"
"00;59;35;23","00;59;37;09","but also to know what's","1"
"00;59;37;09","00;59;38;15","in our surrounding, it's","1"
"00;59;38;15","00;59;39;29","really clearly more useful","1"
"00;59;39;29","00;59;40;27","to have that","1"
"00;59;40;27","00;59;43;17","to to have a greater reception","1"
"00;59;43;17","00;59;44;21","from from information","1"
"00;59;44;21","00;59;46;02","from anywhere around us.","1"
"00;59;46;02","00;59;49;23","So I maybe if if addition was only about","1"
"00;59;49;23","00;59;50;29","communication,","1"
"00;59;50;29","00;59;52;23","it would be okay to have just one ear.","1"
"00;59;52;23","00;59;54;04","But because we want to know","1"
"00;59;54;04","00;59;56;07","as precisely what's happening there","1"
"00;59;56;28","00;59;58;02","and at the same time know","1"
"00;59;58;02","00;59;58;26","what's happening there,","1"
"00;59;58;26","01;00;00;17","maybe it's it's it's there.","1"
"01;00;00;17","01;00;01;29","It has been more useful","1"
"01;00;01;29","01;00;03;18","to have these two here","1"
"01;00;03;18","01;00;05;09","two years on both sides.","1"
"01;00;05;09","01;00;07;29","So maybe there's something about that.","1"
"01;00;07;29","01;00;08;11","That.","1"
"01;00;08;20","01;00;09;15","You have one short note","1"
"01;00;09;15","01;00;10;13","and then Dean is","1"
"01;00;10;13","01;00;11;22","there are also","1"
"01;00;11;22","01;00;13;09","animals with anatomy","1"
"01;00;13;09","01;00;15;08","so that they can direct to their ears,","1"
"01;00;15;08","01;00;17;00","which is seemingly very analogous","1"
"01;00;17;00","01;00;19;05","to the ocular motor skating.","1"
"01;00;19;05","01;00;21;14","It's like an audio postcard","1"
"01;00;21;14","01;00;23;23","and it just the human form","1"
"01;00;23;23","01;00;25;01","outside of the ear wiggling,","1"
"01;00;25;01","01;00;26;15","which is maybe slightly","1"
"01;00;26;15","01;00;28;19","vestigial representation of that.","1"
"01;00;28;28","01;00;32;03","But we have opted for a strategy","1"
"01;00;32;13","01;00;33;27","with fixed ear positioning,","1"
"01;00;33;27","01;00;35;06","but a mobile neck","1"
"01;00;35;06","01;00;36;26","which also makes a cage.","1"
"01;00;36;26","01;00;37;18","So that's kind of our","1"
"01;00;37;18","01;00;42;08","low speed audio skating team.","1"
"01;00;43;21","01;00;44;27","Yeah, I think the only advantage","1"
"01;00;44;27","01;00;46;11","I could see to having two models","1"
"01;00;46;11","01;00;47;19","is that I could eat the French fries","1"
"01;00;47;19","01;00;50;01","and drink milkshake at the same time.","1"
"01;00;50;01","01;00;50;19","And I don't know what","1"
"01;00;50;19","01;00;52;09","that would be like,","1"
"01;00;52;09","01;00;54;15","just overpowering, but","1"
"01;00;54;15","01;00;55;02","what I think is","1"
"01;00;55;02","01;00;57;11","interesting is in the .2.1","1"
"01;00;58;08","01;01;00;19","blue brought up the idea of, so","1"
"01;01;01;02","01;01;02;06","how do we make sure that there's","1"
"01;01;02;06","01;01;02;17","a difference","1"
"01;01;02;17","01;01;04;19","between content and context?","1"
"01;01;04;19","01;01;06;24","And I think whether it's two eyes,","1"
"01;01;07;14","01;01;09;19","two ears, two nostrils, whatever,","1"
"01;01;09;25","01;01;12;26","there must be some advantage to the form","1"
"01;01;13;19","01;01;14;11","because as I said","1"
"01;01;14;11","01;01;17;17","even if you cover one of those intakes,","1"
"01;01;18;09","01;01;20;19","it's not just a redundancy issue, it's","1"
"01;01;20;19","01;01;22;00","a recursion issue.","1"
"01;01;22;00","01;01;25;24","It creates that ability to see context","1"
"01;01;25;26","01;01;29;08","here, context and smell context.","1"
"01;01;29;08","01;01;30;01","I don't believe","1"
"01;01;30;01","01;01;32;04","we would have those things.","1"
"01;01;32;04","01;01;32;24","And as I said,","1"
"01;01;32;24","01;01;35;01","I think I'd get overwhelmed with context","1"
"01;01;35;01","01;01;36;13","and having both French","1"
"01;01;36;13","01;01;37;20","fries and milkshake,","1"
"01;01;38;26","01;01;39;29","it would just blow me up.","1"
"01;01;39;29","01;01;43;13","So but that that's just a statement","1"
"01;01;44;11","01;01;45;17","that says it's not self.","1"
"01;01;45;17","01;01;47;12","They do not give people to models.","1"
"01;01;47;12","01;01;48;26","It can be overpowering.","1"
"01;01;48;26","01;01;49;09","Well.","1"
"01;01;49;13","01;01;51;16","One aspect might return us","1"
"01;01;51;16","01;01;55;03","to the question of composition analogy.","1"
"01;01;56;11","01;01;58;25","It seems like visual","1"
"01;01;58;25","01;02;01;11","composition and temporal composition","1"
"01;02;02;02","01;02;04;23","in music and in heard speech","1"
"01;02;06;00","01;02;07;08","as","1"
"01;02;09;08","01;02;09;21","speaking","1"
"01;02;09;21","01;02;12;09","in terms of generative models","1"
"01;02;12;25","01;02;14;28","have highly factor, sizable","1"
"01;02;14;28","01;02;17;12","or sparsely connected generative models","1"
"01;02;18;08","01;02;20;09","famously connected to like the where","1"
"01;02;20;09","01;02;20;19","and the","1"
"01;02;20;19","01;02;24;02","what streams in visual neuroanatomy.","1"
"01;02;24;02","01;02;24;26","And that's been explored","1"
"01;02;24;26","01;02;26;23","in some active inference papers","1"
"01;02;26;23","01;02;29;18","with awareness and whiteness as being","1"
"01;02;29;18","01;02;32;08","factor visible in the generative model","1"
"01;02;32;19","01;02;33;25","because it really is the case","1"
"01;02;33;25","01;02;35;27","that different layers","1"
"01;02;35;27","01;02;37;18","can host different. What's.","1"
"01;02;37;18","01;02;39;03","And so it makes sense to have","1"
"01;02;39;03","01;02;40;09","those two totally separate","1"
"01;02;41;29","01;02;42;22","taste and","1"
"01;02;42;22","01;02;45;02","smell which are","1"
"01;02;47;05","01;02;48;26","there are more midline,","1"
"01;02;48;26","01;02;50;12","though there are two nostrils.","1"
"01;02;50;12","01;02;51;22","I'm not totally sure on","1"
"01;02;51;22","01;02;52;17","whether there's like, you know,","1"
"01;02;52;17","01;02;55;23","one or two smell chambers or anything","1"
"01;02;55;23","01;03;00;08","composition of chemical bouquets","1"
"01;03;01;05","01;03;03;12","seems quite different,","1"
"01;03;03;12","01;03;04;21","like two paintings","1"
"01;03;04;21","01;03;06;23","that you like next to each other","1"
"01;03;06;23","01;03;09;02","or to songs in succession","1"
"01;03;09;12","01;03;12;05","that you like.","1"
"01;03;12;05","01;03;15;22","Or it's a little bit different than to","1"
"01;03;16;09","01;03;19;00","smells or tastes sequentially","1"
"01;03;19;00","01;03;23;04","or composed.","1"
"01;03;23;04","01;03;26;05","And so maybe these more","1"
"01;03;26;05","01;03;28;10","sometimes called basil, sensory","1"
"01;03;28;10","01;03;31;04","or cognitive features","1"
"01;03;31;04","01;03;34;04","are less affable.","1"
"01;03;34;04","01;03;38;08","And this kind of relates to a cognitive","1"
"01;03;39;09","01;03;40;22","stack","1"
"01;03;41;04","01;03;43;11","where verbal","1"
"01;03;43;11","01;03;45;25","and symbolic communication is","1"
"01;03;47;11","01;03;49;29","like the tip of the iceberg.","1"
"01;03;49;29","01;03;52;16","Support it by","1"
"01;03;52;16","01;03;54;01","biological processes","1"
"01;03;54;01","01;03;56;26","that are differently or less affable","1"
"01;03;57;21","01;04;00;03","and at first only pointed towards","1"
"01;04;00;03","01;04;01;20","like through metaphors and speech,","1"
"01;04;02;24","01;04;05;02","butterflies in my stomach and so on,","1"
"01;04;05;02","01;04;05;11","but then","1"
"01;04;05;11","01;04;08;07","ultimately entirely inexpressible,","1"
"01;04;09;13","01;04;11;03","maybe with some stop in between,","1"
"01;04;11;03","01;04;12;07","like being able to express","1"
"01;04;12;07","01;04;13;21","through the body,","1"
"01;04;13;21","01;04;14;02","like what","1"
"01;04;14;02","01;04;16;10","it's like to do a certain","1"
"01;04;16;10","01;04;18;05","bodily position","1"
"01;04;18;05","01;04;19;16","or have a certain experience","1"
"01;04;19;16","01;04;23;15","or be in a certain physiological state.","1"
"01;04;23;15","01;04;25;03","And","1"
"01;04;25;16","01;04;26;22","this kind of casts","1"
"01;04;26;22","01;04;28;25","a light on the transmission view,","1"
"01;04;29;29","01;04;32;03","complementing the ecological view,","1"
"01;04;32;17","01;04;34;05","the transmission view","1"
"01;04;34;05","01;04;36;17","is like down, propagating","1"
"01;04;37;12","01;04;39;21","symbolic communication","1"
"01;04;39;21","01;04;41;02","and seeking for that","1"
"01;04;41;02","01;04;43;21","to apply all the way on down.","1"
"01;04;43;21","01;04;47;16","Whereas a more bottom up and arguably","1"
"01;04;47;25","01;04;50;21","eco evo devo informed perspective","1"
"01;04;51;14","01;04;56;08","is grounded in the ecological setting","1"
"01;04;57;02","01;04;59;05","and then allows for","1"
"01;04;59;22","01;05;00;29","the crystallization","1"
"01;05;00;29","01;05;03;08","of symbolic processes,","1"
"01;05;04;19","01;05;05;26","including communicated","1"
"01;05;05;26","01;05;08;04","symbolic processes which","1"
"01;05;08;04","01;05;08;24","are aren't","1"
"01;05;08;24","01;05;10;02","they supposed to be the stronghold","1"
"01;05;10;02","01;05;11;25","of the transmission view?","1"
"01;05;11;25","01;05;16;23","But then if even that phenomena","1"
"01;05;17;23","01;05;18;03","can be","1"
"01;05;18;03","01;05;21;14","captured within an ecological frame,","1"
"01;05;21;14","01;05;24;12","then there's an extremely strong basis","1"
"01;05;25;08","01;05;27;19","for the integrative cohesion","1"
"01;05;27;19","01;05;30;23","of an ecological view, as opposed to","1"
"01;05;30;23","01;05;34;06","an extremely piecemeal and","1"
"01;05;35;12","01;05;38;02","question begging transmission view","1"
"01;05;39;27","01;05;40;23","like we talked about.","1"
"01;05;40;23","01;05;41;18","So meiosis","1"
"01;05;41;18","01;05;44;11","and biosimilars, this in live stream 47.","1"
"01;05;46;11","01;05;49;06","So will we see","1"
"01;05;49;06","01;05;51;16","verb verbal communication and behavior","1"
"01;05;52;11","01;05;54;13","as something that is enabled","1"
"01;05;54;13","01;05;55;12","and with analogy,","1"
"01;05;55;12","01;05;57;13","but not the same as","1"
"01;05;57;13","01;05;59;09","cellular transduction?","1"
"01;05;59;09","01;06;00;09","Or are we going to seek","1"
"01;06;00;09","01;06;02;16","a cellular transduction explanation","1"
"01;06;03;09","01;06;10;08","based on verbal behavior?","1"
"01;06;10;08","01;06;14;20","Let's return to some of our topics.","1"
"01;06;14;20","01;06;17;01","All right. Few areas to go blue.","1"
"01;06;17;01","01;06;17;17","Any thoughts?","1"
"01;06;17;17","01;06;20;23","Just any way you want.","1"
"01;06;20;23","01;06;21;03","Yeah.","1"
"01;06;21;03","01;06;22;06","So I just wanted to follow up","1"
"01;06;22;06","01;06;23;25","on what you said.","1"
"01;06;23;25","01;06;25;01","And I just think that the beauty","1"
"01;06;25;01","01;06;26;28","of the ecological approach","1"
"01;06;26;28","01;06;28;29","to understanding communication","1"
"01;06;28;29","01;06;32;23","is that communication between cells, bit","1"
"01;06;32;23","01;06;34;24","semiotic representation or other,","1"
"01;06;35;03","01;06;35;25","and between","1"
"01;06;35;25","01;06;36;21","animals, maybe","1"
"01;06;36;21","01;06;38;23","with gestures, maybe interspecies","1"
"01;06;38;23","01;06;39;29","communication like, you know,","1"
"01;06;39;29","01;06;40;20","you tell your cat,","1"
"01;06;40;20","01;06;41;04","come here","1"
"01;06;41;04","01;06;43;24","and the cat comes or dog or whatever.","1"
"01;06;44;00","01;06;45;27","So I think that that the ability","1"
"01;06;45;27","01;06;48;05","to model systems","1"
"01;06;48;16","01;06;52;24","like our systems is very important.","1"
"01;06;52;24","01;06;53;26","Like if,","1"
"01;06;53;26","01;06;55;04","if the transmission view","1"
"01;06;55;04","01;06;57;04","is not capable of representing","1"
"01;06;57;04","01;06;58;24","all of the situations","1"
"01;06;58;24","01;06;59;17","from cell","1"
"01;06;59;17","01;07;01;02","to cell communication","1"
"01;07;01;02","01;07;03;17","to human to dog communication, and,","1"
"01;07;03;24","01;07;05;25","and all along the line,","1"
"01;07;06;21","01;07;11;01","I think that maybe it's in the way","1"
"01;07;11;01","01;07;11;17","that the","1"
"01;07;11;17","01;07;12;23","ACP inactive in France","1"
"01;07;12;23","01;07;15;24","is still free and slick doesn't have.","1"
"01;07;16;01","01;07;16;26","But I mean","1"
"01;07;16;26","01;07;17;27","it's across","1"
"01;07;17;27","01;07;20;02","any hierarchical temporal","1"
"01;07;20;02","01;07;21;28","cognitive scale.","1"
"01;07;21;28","01;07;23;08","I think that that the way","1"
"01;07;23;08","01;07;24;15","that we view communication","1"
"01;07;24;15","01;07;32;27","also needs to be broadly applicable.","1"
"01;07;32;27","01;07;33;16","Yes, really.","1"
"01;07;34;16","01;07;36;22","So yeah, that's that's the aim.","1"
"01;07;37;14","01;07;39;19","But clearly","1"
"01;07;39;19","01;07;42;17","some people will say that","1"
"01;07;42;17","01;07;44;26","sophisticated linguistic communication","1"
"01;07;44;26","01;07;48;10","can thus be accounted for in terms of","1"
"01;07;49;14","01;07;49;26","in terms","1"
"01;07;49;26","01;07;50;12","of the","1"
"01;07;50;12","01;07;52;16","ecological communication, because,","1"
"01;07;53;10","01;07;54;12","as Daniel said,","1"
"01;07;54;12","01;07;56;17","the symbolic communication","1"
"01;07;56;17","01;07;58;01","characteristic of language","1"
"01;07;58;01","01;08;00;09","seems to be too removed","1"
"01;08;00;09","01;08;02;08","from the kind of basic interaction","1"
"01;08;02;08","01;08;04;02","described by the ecological approach.","1"
"01;08;04;02","01;08;07;02","So there's this like","1"
"01;08;07;02","01;08;08;27","there's a lot of work to be done","1"
"01;08;08;27","01;08;11;20","still to to really explain these","1"
"01;08;11;20","01;08;13;16","the high level","1"
"01;08;13;16","01;08;14;18","linguistic interactions","1"
"01;08;14;18","01;08;15;19","that we have in our","1"
"01;08;15;19","01;08;18;07","in terms of the, of the ecological","1"
"01;08;18;07","01;08;19;28","in active communication.","1"
"01;08;19;28","01;08;22;05","But yeah, there's another example of,","1"
"01;08;22;29","01;08;25;00","of communication,","1"
"01;08;25;10","01;08;25;21","as you","1"
"01;08;25;21","01;08;28;10","said, we can I come to me before a","1"
"01;08;29;15","01;08;31;14","communicative interaction between cells","1"
"01;08;31;14","01;08;32;21","but there's also","1"
"01;08;32;21","01;08;33;20","there's been the work","1"
"01;08;33;20","01;08;36;10","on communication between between plants","1"
"01;08;36;20","01;08;38;08","and how plants","1"
"01;08;38;08","01;08;39;29","perceive their their environment","1"
"01;08;39;29","01;08;41;23","in terms of affordances.","1"
"01;08;41;23","01;08;43;00","And there's been work on that.","1"
"01;08;43;00","01;08;43;20","And so","1"
"01;08;43;20","01;08;44;16","I think that","1"
"01;08;44;16","01;08;45;25","there's it's just to say","1"
"01;08;45;25","01;08;47;19","that there's a it's another","1"
"01;08;47;19","01;08;49;24","and another way in which we can develop","1"
"01;08;49;24","01;08;51;17","the ecological approach.","1"
"01;08;51;17","01;08;53;12","And it seems that","1"
"01;08;54;12","01;08;56;16","that if we yeah.","1"
"01;08;56;16","01;08;59;10","If any, any,","1"
"01;08;59;10","01;09;01;17","any organisms, that organism","1"
"01;09;01;17","01;09;02;17","that behaves in","1"
"01;09;02;17","01;09;03;12","the organism","1"
"01;09;03;12","01;09;04;08","will have a field","1"
"01;09;04;08","01;09;06;26","of that far dense and it seems that if","1"
"01;09;08;01","01;09;11;19","it wants to act on other organisms","1"
"01;09;11;19","01;09;12;16","in its environment,","1"
"01;09;12;16","01;09;13;29","it will act","1"
"01;09;13;29","01;09;16;24","in affecting its field about audience.","1"
"01;09;16;24","01;09;19;12","And it looks like","1"
"01;09;19;12","01;09;20;14","the kind of communication","1"
"01;09;20;14","01;09;21;07","that is at play","1"
"01;09;21;07","01;09;22;28","between trees, for instance,","1"
"01;09;22;28","01;09;25;28","which alerts each other about,","1"
"01;09;26;06","01;09;26;19","for instance,","1"
"01;09;26;19","01;09;29;12","the threats in the, in the forest","1"
"01;09;29;12","01;09;33;16","or sources of, of useful resources","1"
"01;09;33;16","01;09;34;28","in the, in the drone.","1"
"01;09;34;28","01;09;37;03","So these kinds of modifications of","1"
"01;09;38;25","01;09;41;25","of of of the yeah,","1"
"01;09;42;26","01;09;44;29","I don't know exactly the mechanism","1"
"01;09;45;04","01;09;48;11","by which these the these these","1"
"01;09;48;26","01;09;50;15","these communication take place,","1"
"01;09;50;15","01;09;52;02","but we can also see them","1"
"01;09;52;02","01;09;53;08","as modifications","1"
"01;09;53;08","01;09;54;28","of the field of affordances, of trees.","1"
"01;09;54;28","01;09;56;13","So I think that that was","1"
"01;09;56;13","01;09;58;14","when I saw that I was really","1"
"01;09;58;14","01;09;59;15","I thought it was really cool","1"
"01;09;59;15","01;10;00;13","that the trees","1"
"01;10;00;13","01;10;02;23","behaved at a really, really slower","1"
"01;10;02;27","01;10;04;25","timescale, obviously, but like behavior","1"
"01;10;04;25","01;10;08;08","when they go in the sand, like their","1"
"01;10;08;08","01;10;09;29","their roots in certain directions","1"
"01;10;09;29","01;10;11;03","and things like that,","1"
"01;10;11;03","01;10;12;28","we can see it as them","1"
"01;10;12;28","01;10;15;12","exploring their environment, them","1"
"01;10;15;12","01;10;17;14","reacting to a field of avoidance that","1"
"01;10;18;11","01;10;18;23","that they.","1"
"01;10;18;23","01;10;19;18","So obviously that","1"
"01;10;19;18","01;10;21;05","that's also","1"
"01;10;21;05","01;10;22;27","controversial because there's","1"
"01;10;22;27","01;10;23;22","all this debate","1"
"01;10;23;22","01;10;26;22","about the cognitive states of of plants","1"
"01;10;26;22","01;10;29;28","and do they have a consciousness","1"
"01;10;29;28","01;10;30;18","or a left thing.","1"
"01;10;30;18","01;10;32;06","But I think that we can see that","1"
"01;10;32;06","01;10;33;03","they probably have","1"
"01;10;33;03","01;10;35;12","something like a field of us audience","1"
"01;10;35;12","01;10;36;17","and it seems that they can","1"
"01;10;37;19","01;10;39;29","communicate with each other","1"
"01;10;39;29","01;10;41;08","via these modifications","1"
"01;10;41;08","01;10;42;06","of their field of avoidance","1"
"01;10;42;06","01;10;43;04","without us","1"
"01;10;43;04","01;10;43;25","having to say","1"
"01;10;43;25","01;10;45;19","that they are transmitting content,","1"
"01;10;45;19","01;10;47;12","which would be really weird","1"
"01;10;47;12","01;10;51;28","from the standpoint of a plant.","1"
"01;10;51;28","01;10;53;09","Thank you. Blue.","1"
"01;10;53;29","01;10;56;15","So just like if you haven't","1"
"01;10;56;15","01;10;58;28","seen the plant robot created by the MIT","1"
"01;10;59;08","01;11;00;10","Media Lab, like,","1"
"01;11;00;10","01;11;01;12","check it out","1"
"01;11;01;12","01;11;02;11","because the plant, like,","1"
"01;11;02;11","01;11;03;04","they connected it","1"
"01;11;03;04","01;11;05;03","to a set of wheels and a motor","1"
"01;11;05;03","01;11;07;01","and literally will wheel itself","1"
"01;11;07;01","01;11;09;00","back and forth from window to window,","1"
"01;11;09;00","01;11;10;13","like searching for sunlight.","1"
"01;11;10;13","01;11;11;07","So So, I mean,","1"
"01;11;11;07","01;11;12;00","when you modify","1"
"01;11;12;00","01;11;13;03","the field of affordances","1"
"01;11;13;03","01;11;13;24","of a plant,","1"
"01;11;13;24","01;11;14;07","it will","1"
"01;11;14;07","01;11;15;21","it will take advantage of","1"
"01;11;15;21","01;11;17;04","this affordances","1"
"01;11;17;04","01;11;20;02","for movement or any other kind of thing.","1"
"01;11;20;02","01;11;22;27","And as to the complexity of","1"
"01;11;23;26","01;11;26;17","like linguistic communication, okay.","1"
"01;11;26;25","01;11;29;11","But like also like the complexity","1"
"01;11;29;11","01;11;32;04","of cellular communication, especially in","1"
"01;11;32;11","01;11;34;00","like developmental biology","1"
"01;11;34;00","01;11;35;13","and all of the growth factors,","1"
"01;11;35;13","01;11;36;09","signaling cues.","1"
"01;11;36;09","01;11;38;13","And I mean it's highly complex","1"
"01;11;38;13","01;11;39;06","and like the re","1"
"01;11;39;06","01;11;40;22","combinatorial aspect","1"
"01;11;40;22","01;11;42;13","is also incredibly crazy.","1"
"01;11;42;13","01;11;44;03","Like I think","1"
"01;11;44;03","01;11;45;26","it would take a lot to convince me","1"
"01;11;45;26","01;11;47;09","that linguistic communication","1"
"01;11;47;09","01;11;50;06","is more sophisticated or more advanced","1"
"01;11;50;15","01;11;52;16","than biological communication","1"
"01;11;52;16","01;11;54;08","in a developing organism.","1"
"01;11;54;08","01;11;57;03","I'm not sold on that.","1"
"01;11;57;29","01;11;58;15","Thanks, Steve.","1"
"01;12;00;12","01;12;01;07","We're making it.","1"
"01;12;01;07","01;12;01;16","And you","1"
"01;12;01;16","01;12;02;23","help me understand a little bit","1"
"01;12;02;23","01;12;04;19","more about the","1"
"01;12;05;11","01;12;09;08","the influence piece in the joint action.","1"
"01;12;09;08","01;12;11;16","If if I'm in Madrid,","1"
"01;12;12;27","01;12;13;29","a lot of people","1"
"01;12;13;29","01;12;15;24","who are trying to get my attention,","1"
"01;12;15;24","01;12;17;24","I'm not very I'm not","1"
"01;12;18;03","01;12;19;17","I don't speak Spanish very well,","1"
"01;12;19;17","01;12;21;09","just barely get by.","1"
"01;12;21;09","01;12;22;21","And so a lot of times","1"
"01;12;22;21","01;12;25;27","things are spoken to me and there is a","1"
"01;12;26;00","01;12;27;03","there seems to be a break","1"
"01;12;27;03","01;12;29;17","in terms of the amount of sensing I get.","1"
"01;12;30;03","01;12;32;26","And so that joint action could you maybe","1"
"01;12;32;26","01;12;33;26","especially in the","1"
"01;12;33;26","01;12;36;06","in the light of that earlier","1"
"01;12;36;14","01;12;39;06","part where you talked about young kids,","1"
"01;12;39;06","01;12;40;01","they think","1"
"01;12;40;05","01;12;40;21","it appears","1"
"01;12;40;21","01;12;42;19","they're talking to themselves,","1"
"01;12;42;19","01;12;44;20","but they're talking to the world","1"
"01;12;44;20","01;12;45;05","and maybe","1"
"01;12;45;05","01;12;47;06","they're not influencing the world,","1"
"01;12;47;07","01;12;48;20","but they would like to.","1"
"01;12;48;20","01;12;50;07","Could you maybe talk about that","1"
"01;12;50;07","01;12;51;08","sort of sensing side","1"
"01;12;51;08","01;12;52;11","of that joint action?","1"
"01;12;53;18","01;12;53;24","Yeah.","1"
"01;12;53;24","01;12;55;22","So I think that what","1"
"01;12;55;22","01;12;58;10","kids that alone are doing they're nuts.","1"
"01;12;59;00","01;13;00;29","They learn to talk by talking","1"
"01;13;00;29","01;13;01;16","to each other","1"
"01;13;01;16","01;13;03;07","and affecting other persons.","1"
"01;13;03;07","01;13;04;01","But when they learn","1"
"01;13;04;01","01;13;05;20","to talk to each other, they're doing","1"
"01;13;05;20","01;13;07;29","they're they're influencing themselves.","1"
"01;13;07;29","01;13;08;14","I think that","1"
"01;13;08;14","01;13;10;10","that's the part about self cueing.","1"
"01;13;10;10","01;13;11;27","So what they're doing, they're,","1"
"01;13;11;27","01;13;13;05","they're modifying their own","1"
"01;13;13;05","01;13;14;07","field of affordances","1"
"01;13;14;07","01;13;16;09","with their, with their","1"
"01;13;16;14","01;13;17;21","this inner speech","1"
"01;13;17;21","01;13;19;03","and that's how they the","1"
"01;13;19;03","01;13;20;15","they they don't to self cue","1"
"01;13;20;15","01;13;22;06","and self-regulate themselves","1"
"01;13;22;06","01;13;24;13","by bringing some","1"
"01;13;24;13","01;13;27;01","some images in mind or things like that.","1"
"01;13;27;01","01;13;28;10","So that's the","1"
"01;13;28;10","01;13;30;13","I think that's what happens when the","1"
"01;13;30;13","01;13;33;02","when the child","1"
"01;13;33;02","01;13;35;09","learns to do to speak alone.","1"
"01;13;35;23","01;13;37;04","And there's obviously","1"
"01;13;37;04","01;13;39;13","a lot more to say about that","1"
"01;13;40;02","01;13;40;27","when there's.","1"
"01;13;40;27","01;13;41;25","So the question","1"
"01;13;41;25","01;13;45;18","of of the of different languages","1"
"01;13;45;18","01;13;47;18","when you're in another country","1"
"01;13;47;18","01;13;51;05","and you don't so you're spoken to","1"
"01;13;51;14","01;13;54;25","and you're not understanding correctly.","1"
"01;13;54;25","01;13;55;08","But you","1"
"01;13;55;08","01;13;56;16","you pick up some","1"
"01;13;56;16","01;13;58;17","some parts of what's said.","1"
"01;13;58;24","01;14;01;05","So I think that, um,","1"
"01;14;02;10","01;14;03;10","I think that","1"
"01;14;03;10","01;14;05;11","the, the learning of a language","1"
"01;14;05;19","01;14;07;13","is, often,","1"
"01;14;07;16","01;14;12;08","is often understood as the, the, the,","1"
"01;14;12;08","01;14;15;26","as the, as the learning a code.","1"
"01;14;16;04","01;14;16;20","So learning","1"
"01;14;16;20","01;14;19;23","a set of associations between","1"
"01;14;19;23","01;14;20;19","between","1"
"01;14;21;20","01;14;24;05","meanings and between forms","1"
"01;14;24;28","01;14;27;23","that can be either written or spoken.","1"
"01;14;28;02","01;14;29;24","But I think that in the","1"
"01;14;29;24","01;14;31;19","the approach that we're","1"
"01;14;31;19","01;14;33;17","we had been seeing here,","1"
"01;14;33;17","01;14;34;00","learning","1"
"01;14;34;00","01;14;35;10","the language is really more like","1"
"01;14;35;10","01;14;36;29","learning, learning a skill.","1"
"01;14;36;29","01;14;38;10","So you learn you're learning to","1"
"01;14;38;10","01;14;39;05","to speak","1"
"01;14;39;05","01;14;39;21","and learning","1"
"01;14;39;21","01;14;40;20","to understand","1"
"01;14;40;20","01;14;41;27","and interact correctly","1"
"01;14;41;27","01;14;43;04","in a given language","1"
"01;14;43;04","01;14;44;24","as you're learning to do","1"
"01;14;44;24","01;14;45;23","anything else,","1"
"01;14;45;23","01;14;47;20","you're learning to play a game,","1"
"01;14;47;20","01;14;49;18","you're learning to play hockey.","1"
"01;14;49;18","01;14;52;19","So our play soccer or whatever is the","1"
"01;14;52;19","01;14;54;02","the same kind of learning","1"
"01;14;54;02","01;14;55;18","and you're learning to interact","1"
"01;14;55;18","01;14;57;18","in that kind of game.","1"
"01;14;57;18","01;15;00;12","And probably there's a similarity","1"
"01;15;00;12","01;15;02;05","between various languages","1"
"01;15;02;05","01;15;04;24","and the because it's","1"
"01;15;05;09","01;15;07;14","there's, there's a similarity","1"
"01;15;07;14","01;15;08;13","and there's","1"
"01;15;09;15","01;15;11;19","like like very","1"
"01;15;11;19","01;15;12;05","I would","1"
"01;15;12;05","01;15;13;22","I could talk about Gideon Stein there","1"
"01;15;13;22","01;15;14;20","once, once again.","1"
"01;15;14;20","01;15;15;08","But like","1"
"01;15;15;08","01;15;17;24","there's this the various languages","1"
"01;15;18;23","01;15;20;04","resemble each other","1"
"01;15;20;04","01;15;21;08","because they have this","1"
"01;15;21;08","01;15;23;05","this family resemblance.","1"
"01;15;23;05","01;15;24;05","So because you have","1"
"01;15;24;05","01;15;25;08","this familiarity","1"
"01;15;25;08","01;15;27;11","with speaking in a language,","1"
"01;15;27;11","01;15;29;00","even when you're","1"
"01;15;29;00","01;15;29;28","in another place","1"
"01;15;29;28","01;15;31;13","where don't understand the language,","1"
"01;15;31;13","01;15;32;20","you have a basic grasp","1"
"01;15;32;20","01;15;34;17","of some of the structures of the game","1"
"01;15;34;17","01;15;35;17","that is being played.","1"
"01;15;35;17","01;15;38;14","And so from that context, you can get","1"
"01;15;39;16","01;15;41;01","understand some of the things that are","1"
"01;15;41;01","01;15;42;09","said, understand, understand","1"
"01;15;42;09","01;15;43;15","some of the things that are","1"
"01;15;43;15","01;15;45;05","expected of you","1"
"01;15;45;05","01;15;46;17","because you have this grasp","1"
"01;15;46;17","01;15;48;23","of what kind of game is played.","1"
"01;15;48;23","01;15;50;06","When we speak our language.","1"
"01;15;50;06","01;15;52;19","And so even if you're in in them","1"
"01;15;53;06","01;15;54;11","in another country,","1"
"01;15;54;11","01;15;55;24","when you don't speak the language","1"
"01;15;55;24","01;15;57;19","from the context","1"
"01;15;57;19","01;15;59;04","in which you find yourself,","1"
"01;15;59;04","01;16;00;02","you may be able","1"
"01;16;00;02","01;16;01;29","put some things together.","1"
"01;16;01;29","01;16;04;00","Obviously, if you're like","1"
"01;16;04;00","01;16;05;07","just in a place","1"
"01;16;05;07","01;16;06;19","with absolutely no context,","1"
"01;16;06;19","01;16;09;22","you're in a white room completely empty","1"
"01;16;09;22","01;16;10;29","and somebody is talking to you.","1"
"01;16;10;29","01;16;11;20","You have no context.","1"
"01;16;11;20","01;16;13;12","Probably you won't understand anything.","1"
"01;16;13;12","01;16;15;08","But if you're in that context","1"
"01;16;15;08","01;16;16;28","where you can understand","1"
"01;16;16;28","01;16;19;09","that in some games of of","1"
"01;16;19;14","01;16;19;29","there are some,","1"
"01;16;19;29","01;16;23;01","some goals that are that are in place","1"
"01;16;23;01","01;16;24;04","and some people around","1"
"01;16;24;04","01;16;26;05","you are trying to achieve some goal.","1"
"01;16;26;05","01;16;28;01","You can apply your understanding","1"
"01;16;28;01","01;16;28;17","of the game","1"
"01;16;28;17","01;16;30;05","that you play your own language","1"
"01;16;30;05","01;16;31;04","through this new language.","1"
"01;16;31;04","01;16;33;05","And so you can get some things","1"
"01;16;33;23","01;16;35;04","you can understand some things about","1"
"01;16;35;04","01;16;36;01","what's what's","1"
"01;16;36;01","01;16;37;01","what you have to do","1"
"01;16;37;01","01;16;38;22","and how you should behave","1"
"01;16;38;22","01;16;40;03","and how you can respond.","1"
"01;16;40;03","01;16;42;12","But I think that that's a better way","1"
"01;16;42;12","01;16;43;08","of understanding","1"
"01;16;43;08","01;16;44;22","the kind of limited","1"
"01;16;44;22","01;16;46;16","understanding that you have","1"
"01;16;46;16","01;16;48;26","in these kind of interactions","1"
"01;16;48;27","01;16;50;04","rather than in","1"
"01;16;50;04","01;16;52;13","you having a code of your language.","1"
"01;16;52;13","01;16;53;28","And then you try to apply this code","1"
"01;16;53;28","01;16;56;10","in this you I think that that then","1"
"01;16;56;10","01;16;58;14","the idea of learning a skill, learning","1"
"01;16;58;14","01;17;01;02","how to play a game is a better analogy","1"
"01;17;01;15","01;17;02;13","to understanding","1"
"01;17;02;13","01;17;04;03","how you come to learn a language","1"
"01;17;04;03","01;17;05;26","and how you come to apply this,","1"
"01;17;05;26","01;17;07;04","this knowledge","1"
"01;17;07;04","01;17;09;04","in other contexts where the language","1"
"01;17;09;20","01;17;11;12","that is spoken is not the same that you","1"
"01;17;11;12","01;17;12;19","that you're mastering.","1"
"01;17;12;19","01;17;13;27","Does that kind of confirm that","1"
"01;17;13;27","01;17;15;22","it couldn't be content first,","1"
"01;17;17;07","01;17;18;01","that it would have to","1"
"01;17;18;01","01;17;22;26","be context bound?","1"
"01;17;22;26","01;17;24;27","Yeah, in my view,","1"
"01;17;24;27","01;17;29;18","the context is a central element in","1"
"01;17;30;07","01;17;33;15","in in any communicative interaction","1"
"01;17;33;15","01;17;34;25","and in any cooperative","1"
"01;17;34;25","01;17;35;27","communicative interaction.","1"
"01;17;35;27","01;17;38;06","I think it's the it in the context","1"
"01;17;38;14","01;17;38;28","what the what","1"
"01;17;38;28","01;17;41;06","I call the context in the paper appears","1"
"01;17;41;06","01;17;43;01","as a shared field of audience.","1"
"01;17;43;01","01;17;44;06","So that's","1"
"01;17;44;06","01;17;44;23","the audience","1"
"01;17;44;23","01;17;47;29","that are present in the, in the, in the,","1"
"01;17;48;02","01;17;50;08","the environmental context","1"
"01;17;50;08","01;17;51;13","in which you find yourself in","1"
"01;17;51;13","01;17;52;22","with the other person.","1"
"01;17;52;22","01;17;54;25","And that's that's","1"
"01;17;54;25","01;17;57;14","just an element that often exists.","1"
"01;17;57;14","01;17;59;04","The communicative interaction","1"
"01;17;59;04","01;18;00;09","is a great,","1"
"01;18;00;09","01;18;01;27","great source of constraint","1"
"01;18;01;27","01;18;04;07","on the communicative interaction.","1"
"01;18;04;15","01;18;04;28","So yeah,","1"
"01;18;04;28","01;18;05;07","when you,","1"
"01;18;05;07","01;18;07;23","when you come to speak with somebody,","1"
"01;18;07;26","01;18;09;05","you're almost","1"
"01;18;09;05","01;18;13;05","never like in a absolutely free place.","1"
"01;18;13;05","01;18;13;27","You're always","1"
"01;18;13;27","01;18;15;23","in a restaurant in there,","1"
"01;18;15;23","01;18;18;03","in, I don't know, in the bus, in the","1"
"01;18;18;04","01;18;20;09","in the in the grocery store.","1"
"01;18;20;13","01;18;21;17","You're somewhere","1"
"01;18;21;17","01;18;23;23","there's this basic set of affordances","1"
"01;18;23;23","01;18;25;07","that are shared that you understand","1"
"01;18;25;07","01;18;26;12","that you can do this,","1"
"01;18;26;12","01;18;27;10","you cannot do that.","1"
"01;18;27;10","01;18;29;21","And this this set of constraints","1"
"01;18;29;21","01;18;32;00","offered by this charge feel about","1"
"01;18;32;00","01;18;32;26","really drives","1"
"01;18;32;26","01;18;33;20","and constrains","1"
"01;18;33;20","01;18;35;25","how the communicative interaction","1"
"01;18;36;00","01;18;37;00","will unfold.","1"
"01;18;37;00","01;18;37;11","So","1"
"01;18;37;22","01;18;38;20","I think that even","1"
"01;18;38;20","01;18;40;08","if you're in another country,","1"
"01;18;40;08","01;18;41;11","a friend,","1"
"01;18;41;11","01;18;43;04","the context will be hard to pick up.","1"
"01;18;43;04","01;18;44;07","But sometimes","1"
"01;18;44;07","01;18;45;24","there will be shared context","1"
"01;18;45;24","01;18;48;04","that you can get a grasp on","1"
"01;18;48;04","01;18;49;00","and that you can","1"
"01;18;50;01","01;18;50;17","that can.","1"
"01;18;50;17","01;18;53;17","So that can lead to a","1"
"01;18;56;01","01;18;57;23","I'm sorry, I'm losing my words","1"
"01;18;57;23","01;19;00;10","that can lead to an interaction that is","1"
"01;19;00;29","01;19;04;18","that is optimal.","1"
"01;19;04;18","01;19;05;16","I brought it","1"
"01;19;05;16","01;19;08;15","in the physical Rosetta Stone","1"
"01;19;09;08","01;19;11;25","as a special case of of low","1"
"01;19;11;25","01;19;14;10","context asynchronous communication.","1"
"01;19;15;05","01;19;16;06","One can imagine","1"
"01;19;16;06","01;19;17;29","there would be a million","1"
"01;19;17;29","01;19;19;19","different contexts","1"
"01;19;19;19","01;19;23;00","by which the analysis of the stone","1"
"01;19;23;00","01;19;23;12","could have","1"
"01;19;23;12","01;19;26;06","accelerated, such as a person reading","1"
"01;19;26;10","01;19;27;14","any of them,","1"
"01;19;27;14","01;19;30;20","the rules or descriptions being enacted,","1"
"01;19;30;29","01;19;32;16","or a labeled image,","1"
"01;19;32;16","01;19;33;08","or any","1"
"01;19;33;08","01;19;34;15","number of contexts","1"
"01;19;34;15","01;19;36;28","that we would use to interpret","1"
"01;19;37;11","01;19;39;13","and act upon the texts that we read","1"
"01;19;40;02","01;19;41;17","in this setting","1"
"01;19;41;17","01;19;41;28","where","1"
"01;19;41;28","01;19;43;25","we were historically removed","1"
"01;19;43;25","01;19;45;22","from the creation.","1"
"01;19;45;22","01;19;47;01","Then there's still","1"
"01;19;47;01","01;19;48;24","was residual context,","1"
"01;19;48;24","01;19;50;26","and it turned out that that was enough","1"
"01;19;51;00","01;19;54;05","to interpret the symbolic","1"
"01;19;55;19","01;19;57;08","materials.","1"
"01;19;57;10","01;19;58;07","But this","1"
"01;19;58;07","01;20;02;02","is not like the base communication case","1"
"01;20;02;17","01;20;03;03","that we","1"
"01;20;03;03","01;20;05;10","then need to see all communication","1"

"01;20;09;25","01;20;12;07","as being like a Rosetta Stone,","1"
"01;20;12;07","01;20;13;27","like the definitions of words","1"

"01;20;23;13","01;20;24;06","that have to do","1"
"01;20;24;06","01;20;26;26","with the context of the setting and","1"
"01;20;28;09","01;20;30;18","asynchronous","1"

"01;20;32;28","01;20;35;12","especially symbolic asynchronous","1"
"01;20;36;05","01;20;38;16","modifications which are relatively new,","1"

"01;20;44;15","01;20;46;06","to several thousands of years,","1"
"01;20;46;06","01;20;47;24","depending on how we think about it.","1"
"01;20;47;24","01;20;50;06","Symbolic, asynchronous modification","1"
"01;20;51;05","01;20;54;25","is a low context communication,","1"
"01;20;55;28","01;20;59;05","whereas even the interpretations","1"
"01;20;59;05","01;21;01;28","of asynchronous symbolic communication","1"
"01;21;03;02","01;21;04;27","still uses and embodies","1"
"01;21;04;27","01;21;06;29","their context in the perception.","1"
"01;21;06;29","01;21;07;28","So we know that we have","1"
"01;21;07;28","01;21;09;17","stereophonic communication","1"
"01;21;09;17","01;21;12;00","just because stereophonic,","1"

"01;21;13;08","01;21;17;13","just a morse code symbol.","1"
"01;21;17;13","01;21;17;23","But","1"
"01;21;18;29","01;21;20;27","it is a","1"
"01;21;21;03","01;21;23;03","non-controversial here.","1"
"01;21;23;03","01;21;24;19","But interestingly,","1"
"01;21;24;19","01;21;26;17","it sounds like elsewhere","1"
"01;21;26;17","01;21;27;29","that we would want to think","1"
"01;21;27;29","01;21;30;07","about communication broadly","1"
"01;21;30;24","01;21;33;14","as being action oriented and embedded","1"

"01;21;53;13","01;21;54;01","Okay.","1"
"01;21;55;20","01;21;58;08","I think that too often they explain","1"
"01;21;58;08","01;21;59;26","the idea is that","1"
"01;21;59;26","01;22;01;05","the ideas that I'm trying","1"
"01;22;01;05","01;22;03;12","convey really better than me","1"
"01;22;04;08","01;22;04;22","then, you know,","1"
"01;22;04;22","01;22;07;04","I'm not really fluent in English though.","1"
"01;22;07;25","01;22;09;19","Thank you for explaining better than me","1"
"01;22;09;19","01;22;12;22","the idea that I'm trying to say","1"
"01;22;12;22","01;22;13;25","thank you.","1"
"01;22;14;00","01;22;14;22","I appreciate it.","1"
"01;22;14;22","01;22;17;11","And you wrote the paper.","1"
"01;22;17;11","01;22;21;02","And so it's unsurprising, it seems novel","1"
"01;22;21;14","01;22;23;14","and I couldn't say it in any other way.","1"
"01;22;24;21","01;22;25;05","Even when you","1"
"01;22;25;05","01;22;26;03","speak English,","1"
"01;22;26;03","01;22;28;25","Daniel can still like better than than","1"
"01;22;28;25","01;22;30;09","you mean it more effectively.","1"
"01;22;30;09","01;22;32;00","The idea is that you're trying to convey","1"
"01;22;32;00","01;22;32;26","even when English","1"
"01;22;32;26","01;22;34;09","is your first language.","1"
"01;22;34;29","01;22;35;22","Well.","1"
"01;22;35;23","01;22;38;07","Context is non-fungible.","1"
"01;22;38;07","01;22;41;07","So I don't think that there can be","1"
"01;22;42;18","01;22;45;11","a best or a final communication.","1"
"01;22;45;11","01;22;46;21","It's just like a best","1"
"01;22;46;21","01;22;47;23","or a final species","1"
"01;22;47;23","01;22;50;13","or state for an ecosystem to be in.","1"
"01;22;50;13","01;22;53;04","And I guess in the last","1"
"01;22;53;04","01;22;58;08","25 minutes or however,","1"
"01;22;58;08","01;22;59;27","now that our ecosystem","1"
"01;22;59;27","01;23;04;16","has been modified,","1"
"01;23;04;16","01;23;06;15","however it has been","1"
"01;23;06;15","01;23;07;21","in these conversations","1"
"01;23;07;21","01;23;09;15","and through reading and","1"
"01;23;09;15","01;23;11;27","opening up threads,","1"
"01;23;12;02","01;23;13;08","how will it","1"
"01;23;14;01","01;23;17;07","shape our field of affordances","1"
"01;23;17;07","01;23;19;08","and how will we","1"
"01;23;19;24","01;23;23;17","stream and play differently in.","1"
"01;23;23;17","01;23;26;18","So I'm curious from all three of you","1"
"01;23;27;25","01;23;31;02","as a strategy,","1"
"01;23;31;02","01;23;32;20","if you want to get past monologue,","1"
"01;23;32;20","01;23;33;11","what do you do?","1"
"01;23;33;11","01;23;36;28","How many times do you play play in play?","1"
"01;23;37;00","01;23;38;29","So as an example of like a","1"
"01;23;38;29","01;23;40;25","real pertinent one, right now","1"
"01;23;41;25","01;23;43;13","the way that the livestreams","1"
"01;23;43;13","01;23;44;07","have been set up,","1"
"01;23;44;07","01;23;46;24","I've always been sort of a pre brief,","1"
"01;23;47;22","01;23;50;24","an introduction with the authors or play","1"
"01;23;51;07","01;23;55;11","and then a play, a debrief used to this.","1"
"01;23;55;20","01;23;57;22","And so the communication is never left","1"
"01;23;57;22","01;24;01;16","as a, as a one off exercise.","1"
"01;24;01;16","01;24;02;23","I just read the paper.","1"
"01;24;02;23","01;24;03;23","There's a, there's,","1"
"01;24;03;23","01;24;07;00","there is affordances set up to interact","1"
"01;24;07;00","01;24;08;27","with information","1"
"01;24;08;27","01;24;11;27","to be able to receive it","1"
"01;24;11;28","01;24;13;28","at multiple different time points.","1"
"01;24;13;28","01;24;15;17","Because I think in the one room","1"
"01;24;15;17","01;24;16;21","you said we could look at it","1"
"01;24;16;21","01;24;18;12","as slices of time,","1"
"01;24;18;12","01;24;20;07","but that's probably not","1"
"01;24;20;07","01;24;22;21","accurate in terms of the dynamic","1"
"01;24;22;21","01;24;23;20","that's in place.","1"
"01;24;23;20","01;24;24;17","So","1"
"01;24;25;12","01;24;26;07","one of the things","1"
"01;24;26;07","01;24;26;21","the Active","1"
"01;24;26;21","01;24;30;05","Insurance Institute also does is has a","1"
"01;24;30;22","01;24;32;03","textbook group.","1"
"01;24;32;09","01;24;33;07","Now, I've not been","1"
"01;24;33;07","01;24;34;22","part of the text group, book group,","1"
"01;24;34;22","01;24;36;24","and I don't know whether they do it in","1"
"01;24;36;24","01;24;38;07","sets of three as well","1"
"01;24;38;07","01;24;40;18","to create that kind of triangulation","1"
"01;24;40;18","01;24;41;29","so that the interactions","1"
"01;24;41;29","01;24;44;26","of the communication doesn't become","1"
"01;24;46;11","01;24;49;02","monolithic or monastic","1"
"01;24;49;21","01;24;50;26","or here,","1"
"01;24;50;26","01;24;51;18","here's here","1"
"01;24;51;18","01;24;52;08","is the words","1"
"01;24;52;08","01;24;54;17","that have come down now off the mount.","1"
"01;24;54;17","01;24;56;16","Accept them and start","1"
"01;24;56;16","01;24;57;16","start carrying them out.","1"
"01;24;57;16","01;24;58;16","Even though you don't have","1"
"01;24;58;16","01;25;00;21","a context, right?","1"
"01;25;00;26","01;25;02;24","Chiseling them into the stone","1"
"01;25;02;24","01;25;04;29","doesn't increase their priority,","1"
"01;25;05;05","01;25;06;25","at least if you don't have the context.","1"
"01;25;06;25","01;25;09;02","So what I'm curious about from","1"
"01;25;09;02","01;25;10;09","the three of you is","1"
"01;25;10;09","01;25;11;21","if you want to get past","1"
"01;25;11;21","01;25;13;12","instructional ism in terms","1"
"01;25;13;12","01;25;15;12","or if you want to get past transmission,","1"
"01;25;15;25","01;25;18;25","is there a basic requirement","1"
"01;25;19;07","01;25;22;13","to have multiple reinterpretations","1"
"01;25;22;13","01;25;24;08","or at least the opportunity","1"
"01;25;24;08","01;25;25;11","to reinterpret,","1"
"01;25;25;11","01;25;26;10","like just","1"
"01;25;26;10","01;25;28;17","from a communication standpoint,","1"
"01;25;28;17","01;25;31;18","do we must we have reflection","1"
"01;25;35;03","01;25;36;01","and time for that.","1"
"01;25;36;01","01;25;37;28","We have to have time built in for that.","1"
"01;25;37;28","01;25;41;02","Or are we are we then bound to","1"
"01;25;41;03","01;25;42;23","a transmit state on","1"
"01;25;45;13","01;25;47;07","anybody can answer.","1"
"01;25;47;10","01;25;47;20","Yes.","1"
"01;25;47;20","01;25;50;21","Bloopers.","1"
"01;25;50;21","01;25;52;00","So it's not","1"
"01;25;52;00","01;25;55;15","like in the way that we have reflection","1"
"01;25;55;15","01;25;56;23","like we have a pre brief","1"
"01;25;56;23","01;25;58;10","and then to the actual brief","1"
"01;25;58;10","01;25;58;22","and then","1"
"01;25;58;22","01;25;59;07","and then","1"
"01;25;59;07","01;26;00;08","the reflection","1"
"01;26;00;08","01;26;02;13","time in the livestream series.","1"
"01;26;02;22","01;26;04;18","So, so not in that way","1"
"01;26;04;18","01;26;07;26","but but I do think that in this","1"
"01;26;08;03","01;26;10;12","in effective communication","1"
"01;26;10;21","01;26;12;28","is like reflection","1"
"01;26;12;28","01;26;15;12","as an essential component of that,","1"
"01;26;15;25","01;26;17;02","like communication","1"
"01;26;17;02","01;26;18;29","when you have a conversation,","1"
"01;26;18;29","01;26;21;11","it's shouldn't be about","1"
"01;26;21;11","01;26;23;22","just waiting for your turn to talk.","1"
"01;26;23;22","01;26;26;06","I mean, there should be some reflection","1"
"01;26;26;06","01;26;26;14","of what","1"
"01;26;26;14","01;26;28;10","the other person is saying","1"
"01;26;28;10","01;26;30;15","in what you're saying back to them.","1"
"01;26;30;15","01;26;31;09","It's like,","1"
"01;26;31;15","01;26;33;04","Hello, how are you doing today?","1"
"01;26;33;04","01;26;34;09","I want scrambled eggs.","1"
"01;26;34;09","01;26;36;18","Like if that was the conversation went,","1"
"01;26;36;27","01;26;39;11","it wouldn't be it wouldn't work, right?","1"
"01;26;39;20","01;26;40;09","So there","1"
"01;26;40;09","01;26;42;07","to be some element of reflecting back","1"
"01;26;42;07","01;26;44;13","what the other person is saying to you","1"
"01;26;44;13","01;26;46;11","in communication that's effective.","1"
"01;26;46;11","01;26;49;01","It's not just this like Tower of","1"
"01;26;49;18","01;26;54;00","disjointed blocks being built.","1"
"01;26;54;00","01;26;54;20","Yes. For me.","1"
"01;26;55;21","01;26;55;27","Yeah.","1"
"01;26;55;27","01;26;56;17","I think","1"
"01;26;56;22","01;26;57;21","I think that","1"
"01;26;57;24","01;26;59;26","what you said is is interesting,","1"
"01;27;00;23","01;27;02;08","a really important element","1"
"01;27;02;08","01;27;04;14","of cooperative communication","1"
"01;27;04;14","01;27;07;08","is that when you're talking to somebody,","1"
"01;27;07;08","01;27;08;16","when you're in the dialog,","1"
"01;27;08;16","01;27;09;00","you have","1"
"01;27;09;00","01;27;11;07","to concede a part of your autonomy.","1"
"01;27;11;16","01;27;12;29","You have to","1"
"01;27;12;29","01;27;14;24","accept to be regulated","1"
"01;27;14;24","01;27;15;25","by the other person.","1"
"01;27;15;25","01;27;17;23","And that's, I think,","1"
"01;27;17;23","01;27;19;29","where some people who like","1"
"01;27;20;01","01;27;21;07","to talk past each other","1"
"01;27;21;07","01;27;22;14","and don't listen to each other,","1"
"01;27;22;14","01;27;23;01","an interaction","1"
"01;27;23;01","01;27;24;09","that happens that really offends","1"
"01;27;24;09","01;27;25;25","some friends don't like.","1"
"01;27;25;25","01;27;27;22","It seems like when when they're waiting","1"
"01;27;27;22","01;27;28;22","they're just waiting.","1"
"01;27;28;22","01;27;29;12","When they're listening,","1"
"01;27;29;12","01;27;30;07","they're just waiting","1"
"01;27;30;07","01;27;31;28","to see what they want to say.","1"
"01;27;31;28","01;27;34;22","So these don't like don't respect that","1"
"01;27;34;22","01;27;37;04","kind of pragmatic principle","1"
"01;27;37;25","01;27;39;06","of like you have to","1"
"01;27;39;06","01;27;40;04","to pay attention to what","1"
"01;27;40;04","01;27;41;09","the other person is saying","1"
"01;27;41;09","01;27;43;18","and to have a proper to have a correct","1"
"01;27;44;02","01;27;45;06","communicative interaction","1"
"01;27;45;06","01;27;49;12","us to concede the like,","1"
"01;27;49;12","01;27;50;19","you have to accept","1"
"01;27;50;19","01;27;51;29","that your field of performance","1"
"01;27;51;29","01;27;52;24","is regulated","1"
"01;27;52;24","01;27;54;08","by the person who's sucking through you.","1"
"01;27;54;08","01;27;56;09","You have to let yourself be","1"
"01;27;57;19","01;27;59;18","influenced, be constrained by either","1"
"01;27;59;18","01;28;01;08","by the person that was talking to you","1"
"01;28;01;08","01;28;02;07","just because you","1"
"01;28;02;07","01;28;03;17","you have to listen to it","1"
"01;28;03;17","01;28;05;01","and you have to","1"
"01;28;05;01","01;28;07;00","refrain from like turning away","1"
"01;28;07;00","01;28;08;20","and go go do something else.","1"
"01;28;08;20","01;28;11;21","So you have to like it's really","1"
"01;28;11;21","01;28;13;15","just accepting,","1"
"01;28;13;15","01;28;15;00","conceding a part of your autonomy.","1"
"01;28;15;00","01;28;18;05","And that's another idea from a De Paolo","1"
"01;28;18;05","01;28;20;18","as an active approach of language","1"
"01;28;21;07","01;28;21;23","where","1"
"01;28;22;00","01;28;24;00","there's been communicative interaction","1"
"01;28;24;00","01;28;26;04","in the, in any cooperative interaction.","1"
"01;28;26;04","01;28;26;13","But in","1"
"01;28;26;13","01;28;28;16","community of interaction particular,","1"
"01;28;28;16","01;28;30;00","you have to","1"
"01;28;30;00","01;28;31;03","write inhibit","1"
"01;28;31;03","01;28;32;29","a part of your field about for a dance","1"
"01;28;32;29","01;28;34;13","to participate","1"
"01;28;34;13","01;28;36;21","in this interaction and listen.","1"
"01;28;36;21","01;28;38;23","Because suppose that","1"
"01;28;38;23","01;28;40;21","what I'm saying is really boring to you","1"
"01;28;40;21","01;28;41;25","and you just want to go","1"
"01;28;41;25","01;28;42;28","eat your piece of cake","1"
"01;28;42;28","01;28;44;04","in the in the fridge","1"
"01;28;44;04","01;28;46;15","like us do in order to participate,","1"
"01;28;46;15","01;28;47;20","to maintain","1"
"01;28;47;20","01;28;49;05","the interaction,","1"
"01;28;49;05","01;28;50;20","you have to inhibit this.","1"
"01;28;50;20","01;28;52;17","There's that part to the solicitation","1"
"01;28;52;17","01;28;53;23","and to,","1"
"01;28;53;25","01;28;54;06","to, to","1"
"01;28;54;06","01;28;55;23","let me regulate your","1"

"01;28;57;11","01;28;58;27","And so there's this part of","1"
"01;28;58;27","01;29;00;09","like I concede that","1"
"01;29;00;09","01;29;01;15","I concede something","1"

"01;29;03;08","01;29;05;09","And when there is no no more interest","1"
"01;29;05;09","01;29;09;02","or I'm not able to to I don't want to","1"
"01;29;09;02","01;29;10;00","to be regulated.","1"
"01;29;10;00","01;29;11;13","And there's another solicitation","1"
"01;29;11;13","01;29;12;10","outside the interaction","1"
"01;29;12;10","01;29;14;15","that's more interesting to me.","1"
"01;29;14;15","01;29;16;24","But then I will leave the interaction.","1"
"01;29;16;24","01;29;19;01","But to maintain the interaction,","1"
"01;29;19;01","01;29;21;23","you have to have a and","1"
"01;29;22;28","01;29;24;18","a capacity of inhibition that","1"
"01;29;24;18","01;29;25;19","exit of executive","1"

"01;29;35;02","01;29;37;07","just going to think about something else","1"

"01;29;49;27","01;29;50;18","So","1"
"01;29;52;00","01;29;54;02","back to Dean's","1"
"01;29;54;02","01;29;57;19","point about multiple art and multiplayer","1"
"01;29;59;01","01;30;01;22","communication and engagements","1"
"01;30;01;22","01;30;05;22","when we only have one communication,","1"
"01;30;05;22","01;30;08;10","then it can feel like a transmission","1"
"01;30;08;21","01;30;09;26","like the Rosetta Stone","1"
"01;30;09;26","01;30;11;05","transmitted from the past.","1"
"01;30;11;05","01;30;14;05","We don't get a dot two or a dot one","1"

"01;30;25;05","01;30;27;16","Co-operative communication","1"
"01;30;27;16","01;30;29;16","as something unfolding,","1"
"01;30;30;03","01;30;32;24","bumping into each other twice","1"
"01;30;32;24","01;30;35;02","says something about those particles","1"
"01;30;35;11","01;30;38;01","that bumping together just once","1"
"01;30;39;00","01;30;39;22","dozens.","1"
"01;30;39;22","01;30;41;00","It's almost like","1"
"01;30;41;00","01;30;43;19","when I say once there's an accident","1"
"01;30;43;19","01;30;45;12","twice as a coincidence","1"
"01;30;45;12","01;30;47;25","three times is a party or","1"
"01;30;49;04","01;30;50;16","something like that.","1"
"01;30;50;16","01;30;52;29","So especially with three,","1"
"01;30;53;28","01;30;56;03","because one, two, three,","1"
"01;30;56;03","01;31;00;02","there may be a enough","1"
"01;31;00;02","01;31;01;17","of a recurrent engagements","1"
"01;31;01;17","01;31;03;10","and interweaving","1"
"01;31;03;10","01;31;05;29","to support reflection and development","1"
"01;31;06;13","01;31;07;19","to de-emphasize","1"
"01;31;07;19","01;31;10;05","any single of those events,","1"
"01;31;11;01","01;31;13;12","because none of them are even half","1"
"01;31;13;22","01;31;15;28","of the total series of three.","1"
"01;31;16;16","01;31;18;04","So none of them can even be","1"
"01;31;18;04","01;31;20;24","said to be a plurality or a majority","1"
"01;31;21;08","01;31;24;00","if the .01 and two were to vote","1"
"01;31;24;24","01;31;25;27","to vote one of them out","1"
"01;31;25;27","01;31;28;23","or something like that.","1"
"01;31;28;23","01;31;30;29","And I think it does point towards","1"
"01;31;31;22","01;31;34;11","the reality of our continued interaction","1"
"01;31;34;11","01;31;36;11","with materials","1"
"01;31;36;11","01;31;40;00","and then towards structures","1"
"01;31;40;00","01;31;43;17","that allow us to engage naturally.","1"
"01;31;44;10","01;31;45;03","Remy","1"
"01;31;49;01","01;31;50;25","I think that what","1"
"01;31;52;05","01;31;54;03","communicating","1"
"01;31;54;06","01;31;56;07","in there repetitively","1"
"01;31;56;19","01;31;57;14","the same people,","1"
"01;31;57;14","01;31;59;16","what it achieves, it's,","1"
"01;31;59;16","01;32;00;27","it obviously it","1"
"01;32;00;27","01;32;02;04","shapes the generative","1"
"01;32;02;04","01;32;04;21","model, it aligns them in some ways.","1"
"01;32;04;21","01;32;07;27","So we come to share expectations","1"
"01;32;07;27","01;32;10;19","and share fields of affordances.","1"
"01;32;11;16","01;32;13;21","So it clearly eases","1"
"01;32;14;07","01;32;15;19","communicative interaction","1"
"01;32;15;19","01;32;17;28","because we have to communicate as much","1"
"01;32;18;05","01;32;19;23","when there's this tradeoff","1"
"01;32;19;23","01;32;20;03","between","1"
"01;32;20;03","01;32;22;14","if you have a lot of shared context,","1"
"01;32;22;24","01;32;23;07","you don't","1"
"01;32;23;07","01;32;24;15","have you don't","1"
"01;32;24;15","01;32;25;25","have to communicate as much.","1"
"01;32;25;25","01;32;26;21","And if you don't have","1"
"01;32;26;21","01;32;27;20","a lot of social context,","1"
"01;32;27;20","01;32;28;14","you have to communicate","1"
"01;32;28;14","01;32;31;24","more to, to, to, to a","1"
"01;32;32;17","01;32;36;04","yeah, as a, a useful interaction","1"
"01;32;36;04","01;32;37;25","to have a productive interaction.","1"
"01;32;37;25","01;32;40;23","And so what I think we, we have done is","1"
"01;32;40;29","01;32;42;29","we have like aligned","1"
"01;32;42;29","01;32;44;27","our different models in ways","1"
"01;32;44;27","01;32;47;02","that helps us understand","1"
"01;32;47;02","01;32;48;18","each other better than","1"
"01;32;48;18","01;32;49;23","we did at the beginning.","1"
"01;32;51;09","01;32;52;06","For instance, we can","1"
"01;32;52;06","01;32;53;19","refer to things that.","1"
"01;32;53;19","01;32;55;02","We said in the past","1"
"01;32;55;02","01;32;55;28","we can say, Oh, well,","1"
"01;32;55;28","01;32;57;27","when you said that.","1"
"01;32;58;11","01;32;59;22","So I think that's relevant now.","1"
"01;32;59;22","01;33;02;18","And so we can make","1"
"01;33;02;18","01;33;04;26","can point to relations, to things","1"
"01;33;04;26","01;33;06;16","that that we said earlier.","1"
"01;33;06;16","01;33;09;11","So there's this","1"
"01;33;09;11","01;33;10;23","there's this continual","1"
"01;33;10;23","01;33;12;21","easing of communication.","1"
"01;33;12;21","01;33;13;26","And when you have repetitive,","1"
"01;33;13;26","01;33;16;05","communicative interaction with somebody,","1"
"01;33;16;05","01;33;18;15","that's I think that I think is","1"
"01;33;18;15","01;33;21;22","why we can come to believe that people","1"
"01;33;21;23","01;33;22;15","we are living with,","1"
"01;33;22;15","01;33;24;10","we can read each other's mind","1"
"01;33;24;10","01;33;25;12","with or without talking,","1"
"01;33;25;12","01;33;27;15","because there is so much shared context","1"
"01;33;27;15","01;33;29;09","that something can happen","1"
"01;33;29;09","01;33;31;07","and it can make us think some","1"
"01;33;31;07","01;33;33;01","something that is shared without us","1"
"01;33;33;01","01;33;34;13","even saying anything.","1"
"01;33;34;13","01;33;36;28","So there's this this context come to be","1"
"01;33;37;16","01;33;39;08","really complex and really,","1"
"01;33;40;10","01;33;41;20","really deep.","1"
"01;33;41;20","01;33;44;21","And so yeah, interacting repetitively","1"
"01;33;45;20","01;33;50;13","obviously is, is communication.","1"
"01;33;50;13","01;33;52;14","Okay, so we can","1"
"01;33;52;14","01;33;55;07","meet multiple times due preparation,","1"
"01;33;56;19","01;33;58;21","engagement and reflection","1"
"01;33;59;29","01;34;02;26","before, during and after a communication","1"
"01;34;03;16","01;34;05;21","and structure communication","1"
"01;34;05;21","01;34;07;06","so that there are multiple","1"
"01;34;07;06","01;34;09;19","such kind of peaks, troughs","1"
"01;34;10;22","01;34;14;17","we can talk about aligning or","1"
"01;34;15;17","01;34;16;15","synchronizing","1"
"01;34;16;15","01;34;18;06","in the general synchronous sense,","1"
"01;34;18;06","01;34;19;28","not making it identical,","1"
"01;34;19;28","01;34;20;17","but rather","1"
"01;34;20;17","01;34;22;27","coordinating our generative models","1"
"01;34;23;05","01;34;25;10","through perception and learning.","1"
"01;34;27;00","01;34;29;13","As you mentioned, helps us understand","1"
"01;34;29;13","01;34;31;08","each other better.","1"
"01;34;31;08","01;34;33;08","Like a goal of a communication","1"
"01;34;33;08","01;34;35;00","could be epistemic","1"
"01;34;35;00","01;34;37;15","let's get to know each other","1"
"01;34;37;15","01;34;40;13","and it could also have an element","1"
"01;34;40;13","01;34;42;10","of pragmatic value,","1"
"01;34;42;10","01;34;44;10","like let's take epistemic action","1"
"01;34;44;10","01;34;44;27","to find out","1"
"01;34;44;27","01;34;47;14","if a collaboration is relevant here.","1"
"01;34;47;14","01;34;48;06","And then","1"
"01;34;48;06","01;34;49;08","going to engage","1"
"01;34;49;08","01;34;52;02","in these pragmatic actions.","1"
"01;34;52;02","01;34;52;24","Remmy","1"
"01;34;54;09","01;34;57;05","Yeah, and I think that a lot of","1"
"01;34;58;06","01;35;00;09","interaction","1"
"01;35;00;15","01;35;03;09","that we share in our academy can","1"
"01;35;04;02","01;35;07;09","a linguistic in advanced societies","1"
"01;35;07;09","01;35;08;04","really often","1"
"01;35;08;04","01;35;10;26","look like transmission interaction.","1"
"01;35;11;05","01;35;13;03","So we're seeing things","1"
"01;35;13;03","01;35;15;00","that we're thinking to each other,","1"
"01;35;15;00","01;35;17;01","but I think that is epistemic","1"
"01;35;17;08","01;35;19;19","or communicative","1"
"01;35;19;19","01;35;21;19","in terms of transmission","1"
"01;35;21;19","01;35;22;19","is a communicative","1"
"01;35;22;19","01;35;23;26","transmission","1"
"01;35;23;26","01;35;27;07","interactions are are the way they are","1"
"01;35;27;07","01;35;28;22","because they are explicit","1"
"01;35;28;22","01;35;30;01","aims of the interaction","1"
"01;35;30;01","01;35;31;03","in which we are engaged.","1"
"01;35;31;03","01;35;31;25","That is,","1"
"01;35;31;25","01;35;33;17","we are transmitting content","1"
"01;35;33;17","01;35;35;03","now when we're talking to each other","1"
"01;35;35;03","01;35;36;12","because","1"
"01;35;36;28","01;35;37;14","in a way","1"
"01;35;37;14","01;35;39;25","that that's the goal of the interaction.","1"
"01;35;40;05","01;35;43;23","But in other contexts like it's","1"
"01;35;43;23","01;35;46;01","because we have come get practices","1"
"01;35;46;01","01;35;46;28","that we have developed","1"
"01;35;46;28","01;35;49;09","that we can have these these goals","1"
"01;35;49;24","01;35;52;04","that can drive an interaction.","1"
"01;35;52;19","01;35;55;02","And if we're at the grocery store,","1"
"01;35;55;03","01;35;56;19","if we're in other context,","1"
"01;35;56;19","01;35;57;10","we're doing something","1"
"01;35;57;10","01;35;58;02","with something else.","1"
"01;35;58;02","01;36;00;06","But when we're in academic contexts,","1"
"01;36;00;06","01;36;02;17","often the goal of the interactions is","1"
"01;36;02;26","01;36;03;20","talking about","1"
"01;36;04;23","01;36;06;20","transmitting some, some,","1"
"01;36;06;20","01;36;08;24","some contents, transmitting some, some,","1"
"01;36;09;09","01;36;10;02","some theories,","1"
"01;36;10;02","01;36;10;14","for instance,","1"
"01;36;10;14","01;36;11;10","explaining theories,","1"
"01;36;11;10","01;36;12;20","explaining arguments.","1"
"01;36;12;20","01;36;14;05","And so these interactions.","1"
"01;36;14;05","01;36;15;22","We look at them and we're like,","1"
"01;36;15;22","01;36;17;24","Oh, that's clearly there's","1"
"01;36;17;24","01;36;18;27","we're transmitting content","1"
"01;36;18;27","01;36;19;25","when we're talking.","1"
"01;36;19;25","01;36;21;13","But the idea is that","1"
"01;36;21;13","01;36;23;07","this is really a small subset of,","1"
"01;36;23;07","01;36;25;05","the cases of communicative interaction","1"
"01;36;25;05","01;36;27;25","that we engage in in everyday life,","1"
"01;36;28;04","01;36;32;29","and we take these as paradigmatic cases","1"
"01;36;32;29","01;36;34;17","of communicative interaction","1"
"01;36;34;17","01;36;37;09","when they are really","1"
"01;36;37;09","01;36;39;05","the pinnacle of the","1"
"01;36;39;05","01;36;41;22","the linguistic civilization.","1"
"01;36;41;22","01;36;44;07","We're in a really rarefied","1"
"01;36;46;11","01;36;48;29","context where academic discussions are","1"
"01;36;48;29","01;36;51;19","not what we do in everyday settings.","1"
"01;36;51;19","01;36;53;18","When we talk to each other","1"
"01;36;53;18","01;36;56;10","and we we do this, it's","1"
"01;36;56;10","01;36;58;00","because it's an explicit","1"
"01;36;58;00","01;36;59;17","aim of our interaction","1"
"01;36;59;17","01;37;02;08","now that we do this. But in other cases,","1"
"01;37;03;22","01;37;04;20","in many in","1"
"01;37;04;20","01;37;06;11","most cases, when we speak to each other,","1"
"01;37;06;11","01;37;07;29","that's not the aim.","1"
"01;37;07;29","01;37;09;22","The explicit aim is not to transfer","1"
"01;37;09;22","01;37;11;25","some information or talk about theories.","1"
"01;37;11;25","01;37;14;01","It's about doing things together.","1"
"01;37;14;06","01;37;16;17","And now we're doing something together.","1"
"01;37;16;17","01;37;18;17","We're talking about active inference,","1"
"01;37;18;17","01;37;22;10","but it looks as if it can be understood","1"
"01;37;22;10","01;37;24;01","in in terms of content","1"
"01;37;24;01","01;37;25;22","sharing and content transmission.","1"
"01;37;25;22","01;37;27;22","But that's because it's the goal","1"
"01;37;27;22","01;37;29;01","of our interaction.","1"
"01;37;29;01","01;37;29;10","It's that","1"
"01;37;29;10","01;37;29;28","because it's","1"
"01;37;29;28","01;37;34;01","the nature of communication.","1"
"01;37;34;01","01;37;37;17","And I don't know if I'm being clear","1"

"01;37;38;17","01;37;40;22","Dingyadi or Henry.","1"
"01;37;40;22","01;37;43;09","I just I think","1"
"01;37;44;09","01;37;45;09","I don't want to put","1"
"01;37;45;09","01;37;46;26","my philosopher's cap on, but I will.","1"
"01;37;46;26","01;37;48;00","Just briefly,","1"
"01;37;48;00","01;37;49;23","I think we use language of communication","1"
"01;37;49;23","01;37;50;14","to save time.","1"
"01;37;50;14","01;37;53;03","It's an exploitation strategy.","1"
"01;37;53;03","01;37;55;15","And so I think when we put a 13 week set","1"
"01;37;55;15","01;37;56;08","of parentheses","1"
"01;37;56;08","01;37;59;20","around a learning moment or opportunity,","1"
"01;38;00;08","01;38;01;22","we oftentimes get it,","1"
"01;38;01;22","01;38;03;09","get the cart ahead of the horse.","1"
"01;38;03;09","01;38;04;07","We don't","1"
"01;38;04;07","01;38;06;12","we don't see the pragmatics","1"
"01;38;06;12","01;38;08;23","because we're busy transmitting.","1"
"01;38;09;29","01;38;10;20","And what ends","1"
"01;38;10;20","01;38;11;05","up happening","1"
"01;38;11;05","01;38;13;11","is the plan forward that affordances,","1"
"01;38;13;20","01;38;14;27","that exploitation","1"
"01;38;14;27","01;38;18;01","or optimization or savings of time","1"

"01;38;20;15","01;38;22;07","to participate in the permeate.","1"
"01;38;22;07","01;38;24;16","Now we can see that's a luxury.","1"
"01;38;24;16","01;38;26;00","But is it","1"
"01;38;26;00","01;38;28;29","if we don't respect the fact that people","1"
"01;38;29;20","01;38;32;04","maybe don't necessarily learn as well","1"
"01;38;32;21","01;38;34;06","when they're handed the plan,","1"
"01;38;34;06","01;38;35;18","as opposed to","1"

"01;38;41;26","01;38;44;00","We could go away from this live stream","1"
"01;38;44;00","01;38;44;20","and each of us","1"
"01;38;44;20","01;38;47;24","could literally now design a better plan","1"

"01;38;53;01","01;38;56;08","what was a sketch.","1"
"01;38;56;08","01;38;58;16","And then we perhaps","1"
"01;38;59;10","01;39;01;22","participated and permeated.","1"
"01;39;01;22","01;39;02;14","Now","1"
"01;39;02;26","01;39;04;04","that the sophistication","1"

"01;39;05;25","01;39;08;08","in terms of a goal for each one of us","1"
"01;39;08;22","01;39;11;11","is orders of magnitude greater","1"
"01;39;11;24","01;39;14;01","because somebody didn't say, Oh,","1"
"01;39;14;13","01;39;15;25","well, I've only got 13 weeks.","1"
"01;39;15;25","01;39;17;20","I don't have the luxury","1"

"01;39;22;29","01;39;24;21","I don't mean to sermonizing,","1"
"01;39;24;21","01;39;27;03","but I think when we actually feel","1"
"01;39;27;04","01;39;30;08","what it's like to let the plan","1"
"01;39;31;17","01;39;33;27","naturally evolve and become","1"

"01;40;03;03","01;40;05;05","And I think the most important","1"

"01;40;07;23","01;40;08;08","because that's","1"

"01;41;39;18","01;41;42;05","for many learning scenarios","1"
"01;41;43;02","01;41;45;18","is to replicate the prior.","1"

"01;45;35;14","01;45;37;25","it does it to minimize the three","1"
"01;45;37;25","01;45;40;10","and active inference is no different.","1"
"01;45;40;10","01;45;43;11","And a communicative active inference","1"
"01;45;43;11","01;45;44;29","as a form of active inference","1"
"01;45;44;29","01;45;46;20","also aims to minimize","1"
"01;45;46;20","01;45;47;26","the free energy of an overturned","1"
"01;45;47;26","01;45;48;26","down is them.","1"
"01;45;48;26","01;45;51;11","And so when an organism tries, it","1"
"01;45;51;22","01;45;54;15","finds itself in a situation where it's","1"
"01;45;55;12","01;45;56;20","there's a lot of free energy","1"
"01;45;56;20","01;45;58;01","or there's a lot of error of prediction.","1"
"01;45;58;01","01;45;59;18","It will try to","1"
"01;45;59;18","01;46;01;17","engage it in its endeavor intervening.","1"
"01;46;01;17","01;46;02;19","It's an environment","1"
"01;46;02;19","01;46;04;17","in order to bring itself","1"
"01;46;04;17","01;46;07;21","back in the available in, viable states.","1"
"01;46;08;03","01;46;09;29","And so all these ideas","1"
"01;46;09;29","01;46;11;24","and when we apply them to communication,","1"
"01;46;11;24","01;46;13;16","I think they lead","1"
"01;46;13;16","01;46;15;11","not necessarily by implication,","1"
"01;46;15;11","01;46;16;10","but I think the","1"
"01;46;16;10","01;46;19;06","there's a path to these ideas, true","1"
"01;46;20;06","01;46;21;08","to the","1"
"01;46;21;08","01;46;22;03","pragmatic view of","1"
"01;46;22;03","01;46;23;16","communication, the idea","1"

"01;46;29;18","01;46;30;13","of organisms","1"
"01;46;30;13","01;46;31;29","in order to minimize their free energy.","1"
"01;46;31;29","01;46;32;06","I think","1"
"01;46;32;06","01;46;35;27","there's this kind of basic biological","1"
"01;46;36;05","01;46;38;06","and understanding","1"
"01;46;38;06","01;46;40;07","of the behavior of organism.","1"
"01;46;40;15","01;46;42;26","I think it leads us more toward","1"
"01;46;42;26","01;46;45;06","the pragmatist view of communication","1"
"01;46;45;19","01;46;47;18","rather than toward the","1"

"01;46;56;12","01;46;58;19","highly advanced and complex","1"
"01;46;58;19","01;46;59;24","linguistic interactions.","1"
"01;46;59;24","01;47;01;09","And I think that this like","1"
"01;47;01;09","01;47;04;03","basic biological framework","1"
"01;47;04;03","01;47;05;13","is a good place.","1"
"01;47;05;13","01;47;07;05","Try to understand","1"
"01;47;07;05","01;47;08;26","communication in the pragmatist.","1"
"01;47;08;26","01;47;11;00","You a","1"
"01;47;12;11","01;47;14;12","very nice answer","1"
"01;47;15;09","01;47;17;14","all I'll read a comment from Stephen","1"
"01;47;17;25","01;47;20;16","and then we can give a thought on it","1"
"01;47;20;16","01;47;21;15","as well as provide","1"
"01;47;21;15","01;47;24;00","some closing thoughts.","1"
"01;47;24;00","01;47;24;28","So Stephen wrote","1"
"01;47;26;07","01;47;27;08","Explicit aims","1"
"01;47;27;08","01;47;28;09","of interaction","1"
"01;47;28;09","01;47;30;08","are important and can be invisible.","1"
"01;47;30;08","01;47;31;21","Thus communication appears","1"
"01;47;31;21","01;47;33;08","to be based on transmission.","1"
"01;47;33;08","01;47;35;13","Should we identify the context","1"
"01;47;35;13","01;47;37;24","through the affordances or via","1"
"01;47;37;24","01;47;39;04","naming the water","1"
"01;47;39;04","01;47;40;29","like the water we swim in?","1"
"01;47;40;29","01;47;43;21","That is is the context","1"
"01;47;43;21","01;47;44;15","and the explicit","1"

"01;47;47;21","01;47;49;21","Or is there a special source","1"
"01;47;49;21","01;47;50;14","that flavors","1"
"01;47;50;14","01;47;51;18","the cultural waters","1"
"01;47;51;18","01;47;55;24","in which we are swimming?","1"
"01;47;55;24","01;47;56;03","Yeah,","1"
"01;48;00;16","01;48;01;26","Steve, special sauce.","1"
"01;48;01;26","01;48;02;18","Real quick on that.","1"
"01;48;02;18","01;48;05;16","I think what maybe you did build on","1"
"01;48;05;16","01;48;06;10","what Remy just said.","1"
"01;48;06;10","01;48;07;16","I think","1"
"01;48;07;16","01;48;10;23","perhaps active inference opens up","1"
"01;48;10;23","01;48;11;23","that space.","1"
"01;48;11;23","01;48;12;25","It's to the","1"
"01;48;12;25","01;48;15;00","to the idea of a special sauce.","1"
"01;48;15;00","01;48;15;24","It doesn't guarantee","1"
"01;48;15;24","01;48;16;29","that there will be one,","1"
"01;48;16;29","01;48;19;10","and it certainly doesn't promise.","1"
"01;48;20;19","01;48;22;23","But what it does do is it says,","1"
"01;48;22;23","01;48;26;00","what are the possibilities within this?","1"
"01;48;26;01","01;48;28;27","Not just what are we collapsing down to?","1"
"01;48;29;10","01;48;31;00","I mean, throughout this series,","1"
"01;48;31;00","01;48;32;23","I've been talking a lot about,","1"
"01;48;32;23","01;48;35;02","well, we can't leave the absolutes,","1"
"01;48;35;02","01;48;36;21","the things that we've experienced","1"
"01;48;36;21","01;48;38;05","out of this equation.","1"
"01;48;38;05","01;48;39;05","But I think what the","1"
"01;48;39;05","01;48;39;24","what I think","1"
"01;48;39;24","01;48;42;11","the active inference affords is that","1"
"01;48;43;00","01;48;44;10","those relativities","1"
"01;48;44;10","01;48;46;11","in those those entanglements","1"
"01;48;46;15","01;48;47;24","and those entanglements","1"
"01;48;47;24","01;48;49;18","always to be determined","1"
"01;48;49;18","01;48;52;07","can be moved towards","1"
"01;48;52;07","01;48;54;25","and and maybe accepted","1"
"01;48;54;25","01;48;57;02","with with more abundance","1"
"01;48;57;02","01;48;58;24","if we use active inference.","1"
"01;48;58;24","01;49;04;18","But that's just my optimistic take on.","1"
"01;49;04;18","01;49;06;29","Do you have any other closing words","1"
"01;49;06;29","01;49;09;00","before we hear some final thoughts","1"
"01;49;09;00","01;49;12;27","from the others?","1"
"01;49;12;27","01;49;14;25","Excellent. Okay.","1"
"01;49;14;25","01;49;18;22","Blue or Remy with some final thoughts.","1"
"01;49;18;22","01;49;21;10","How's this?","1"
"01;49;21;10","01;49;27;12","How will it permeate with you?","1"
"01;49;27;12","01;49;28;23","Okay, so I'll go ahead.","1"
"01;49;28;23","01;49;31;17","So, yeah, I was really happy","1"
"01;49;31;17","01;49;32;28","to have the chance","1"
"01;49;32;28","01;49;35;13","to talk about the paper with you.","1"
"01;49;35;26","01;49;37;15","I think that one of the","1"

"01;49;38;15","01;49;41;15","that I would take home is that now","1"
"01;49;41;15","01;49;44;09","I have a really salient solicitation to","1"
"01;49;44;16","01;49;46;13","see the Planet Robot","1"
"01;49;47;18","01;49;48;10","in action.","1"
"01;49;48;10","01;49;49;09","So like","1"
"01;49;49;09","01;49;49;20","at the","1"
"01;49;49;20","01;49;50;25","second that I close","1"
"01;49;50;25","01;49;51;28","the Zoom meeting, I'm","1"
"01;49;51;28","01;49;53;08","going to go see that.","1"
"01;49;53;08","01;49;54;15","That's really something","1"
"01;49;54;15","01;49;56;01","that I taking","1"
"01;49;56;01","01;49;58;23","from the citizen discussion.","1"
"01;49;58;23","01;49;59;11","But yeah, no,","1"
"01;49;59;11","01;50;00;21","it was really interesting","1"
"01;50;00;21","01;50;01;07","to see","1"
"01;50;01;07","01;50;02;14","different perspectives,","1"
"01;50;02;14","01;50;05;15","different backgrounds and","1"
"01;50;05;15","01;50;06;23","what, what","1"
"01;50;06;23","01;50;07;21","these different","1"
"01;50;07;21","01;50;08;16","differing backgrounds","1"
"01;50;08;16","01;50;12;00","can bring to a discussion that is,","1"
"01;50;13;07","01;50;15;10","I think that was really enlightening","1"
"01;50;15;21","01;50;18;14","for me and I was really happy to to be","1"
"01;50;18;14","01;50;21;26","there.","1"
"01;50;21;26","01;50;23;13","Just say thanks for coming.","1"
"01;50;23;13","01;50;24;17","I mean, we really enjoyed","1"
"01;50;24;17","01;50;25;07","this discussion.","1"
"01;50;25;07","01;50;25;20","And for me,","1"
"01;50;25;20","01;50;28;10","I think what will permeate is like the,","1"
"01;50;29;17","01;50;31;09","you know, everything I think about now,","1"
"01;50;31;09","01;50;32;09","I just think about","1"
"01;50;32;09","01;50;33;08","how can I model this","1"
"01;50;33;08","01;50;34;25","in terms of active influence?","1"
"01;50;34;25","01;50;38;06","And I feel like this paper will,","1"
"01;50;38;06","01;50;39;28","you know, influence","1"
"01;50;39;28","01;50;42;05","maybe the way that I think about","1"
"01;50;42;05","01;50;42;24","communication,","1"
"01;50;42;24","01;50;44;12","which is a big part of modeling,","1"
"01;50;44;12","01;50;45;17","active influence","1"
"01;50;45;17","01;50;46;20","period, especially like","1"
"01;50;46;20","01;50;48;18","in a multi-agent dynamical system.","1"
"01;50;48;18","01;50;52;03","So I think I will probably leverage","1"
"01;50;52;03","01;50;53;15","the psychological approach","1"
"01;50;53;15","01;50;55;17","in the way that I think about it","1"
"01;50;55;23","01;50;56;12","going forward.","1"
"01;50;56;12","01;50;58;08","So I appreciate the opportunity","1"
"01;50;58;08","01;51;00;27","to learn about it.","1"
"01;51;00;27","01;51;01;28","Awesome.","1"
"01;51;01;29","01;51;04;09","My closing thought.","1"
"01;51;04;23","01;51;07;17","What I'm left with here is active","1"
"01;51;07;17","01;51;11;00","inference as about affordances","1"
"01;51;11;29","01;51;14;25","is about the content of the model","1"
"01;51;15;06","01;51;16;18","is about affordances,","1"
"01;51;16;18","01;51;19;05","and active inference is an affordances.","1"
"01;51;19;05","01;51;22;07","It allows us to realize epistemic","1"
"01;51;22;07","01;51;24;15","and pragmatic value today","1"
"01;51;24;15","01;51;26;12","and in the future.","1"
"01;51;26;12","01;51;28;11","And in that way","1"
"01;51;28;11","01;51;31;10","we can see it as a gripper and gripped.","1"
"01;51;31;25","01;51;33;27","Just like we could talk about the hand","1"
"01;51;34;04","01;51;35;28","as gripper and gripped,","1"
"01;51;35;28","01;51;37;08","whether it's holding hands","1"
"01;51;37;08","01;51;40;13","or grabbing an object, and especially in","1"
"01;51;40;13","01;51;44;14","this thought to some very nice points","1"
"01;51;44;14","01;51;48;01","added on language as gripper and gripped","1"
"01;51;48;22","01;51;50;12","and contextualizing","1"
"01;51;50;12","01;51;53;07","this kind of breakaway verbal community","1"
"01;51;53;27","01;51;57;19","of research and scholarly education","1"
"01;51;57;19","01;51;58;27","and academia,","1"
"01;51;58;27","01;52;02;04","and recognizing that breakaway community","1"
"01;52;02;04","01;52;03;17","and skill","1"
"01;52;03;20","01;52;05;27","as something that's crystallizing","1"
"01;52;05;27","01;52;08;01","out of a much more inclusive","1"
"01;52;08;01","01;52;10;07","and pragmatically oriented niche.","1"
"01;52;10;22","01;52;13;25","And I think that will be a win win","1"
"01;52;14;01","01;52;18;18","framing because it will help ground","1"
"01;52;18;27","01;52;20;11","what can be abstract","1"
"01;52;20;11","01;52;23;15","and lofty discussions and also","1"
"01;52;23;27","01;52;26;23","elevate and bring what","1"
"01;52;27;25","01;52;29;08","bring attention","1"
"01;52;29;08","01;52;29;28","and support","1"
"01;52;29;28","01;52;33;19","to some areas and types of communication","1"
"01;52;34;02","01;52;36;08","that are absolutely natural","1"
"01;52;36;18","01;52;37;24","in field of affordances","1"
"01;52;37;24","01;52;39;13","view and the ecological view,","1"
"01;52;39;13","01;52;40;27","but are not always respected.","1"
"01;52;40;27","01;52;42;08","So highly unsure","1"
"01;52;42;08","01;52;44;19","like a symbolic transmission view","1"
"01;52;44;19","01;52;46;15","and the closing image","1"
"01;52;46;15","01;52;48;28","for me is making the source underwater.","1"
"01;52;49;17","01;52;50;29","I'm just imagining it's like,","1"
"01;52;50;29","01;52;52;24","I don't know, SpongeBob SquarePants","1"
"01;52;52;24","01;52;53;05","or someone's","1"
"01;52;53;05","01;52;54;08","trying to cook","1"
"01;52;54;08","01;52;55;15","and make the sauce,","1"
"01;52;55;15","01;52;57;16","but we're adding things.","1"
"01;52;57;16","01;52;58;11","And it's more","1"
"01;52;58;11","01;52;59;09","just like happening","1"
"01;52;59;09","01;53;01;23","in this diffusive space.","1"
"01;53;01;23","01;53;02;14","And in a way,","1"
"01;53;02;14","01;53;04;22","all kitchens are in fluids.","1"
"01;53;05;01","01;53;06;21","That's why we can smell","1"
"01;53;06;21","01;53;08;00","what we're cooking.","1"
"01;53;08;00","01;53;09;21","But it's different enough","1"
