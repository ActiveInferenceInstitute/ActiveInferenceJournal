"Speaker 1","00;00;29;19","00;01;04;23","All right. Welcome, everyone. It is September 7th, 2022. We're here in active live stream number 48.1. In the second discussion on the paper, communication as socially extended active inference an ecological approach to communicative behavior. Welcome to the Active Inference Institute, where we are a participatory online institute that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. This is a recorded and an Archived livestream, so please provide us with feedback so we can improve our work."
"Speaker 1","00;01;05;17","00;01;43;11","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll be following video etiquette for the livestream. Head over to active inference dot org to learn more about getting involved in different learning groups and projects at the Institute. Well, we're here in stream number 48.1, continuing our discussion on communication, active inference, ecological approaches and so on. This is going to be a really exciting discussion and we're appreciative of the first author joining us."
"Speaker 1","00;01;44;07","00;02;08;14","We'll jump right in with some introductions and then onto the discussion. So if you're watching live, feel free to write any questions in the live chat. And I know that on our side we have a lot of things to explore. And also, of course, looking forward to learning more and seeing where it goes. So I'm Daniel. I'm a researcher in California."
"Speaker 1","00;02;08;19","00;02;28;20","And I guess the ecosystem of today is chaparral because it's very warm where I am. And so I was thinking about how different ecosystems and eco tones might facilitate different kinds of communication in a regional way. And I'll pass it to Dean."
"Speaker 2","00;02;30;10","00;03;11;21","I, I'm Dean. I'm in the Rocky Mountains in western Canada right now. And it's it's what we would do in Fahrenheit. It's about 45 Fahrenheit this morning, but it's going to work from up to about 90. So, yeah, there's a bit of an ecology going on around here, too. I think it's going to be a really interesting day because I think what we're going to do is take this ecological approach and lens and with the background of everybody here, we're going to really be able to pull up a lot of different, interesting things that otherwise we would not pay attention to if we only got stuck on the transmission piece."
"Speaker 2","00;03;11;21","00;03;15;13","And I'll pass it down to blue."
"Speaker 3","00;03;15;28","00;03;36;23","Hi, I'm Blue. I am a researcher in Sunny, beautiful New Mexico at the other end of the Rocky Mountains from Dean. Like, literally, if you just go straight down, I'm in the century to Christmas and we are recovering here from a like torrential summer of rain. And I think we're I think like maybe we're finally getting back to some sun."
"Speaker 3","00;03;37;09","00;04;20;08","It's starting to get hot now, like finally. So I think that the sun is is here to stay for. We still have a hot month, I guess, but the desert ecosystem and the to our desert is special and fun and always excites me. And I'm interested to in this paper and in how it more applies broadly the the communication as compared to the vassal paper like can we then apply it to animals and also to like maybe human animal interactions and what those look like and maybe not only cooperative communication but also like competitive communication."
"Speaker 3","00;04;20;08","00;04;26;08","And I think, I think like extending this work into those avenues is interesting and exciting."
"Speaker 1","00;04;28;03","00;04;37;16","Awesome. Thank you, Blue. So, Remy, welcome and please take it away. Feel free to introduce yourself and give any context on the paper."
"Speaker 4","00;04;38;11","00;05;19;02","All right. So thank you for having me. I'm really pleased to see that we will discuss our paper. I'm remits I'm a researcher based in Montreal at UConn and yeah, it's it's sunny it's a nice day you're too. And so yes the paper was an attempt to to device a view of communication that could be like a starting point for ecological and in active approaches to language and communication."
"Speaker 4","00;05;19;14","00;06;01;19","And the problem that we saw is that in most language sciences, like linguistics, in the field of language, in mainstream philosophy, in language and in biology of communication, most researchers, most people end up at IQ automatically a view of communication in which communication is essentially transmitting information or transmission, transmitting content or an idea to another being. So usually like in linguistic communication, that would be like, I have the belief that it's a sunny day outside."
"Speaker 4","00;06;01;28","00;06;47;27","I say it's a sunny day outside. And then by doing this, I am transmitting to you the belief that it's a sunny day outside. So that's the basic view of communication, the transmission view that is more or less adopted by everybody in in linguistics and in cognitive science. But a lot of people at least, and that's a view of communication that is problematic from an active and ecological perspective because it relies on the notion of content and the notion of representation to transmit a content, I must have a representation in my head and then I can transmit it to you so that you can entertain this representation in your head."
"Speaker 4","00;06;48;08","00;07;24;28","But as is quite well known in active and ecological approaches to cognition, I reject the notion of representation, the notion, the notion of content as basic building block of cognition. So the transmission view is a problem from an active ecological view. And so what we tried to do was to develop a view of communication from which ecological and active approaches could start to understand language and communication without having to rely on the notion of content or representation."
"Speaker 4","00;07;25;04","00;08;19;12","So that's like the basic motivation of the paper. That's what we were trying to do and we thought that active and friends and especially its ecology interpretation could be useful for doing that. And, and yet the thing that you mentioned, blue. Yeah, the aim was to devise a view of communication that could be perfectly general, so that could be applied to animal communication, maybe communication between cells at the, at, the, at the more, at the more small scale level and eventually maybe communication between groups at the more at a larger scale so that the view to the attempt was to produce a view of communication that is perfectly general and that can be precise and"
"Speaker 4","00;08;20;13","00;08;53;03","along the way. So that we can, for instance, precise the conception of communication to apply it to cooperative communication, for instance, which is the kind of communication that is characteristic of human communicative interaction, and that was treated notably in the cell paper to which you alluded to. So that's the aim of the paper. And so because of its generality, it's the paper that is really in a way superficial because it's it really treats a lot of topics really quickly."
"Speaker 4","00;08;53;21","00;09;04;22","But that was like a big road map for a view of communication that could be used by ecological and active researchers. So that was essentially what we tried to do in this paper."
"Speaker 1","00;09;06;12","00;09;29;01","Awesome. And just one more follow up question. We often asked would be, how did you come to use active inference? What about the collaboration or your direction led to the fusion of these approaches? Where you studying communication more broadly and came across active inference or vice versa?"
"Speaker 4","00;09;29;27","00;10;07;13","Yeah. So earlier in my in my academic career, so to speak, I was really more in Philadelphia of mind to have more of a philosophical background and not really in cognitive science. So that's where I became acquainted with like issues, about content, about meaning, etc.. And then I came to Cam worked with quality, which is really more center than philosophy of cognitive science and was really interested in predictive processing theories and eventually in active inference framework because of its link with predictive processing."
"Speaker 4","00;10;07;21","00;10;46;01","So coming at you can with well, I really became acquainted with these, with these ideas, with these frameworks and that's where I linked these, these new frameworks with my earlier interests in language and communication that came from my background in philosophy of mind. So that's kind of how it happened. And talking with Clive and the community of researchers at Education who is really using the predictive processing and active inference frameworks, and that's how it all came together."
"Speaker 1","00;10;46;01","00;10;55;03","Awesome. Well, many places to pick up, perhaps, Dean, first, if you'd like to."
"Speaker 2","00;10;55;03","00;11;30;15","Well, okay, I'll start with the question. If I'm if we're going to if we're going to take an an activist approach to this, we're going to look at at what communication is through that philosophical approach and and take all that active inference affords in terms of of opening up what communication is, maybe. I mean, could you talk a little bit about how people who want to argue that there is no content?"
"Speaker 2","00;11;31;02","00;12;11;16","What, how then what, how could we then describe our experiences, the things that we've played out, the things that we're going to play towards? But mostly what I'm curious about is the things that have been played, because we've got a record of that. We don't have to call it content. But I've had a lot of conversations with a lot of people who live in the in activist thinking community, and they they come up, they twist a whole bunch of things around, but they really have a hard time coming up with an argument that says, my experiences aren't something, some thing."
"Speaker 2","00;12;11;19","00;12;16;01","So maybe you could talk a little bit about the."
"Speaker 4","00;12;16;01","00;12;45;07","Yeah, so that's a good question. I think that's one of the answers that I could provide is that from my perspective, there are some people in ecological and active circles who refuse all reference to content. This content doesn't exist at all. But that's not my perspective. From my perspective, content is just not at the basic level of cognition."
"Speaker 4","00;12;45;07","00;13;10;27","And it's like it's kind of I don't know if you're familiar with the work of Hutto and Mayan. There are these are radical and activists, and they claim that their content is not like at the fundamental level, it's something that gets added up once there are a particular kind of social normative practices that can give rise to content."
"Speaker 4","00;13;10;27","00;13;48;28","So that that's my view. I think that we can describe the basic cognitive functioning of organisms and animals and in many cases humans without the use of the notion of content of the notion of representation. I think that we can do that. But at some point in our in our in our social interactions, there are multiple things that that that can happen that will give rise to a content to representation."
"Speaker 4","00;13;48;28","00;14;15;11","And that's that's a complicated story. That's something that I might come back to later on. But the idea is that content is not at the basic level. It's not something that we can presuppose in a theory of communication and something that can be explained by a theory of communication. But it's not something that is that can be taken as something that can explain."
"Speaker 4","00;14;15;11","00;14;49;09","It's something that has to be explained, so to speak. I don't know if I'm clear so we can, I think, use the notion of content to characterize the kind of experience, the kind of phenomena that you allude to, but this notion must be it must not be taken as granted. That's that the view that I take. And I think there are some ways to explain how content arrives on the scene, but it's not something that can be taken as granted in a theory area of communication."
"Speaker 4","00;14;49;09","00;15;15;02","And that's what I'm critiquing in this paper. It's like in traditional transmission view of communication, people, principles, that there is content, that there is representation, and communication is defined as the transmitting of this content, of this representation. What I'm saying is that representation is not an explosion, something that that can be used as this based all explanatory notion."
"Speaker 4","00;15;15;18","00;15;42;29","It's something we have to describe communication without the use of this notion and then with various tools of social interaction and particularly social normative practices, we can explain out there that our content can then arise so that that's I can if you want to give more detail on that front. But that's my, my, my $0.02. So content exists."
"Speaker 4","00;15;42;29","00;15;49;01","It's not just at the basic level of communication."
"Speaker 1","00;15;49;01","00;16;27;23","Awesome. That reminds me of and to to stay on our philosophy wavelength. The difference between the explaining and them and the exponents. So just quoting Wikipedia and explanation them is a sentence describing a phenomena that is to be explained, and the explanations are the sentences are adduced as explanations of that phenomena. And so it's a very interesting difference among these theoretical views and framings, which I'm sure we'll be able to unpack a lot of implications of that content as a phenomena or a descriptive category sign or symbol."
"Speaker 1","00;16;28;10","00;16;57;16","We can have many ways of even describing what that is. However, under the transmission view, you're suggesting that content is seen as what is able to explain different phenomena like communication or cooperative communication, no matter how far out you go in the sub discussions, content is doing something to explain. Whereas in the radical and activist approach, radical meaning from the root."
"Speaker 1","00;16;57;16","00;17;25;00","So with an activism at the root, that doesn't mean that there couldn't be a branch that summarizes and reflects content, but it's something that is explained through an active means rather than something that we're going to put like the cart before the horse and then use this semantic content representation view and the transmission associated with it to then try to explain in activism."
"Speaker 2","00;17;25;14","00;17;54;15","Deem Yeah, I think I, I'm, I'm on the same page as both of you. I, I take an example and in 2019 I'm walking up the street, Rue Saint Tony, and I'm heading to the patisserie and I don't have any first hand experience with that, but once I arrive there and I one of those, those chocolate pastries, now all of a sudden I have content."
"Speaker 2","00;17;54;24","00;18;22;23","So it wasn't that I had content first, even when I was looking at the map and walking up from UK and past all the bars and and on a beautiful fall day, I had the content once I experienced something first. But I also can't deny that there was an aspect of that that wasn't limited just to the moment of all of the actions that I took walking up the street."
"Speaker 2","00;18;22;28","00;18;55;23","So if we're going to look at an ecology and as I said in my first question, if we're going to use active inference as the lens, the situational analysis method, I don't know how we can draw up content, but I do think the timing of when we see it as the important thing or the the central aspect of what communication is, I don't think it I don't think it destroys the fact that we still have it."
"Speaker 2","00;18;55;23","00;19;14;21","It's just when does it matter in that in that continuum. So yeah. And by the way, thank you for just reminding me of that. That trip in to Montreal in 2019 before all the tech broke loose with all these viral things, was beautiful. Time."
"Speaker 1","00;19;14;21","00;19;18;07","I also went to Montreal in 2019. Very cool to."
"Speaker 3","00;19;21;24","00;19;40;06","Yeah. I am curious about the difference between or maybe there's no difference or how can we clarify the difference between content and context?"
"Speaker 1","00;19;40;06","00;19;44;12","Yes, great question. What do you think for me?"
"Speaker 4","00;19;45;09","00;20;28;25","Okay, so content is essentially something that as accuracy conditions. So the idea of content is it's something that can be false or true. It's something that can be or more generally something that can be satisfied or not satisfied. So for instance, usually we'll say that our propositional attitude of content. So for instance, when I have a belief, my belief as a content and this content can be true or false or for instance, if I believe that it's sunny outside, I have the belief that it is sunny outside in the content, it is sunny outside."
"Speaker 4","00;20;28;25","00;20;49;25","It can be true or false and it's sunny outside that then my my belief is true. So that's the basic idea of content. It's something that is attached to our mental states and it's usually associated associated with the notion of representations. There are complex debates to be out there, but that's the idea of content. It's something that it's like."
"Speaker 4","00;20;50;11","00;21;08;27","It's like, yeah, something that as conditions of correction in which it can be correct or incorrect. And so that's content and context in in the I don't know if you mean in general or in the specific way in which we use it in the paper."
"Speaker 3","00;21;08;27","00;21;11;23","So how you use it in the paper?"
"Speaker 4","00;21;12;08","00;22;01;10","Yeah. So context is a set of elements that are relevant to the and to the, to a joint action. So that's how we use it. A context. A context of action in particular in the paper we're talking about joint action. So when two people or more people are performing a joint action, they're doing something together. There are going to be some elements, some events, some objects of the environment that will be relevant on which some action has to be done in order to advance the joint action for the context is like this structured a special temporarily structured set of elements on which action has to be taken to progress the joint action."
"Speaker 4","00;22;01;10","00;22;07;27","So that's the notion of context that we use in the paper. I don't know if if that certifies them well."
"Speaker 3","00;22;08;04","00;22;15;02","So it implies like, like the set of elements is therefore also content. Is that true."
"Speaker 4","00;22;16;06","00;22;44;08","In that in the paper we we don't think that it is my describing it as a set of elements is a content full description because I'm talking about it and there's a content to the sentence of me saying that, that there's a set of elements, but the set itself, the thesis that we are pushing for in the paper is that it can be it can appear in that field."
"Speaker 4","00;22;44;08","00;23;14;16","Those affordances of an organism without it having to represent it. So that's where that's what we are going to in ecological psychology. There's we're working on the notion of a field of affordances. So it's like the set, the structure and set of affordances to which an organism is sensible. And it's like there there's some elements that will drive its action differentially depending on various internal factors."
"Speaker 4","00;23;14;16","00;23;38;29","And this sensibility of an organism to its environment doesn't have to be characterized in terms of content. If we believe that the ecological psychologists who developed this notion so this set of elements appears in a field of affordances and these these organisms who are sensible to their field of affordances not have to entertain their representation of this set of element."
"Speaker 4","00;23;38;29","00;23;50;06","They're just sensible to their field of affordances. And that's how they respond to these sets of elements of their environment."
"Speaker 3","00;23;50;06","00;24;20;28","So like I maybe like when you talk about content, maybe that is what needs to actually be clarified. Like so content is specifically some kind of semantic representation or semiotic representation and said something that is explicit but like can you, can you give me an example of the what would be an element in like a set of elements like how, how is that also not like content?"
"Speaker 4","00;24;20;28","00;24;52;25","Yeah, these are obviously complex questions, but yeah, typically and that's our audience is a relation between an element of the environment and an action capacity of an organism and the, the, the thesis that is taken by an ecological psychologist, not everybody will agree with that. But is that the perception of affordances and does not need the mediation of a representation?"
"Speaker 4","00;24;53;03","00;25;20;23","You can directly be sensible to a certain pattern. I've been there, for instance, in the in the in the energy array around you and you respond to this pattern of energy by, for instance, taking the foreign dunes that is specified by this pattern of energy. And you don't as it's not necessary to have a representation of the far dense to which you're sensible, it's something that you can directly perceive."
"Speaker 4","00;25;20;29","00;25;51;20","And that's that's like a central idea of ecological psychology. Some people will disagree with that will say that you cannot be sensible to in that far dense if you don't represent it. So that that's something that you can argue for. But there is a lot of ecological psychologists who believe that you can be directly sensible to affordances of your environment just by responding to the the energy array that is in your environment without needing to represent this effort."
"Speaker 4","00;25;51;20","00;26;20;21","And so in doing that, they say that we don't need the notion of content or representation to characterize the way in which an organism is responsive to the affordances of its environment. And that's what we we presuppose in this paper. But obviously there are disagreements to be had there. There are people obviously you think that if an organism is to act on its environment, it has to be to have it representation of its environment in order to act correctly."
"Speaker 4","00;26;20;21","00;26;25;06","So that's obviously something that can be defended too well."
"Speaker 3","00;26;25;06","00;26;28;27","Great. Thank you so much. No, that's super helpful. Thanks."
"Speaker 1","00;26;30;00","00;27;16;07","It makes me think of a tug of war game or just two people pulling on a rope. They're engaged in joint action, which is how action and activism are placed at the center of the account of context. One individual pulling the rope. They might be thinking or thinking that they think any number of things. But through the field of affordances being shaped through the regularities and the, I think, arrays of energy that you described in the speech that is going to alter the field of affordances of someone on the other side of the rope, and that could be mediated through their appropriate perception."
"Speaker 1","00;27;16;07","00;28;03;00","Or maybe the rope is now not graspable, but it was graspable previously. None of that requires a symbolic or even necessarily semantic component to be transmitted along with the rope pole. Maybe they had a pre play and they said two tugs means this and three means that. And that can also reflect planning to communicate. However, in the act of communication, as we're exploring, we're putting action and the embodiment in the environment as primacy and then seeing certain types of cognitive agents as being able to develop representation like properties on top of some physical regularities in the niche din."
"Speaker 2","00;28;03;00","00;28;53;21","I mean, what would you think of this idea if you if I were to we haven't defined ecology here in this conversation, but if if someone like me came along to you and said, can we define it as both a process, ecology as process and an ecology as a as a product? Would you push back on that, on that ability to see it to two ways and then I guess on top on the general level to blues question then can can we, can we see it as content and context, this idea, this placeholder of ecology, if we keep it on that general level, can we have our cake and eat it too?"
"Speaker 4","00;28;53;21","00;29;41;07","Yeah. So ecology here really refers to something specific. It's not ecology in general, like in the branch of biology when in in so that you are connected science. When we talk about ecological psychology, it's a particular movement that became that that began with the work of the of Gibson in the fifties, sixties and seventies. And it's an approach to psychology that states that the recognition of animals is the matter of its direct relation with its environment and is a matter of the kind of skills that are exhausted by this animal in its environment."
"Speaker 4","00;29;41;12","00;30;13;01","And the central notion of ecological psychology is the notion of affordances and therefore dense is a possibility of action. It's a relation between an element of the environment and a skill that can be exercised on this element of the environment. And the thesis of Gibson and all the ecological psychologies that followed after that is that organisms and animals primarily perceive affordances in their environment."
"Speaker 4","00;30;13;01","00;30;55;17","They don't perceive objects, they don't perceive events or properties. What they perceive first and foremost, first and foremost is possibilities for action. And they are pushed and pulled by their environment in various way and responsive to their environment to take some affordances and don't not take some other affordances and that. So that's like in a constant interaction with their environment, organisms will respond to these affordances and do some, do some things and we'll be attracted by some affordances will be pushed by some other affordances, and that's how an organism interacts with its environment."
"Speaker 4","00;30;55;17","00;31;23;21","So that's ecology. It really refers to that, that body of ideas that came from the work of Gibson in ecological psychology. There are obviously links with ecological ecology more broadly in the in the as a branch of biology, but it's really specifically the like the this this set of ideas linked to ecological psychology and Gibson's work."
"Speaker 2","00;31;23;21","00;31;40;21","Do you think that that what you just described the possibility could be for people like yourself both a product and a process, is that possibility something that can be categorized two different ways at once?"
"Speaker 4","00;31;42;13","00;31;44;14","So that's a good question. You mean like a."
"Speaker 2","00;31;47;19","00;31;53;23","Is it a category error to say it's only a process? That would be another way of asking the same questions."
"Speaker 4","00;31;54;19","00;32;32;27","I think that ecological psychologists would more preferred the description of the the interaction of an organism with its environment in terms of process, because the organisms is always changing through its interaction with its environment. And obviously the organism is also changing the environment control as is described in in active insurance accounts of niche construction. So there's always an evolving interaction in which the organisms gain skills and the environment is transformed."
"Speaker 4","00;32;33;03","00;32;42;20","So the field of affordances is like never static, so it can never really be described as a product. I don't know if that's and that can that answer is a bit for your question."
"Speaker 2","00;32;43;14","00;33;06;28","Well, are there other products within what you just described? So for example, if I if I'm an organism, I've had experiences and I can now use those experiences to continue my process. Are those those things that I've experienced, are they do they just have to stay in the same category as now processed as in as in past or have they solidify?"
"Speaker 2","00;33;07;04","00;33;33;05","Because I can't go back and change my history per se, I can build off of it. But those are pretty absolute. Now, this this sentence that I'm getting out is going to have a record that I can't I can't erase. So are those things products now? And in the enacting of whatever I've decided I want to focus on in terms of possibility."
"Speaker 4","00;33;33;05","00;33;56;12","I may be I just say something quick. Maybe when you you take like a definite time slice of an evolving organism, you can see that at that point there's a product that can be defined. You can say, okay, at that point there's this set of abilities, this set of skills, this set of experiences that can be attributed to this animal."
"Speaker 4","00;33;56;12","00;34;24;24","So there is a product at that point, but if you take the organism evolution like it's in its entirety, there is always changing. So it's something it's always a process in truth, there's always a process. But if you you you freeze frame, maybe you can say, okay, at that point there's this. And then that is a product of the of the, the interaction."
"Speaker 4","00;34;25;01","00;34;32;03","But I don't know if I answered correctly your question, but that's that would be my, my idea."
"Speaker 2","00;34;32;20","00;34;52;17","Yeah, you are answering and that's great. I'm just trying to get in my mind if we're going to talk about relativity and I know that I step into a river and step out and then step into it a second time, I'm not stepping into the same river. So what gives me the affordances to realize that difference? Is it a product?"
"Speaker 2","00;34;52;23","00;35;15;14","Is it the first step is that first time I went in now a product because I can't go back and change it, I can move off of that and see the relative, the relative distance or the relative time. But I don't know how we do processing with our product. That's, I guess, what I'm asking."
"Speaker 1","00;35;16;11","00;36;08;16","One quick thought on that is that product doesn't necessarily mean singular final static. There are working products that can be versioned, which digital files have helped us see. And then also we could say that the past is produced, but also it's reproduced when it's remembered, when it's brought back together, and even in the directions you point to towards the end of the paper, with what kinds of empirical neurophysiological accounts are helping bolster the ecological claim, the realization that memories are not being accessed as static files but are recreated contextually and relived is an interesting angle."
"Speaker 1","00;36;08;16","00;36;11;12","Yes, blue."
"Speaker 3","00;36;11;12","00;36;41;26","So the recreation of memories contextually, like in dreams, is really interesting because it's like the recreation and also like recombination in in a different context. And just before we leave context entirely, I guess, I think I have a hard time with all of this because even a field of affordances has content, right? Like, like I can go fly a kite if it's windy outside."
"Speaker 3","00;36;41;26","00;37;02;03","Like, I have a set of actions that I can choose from. And I think because we have to talk about it in a way that's semantic, it's difficult to like experience my field of recordings because I'm a human. And not only that, like I'm a very verbal human. So so I think that there's there's like that. But but we even the field of affordances has content."
"Speaker 3","00;37;02;03","00;37;29;22","But but I realized that, like, it's the mental representation aspect that is not that is the distinction between content and context. And I just want to point to the quantum paper where we have the quantum reference frames and crisp fields for our next reality that we did on the livestream. I think number 40 and live stream number 17."
"Speaker 3","00;37;30;13","00;37;52;27","And just it's it's not possible to have a full contextual alignment here. And it makes me think of in the paper how you were describing like there's this person on one end of the beat of the tug of war, and then there's another person on the other end of the tug of war. And then there's actually the tug of war itself."
"Speaker 3","00;37;53;07","00;38;14;09","And I just wonder about like, what is the the so person has their context, person B has their context. What is the context of the tug of war itself? Like it's it's another entity. Anytime you have this like interaction. And this is something that I've said to Daniel before, like you have a relationship with a person, you have a set of communication with the person."
"Speaker 3","00;38;14;15","00;38;43;02","Like that's its own thing. Like that has to be like loved, protected, nurtured. Like you have to keep it up. It has to like like it has to undergo like altarpieces it has to self-assemble, like it's its own entity. And I wonder about modeling in that way. Like, like if I model my communication, like there's me and the person and then the interaction or the collective behavior or whatever it may be, I don't know."
"Speaker 3","00;38;43;02","00;38;49;13","I just it's I've been thinking about it and yeah, that's all."
"Speaker 1","00;38;49;13","00;39;17;02","It's like a view from the bottom or inside or however of communication where there's two entities and a partially aligned frame. And then there's also a view where it is just one thing, albeit maybe with partial information encapsulation, but it still becomes one thing. And then is that one thing atomic even though it contains divisions and partitions as well."
"Speaker 1","00;39;17;02","00;39;18;27","Remy on that or anywhere you want to go."
"Speaker 4","00;39;19;22","00;40;09;24","Yeah I think blew your interventions that were really are really really interesting so far for did the first thing that you said I think I know those are the 2 to 2 to like remove are are a bit of describing things in terms of content because we have language and we describe things in terms of contents. But it's something that has been remarked by really, really by a phenomenological phenomenology that's like Merleau-Ponty and and they are that our primary contact with the world is not some like a description, it's not like a representation and it's not like a reflexive consciousness."
"Speaker 4","00;40;09;24","00;40;31;18","It's a free reflexive consciousness. And in your day to day interaction with your environment, you're not using this kind of language like description to experience your environment. Like if you're playing a sports and like for instance with you're playing soccer and you, you see like a pass that you can make, you're not reflexively thinking that, Oh, you could make that pass."
"Speaker 4","00;40;31;18","00;40;59;18","It's like a push or a pull in a field that in their field kind of thing. And that's how we, we experience. And the second where us humans, especially we, we begin to think about our experience, then we cannot help but describe it in terms of content, in terms of a representation that we entertain in the linguistically with the linguistic means, but in our free reflexive engagement with the environment."
"Speaker 4","00;40;59;18","00;41;38;27","That's the thesis of the economic logics and the ecological psychology. It's really just a push and pull from the environment that drives us in different directions. And we don't have this kind of reflexive consciousness, this kind of representation on which we rely to describe and understand it with these linguistic means. So I think that's really the difficulty that we have of late in getting to this pre reflexive consciousness when we are so used to this again that we describe something, we are describing it in terms of content."
"Speaker 4","00;41;38;27","00;42;17;00","So we have it's hard to say, oh, there is no content when we talk about it, we are invoking content automatically. So yeah, there's a difficulty there. And about the autonomy of the dynamic of an interaction that's something that's really, really interesting. And there's been a great work on this by a is it Kelsey Paolo I don't know if you're familiar is working is an activist researcher is working on language too and I am I have been really inspired by his work and he's describing situations where like there are two people interacting and these two people as goals that are aligned."
"Speaker 4","00;42;17;00","00;42;47;12","But because of the particular dynamic of the interaction, these goals don't come to fruition. For instance, you're walking in the in the corridor in there somewhere and you're facing somebody. And both of you want to like fluidly like pass each other, but you're both trying to go for on one side and then on one side and you're blocking each other that you're trying to achieve the same goal, which is individually passing past each other."
"Speaker 4","00;42;47;12","00;43;27;28","But because of a dynamic that arises from your interaction, you're you cannot achieve this, this goal. So there there's really like this autonomous dynamic at the interaction that is really important. And I don't think obviously that's something that that we wanted to put in the paper because we're talking about interactive, dynamic, dynamic systems. But I don't think that I have succeeded in translating this in the way we think of shared field of affordances because I, I define shared filter avoidance is as the subset that is common to both individual fields of affordances."
"Speaker 4","00;43;27;28","00;43;56;09","But I think that neglects this point, this autonomy of the field of affordances that is shared in the interaction. I don't know if I'm being clear, but I define the shared field of affordances as a product of the combination that a combination of the two individual fields of affordances. But it seems that there's a lack of autonomy in the shell field that I don't know how to account for."
"Speaker 1","00;43;56;09","00;44;26;27","That makes me think of the ants case where one nest may might be able to grab a single seed and carry home. So that would be compatible with a view on communication shaping the field of affordances because it modifies the capacity for another nest made to pick up that seed because it's been moved doesn't need to have any representational content, although especially when we're linguistically describing it does so definitely want to come back to that."
"Speaker 1","00;44;28;03","00;44;56;09","Then there's this seed grabbing ability which is predicated on a lower level of audience, like the ability to grasp with the mandibles. And that lower level of audience enables true joint action like multiple nest mates working together to drag something bigger home, but dragging something bigger isn't in the fore, and so even exists at the single decimate level."
"Speaker 1","00;44;56;21","00;45;38;11","So there's like shared affordances and joint action at the level of what we can both do. And then there's also this very interesting higher level view where perhaps novel affordances become accessible, but then whom or to what or when do these special affordances or maybe nested system affordances come into play? And how will we mediate the the handoff or like the way that those different levels of affordances come into relevance or out of relevance, blue."
"Speaker 3","00;45;38;11","00;46;02;08","So in terms of that modeling, the field of affordances like it changes through time. And this is why I like I was thinking about a competition like in a tug of war between two people. Both of them have the appearance to win or there could be a tie, right? But like it's a potential opportunity for either one to win, but only one can be the winner."
"Speaker 3","00;46;02;15","00;46;20;17","And so then one person winning, like by default, you know, makes it makes the other person lose. And so this this field of avoidance, of thinking through time is really interesting and I think very broadly applicable for modeling all kinds of processes."
"Speaker 4","00;46;20;17","00;46;53;24","Yeah, that's true. And the idea about the collective affordances, there's been some interesting, interesting work on that and clearly some organisms like ants don't perceive collective affordances. They perceive is they perceive something, they perceive their individual affordances and collectively level. There's the the taking of this higher level affordances, this collective affordances of our dance. But they don't perceive individually, probably I don't think they do perceive individually the audience."
"Speaker 4","00;46;53;24","00;47;26;05","But some organisms such as humans, I think because we have maybe a deeper generative of something, we are able to perceive some collective affordances because we're sensible to them. For instance, if I'm moving with a friend, I can perceive that a couch is unmovable by me, but I can perceive it as movable by us. And then I can see like, Oh, we could move this couch together because I perceive it as something that can be acted upon, not just by me, but with somebody else."
"Speaker 4","00;47;26;05","00;47;44;13","And then I have a perception, it appears in my individual feed of our dance as a collective for dance. But that's different from the, the, the ants who achieve a collective action, but without having the perception their field of individual feeling, of affordances of this collective audience."
"Speaker 1","00;47;46;12","00;48;48;10","That's awesome. It makes me think of the human capacity to have counterfactuals and speculative realism on teams and projects like, Hey, everybody here, we could do X. So there's the ability to communicate semantically and representational anywhere needed plausible narratives or little sub niches. New things can be suggested and arise that are specifically about shared or collective affordances. And then additionally, there are special names for when we take individual level affordances that have consequences on other levels of decision making, like there might be a multisig wallet in cryptography or a voting system in democracy where an individual's affordances like to pull the lever or to fill in a box or to assign a transaction, and then"
"Speaker 1","00;48;48;10","00;49;49;18","it's being engaged in specifically because there's knowledge if 100 people do this, then this performance is going to happen. So it seems like there's many cases where we do our mandible closing the kind of lower level individual task, also with an explicit knowledge and a communicated knowledge around how someone's individual actions will influence group outcomes that could be like weakly emergent, like merely submitting the affordances taken by individuals as well as strongly emergent or more strongly emergent in the sense that there's, there's nothing different about anyone's pulling lever and voting, but there are phase transitions and dynamics that can be like top down deep."
"Speaker 2","00;49;49;18","00;50;30;12","Yes. So when we have these experiences and they are kind of absolute in the sense that they they've happened, they've occurred and whether we can recall them or not, they they seem to have some kind of an effect on this relativity piece and and the relationship piece. I don't think it matters whether we see Newton on one side and then Chris Fields and an Einstein on the other, that the bottom line is, is that to what Daniel was just saying, the possible happens when we when we don't get stuck on what's the gauge of the transmission line, but what does that now allow us to do?"
"Speaker 2","00;50;30;19","00;51;10;06","So how do we move from the absolutes, the modeling piece to the process piece, the things that are out there that are have not happened yet, that are still in that possibility category. And now we're going to use communication not just to narrow down to the workbench. The ontology, which Daniel and I are our fast friends, except when it comes to the specifics of ontology, the generalities of that, and the potential impossibility of that, really, maybe you can talk to us a little bit about that from the ecological lens."
"Speaker 4","00;51;11;23","00;51;37;18","Yeah, that's a really good question. I think the one interesting thing about like collective and shared affordances is I think they they are learned in the same way that we learned individual affordances. So for instance, how do we learn how would we we we learn to perceive enough audience. We learn to perceive in that audience. We I think we gain a skill."
"Speaker 4","00;51;37;24","00;52;01;25","When we gain a particular skill, we then can perceive in the over environment, the situations where we can apply the skill. So for instance, when we're really young, we can like I guess we can then maybe crawl a little bit. So we know where surfaces can be crawled upon and we can grab things. So we perceive where things can be grabbed."
"Speaker 4","00;52;01;25","00;52;31;02","And so we start from this like basic skills and then we explore our environment. We do some things that we, we, we're gaining some abilities and when we do that, probably a little bit by trial and error, we, we begin to perceive some higher level affordances can because we can do some more complex things. And so our field of affordances deepens and become more it becomes more complex as our set of skills becomes more complex."
"Speaker 4","00;52;31;11","00;52;58;10","But I think that interacting with others, with others and so sorry for my, my accent, it's not really good. I, I didn't want to say interacting with the animal others. So yes. So when we interact with others we are also learning to do some particular things. For instance, if I tried to to pick something up alone, I might not be strong enough to do it."
"Speaker 4","00;52;58;10","00;53;21;03","So I don't have the skills. So I don't perceive that for dense. But if in some cases I picked something up and I see something, somebody else picking it up with me and we succeed in listing it and then I've gained the ability to see that with somebody else I can lift the stick, but it's not a different, different kind of learning."
"Speaker 4","00;53;21;10","00;53;51;04","And in that case, from the kind of learning that I apply when I'm learning individual skills, it's just that interacting with your environment, you acquire skills, somebody sometimes with some somebody else, sometimes not. And you understand how you can apply these skills in your environment and then you navigate your field affordances accordingly. So how you perceive a possibility is about, Oh, you have to learn to do some things in the past."
"Speaker 4","00;53;51;09","00;54;15;19","And then because of this learning, you perceive situations as affording these of actions. They can be individual, but in communication they are usually about what others can do and what we can do with others. And that's how you perceive like the possibilities that can be that can be brought upon, that can be done with with the person with which you're interacting."
"Speaker 4","00;54;15;19","00;54;18;05","But I don't know if that held. But that's how I see it."
"Speaker 2","00;54;19;19","00;54;43;12","From a, from a modeling standpoint. If you if you move away from the constraints and you look at the emancipation and the freedom piece, it obviously becomes combinatorial, the explosive very, very quickly, because it can go off in many, many directions. As a for example, as Daniel alluded to and we started today's live stream, this could go down many different paths."
"Speaker 2","00;54;43;12","00;55;12;25","So he left it open. He left the freedom aspect in. And so I was curious what you think about. So when we do leave that in, when we do move out of the laboratory or we do move away from the mechanics which you were just describing, and give our attention over to the the freedoms piece of it without without immediately assuming, oh, well, we're going to start modeling now because this is just going to blow up on us."
"Speaker 2","00;55;12;25","00;55;23;03","I was wondering what you were thinking, what you're thinking is around that in terms of communication as a platform for the possible?"
"Speaker 4","00;55;23;03","00;55;48;04","Yes. So the idea of communication is, is that the role it plays in interaction is is a constraint. It's a constraint of the on the set of possible action that can be achieved. So the idea is that the what communication achieves it helps to limit the kind the scope of affordances that will be salient at a given moment."
"Speaker 4","00;55;48;11","00;56;19;08","It's like you will center like the shared field of affordances around a certain set or a certain affordances. And this will limit this will restrict the set of affordances that will be considered or that can be acted upon by the individual participants. So that's the role that I don't know if that helps, but that's how communication works. I think in interaction that everybody does it in the dynamical systems terms."
"Speaker 4","00;56;19;08","00;56;43;08","If the idea was that it allows to create interpersonal synergies in order to achieve the joint goals of the interaction, that was the suggestion in the paper. So for instance, two people being together in a in a room, they can be a lot, they can do a lot of thing. There's like an almost infinite set of affordances that are open to them."
"Speaker 4","00;56;43;14","00;57;18;09","But if one of the people in the room, like, goes to the couch and see like couch or manifestly tries to lift it, then what is what is conveyed for 2 to 3? Take the transmission view idiom. What is conveyed or what to the effect that it as it will augment the salience of the sylvian of the audience, of taking the couch, and then this would restrict the set of affordances that are open, that are salient in the shared field, and then the other person will like, see, okay, that's what we're doing now."
"Speaker 4","00;57;18;13","00;57;45;01","And they're going to take the couch together and list it and bring it. So so that's the role of communication is there's a whole set of affordances open at any moment. And what communication does it restricts and it constrains this set of affordances in order to better achieve that, the joint goals of interaction, that's what we tried to do in the in the paper to understand cooperative communication."
"Speaker 2","00;57;46;14","00;58;18;09","You touched on an important difference, though, between is and if so, what is does actually put pretty strong what we kind of guardrails constraints. But if I ask what if I haven't put a constraint on something I would look now at the counterfactual and the possible and I haven't said that the first the first person that answers back to me is going to necessarily be now the new constraint."
"Speaker 2","00;58;18;09","00;58;42;01","The whole point it if is the possible right and it is the freeing up and it's the whiteboard moment and you know all of this. So again, I in the context of this paper, what the is part of it is in terms of joint action. But is there a what is there a place in your research or the if within the same arguments that you're."
"Speaker 2","00;58;42;04","00;58;49;03","I believe that there is but you didn't speak as clearly to them as you did to the is parts. The constrained parts."
"Speaker 4","00;58;50;18","00;59;19;04","Yes. So the I think what you're talking about here is the the the communication about like future or counterfactual situation. That's what that's what you're talking about. The key. Yeah. So what's what we, we tried to do in the paper is we introduce the notion of a simulation of a field of affordances. And that's where we're we're then thing really closely with like the notion of representation because our idea is that the representation of AI and therefore it is like it's like a fine, fine line to tread."
"Speaker 4","00;59;19;12","01;00;02;04","But so, so there's this notion of a simulation of enough audience feel some sufficiently cognitively complex organisms such as humans and probably some primates can can produce a simulation of enough audience that will enter in this year hierarchical for dense competition. So you can like activate enough audience that is not immediately present in order to affect your current field of audience to a, to, to, to, for, for instance, go towards this simulation of does that based on the work of Paul Chozick, which is at at Montreal and there's work on for a dance competition."
"Speaker 4","01;00;02;09","01;00;33;00","And he argues that a lot of of the phenomena linked to cognitive control so such as the executive function and this kind of thing and working memory can be understood as these these effects of, of, of affordances at higher levels that will constrain the their lower levels of the field of affordances in order, for instance, to act accordingly to the desire level for this."
"Speaker 4","01;00;33;00","01;01;04;27","So the example, the example that she gives is, for instance, suppose that there is a monkey on the, on a branch that like sees a little berry just, just beside it. So there's the dance of eating the berry. But suppose that there's an apple which is a bigger fruit, a bigger prize further down on the on the branched and the monkey as the understanding that there's a in this apple for there there you can with this this simulation of the dance of eating this apple."
"Speaker 4","01;01;04;29","01;01;27;11","I your level also like if I do that if I go there I will get this apple this simulation of a not for a dance at a higher level will constrain with diminish the salience of this immediate so sedation that and it will help him to like ignore this in the immediate berry and it will continue on the branch in order to get to the bigger through to the apple."
"Speaker 4","01;01;27;11","01;01;53;02","So there's like the basic idea of how the simulation of affordances can play like a cognitive control role in order to constrain our behavior according to further goals, like in, in the future, future situation. So that that's the idea on which we, we speak about it really, really quickly in the paper because it's already a really big paper."
"Speaker 4","01;01;53;02","01;02;20;19","But that's an important point. And that's the key to understanding that communication about future and the counterfactual situation. We talk about it in the last section. It's the displacement or did the absence reference discussion. So the idea how can we talk about things that are not immediately present in the special temporal sense? And the idea is that we can activate shared simulations of affordances."
"Speaker 4","01;02;20;19","01;02;45;12","So I can speak about in affordances that an audience that is not immediately present, but it can affect our our shared field of audience and it can drive our behavior toward this audience, for instance, even if it's not immediately present. But, yes, this poses the question of is are these simulations of affordances, representations? I'm not I'm on the fence on this question."
"Speaker 4","01;02;45;19","01;03;02;22","But if they are, they are probably like action oriented representations that we may be. Would be acceptable to an activist, an ecological psychologist sorry for my really long and so that's something that something that I've really thought about a lot."
"Speaker 1","01;03;02;22","01;03;09;27","Price Yeah. You want to add anything? Ah there's a few ways to go."
"Speaker 3","01;03;09;27","01;03;11;08","So I'm going to go ahead and take it away."
"Speaker 1","01;03;11;18","01;04;11;24","All right. Well, one interesting connection with active inference. You mentioned there's nested affordances is including ones that include that are plausible. So that reminded me a lot of the attention and metacognition as mental action, which we explored in Livestream 25 with Sanford Smith at ALS Paper, where the same way that at the kernel layer of the partially observable Markov decision process or however we're doing active modeling at the most basil kernel layer, those pies, those policy selections and those ease, those affordances have to do with the level of affordances that is embodied, like the actual actions that the eyes are taking in the ocular motor case or the actual direction that's taken left or right"
"Speaker 1","01;04;12;02","01;04;57;15","in a TMS example. And then nested modeling is using an analogous graphical structure where policies of nested levels reflect, attention being paid to various lower level, lower levels of that hierarchical architecture. So there could be one lever they can go left and right and one that can go up and down. And then there's a higher level decision like which of these two levers should I be paying attention to and how where am I of which left are I'm paying attention to and so on."
"Speaker 1","01;04;57;15","01;05;49;04","So I think the paper itself does not present any formal isms, but there's extensive linking to work in active inference and also to really resonate ideas that are in a non slash pre active inference framing that are immediately compatible like nested levels of affordances. The distinction between the primacy of the bodily affordances, but also for certain cognitive systems, the existence of what appear to be cognitive affordances and the desire to model those jointly, perhaps without taking on strong or specific baggage around how we are then constrained to think about the bodily or the cognitive aspects of that."
"Speaker 1","01;05;49;04","01;06;29;08","Modeling blew up. And then one other thought was on like shared action, including shared planning. So planning to act together and about how events or activity planning in the future is like an activity that one person can do or groups can do. But it's about preparing a context so that a process can occur. And sometimes all that's needed is to send the calendar events invite."
"Speaker 1","01;06;29;25","01;07;01;29","Other times there might need to be a lot of work to be done before the event itself. However, what is the transmission view on planning that might be able to describe? And I think the paper does an excellent job of saying that the transmission view is not refuted by the ecological and inactive angle. You said no transmission, no communication, no communication."
"Speaker 1","01;07;01;29","01;07;52;05","It's like it's an enabling aspect of this action orientation and this focus. Here's some other areas that we had written down from before. One I'm really curious to follow up on is about like language and maybe the role of our talking about these issues. What other media or formats have you found to be insightful? Do any and activists do presentations with silent films or with objects that are mailed to you and you play with or do this?"
"Speaker 1","01;07;52;22","01;08;13;12","I mean, how else can we point at the moon and not have it be confused that we're talking finger anatomy? Read me first. Dental."
"Speaker 4","01;08;13;12","01;08;51;05","Okay. Yeah, I think that that's that's hard to to to talk about academic subjects like this without having like an explicitly transmission view, like appearance of communication because this, these kind of interactions are so far from the basic interactive activities that were like the context of the evolution of communication, which is what I'm trying to to explain here."
"Speaker 4","01;08;51;13","01;09;30;10","It's not like you imagine like you imagine like a tribe somewhere in the in the place, the person and like they're they're they're not trying to explain academic subjects to each other. They're trying to do things, concrete things together. And that's really the context of where communication evolved and what it what purpose it served. But I think that it's hard to like envision the academic discussions such as that when we're I think now that would be like that would be more evidence toward the ecological view then for the transmission to do."
"Speaker 4","01;09;30;22","01;09;59;17","I don't know if that that's here, but clearly like moving your couch together is a better instance of and the communication that takes place in this joint activity is probably a better example of our view than like speaking together about active and friends and communication because this is really a specific and really highly complex form of social activity that is more, more readily described."
"Speaker 4","01;09;59;18","01;10;05;13","For instance, in terms of of the transmission view, I think."
"Speaker 1","01;10;05;13","01;10;10;01","Yeah, nice. A lot to say there. Blue."
"Speaker 3","01;10;10;01","01;10;36;08","So I think all of those things like even silent films are also representations, right? So whether it's a communication like with communication or even pointing to the moon would be like a well, maybe that would be different. I don't know. I like this idea of communication as an action that we take. And I'm not leaving information transmission behind in the dirt."
"Speaker 3","01;10;36;08","01;11;14;11","I don't think it I don't think it needs to go there. I think. But but I do think that all actions are in some way some kind of information transmission. So even like like and study theory of mind. So I assume you're familiar with integrated information theory and the emergent properties that information can help us to represent. And so I think like in some way even like eating food like tells the environment that you're hungry and, and takes away the food."
"Speaker 3","01;11;14;11","01;11;29;06","And so there's, there's always some level of informational exchange, even if it's just trivial information exchange, even if it's not meaningful, it doesn't create some bigger emergent thing, right."
"Speaker 1","01;11;29;06","01;11;35;13","Thanks, Blue Dean."
"Speaker 2","01;11;35;13","01;12;04;26","I think it's an easy again. I think it's it's I won't say it's easy. It's really did a good job of explaining this and not making it too obtuse. If you if you use an example of moving a couch, the physical manipulation, it's not hard to extend that to communication and symbolic anyplace in the manipulation stays then then that sort of reinforces the idea that there is there a process at hand, something that we can observe."
"Speaker 2","01;12;05;21","01;12;29;22","But I'm still kind of confused about. So once that the chair been lifted or the the words have come out of my I heard the expression because I was watching the John Bourbaki thing yesterday and something comes out of my mouth whole now. It's it's done. It's a product. I mean, we can read, we can read, submitted or reflect on it or whatever, but it's there."
"Speaker 2","01;12;30;05","01;13;02;21","It's now historical. And so that transition from process to product, I think, is something that the manipulation by itself doesn't explain, have to kind of delink and see the sort of timelessness aspect of this. Carl talks about deep temporal models, and so I don't know that I'm not sure how communication manipulation, symbolic manipulation gets explained in these deep chemical senses."
"Speaker 2","01;13;02;21","01;13;30;06","And I'm not just talking about chiseling chiseling it into the stones, the tablets. Right. Like there's got to be another piece to this that you've looked into. I mean, obviously much deeper than I have. What what what is your sense of that? Once we get past the manipulation, processing and start seeing the the products pile up?"
"Speaker 4","01;13;30;06","01;13;59;19","Yes. So, yeah, it's hard to answer this question, but that's true of everything. That is something that happens at some point. It's it's it's there and you can't change it. So any event, communicative or not, or like a rug that falls or something that does that property to know it's it once it happens, it's something to which we can go back."
"Speaker 4","01;13;59;19","01;14;31;23","And I don't know if that's so, so in the same sense that if you you talk to say something, this is something that that does happen and you can it's now a product and something to which you can allude to it has influenced the your cognitive system and then you can I I'm I struggled to to see what was the question exactly."
"Speaker 4","01;14;32;04","01;14;33;23","Well I don't know if that."
"Speaker 2","01;14;34;05","01;14;55;00","One of the things that you pointed to right at the very start of your paper was that what these symbols that have been manipulated now set down in this paper is not the end. It's the start of something. This product, this paper should be the start of a dialog or a trialogue or in case a quadra and it has become something."
"Speaker 2","01;14;55;05","01;15;19;23","Right. So so it's the back and forth part that I find really interesting. And it's something you spoke to very clearly at the very start of your paper. You didn't say, okay, so if we get stuck in the transmission, do when when I stop talking, that's it. That's over. And now we're going to start something else. No, you basically said there's a continuum aspect to this."
"Speaker 2","01;15;20;05","01;15;48;23","It isn't strictly episodic that we have to look at something more than just what Remi says, which I think is that it brilliant way to start a paper and an even better way to start a conversation. So so there is a product piece to this and there's a process piece to this. You put something down and and a child will start manipulating it and then they'll start manipulating the symbology that they're applying or actually getting associating with that."
"Speaker 2","01;15;49;06","01;16;15;16","So again you've looked at that far deeper than I have, obviously, because listen to how I ramble. Right. But I wondered what you're like. How do you take that transition piece now and hold it up to other people who may be taking an activist procedure or to take more of an instrumentalist approach? Right. Because the bottom line is, it's hard to deny that it's it's done or it's it's still happening."
"Speaker 2","01;16;15;28","01;16;21;03","But you focused on the it's still happening. So what are your thoughts."
"Speaker 4","01;16;21;03","01;16;53;11","Yeah, I think that there's with communication there's a sedimentation. The Paolo talks about this too like the symbol we use then the words that we speak there's like this. And then there's also talking about first all your first order language and second order language. And so first order language is like the flow, the dynamic where every interaction is new, everything is always like on fly and there's always a transformation of the linguistic forms that we use."
"Speaker 4","01;16;53;18","01;17;24;19","And the second order language is like the abstraction where we can say, Oh, that's the same word that has been used at the same sentence, that's the same meaning. And the second order language is like a and something that's added up and that's an abstraction that's something traditional linguistic has really focused on this second, second order language, which is like the product of language, which is like, okay, the language that, the language that we speak is a set of sentences, a set of words."
"Speaker 4","01;17;24;25","01;17;46;14","And that's something that that is identified at the level of the second order language. But when we're speaking where we're talking, it's not at this level that we're doing it. When we're acting, it's always new. We always reconfigure being, we always transforming. And it's only when we abstract from this, like, basic interaction and some patterns that we see."
"Speaker 4","01;17;46;14","01;18;22;26","Okay. And the second order at the second level, there is words, there's a syntax, there's some rules that are followed. But it's not the real phenomenon. Language, phenomenal language is the first order, and that's the idea. So maybe that's a way to see like the real activity is the reader process. But if we abstract, if we look back on this process and we analyze it and we abstract some parts of it, then we can see these forms emerging, these languages, these words that are used repetitively, and then we can apply the product of language."
"Speaker 4","01;18;23;01","01;18;48;02","But in truth, language is always the process and that's the shift the terminology called shift of not talking about language, but language in which is something that is that an activist working on language to try to do that's really brings forward this this notion of language is always an activity, always a process and not like a set of words instead of symbols that are used."
"Speaker 4","01;18;48;21","01;19;16;24","And these these analysis in terms of repeatable symbols is something that we get when we analyze it like after the fact. And we see these patterns that are that are used that we we get this thickened order. But when we are doing it at the fundamental level, it's really just that process of continual interaction. So that's maybe something to think about."
"Speaker 4","01;19;17;04","01;19;38;08","And there's something I want to say really quickly about Blue said about the information and the way in which information is always present and that that's true. That that's what I allude to at the end of the paper when I cite Brian's terms, when I say, yeah, there's always information transmission, right? Just moving in my environment, there's information that's transmitted."
"Speaker 4","01;19;38;12","01;20;08;07","But yeah, that's exactly the point. And that's the idea is that content is not information. Information is everywhere, everywhere, always. When we when anything happens in the environment, in the universe, there's information that is created as it transmitted. But the idea is that information understood in this in these terms and uncertainty reduction notion of information is not sufficient to explain communication because there's information all the way everywhere."
"Speaker 4","01;20;08;08","01;20;37;05","Does that the point that that that people who own the transmission that you think that they can rely on this notion of information to explain it to communication but it's not that strong and thus notion of information. They need the notion of content to explain what they want to explain because, for instance, the information that you think about when they eat, when they wave my arms like that, there is information because there is an exchange with my environment."
"Speaker 4","01;20;37;14","01;20;52;20","But that's not sufficient to explain communication because this information is everywhere and communication is not everywhere. It's a property of certain behaviors that we have to be more specific to analyze."
"Speaker 1","01;20;52;20","01;20;53;20","Thank you, Blue."
"Speaker 3","01;20;55;16","01;21;16;02","So the information has to have context, right? It has to have relevance for the communication, for the collective action, for the collaboration or something. So so there's no like in an order for a communication like that that's contextual. I don't know. Imposition needs to exist I think."
"Speaker 1","01;21;17;12","01;21;59;01","Yeah. Nice. So just a few notes. I really like this sedimentation of communication. It's a really rich, like riverbed or or rock formation, natural analogy. That's. That's concordant with the ecological perspective to reflect how the products of communication are indeed sequentially layered, the pen marks on the page can't be erased, can't undo what was said. We can't on record, we can't on transact, on the blockchain, all these different aspects and even including the scientific literature being appended to continually."
"Speaker 1","01;21;59;16","01;22;45;02","So there's a segmented aspect. Yet also there's something that is a process like the river that is depositing the sediment. And then that made me think about how sometimes communication is descriptive around what was or is. And this may map on to the variational free energy inference which is kind of like now casting or even retro casting. But once we enter into action mode and anticipatory or prospective informing and communicating, looking forward to reduce uncertainty of our actions."
"Speaker 1","01;22;45;02","01;23;39;28","Selection is vital for systems to persist and thrive. However, as we've explored in many discussions, sometimes from a really technical angle, the introduction of action into model selection and just modeling in general introduces several complexities how the space of possible is enumerated and scanned over. It's a simpler and a different question to do purely receptive inference on something about the past, but to inject one into the present and embody that present seeing requires one to act amidst uncertainty about what the future of the general process will be and the consequences of action, which are either slightly or almost entirely unknown so."
"Speaker 1","01;23;40;03","01;24;06;22","The introduction of action puts us into that realm of expected free energy and highlights all these really interesting dynamics and how the future is not the past. But it becomes that way. Like you get sediment ID, but this is the pre sedimentation. There's some dust molecules there right next to each other in the river. One of them is going to sediment, the other one's going to go out to the Pacific Ocean."
"Speaker 1","01;24;08;09","01;24;41;27","It may not be clear in that river which way the different particles are going to go. And so that's like where like all the complexity and turbulence can be happening. And so it's a very rich distinction and something to to really bring back about how the past is sediment did, but there's an openness in the action consideration and that's where planning as inference and joint action and shared attention, all these features come into play."
"Speaker 2","01;24;42;20","01;25;13;03","Dean Yeah. Daniel I don't know if your if indirectly referring back to the 47th series of the live stream, but there it was. We talked about was that people who have look through in an activist lens really make fantastic arguments about let's focus on process, let's focus on the process. Apologies if if you're talking about people who work in the instrumentalists, hopefully that'll get answered."
"Speaker 2","01;25;13;22","01;25;51;20","If you're talking about people walking in through the instrumentalist lens, they really to talk about product. They really want to say this is a tool and they argue fantastically for that. And I think what we tried to do in the 47 was say, you're both right, you both have fantastic arguments. As an agent who's trying to communicate, why would we say one is necessary like we're acting first, why if we're active and first, first and foremost, if we're always trying to scan and survey that field of affordances, why would we drop one for the other and less that was necessary?"
"Speaker 2","01;25;52;01","01;26;37;13","What isn't part of affordances? The the ability to option and be able to recognize the tool product and recognize the action in that moment carrying out that that data thread which we can now act further on. Is that a step Daniel said downstream. Right. So again, I don't think anybody would argue that activism and that ecological approach is hugely important in order to be able to generate those affordances and that maybe, maybe there's still people who want to argue no, if you just bring your toolkit, all of your all your your problems will suddenly dissolve."
"Speaker 2","01;26;37;18","01;27;03;00","Or if you just walk into the room, you'll know how to talk to all of these people without really developing that that sense of, okay, so as you said, first order and second order communication, right? You just walked into the room and then you reflect later. So the next time you walk into a room, maybe you you come at it a little differently each time."
"Speaker 2","01;27;03;00","01;27;28;13","Right? So, again, Daniel, I don't know if you were consciously or subconsciously referring back to the last livestream set, but that's essentially where I'm kind of that well, I've been there for a bit now, but I wonder how you can argue there can only be one if we're talking about affordances, if we're not talking about fine, it can be one."
"Speaker 2","01;27;28;16","01;27;36;20","But if we're talking about affordances and we're optioning out, how can it be less than two?"
"Speaker 1","01;27;36;20","01;28;03;23","The menu is not diminished by selecting what you want for that meal. You don't rip the rest of the menu and then also read one one. Just insight. I've never heard it phrase this way, but it's so interesting and hopefully as many people including us some directions is you said it's hard to discuss academic subjects without the transmission view and."
"Speaker 1","01;28;03;23","01;28;37;18","That's just such a fundamental point. One could take a sort of sociological critique of, academic discourse and, well, the practices and the networks of academics and the genres that they write in the venues and the paywalls and all of these different sociological features, structure, academic discourse to be such and such a way that can feel lifted from our first order experience."
"Speaker 1","01;28;38;16","01;29;24;23","And this actually takes an even more fundamental angle, which is, yes, those sociological features may be what is explained, but fundamentally on on that topic or anything, what is it about this conceptual or academic mode of synchronous and asynchronous discourse? Just what is it about? What is it on? And how can we evolve this and develop this to create an ecology of communicate and to integrate in a new way for Rémi first and then anyone."
"Speaker 4","01;29;24;23","01;29;57;04","So yeah, I think that the not just the academic discussions but all our conceptions of education and learning are influenced by this transmission view also because the, the traditional views of, of, of education is the notion that you transmit a certain knowledge, a certain view, a certain content to like the, the student, you're the teacher and you have this this content and you're giving it to the that's like the tradition, the traditional view of education."
"Speaker 4","01;29;57;10","01;30;29;27","And there there's been push back in recent years in the in the fields of communication and trying to understand education and apply more participative methods of learning that go against that. But really, the view of education as transmitting knowledge, I think is really closely connected to this transmission view of communication. And I think that's not a particularly good view of applying pedagogic pedagogic practices."
"Speaker 4","01;30;29;27","01;31;12;28","I think that's that's really limited. And there's been the advent it did for my for our paper in 2021 to do that. But yeah, there's been in recent years a lot of work in fields of education in trying to push back again this against this transmission view of education and trying to put like, yeah, I think classrooms that are more interactive and which there is, there's active learning from the from the students and they're just not just the receiving and knowledge, but they're gaining skills by acting in the in their in their in their and in an environment, a learning environment in which they're agents and not just patients."
"Speaker 4","01;31;12;28","01;31;18;07","So that's I think that's something that's also useful to to to to discuss."
"Speaker 1","01;31;19;20","01;32;05;08","Yes. We had some great times discussing instruction ism and interaction ism in the context of skillful performance and motor commands. And the discussion was, are you sending motor commands representational? Are they instructions to be carried out or are they interactions that are being engaged in that might not necessitate taking a representational list view? And in this same spirit and strength of the active inference framework that we can talk about patterns across systems here is instruction ism and interaction ism in a very natural setting of the ecological experience of learning."
"Speaker 1","01;32;06;01","01;32;33;19","And one can take various critiques or angles on like tabula rasa or blank slate. We don't need to endorse the view. However, what it implies quite directly is that there's a canvas and things are added sediment on the canvas, and one can see that some writing is on the canvas or it's a different shape, or those are specifying the metaphor."
"Speaker 1","01;32;34;01","01;33;06;23","But fundamentally the knowledge accretion model of education, the opt in model as, well as the ignorance destructive model of education, which is a kind of counterpoint to we're going to add good knowledge. And then the shadow that is we're going to destroy bad knowledge and unlearn. Both of those are like working in the riverbed. Are we going to sediment this way or let's modify these sediments."
"Speaker 1","01;33;07;14","01;33;43;18","It's still seeing the product of education, which is a totally reasonable focus for industries and sectors that are focused on the products of education, the products of education for the student, the certificate and the social recognition and status thereof, or just the outcomes of education for the system, like amount of people with a certain professional training and what is the river that is sediment thing or sediments that can get dropped."
"Speaker 1","01;33;44;09","01;34;24;17","And that's the active term in education learning by doing as if even a lecture is doing something, you're looking, you're hearing, you're touching. So it is quite an exciting area to explore how interaction ism in settings that have been considered educational, conventionally or unconventionally, what the implications are. And I'm sure that next week we'll be able to explore many more implications as we kind of have crested one hill and look towards some implications."
"Speaker 1","01;34;24;17","01;34;36;12","But how do you communicate differently with what you know and have done in philosophy and science of communication?"
"Speaker 4","01;34;37;29","01;35;16;17","Remmy I think I'm really bad at applying my theory of communication. I think I, I give a class in that to come and I, I always like I'm angry at myself because I really like just automatically applies this really classical way of, of, of transmitting knowledge. And I'm always angry at myself because I don't apply enough. I think my, my, my own ideas about communication."
"Speaker 4","01;35;16;26","01;35;27;08","But the I, I think I should do more to, to be a better, provide better evidence for my own theory of communication."
"Speaker 1","01;35;27;08","01;36;07;19","It's funny, I'm sure it'll be a lifelong process for all of us because we have priors that are templated on the forms that we know. That's what was and what is and what maybe and then there's that expected free energy like active communication perspective and are we going to select only from yesterday's menu? Or can new dishes and new approaches be added that we may want to select from?"
"Speaker 1","01;36;08;02","01;37;21;27","Are there new modalities or approaches to communication in educational settings or otherwise that are now authorized or enabled by this perspective? I'm sure we'll continue to discuss it. But let's just say this paper becomes a fundamental reading for a communications department or for early life learning group like a public school. What is different in the short term with the structural constraints and opportunities that exist with someone thinking and acting differently, and then over slower time scales, the coevolution of those individual affordances, cognitive and bodily affordances, and the kinds of systemic alterations to the education architecture, then I know you'll have a thought on that."
"Speaker 2","01;37;21;27","01;37;54;03","Part of what you were speaking to is just simply asking as as Remi did at the beginning of his paper, and then what happens? But then not racing to provide the answers. It's it's it's essentially opening. Opening up the space. And then and then what happens might mean that you you move out of the classroom and you and you take the classroom, migrates to to the lookout on Mount Royal or you or you you simply don't intervene."
"Speaker 2","01;37;54;12","01;38;22;26","You you kind of let the ecology work itself through. Now, that could be very scary at first because of course, you're supposed to be the one herding the cats. But if you let the herd piece of it off and see what cats do when you're allowed to sort of free think, I think I don't know that it provides the the absolute specific answer, but it will provide you that joint action opportunity."
"Speaker 2","01;38;23;08","01;38;47;03","If you're if you're really, truly looking for affordances as opposed to specifics. And and again, I think even in an academic setting, I don't think it's I don't think it's too far of a stretch to say affordances matter. And we would like to see if people can exercise those things. We just want to get to crazy, right."
"Speaker 1","01;38;51;08","01;39;37;03","Norms and guidelines for affordances help. Don't know what else to say, but certainly there are things that one would prefer not to see occur in a learning setting. Right. Easy to enumerate. And then there are the known beneficial affordances or phenomena and then part of interaction ism seems to leave the unknown unknown quadrants open and to allow for individual or for collective outcomes that are surprising and maybe not explicitly navigated towards or planned for."
"Speaker 1","01;39;37;03","01;40;24;18","But how to leave the unknown unknowns open while derisking unknowns and knowns is a challenge. And so again, it's natural to see where in the de-risking imperative we de-risk everything. And that introduces like second order risks. And it closes the door on what may have even been the purpose. I mean, what's the safest car, the one that doesn't move in that one limited local optimization of like reducing the number of high speed collisions or something like that?"
"Speaker 1","01;40;24;18","01;40;27;10","Yes, Remmy."
"Speaker 4","01;40;27;10","01;41;05;11","And so on that topic, I think there's Bloomberg in the world and give us time to talk about an optimal grip on the field of. I didn't see it, I think, but their work was a great, inspiring inspiration for for my own work. So they talk about an optimal grip on the on that field of affordances. And there's like you're always trying to stay in the point where you're there is like the relevant affordances are open to you, but you stay, you stay at the same time open to switching to other F audiences."
"Speaker 4","01;41;05;19","01;41;27;02","And you're trying to, in that process of interaction with your field of affordances, continually minimize your own free in there in G. But there is there's risk in that. So there's the idea that the example that they give is the boxer who was trying to maintain a certain distance to its opponent, because at that distance it's the boxer is fighter."
"Speaker 4","01;41;27;07","01;42;01;17","It cannot reach with its punches. If it's too close, maybe there's less impact and maybe it's more open to it to be in it. So there's like this optimal distance to which the boxer as light, flexible and multiple opportunities that it can the boxer can take. And I think that's what we were always trying to do. We're trying to get to this optimal grip, as did the field of affordances in which there's multiple affordances, that forward energy minimization, and that we want to take that."
"Speaker 4","01;42;01;17","01;42;29;06","And that's obviously something that can be hard to do. But we have through our skillful interaction with the environment, we learn these kinds of of gradients. Where should we go in the in our environment in order to find these optimal groups? And like you're speaking about car, I guess depending on your skill, you might want different car to get this optimal grip on the on the, on the road."
"Speaker 4","01;42;29;06","01;42;50;29","If you're like a fast driver who likes to go go really fast, you might want a faster car. But if you go too far and you're getting an accident, so there's depending on our skills, there's different optimal grips on the road feel develop audience and something was really afraid to go might go with it like really slow car and that would be it's that person's optimal grip on the road."
"Speaker 4","01;42;50;29","01;42;58;05","That would be the this would provide for for this person. So that made me think about that."
"Speaker 1","01;42;59;29","01;43;37;22","So some comments on optimal grip. Thanks for bringing in yellow all work it's it's really nice that that was brought in even several years ago into the active inference literature and if we're imagining tactile grip actual prevention if we're not in a grip strength competition where one might just monotonically prefer more grip, if we were like on a playgrounds and we're going to be swinging among bars, then the optimal grip has to satisfy being able to keep us off the hot lava."
"Speaker 1","01;43;38;05","01;44;05;14","But also it's not permanent. And there's like a level of engagement that is not as strong as we could possibly grasp, but gets the job done, keeps us in the air, and lets us easily and without repetitive stress, like grab the next bar. So how might that be reflected in some of the formal isms of active inference? While for expected and variational free energy, there are two terms."
"Speaker 1","01;44;05;14","01;44;35;29","One is reflecting a divergence minimization and one is keeping the door open with about future outcomes. So in that balance is like the divergence minimization of the boxer. But then also there is something about keeping it open and then it makes me wonder about optimal grip with some of these educational and academic ideas. What is the optimal in a given context of thermodynamics?"
"Speaker 1","01;44;36;25","01;45;20;24","Could it be the optimal grip in a easygoing chill, qualitative conversation to know that thermodynamics has to do with things like temperature? And now we're going to talk about something adjacent to it. That was just one bar on the playground to jump among. And so what does optimal grip and feel like and what are the ecologies that support different individuals, optimal grip on different concepts so that people can be engaging and interacting in a way that is natural and and seamless for them."
"Speaker 1","01;45;21;19","01;45;22;05","Yeah. Remi."
"Speaker 4","01;45;23;13","01;45;51;22","I think there's a case where did that usually to get to talking about the tactile grips there can be an optimal grip in in that sense. And I think in the communicative context, we can also see, for instance, the the case where we're in that we talked about example of moving furniture together. There is this this optimal grip where, okay, you're holding the couch and you can feel it slipping sometimes and you're like, oh dear, I must get a better grip."
"Speaker 4","01;45;51;28","01;46;20;28","But in that case, you have an interactive component and you have a communicative component because you can see when you're feeling your grip slips, you can see stuff to the other person, to okay, so to the other person can stop moving and then you can get a better grip on the on the couch. So this aspect that the idea that we tried to to put in in the paper when we were talking about cooperative communication is that there can be an optimal grip from a collective, from an interactive perspective."
"Speaker 4","01;46;21;04","01;46;54;15","And communication is a way of achieving that, of achieving an optimal grip by a group of individuals under under the context of their their joint action. And so, for example, if I'm moving a couch with somebody and I feel my grip slipping, I can say, oh, stop, because it will it will stop the couch from moving, and then it will help me get a better grip in the literal and figurative sense on the couch so that we can further advance our joint action of moving that couch."
"Speaker 1","01;46;54;15","01;46;55;07","Thank you, Blue."
"Speaker 3","01;46;57;21","01;47;32;22","So something else like where is an interesting place where we have grip, where we don't always think about it is in the in the mental capacity. So like when you talk about overthinking so like you think something you can under think underprepared and then you can also overthink. So there's also this optimal space. And just as a practitioner of meditation for a long time, when you're meditating on something, it's the same, so like it's like this over focus, like you have to hold it there, the object of your meditation."
"Speaker 3","01;47;32;22","01;47;48;21","But like if you squeeze too tight, like if you focus on it too intently goes away, it pops up. And lots of things are like, I mean, even if you literally grip something, if you squeeze it too tight, it will pop out of your hand. Just that the force and the philosopher's acts make it that way. So I just wanted to bring that up."
"Speaker 1","01;47;49;24","01;48;34;04","Thank you. Blue one. No, on the couch moving example. It's quickly become our favorite example. We should definitely do some visuals next time. It's it's an interesting example because the communication candy representational and linguistic, we don't have enough room for my right hand to come through this doorway. It's very transmission view compatible, but also there's a direct, continuous time communication through the mechanics of the couch that are synchronously being experienced in real time and mediated through artifacts and through the niche itself."
"Speaker 1","01;48;35;13","01;49;36;14","Linguistic communication has a linear, sequential and turn taking aspect. Active listening is a practice that from the point of view of the active listener, whether they speak or not, brings that real time and continuous engagement to the discourse. Even if they're listening to a recording or whether they're participating or listening in a conversation. However it, feels like something really important to unpack as we look towards the linguistic direction to differentiate settings where like through digital stigma g and note taking or through physical objects like a rowing team or the moving the couch, there's a mediation through the environments continuously as opposed to something like a correspondence chess game or a phone call where there's a"
"Speaker 1","01;49;36;14","01;49;48;19","linear turn taking sedimentation, even though there may still be a continuous unfolding of experience for the agents. So that is a very rich area to look at."
"Speaker 2","01;49;49;00","01;50;13;22","Dean Yeah, you're just you're jumping in and saying things that I want to say. So obviously the some sort of substantive simpatico is going on communication wise. But I was going to say, I was going to kind of now I'm going to build off what you said and what you said. One of the things that we used to always bring to people's attention in terms of their field of affordances, that when you're having to explain something, you have to take your time."
"Speaker 2","01;50;14;25","01;50;46;20","You have to slow down. I was working with younger people. You have to slow down. But the also the other part of it is you have to know when to hit the hand up reaction button in the zoom call. You have to time your take for full effect. So you have to know both of those relativities when we're talking about communication because if you are, you can show your passion by constantly interrupting another person and actually do yourself a disfavor."
"Speaker 2","01;50;47;10","01;51;12;08","So the first thing was always slow down. The second thing was always think about when you're putting up your hand, think about when it's your turn. Allow sometimes for there to be a pregnant pause. I know Daniel's very gifted at this. There's lots and lots of times as the moderator, he could just fill in the space. But he's really, really good at sometimes letting the communication happen when nothing is said."
"Speaker 2","01;51;12;08","01;51;36;13","So I'm going back to what he was asking earlier is can we signal something by not saying something? And I didn't jump in then, but I was kind of hoping to be able to explain that before we have to sign off today, because that's a perfect example of actually doing the signaling without manipulating the symbols per se."
"Speaker 1","01;51;36;13","01;51;45;02","Interesting stuff. Does anyone have any final thoughts in this one? Yes, please. Renny."
"Speaker 4","01;51;45;25","01;52;14;02","Yeah. Just quickly, the the the idea that there's like a still in the when to intervene speak too much speak not enough. It's it's like this the dimension that went through what is called pragmatics in in in linguistics. And there's a really clear of the notion of an optimal grip. Again, in terms of distance, there's not an appropriate distance to which you you must send to your interlocutor."
"Speaker 4","01;52;14;02","01;52;40;08","And that varies in function of culture. So if you're really so it's in some culture and some for some person it can be like really close to you and your income for public for but for them it might be their, their optimal grip in this communicative interaction for their for others. Maybe your, your, you must be faster. But then if you're too far, then you might you're bad less, less and less good understanding of what this person is saying."
"Speaker 4","01;52;40;16","01;52;51;01","So there's this optimal group also in the pragmatics of the interaction that yes, I think that was a good point."
"Speaker 1","01;52;51;01","01;53;25;21","Optimal grip in space and time and meaning, many spaces for. A conversation. Are you intimately familiar and perturbing and six inches away or are you yelling purely strategic, impersonal information from across the fields? A lot of different ecologies, a lot of different agents. So a lot of different communications, blue or green, if you have any other thoughts otherwise."
"Speaker 1","01;53;25;21","01;53;40;04","That brings us to a very nice end of 48 one, and I'm sure it'll be a great discussion to continue next week."
"Speaker 3","01;53;40;04","01;53;48;08","Thanks for providing us with such beefy, juicy stuff to talk about. I really enjoyed the paper having you here. It's great."
"Speaker 2","01;53;50;06","01;54;10;22","Thank you. Completely concur. Review is a fantastic paper and as I said, there's nothing that I find more intriguing when somebody writes something down not as providing all the answers, but as opening up all all these questions that we've been able to share today. So I'm very I'm very happy that you were able to join us."
"Speaker 1","01;54;12;09","01;54;16;11","All right. Thank you all. See you next week."
