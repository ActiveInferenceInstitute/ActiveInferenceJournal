00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:30,330
FRIEDMAN: All right.

2
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,564
Welcome, everyone.

3
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:34,734
It is September 7th, 2022.

4
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,103
We're here in ActInf Livestream

5
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,072
number 48.1.

6
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,440
In the second discussion

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,142
on the paper, "Communication

8
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,544
as Socially Extended Active Inference:

9
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,845
An Ecological Approach

10
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:48,381
to Communicative Behavior."

11
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:50,417
Welcome to the Active Inference

12
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,484
Institute,

13
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,653
where we are a participatory

14
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:54,821
online institute

15
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:55,889
that is communicating,

16
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,390
learning and practicing

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,192
applied active inference.

18
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:00,293
This is a recorded

19
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:01,861
and an Archived livestream,

20
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:02,362
so please

21
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:03,363
provide us with feedback

22
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,565
so we can improve our work.

23
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,499
All backgrounds

24
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,368
and perspectives are welcome

25
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,836
and we'll be following

26
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:12,705
video etiquette for the livestream.

27
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,674
Head over to active inference

28
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:15,608
dot org

29
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:15,975
to learn

30
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:18,378
more about getting involved in different

31
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:19,212
learning groups

32
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,849
and projects at the Institute.

33
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:27,253
Well, we're here in stream number 48.1,

34
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,656
continuing our discussion

35
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,792
on communication, active inference,

36
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,894
ecological approaches and so on.

37
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,564
This is going to be a

38
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,265
really exciting discussion

39
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,500
and we're appreciative

40
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,403
of the first author joining us.

41
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:44,971
We'll jump

42
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:48,174
right in with some introductions

43
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:50,343
and then onto the discussion.

44
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:51,744
So if you're watching live, feel

45
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:52,412
free to write

46
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:55,482
any questions in the live chat.

47
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,317
And I know that on our side

48
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,352
we have a lot of things to explore.

49
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,453
And also,

50
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:00,854
of course,

51
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:01,421
looking forward

52
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,089
to learning more

53
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,691
and seeing where it goes.

54
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,292
So I'm Daniel.

55
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,461
I'm a researcher in California.

56
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,195
And I guess

57
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:12,031
the ecosystem of today is chaparral

58
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:15,301
because it's very warm where I am.

59
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:16,302
And so

60
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,271
I was thinking about how different

61
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,940
ecosystems and eco tones

62
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,609
might facilitate

63
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,911
different kinds of communication

64
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,913
in a regional way.

65
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:30,350
And I'll pass it to Dean.

66
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,484
TICKLES: I, I'm Dean.

67
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,486
I'm in the Rocky Mountains in

68
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,788
western Canada right now. And

69
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,891
it's it's

70
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,325
what we would do in Fahrenheit.

71
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,393
It's about

72
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,362
45 Fahrenheit this morning,

73
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,530
but it's going to work from up

74
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,164
to about 90.

75
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:44,898
So,

76
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,533
yeah, there's a bit of an ecology

77
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,902
going on around here, too.

78
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,103
I think

79
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,237
it's going to be

80
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,338
a really interesting day

81
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,574
because I think what we're going to do

82
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,809
is take this ecological approach

83
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:00,780
and lens and with

84
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,382
the background of everybody

85
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,516
here, we're going to really be able

86
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,418
to pull up a lot of different,

87
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,253
interesting things that otherwise

88
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,922
we would not pay attention to

89
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,190
if we only got

90
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,691
stuck on the transmission piece.

91
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:15,428
And I'll pass it down to Bleu.

92
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,130
KNIGHT: Hi, I'm Bleu.

93
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,633
I am a researcher in Sunny, beautiful

94
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:21,201
New Mexico

95
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,102
at the other end of the Rocky Mountains

96
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:23,836
from Dean.

97
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:24,437
Like, literally,

98
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:25,672
if you just go straight down, I'm

99
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,473
in the century to Christmas

100
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:30,443
and we are recovering here from a like

101
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,111
torrential summer of rain.

102
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:33,513
And I

103
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:33,980
think we're

104
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,281
I think like maybe

105
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,317
we're finally getting back to some sun.

106
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,985
It's starting to get hot now,

107
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,186
like finally.

108
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,222
So I think that the sun is is here

109
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,456
to stay for.

110
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:44,424
We still have a hot month,

111
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:45,124
I guess,

112
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:46,826
but the desert ecosystem

113
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:50,129
and the to our desert is special

114
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:53,566
and fun and always excites me.

115
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,768
And I'm interested to in this paper

116
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,103
and in

117
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,173
how it more applies broadly the

118
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,174
the communication

119
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,142
as compared to the vassal paper

120
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:07,347
like can we then apply it to animals

121
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,515
and also to like

122
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,784
maybe human animal interactions

123
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,687
and what those look like and maybe

124
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,757
not only cooperative communication

125
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,260
but also like competitive communication.

126
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,660
And I think,

127
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,060
I think

128
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,429
like extending this work into

129
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,931
those avenues is

130
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,266
interesting and exciting.

131
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:28,801
FRIEDMAN: Awesome.

132
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:29,869
Thank you, Bleu.

133
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,273
So, Remi, welcome and please

134
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:33,840
take it away.

135
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,208
Feel free to introduce yourself

136
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,543
and give any context on the paper.

137
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,413
TISON: All right. So thank you for having me.

138
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,482
I'm really pleased to see that

139
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,752
we will discuss our paper.

140
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:49,355
I'm Remi Tison. I'm a researcher

141
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,091
based in Montreal at UConn

142
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,894
and yeah, it's

143
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,763
it's sunny it's a nice day you're too.

144
00:04:56,763 --> 00:05:00,300
And so yes

145
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,702
the paper was

146
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,140
an attempt to

147
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:10,109
to device a view of communication

148
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:13,646
that could be like a starting point

149
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,483
for ecological and in active approaches

150
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,452
to language and communication.

151
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,322
And the problem that we saw

152
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,657
is that in most

153
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,195
language sciences, like linguistics,

154
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,031
in the field of language,

155
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,566
in mainstream philosophy, in language

156
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,702
and in biology of communication,

157
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,136
most researchers,

158
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:40,473
most people end up at IQ automatically

159
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,241
a view of communication

160
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,243
in which communication is

161
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,112
essentially transmitting

162
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,682
information or transmission,

163
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,950
transmitting content

164
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,586
or an idea to another being.

165
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:54,387
So

166
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,322
usually like

167
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,990
in linguistic communication,

168
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,624
that would be like,

169
00:05:58,624 --> 00:05:59,625
I have the belief

170
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,894
that it's a sunny day outside.

171
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:04,831
I say it's a sunny day outside.

172
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,766
And then by doing this,

173
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,568
I am transmitting to you

174
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:09,302
the belief

175
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,304
that it's a sunny day outside.

176
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,271
So that's the

177
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,073
basic view of communication,

178
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,174
the transmission view

179
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,142
that is

180
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,411
more or less adopted by everybody

181
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,248
in in linguistics and in

182
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,616
cognitive science.

183
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,418
But a lot of people at least,

184
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,153
and that's a view of communication

185
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,755
that is problematic

186
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:29,822
from an active

187
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,791
and ecological perspective

188
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,194
because it relies on the notion

189
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,162
of content

190
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,297
and the notion of representation

191
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,133
to transmit a content,

192
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,201
I must have a representation in my head

193
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,204
and then I can transmit it to you

194
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:46,439
so that you can entertain

195
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,274
this representation in your head.

196
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,743
But as is quite well known

197
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,346
in active and ecological approaches

198
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,547
to cognition,

199
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,983
I reject the notion of representation,

200
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:57,383
the notion,

201
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,551
the notion of content

202
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,521
as basic building block of cognition.

203
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,590
So the transmission view is a problem

204
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,959
from an active ecological view.

205
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,326
And so

206
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:08,161
what we tried to do

207
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,531
was to develop a view of communication

208
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,466
from which ecological

209
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,967
and active approaches

210
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:18,504
could start to understand language

211
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,974
and communication without having to rely

212
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,876
on the notion of content

213
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,111
or representation.

214
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:25,711
So that's like

215
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,080
the basic motivation of the paper.

216
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,750
That's what we were trying to do

217
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,552
and we thought that

218
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,188
active and friends and

219
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,622
especially its ecology

220
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,158
interpretation could be useful

221
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,060
for doing that.

222
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,161
And,

223
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,196
and yet

224
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,531
the thing that you mentioned, Bleu.

225
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:46,432
Yeah,

226
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,368
the aim was to devise

227
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,937
a view of communication

228
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,472
that could be perfectly general,

229
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,574
so that could be applied to

230
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:55,942
animal communication,

231
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,543
maybe communication

232
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:58,945
between cells at the, at,

233
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,947
the, at the more,

234
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,115
at the more small scale level

235
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,317
and eventually

236
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,318
maybe communication

237
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,652
between groups

238
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:10,189
at the more at a larger scale so that

239
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,924
the view to

240
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:12,425
the attempt

241
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,927
was to produce a view of communication

242
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,529
that is perfectly general

243
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,365
and that can be precise and

244
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,200
along the way.

245
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,768
So that we can, for instance,

246
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,204
precise the conception of communication

247
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:25,972
to apply it

248
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,140
to cooperative communication,

249
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,708
for instance,

250
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,510
which is the kind of communication

251
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,712
that is characteristic of human

252
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,180
communicative interaction,

253
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,882
and that was treated

254
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,618
notably in the cell paper to which you

255
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,219
alluded to.

256
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,755
So that's the aim of the paper.

257
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,157
And so because of its generality,

258
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,159
it's the paper that is really

259
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,896
in a way superficial because

260
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,230
it's it really treats

261
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,699
a lot of topics really quickly.

262
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,467
But that was like

263
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,868
a big road map

264
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,037
for a view of communication

265
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:58,971
that could be used

266
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:02,041
by ecological and active researchers.

267
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,242
So that was essentially

268
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:06,078
what we tried to do in this paper.

269
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:07,179
FRIEDMAN: Awesome.

270
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,383
And just one more follow up question.

271
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,752
We often asked would be,

272
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,187
how did you come to use

273
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,989
active inference?

274
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,258
What about the collaboration

275
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,493
or your direction

276
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:24,263
led to the fusion of these approaches?

277
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:24,997
Where you studying

278
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,265
communication more broadly

279
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:27,099
and came across

280
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,869
active inference or vice versa?

281
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:30,269
TISON: Yeah.

282
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:34,073
So earlier in my in my academic career,

283
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:34,473
so to speak,

284
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:35,908
I was really more in

285
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,343
Philadelphia of mind

286
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:37,910
to have more

287
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,445
of a philosophical background

288
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,981
and not really in cognitive science.

289
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,483
So that's where I became acquainted with

290
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,452
like issues, about content,

291
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,120
about meaning, etc..

292
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,956
And then I came to

293
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,124
Cam worked with quality,

294
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,593
which is really more center

295
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,293
than philosophy

296
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,428
of cognitive science

297
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,931
and was really interested in predictive

298
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,466
processing theories

299
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,035
and eventually in active inference

300
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:04,870
framework

301
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,538
because of its

302
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,707
link with predictive processing.

303
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,842
So coming at you can with well,

304
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:13,145
I really became acquainted with these,

305
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,082
with these ideas, with these frameworks

306
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:19,452
and that's where I linked these,

307
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:20,720
these new frameworks

308
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,021
with my earlier interests

309
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,757
in language and communication that came

310
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,459
from my background

311
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,693
in philosophy of mind.

312
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,895
So that's kind of how it happened.

313
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:33,532
And talking with Clive and the community

314
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,568
of researchers at Education

315
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:36,435
who is

316
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,205
really using the predictive processing

317
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,273
and active inference frameworks,

318
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:46,112
and that's how it all came together.

319
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,347
FRIEDMAN: Awesome. Well,

320
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,583
many places to pick up, perhaps,

321
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:55,154
Dean, first, if you'd like to.

322
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:55,921
TICKLES: Well, okay,

323
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,223
I'll start with the question.

324
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,225
If I'm if we're going to

325
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,827
if we're going to take an an activist

326
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,695
approach to this,

327
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,964
we're going to look at at

328
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,100
what communication is

329
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,270
through that philosophical approach and

330
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:15,374
and take all that active inference

331
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,777
affords in terms of of opening up

332
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,180
what communication is,

333
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:21,847
maybe.

334
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:22,148
I mean,

335
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,249
could you talk a little bit

336
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,785
about how people who

337
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:30,523
want to argue that there is no content?

338
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,558
What, how then what,

339
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,827
how could we then describe

340
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,028
our experiences,

341
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,431
the things that we've played out,

342
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:39,732
the things

343
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,535
that we're going to play towards?

344
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,737
But mostly what I'm curious about is

345
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,305
the things that have been played,

346
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:47,606
because we've got a record of that.

347
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,142
We don't have to call it content.

348
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,811
But I've had a lot of conversations

349
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:52,545
with a lot of people

350
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,647
who live in the in activist

351
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,683
thinking community, and they

352
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,385
they come up,

353
00:11:59,385 --> 00:11:59,852
they twist

354
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:00,753
a whole bunch of things around,

355
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,655
but they really have a hard time

356
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,990
coming up with an argument that says,

357
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:06,926
my experiences

358
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,530
aren't something, some thing.

359
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,065
So maybe you could talk

360
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,035
a little bit about the.

361
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,270
TISON: Yeah, so that's a good question.

362
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,740
I think that's one of the answers

363
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,507
that I could provide

364
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:26,946
is that from my perspective,

365
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,948
there are some people in ecological

366
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,616
and active

367
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:33,719
circles who refuse all reference

368
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:34,353
to content.

369
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,422
This content doesn't exist at all.

370
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,457
But that's not my perspective.

371
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:42,194
From my perspective, content is just not

372
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,264
at the basic level of cognition.

373
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,966
And it's like

374
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:47,566
it's kind of

375
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:47,900
I don't know

376
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,634
if you're familiar

377
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,570
with the work of Hutto and Mayan.

378
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,205
There are

379
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,441
these are radical and activists,

380
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,108
and they claim

381
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,612
that their content is not like

382
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,647
at the fundamental level, it's

383
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,516
something that gets added up

384
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,218
once there are a particular kind

385
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,587
of social normative practices

386
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,923
that can give rise to content.

387
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,291
So that that's my view.

388
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,860
I think that we can describe the basic

389
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,529
cognitive functioning

390
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,797
of organisms

391
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,300
and animals and in many cases humans

392
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,170
without the use of the notion of content

393
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,071
of the notion of representation.

394
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,573
I think that we can do that.

395
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:32,077
But at some point in our in our

396
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,181
in our social interactions,

397
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:38,284
there are multiple things that

398
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:39,985
that

399
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,321
that can

400
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,090
happen that will give rise

401
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,961
to a content to representation.

402
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,130
And that's that's a complicated story.

403
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,298
That's something

404
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:55,434
that I might come back to later on.

405
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,003
But the idea is that content is not

406
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,040
at the basic level.

407
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,574
It's not something

408
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,209
that we can presuppose

409
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,311
in a theory of communication

410
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,479
and something that can be explained

411
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,281
by a theory of communication.

412
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,250
But it's not something that is

413
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,351
that can be taken

414
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,354
as something that can explain.

415
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,890
It's something that has to be explained,

416
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,357
so to speak.

417
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,025
I don't know if I'm clear

418
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,493
so we can,

419
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,462
I think, use the notion of content

420
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:24,296
to characterize

421
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,432
the kind of experience, the kind of

422
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:29,568
phenomena that you allude to, but

423
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,238
this notion must be

424
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,173
it must not be taken as granted.

425
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,508
That's that the view that I take.

426
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,878
And I think there are some ways

427
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,580
to explain how content

428
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,849
arrives on the scene, but

429
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:45,417
it's not

430
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,852
something that can be taken

431
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,520
as granted in a theory

432
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,321
area of communication.

433
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:49,788
And that's what

434
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,023
I'm critiquing in this paper.

435
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:51,757
It's like

436
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,926
in traditional transmission view

437
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,794
of communication,

438
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,196
people, principles,

439
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,330
that there is content,

440
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,565
that there is representation,

441
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,767
and communication is defined

442
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:02,835
as the transmitting

443
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,937
of this content, of this representation.

444
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,872
What I'm saying is that

445
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:09,975
representation is not an explosion,

446
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:10,576
something that

447
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,610
that can be used

448
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,047
as this based all explanatory notion.

449
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,616
It's something we have to

450
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:18,817
describe communication

451
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,719
without the use of this notion

452
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,355
and then with various tools

453
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,291
of social interaction

454
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,226
and particularly social

455
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,661
normative practices,

456
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,629
we can explain out there

457
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,732
that our content can then arise

458
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,600
so that that's

459
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,200
I can

460
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,168
if you want to

461
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:37,770
give more detail on that front.

462
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,572
But that's my, my, my $0.02. So

463
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,975
content exists.

464
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,243
It's not just

465
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:49,048
at the basic level of communication.

466
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:49,982
FRIEDMAN: Awesome.

467
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,550
That reminds me of

468
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,752
and to to stay on our philosophy

469
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:55,754
wavelength.

470
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,256
The difference between the explaining

471
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,792
and them and the exponents.

472
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,093
So just quoting Wikipedia

473
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:01,760
and explanation

474
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,761
them is a sentence

475
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:03,862
describing a phenomena

476
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,698
that is to be explained,

477
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:06,832
and the explanations are

478
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:07,466
the sentences

479
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,033
are adduced

480
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:10,235
as explanations of that phenomena.

481
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,572
And so it's a very interesting

482
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,407
difference

483
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,276
among these theoretical views

484
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,110
and framings,

485
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:18,610
which I'm

486
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,346
sure we'll be able to unpack

487
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:23,983
a lot of implications of that content

488
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,317
as a phenomena

489
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,852
or a descriptive category

490
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,320
sign or symbol.

491
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,455
We can have many ways

492
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,623
of even describing what that is.

493
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,859
However, under the transmission view,

494
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,127
you're suggesting

495
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,261
that content is seen

496
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,964
as what is able to explain

497
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,167
different phenomena like communication

498
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,435
or cooperative communication,

499
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:46,538
no matter how far out you go in the sub

500
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,341
discussions, content is doing something

501
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,642
to explain.

502
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:53,512
Whereas in the radical

503
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,381
and activist approach,

504
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,549
radical meaning from the root.

505
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,585
So with an activism at the root,

506
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:01,387
that doesn't mean

507
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,689
that there couldn't be a branch

508
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,125
that summarizes and reflects content,

509
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,027
but it's something that is explained

510
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,262
through an active means

511
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,230
rather than something

512
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,097
that we're going

513
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:14,767
to put like the cart before the horse

514
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,203
and then use this semantic content

515
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,638
representation view

516
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,707
and the transmission associated with it

517
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,977
to then try to explain in activism.

518
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,111
TICKLES: Deem

519
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,548
Yeah, I think I,

520
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,850
I'm, I'm on the same page

521
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,551
as both of you.

522
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:36,989
I, I take an example and in 2019 I'm

523
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,323
walking up

524
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,858
the street, Rue Saint Tony,

525
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,061
and I'm heading to the patisserie

526
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,296
and I don't have any first

527
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,065
hand experience with that,

528
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,966
but once I arrive there

529
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,035
and I one of those, those chocolate

530
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,238
pastries, now all of

531
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,840
a sudden I have content.

532
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,076
So it wasn't that I had content first,

533
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,445
even when I was looking at the map

534
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,947
and walking up from UK and

535
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,449
past all the bars and

536
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,884
and on a beautiful fall day,

537
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,586
I had the content once

538
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,589
I experienced something first.

539
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,292
But I also can't deny

540
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,561
that there was an aspect of that

541
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,964
that wasn't limited just to the moment

542
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,999
of all of the actions that I took

543
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,901
walking up the street.

544
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:23,936
So

545
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,605
if we're going to look at an ecology

546
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,841
and as I said in my first question,

547
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,142
if we're going to use

548
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,111
active inference as the lens,

549
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:36,248
the situational analysis method,

550
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,986
I don't know how we can draw up content,

551
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,589
but I do think the timing of when we

552
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,692
see it as the important thing or the

553
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,594
the central aspect

554
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,529
of what communication is,

555
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,463
I don't think it

556
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,798
I don't think it

557
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,767
destroys the fact that we still have it.

558
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:56,502
It's just

559
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,203
when does it matter

560
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,139
in that in that continuum.

561
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,473
So yeah.

562
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,374
And by the way, thank you

563
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,309
for just reminding me of that.

564
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:08,280
That trip in to Montreal in 2019 before

565
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,148
all the

566
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,083
tech broke loose with all these viral

567
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,151
things, was beautiful.

568
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,653
Time.

569
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,523
FRIEDMAN: I also went to Montreal in 2019.

570
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:18,190
Very cool to.

571
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,161
KNIGHT: Yeah.

572
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,296
I am curious

573
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,931
about the difference between

574
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,733
or maybe there's no difference

575
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:30,602
or how can we

576
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,472
clarify the difference between content

577
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:40,179
and context?

578
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,181
FRIEDMAN: Yes, great question.

579
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,083
What do you think for me?

580
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:49,054
TISON: Okay, so content is

581
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,123
essentially

582
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:54,326
something that as accuracy conditions.

583
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,496
So the idea of content is it's

584
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,632
something that can be false or true.

585
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,769
It's something that can be or more

586
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:04,570
generally something

587
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,872
that can be satisfied or not satisfied.

588
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:07,940
So for instance,

589
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,474
usually we'll say that

590
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,843
our propositional attitude of content.

591
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:14,046
So for instance, when I have a belief,

592
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,049
my belief as a content

593
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,052
and this content can be true or false

594
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,453
or for instance,

595
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,522
if I believe that it's sunny outside,

596
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,991
I have the belief that it is

597
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,759
sunny outside in the content,

598
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,860
it is sunny outside.

599
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,596
It can be true or false

600
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,497
and it's sunny outside

601
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,199
that then my my belief is true.

602
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,101
So that's the basic idea of content.

603
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,769
It's something that is attached to

604
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,271
our mental states

605
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:42,774
and it's usually associated associated

606
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,343
with the notion of representations.

607
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,143
There are

608
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,045
complex debates to be out there,

609
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:48,614
but that's the idea of content.

610
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,415
It's something that it's like.

611
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,250
It's like,

612
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,150
yeah, something

613
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,884
that as

614
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,353
conditions of correction

615
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,722
in which it can be correct or incorrect.

616
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,658
And so that's content and context

617
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:01,526
in in the

618
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,528
I don't know if you

619
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:04,396
mean in general

620
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,764
or in the specific way

621
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,900
in which we use it in the paper.

622
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,301
KNIGHT: So

623
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,271
how you use it in the paper?

624
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:12,671
TISON: Yeah.

625
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:16,675
So context is a set of elements

626
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,512
that are relevant to the and

627
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,715
to the, to a joint action.

628
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,118
So that's how we use it. A context.

629
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,587
A context of action

630
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:29,688
in particular in the paper

631
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,323
we're talking about joint action.

632
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,458
So when two people or more people

633
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,093
are performing a joint action,

634
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,828
they're doing something together.

635
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,897
There are going to be some elements,

636
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:39,998
some events,

637
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,000
some objects of the environment

638
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,201
that will be relevant

639
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:45,237
on which some action has to be

640
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,707
done in order to advance

641
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,243
the joint action for the context is like

642
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,145
this structured

643
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,147
a special temporarily structured

644
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,581
set of elements

645
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,684
on which action has to be taken

646
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,353
to progress the joint action.

647
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:02,854
So that's the notion of context

648
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,823
that we use in the paper.

649
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:05,590
I don't know if

650
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,893
if that certifies them well.

651
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,828
KNIGHT: So it implies like,

652
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:13,065
like the set of elements is therefore

653
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,067
also content. Is that true.

654
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:17,669
TISON: In that in the

655
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,405
paper we we don't think that it is

656
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,241
my describing it

657
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:26,478
as a set of elements is a content

658
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:27,346
full description

659
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,580
because I'm talking about it

660
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,382
and there's a content to the sentence

661
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:30,949
of me

662
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,284
saying that,

663
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,286
that there's a set of elements,

664
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:37,589
but the set itself,

665
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:39,024
the thesis that we are pushing for

666
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,927
in the paper is that it can be

667
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,296
it can appear in that field.

668
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,064
Those affordances of an organism

669
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:50,469
without it having to represent it.

670
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,304
So that's where that's

671
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,772
what we are going to in

672
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,974
ecological psychology.

673
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,242
There's we're working on the notion

674
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:58,410
of a field of affordances.

675
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,978
So it's like the set,

676
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,947
the structure and set of affordances

677
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:05,050
to which an organism is sensible.

678
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,052
And it's like there

679
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,121
there's some elements that will

680
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,155
drive its action

681
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,791
differentially depending on

682
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,526
various internal factors.

683
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,928
And this sensibility of an organism

684
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,230
to its environment

685
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,532
doesn't have to be characterized

686
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:21,933
in terms of content.

687
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:22,901
If we believe that

688
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,269
the ecological psychologists

689
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,604
who developed this notion

690
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,672
so this set of elements

691
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,375
appears in a field of affordances

692
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:31,810
and these

693
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,677
these organisms

694
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:33,512
who are sensible

695
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,213
to their field of affordances

696
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:36,448
not have to entertain

697
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,883
their representation

698
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:38,984
of this set of element.

699
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,319
They're just sensible to their field

700
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,421
of affordances.

701
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,623
And that's how they respond

702
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,425
to these sets of elements

703
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:50,228
of their environment.

704
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:53,965
KNIGHT: So like I maybe like

705
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,867
when you talk about content,

706
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,035
maybe that is what needs

707
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:58,170
to actually be clarified.

708
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,739
Like so content is specifically

709
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:03,542
some kind of semantic representation

710
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,310
or semiotic representation

711
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,112
and said something that is explicit

712
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:07,879
but like can you,

713
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:11,116
can you give me an example of the

714
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:12,751
what would be an element

715
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,986
in like a set of elements like how,

716
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:20,926
how is that also not like content?

717
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,928
TISON: Yeah, these are obviously

718
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:24,930
complex questions, but

719
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:27,365
yeah,

720
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,202
typically and that's

721
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,671
our audience is a relation

722
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:34,806
between an element of the environment

723
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,342
and an action capacity of an organism

724
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:39,544
and the, the,

725
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:42,347
the thesis that is taken by an

726
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:43,648
ecological psychologist,

727
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,417
not everybody will agree with that.

728
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:46,318
But is that

729
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,521
the perception of affordances and does

730
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:50,589
not need

731
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,858
the mediation of a representation?

732
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:55,260
You can directly be sensible

733
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,196
to a certain pattern.

734
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,398
I've been there, for instance, in the

735
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,568
in the in the energy array around you

736
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:04,636
and you respond

737
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:05,971
to this pattern of energy

738
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:06,872
by, for instance,

739
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:07,973
taking the foreign dunes

740
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,407
that is specified

741
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:10,809
by this pattern of energy.

742
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:11,409
And you don't

743
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:12,377
as it's

744
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:15,213
not necessary to have a representation

745
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,481
of the far dense

746
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:17,849
to which you're sensible,

747
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,484
it's something that you can

748
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:20,952
directly perceive.

749
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:22,254
And that's

750
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,856
that's like a central idea

751
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:25,957
of ecological psychology.

752
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,325
Some people will disagree with

753
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:27,893
that will say

754
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,561
that you cannot be sensible

755
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:30,362
to in that far dense

756
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,930
if you don't represent it.

757
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,331
So that that's

758
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,834
something that you can argue for.

759
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:36,334
But there is a

760
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,903
lot of ecological psychologists

761
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:38,703
who believe

762
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,438
that you can be directly sensible

763
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:42,140
to affordances

764
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,108
of your environment

765
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:45,243
just by responding to the

766
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,478
the energy array

767
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:48,246
that is in your environment

768
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,015
without needing

769
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,683
to represent this effort.

770
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:52,584
And so

771
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:53,451
in doing that,

772
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,654
they say that we don't need

773
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,890
the notion of content or representation

774
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,991
to characterize

775
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:00,292
the way

776
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,227
in which an organism is responsive

777
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,962
to the affordances of its environment.

778
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,463
And that's what we

779
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:06,998
we presuppose in this paper.

780
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,000
But obviously there are disagreements

781
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:10,035
to be had there.

782
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:10,902
There are people

783
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:11,970
obviously you think that

784
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,173
if an organism is to

785
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:15,574
act on

786
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,308
its environment,

787
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,475
it has to be to have it

788
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,077
representation of its environment

789
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,679
in order to act correctly.

790
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:21,646
So that's obviously

791
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:24,883
something that can be defended too

792
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:25,850
well. Great.

793
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,484
KNIGHT: Thank you so much.

794
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,420
No, that's super helpful.

795
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,321
Thanks.

796
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:32,857
It makes me think of a tug of war game

797
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:34,926
or just two people pulling on a rope.

798
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,029
They're engaged in joint action,

799
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:42,167
which is how action and activism

800
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:43,168
are placed

801
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:47,272
at the center of the account of context.

802
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,441
One individual pulling the rope.

803
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,911
They might be thinking or thinking

804
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:56,414
that they think any number of things.

805
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:57,682
But through

806
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:58,984
the field of affordances

807
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:01,586
being shaped through the regularities

808
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:02,354
and the,

809
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:03,855
I think, arrays of energy

810
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:07,592
that you described in the speech

811
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:09,594
that is going to alter

812
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,363
the field of affordances of someone

813
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:12,864
on the other side of the rope,

814
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,265
and that could be mediated

815
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,201
through their appropriate perception.

816
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:18,670
FRIEDMAN: Or maybe the rope is now not graspable,

817
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,339
but it was graspable previously.

818
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:24,209
None of that requires a symbolic

819
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:27,712
or even necessarily semantic component

820
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:28,647
to be transmitted

821
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,016
along with the rope pole.

822
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,385
Maybe they had a pre play and they said

823
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,020
two tugs means this

824
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,488
and three means that.

825
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,790
And that can also reflect planning

826
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,225
to communicate.

827
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,427
However, in the act of communication,

828
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,497
as we're exploring, we're

829
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,631
putting action

830
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:47,732
and the embodiment

831
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:49,968
in the environment as primacy

832
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,302
and then seeing certain types

833
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:52,303
of cognitive agents

834
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,839
as being able to develop representation

835
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,974
like properties

836
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:59,010
on top of some physical regularities

837
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,981
in the niche din.

838
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:03,248
I mean,

839
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,150
TICKLES: what would you think of this idea

840
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,518
if you if I were to

841
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,020
we haven't defined ecology

842
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,822
here in this conversation,

843
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:13,591
but if if someone like me

844
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:15,694
came along to you and said,

845
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,496
can we define it as both

846
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:20,665
a process, ecology as process

847
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:23,034
and an ecology as a as a product?

848
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,137
Would you push back on that, on that

849
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,641
ability to see it to two ways

850
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,876
and then I guess on top

851
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,178
on the general level

852
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:36,081
to Bleu's question then can can we,

853
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:36,748
can we see it

854
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,451
as content and context, this idea,

855
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:42,353
this placeholder of ecology,

856
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,389
if we keep it on that general level,

857
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:53,698
can we have our cake and eat it too?

858
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:53,932
TISON: Yeah.

859
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,101
So ecology here

860
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,737
really refers to something specific.

861
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,505
It's not ecology

862
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:02,974
in general, like in

863
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:04,876
the branch of biology

864
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:06,978
when in in

865
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,580
so that you are connected science.

866
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,447
When we talk about

867
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:12,183
ecological psychology, it's a particular

868
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,621
movement that became that

869
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:19,591
that began with the work of the

870
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,425
of Gibson

871
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,361
in the fifties, sixties and seventies.

872
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,730
And it's an approach to psychology

873
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,800
that states that the

874
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,970
recognition of animals is the matter

875
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,838
of its direct relation

876
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,273
with its environment

877
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,674
and is a matter of

878
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:37,809
the kind of skills

879
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,944
that are exhausted by this animal

880
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,379
in its environment.

881
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,548
And the

882
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,751
central notion of ecological psychology

883
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,720
is the notion of affordances

884
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,189
and therefore dense is a possibility

885
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,190
of action.

886
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,992
It's a relation

887
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:55,927
between an element of the environment

888
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,128
and a skill

889
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,264
that can be exercised on this element

890
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,765
of the environment.

891
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,467
And the thesis of Gibson

892
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,169
and all the ecological psychologies

893
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:05,837
that followed after that is that

894
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,706
organisms and

895
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:09,908
animals

896
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,976
primarily perceive affordances

897
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,044
in their environment.

898
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:14,579
They don't perceive objects,

899
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,080
they don't perceive

900
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,582
events or properties.

901
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:18,550
What they perceive

902
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,584
first and foremost,

903
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,187
first and foremost is

904
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:23,922
possibilities for action.

905
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,356
And they are

906
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:26,191
pushed and pulled

907
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:28,259
by their environment in various way

908
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,395
and responsive to their environment

909
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,597
to take some affordances

910
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:33,331
and don't

911
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:33,932
not take

912
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,400
some other affordances and that.

913
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,002
So that's like in a constant interaction

914
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,304
with their environment,

915
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,172
organisms will respond

916
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,908
to these affordances and do some,

917
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:48,079
do some things and we'll be attracted by

918
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,081
some affordances will be pushed

919
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:51,816
by some other affordances,

920
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:54,285
and that's how an organism interacts

921
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:56,955
with its environment. So that's ecology.

922
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:59,424
It really refers to that,

923
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:02,160
that body of ideas that came

924
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,328
from the work of Gibson

925
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,829
in ecological psychology.

926
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:05,430
There are

927
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,867
obviously links with ecological ecology

928
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,902
more broadly in the in the

929
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:12,403
as a branch of biology,

930
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:14,505
but it's really specifically the

931
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:18,543
like the this this set of ideas

932
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,611
linked to

933
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:23,715
ecological psychology and Gibson's work.

934
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,682
TICKLES: Do you think that

935
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:26,217
that what you just described

936
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,886
the possibility

937
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,022
could be for people like yourself

938
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:34,259
both a product and a process,

939
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:36,794
is that possibility

940
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,529
something that can be categorized

941
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,732
two different ways at once?

942
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,468
TISON: So that's a good question.

943
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,570
You mean like a.

944
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,240
TICKLES: Is it a category error

945
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,442
to say it's only a process?

946
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:52,310
That would be another way

947
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,679
of asking the same questions.

948
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:57,415
TISON: I think that ecological psychologists

949
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,317
would more

950
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,552
preferred the description of the

951
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:04,489
the interaction of an organism

952
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:05,423
with its environment

953
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,624
in terms of process,

954
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:09,827
because the organisms is always

955
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:11,729
changing through its interaction

956
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:13,131
with its environment.

957
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,799
And obviously

958
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:16,467
the organism is also changing

959
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:17,869
the environment control

960
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,671
as is described in

961
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,272
in active insurance

962
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,507
accounts of niche construction.

963
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:25,176
So there's always an evolving

964
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:28,413
interaction in which the organisms

965
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,881
gain skills

966
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:32,917
and the environment is transformed.

967
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:34,319
So the field of

968
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,287
affordances is like never static,

969
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,222
so it can never really be described

970
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:38,990
as a product.

971
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,058
I don't know if that's

972
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:40,825
and that can

973
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:43,494
that answer is a bit for your question.

974
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:45,029
TICKLES: Well, are there other products

975
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:46,831
within what you just described?

976
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:48,066
So for example, if I

977
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,100
if I'm an organism,

978
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,368
I've had experiences

979
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:53,004
and I can now use those experiences

980
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,572
to continue my process.

981
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,041
Are those those things that

982
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:57,909
I've experienced,

983
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:58,543
are they do

984
00:32:58,543 --> 00:32:59,477
they just have to stay

985
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,511
in the same category

986
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:04,382
as now processed as in as in past

987
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,918
or have they solidify?

988
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:08,486
Because I can't go back

989
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,788
and change my history per se,

990
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:12,890
I can build off of it.

991
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,192
But those are pretty absolute.

992
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:14,959
Now, this

993
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,861
this sentence that I'm getting out

994
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,663
is going to have a record

995
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,732
that I can't I can't erase.

996
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,868
So are those things products now?

997
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:26,371
And in the enacting of whatever

998
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,805
I've decided

999
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:28,873
I want to focus on

1000
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:33,211
in terms of possibility.

1001
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:36,180
TISON: I may be I just say something quick.

1002
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:39,250
Maybe when you you take

1003
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,052
like a definite time slice

1004
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,487
of an evolving organism,

1005
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,522
you can see that at that point

1006
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,457
there's a product that can be defined.

1007
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:48,326
You can say, okay, at that point there's

1008
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,861
this set of abilities,

1009
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,995
this set of skills,

1010
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,830
this set of experiences

1011
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:56,434
that can be attributed to this animal.

1012
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,236
So there is a product at that point,

1013
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:01,472
but if you take the organism

1014
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:04,242
evolution like it's

1015
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:05,910
in its entirety,

1016
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,412
there is always changing.

1017
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:07,812
So

1018
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:11,049
it's something it's always a process

1019
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,484
in truth, there's always a process.

1020
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:15,153
But if you you

1021
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,654
you freeze frame,

1022
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,456
maybe you can say, okay, at that point

1023
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:19,123
there's this.

1024
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:20,124
And then that

1025
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,560
is a product of the of the,

1026
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,029
the interaction.

1027
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,598
But I don't know if I answered

1028
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:29,233
correctly your question,

1029
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,103
but that's that would be my, my idea.

1030
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,271
TICKLES: Yeah,

1031
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:35,940
you are answering and that's great.

1032
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,042
I'm just trying to get in my mind

1033
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,278
if we're going to talk about relativity

1034
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:43,081
and I know that I step into a river and

1035
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:43,948
step out

1036
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:44,749
and then step into it

1037
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:45,683
a second time,

1038
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,485
I'm not stepping into the same river.

1039
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:48,252
So what

1040
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,520
gives me the affordances

1041
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,656
to realize that difference?

1042
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:52,790
Is it a product?

1043
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,124
Is it

1044
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:54,192
the first step

1045
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:54,859
is that

1046
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:57,061
first time I went in now a product

1047
00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:00,264
because I can't go back and change it,

1048
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,200
I can move off of that

1049
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,135
and see the relative,

1050
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,336
the relative distance

1051
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:06,871
or the relative time.

1052
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,107
But I don't know how we do

1053
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,143
processing with our product.

1054
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:15,446
That's, I guess, what I'm asking.

1055
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:17,381
FRIEDMAN: One quick thought on that

1056
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:20,384
is that product doesn't necessarily

1057
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:23,087
mean singular final static.

1058
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,689
There are working products

1059
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:25,590
that can be versioned,

1060
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,725
which digital files have helped us see.

1061
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,027
And then also we could say that

1062
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:31,863
the past is produced,

1063
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,199
but also it's reproduced

1064
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,068
when it's remembered,

1065
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,270
when it's brought back together,

1066
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,872
and even

1067
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:41,973
in the directions

1068
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:42,707
you point to

1069
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,542
towards the end of the paper,

1070
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,276
with what kinds

1071
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:48,179
of empirical neurophysiological accounts

1072
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,381
are helping bolster

1073
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,650
the ecological claim,

1074
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:53,718
the realization

1075
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:54,485
that memories

1076
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:58,322
are not being accessed as static files

1077
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:00,958
but are recreated contextually

1078
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,294
and relived is an interesting

1079
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:08,499
angle.

1080
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,369
Yes, Bleu.

1081
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,906
KNIGHT: So the recreation of memories

1082
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:17,074
contextually, like in

1083
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,243
dreams, is really interesting

1084
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:21,312
because it's like the recreation

1085
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,848
and also like recombination

1086
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,983
in in a different context.

1087
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,352
And just before we leave

1088
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,555
context entirely,

1089
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,890
I guess, I think I have a hard time with

1090
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:35,059
all of this

1091
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,195
because even a field of affordances

1092
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,563
has content, right?

1093
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:38,996
Like,

1094
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:40,998
like I can go fly a kite

1095
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:41,866
if it's windy outside.

1096
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:42,033
Like,

1097
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,067
I have a set of actions

1098
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,368
that I can choose from.

1099
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:44,936
And I think

1100
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,671
because we have to talk about it

1101
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:49,607
in a way that's semantic, it's difficult

1102
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,176
to like experience

1103
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:54,045
my field of recordings

1104
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:54,979
because I'm a human.

1105
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,347
And not only that, like I'm

1106
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:57,582
a very verbal human.

1107
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:57,949
So so

1108
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,784
I think that there's there's like that.

1109
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:00,318
But but we

1110
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:00,918
even the field of

1111
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,053
affordances has content.

1112
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,654
But but I realized that, like,

1113
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,756
it's the mental representation

1114
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:08,192
aspect that is not

1115
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:09,794
that is

1116
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:10,561
the distinction

1117
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,797
between content and context.

1118
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,933
And I just want to point to

1119
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,536
the quantum paper

1120
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:19,370
where we have

1121
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,305
the quantum reference frames

1122
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:24,108
and crisp fields for our next reality

1123
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,111
that we did on the livestream.

1124
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:28,946
I think number 40 and live stream

1125
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,414
number 17.

1126
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:34,518
And just it's it's not possible

1127
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:34,952
to have

1128
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:39,357
a full contextual alignment here.

1129
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,459
And it makes me think of in the paper

1130
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,327
how you were describing like

1131
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:44,762
there's this person

1132
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:45,930
on one end of the beat

1133
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:46,964
of the tug of war,

1134
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,099
and then there's another person

1135
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,734
on the other end of the tug of war.

1136
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:51,302
And then there's actually

1137
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,237
the tug of war itself.

1138
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:55,506
And I just wonder about like,

1139
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:56,340
what is the

1140
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,543
the so person has their context, person

1141
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:00,811
B has their context.

1142
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:03,214
What is the context of the tug of war

1143
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,483
itself? Like it's it's another entity.

1144
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:08,119
Anytime you have this like interaction.

1145
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,387
And this is something that I've said

1146
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,288
to Daniel before,

1147
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,355
like you have a relationship

1148
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,123
with a person,

1149
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,724
you have a set of communication

1150
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:14,458
with the person.

1151
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,394
Like that's its own thing.

1152
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:17,828
Like that has to be like

1153
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:19,664
loved, protected, nurtured.

1154
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:21,799
Like you have to keep it up.

1155
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:22,867
It has to

1156
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,735
like like it has to

1157
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,270
undergo like altarpieces

1158
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,638
it has to self-assemble,

1159
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,373
like it's its own entity.

1160
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:32,043
And I wonder about modeling in that way.

1161
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,312
Like, like if I model my communication,

1162
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:35,279
like there's

1163
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:36,547
me and the person

1164
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:37,982
and then the interaction

1165
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,818
or the collective behavior or whatever

1166
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,054
it may be, I don't know.

1167
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,922
I just it's I've been thinking about it

1168
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:49,427
and yeah, that's all.

1169
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,729
FRIEDMAN: It's like a view from the bottom

1170
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:54,598
or inside or however of communication

1171
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:55,833
where there's two entities

1172
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,635
and a partially aligned frame.

1173
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:58,869
And then there's also a view

1174
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:01,038
where it is just one thing,

1175
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:04,375
albeit maybe with partial information

1176
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:05,776
encapsulation,

1177
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:07,812
but it still becomes one thing.

1178
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:11,582
And then is that one thing atomic

1179
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,150
even though it contains

1180
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:17,021
divisions and partitions as well.

1181
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,690
Remi on that or anywhere you want to go.

1182
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,224
TISON: Yeah I think

1183
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:22,593
blew your interventions that were really

1184
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,963
are really really interesting

1185
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:26,564
so far

1186
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:29,233
for did the first thing that you said

1187
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:33,371
I think I know those are the 2

1188
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,374
to 2 to

1189
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,810
like remove are

1190
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,979
are a bit of describing things

1191
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,047
in terms of content

1192
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,215
because we have language

1193
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:44,749
and we

1194
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,517
describe things in terms of contents.

1195
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,953
But it's something that has

1196
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:51,389
been remarked by really, really

1197
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,157
by a phenomenological phenomenology

1198
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,793
that's like Merleau-Ponty and and

1199
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,729
they are that our primary

1200
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,100
contact with the world is not some like

1201
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,668
a description, it's

1202
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,570
not like a representation

1203
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,506
and it's not like a

1204
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:09,807
reflexive consciousness.

1205
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,942
It's a free reflexive consciousness.

1206
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,010
And in your day

1207
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:13,844
to day interaction

1208
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,413
with your environment,

1209
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,415
you're not using this kind of language

1210
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,783
like description

1211
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,418
to experience your environment.

1212
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,286
Like if you're playing a sports

1213
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:23,421
and like for instance

1214
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,222
with you're playing soccer and you,

1215
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:27,057
you see like a pass that you can make,

1216
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:27,992
you're not

1217
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:30,661
reflexively thinking that, Oh,

1218
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:31,629
you could make that pass.

1219
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:33,631
It's like a push or a pull

1220
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:35,366
in a field that in

1221
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,002
their field kind of thing.

1222
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,171
And that's how we, we experience.

1223
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,673
And the second where us humans,

1224
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:43,974
especially we,

1225
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:44,942
we begin to

1226
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,310
think about our experience,

1227
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,646
then we cannot help but describe it

1228
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:49,713
in terms of content,

1229
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:50,181
in terms

1230
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:52,416
of a representation that we entertain

1231
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,151
in the linguistically

1232
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:55,252
with the

1233
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:56,320
linguistic means,

1234
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,621
but in our free

1235
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,923
reflexive engagement

1236
00:40:58,923 --> 00:40:59,657
with the environment.

1237
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:00,224
That's the

1238
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:02,426
thesis of the economic logics

1239
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:04,161
and the ecological psychology.

1240
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:05,563
It's really just a push

1241
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:06,063
and pull

1242
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:07,465
from the environment

1243
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,733
that drives us in different directions.

1244
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,870
And we don't have this kind of

1245
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,238
reflexive consciousness,

1246
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:15,506
this kind of representation

1247
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,942
on which we rely to describe and

1248
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:20,744
understand it

1249
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,446
with these linguistic means.

1250
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:26,083
So I think that's really the difficulty

1251
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:29,253
that we have of late in

1252
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,322
getting to this pre

1253
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,756
reflexive consciousness

1254
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:35,292
when we are so used to this again

1255
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,861
that we describe something,

1256
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:37,895
we are describing it

1257
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:38,929
in terms of content.

1258
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:41,165
So we have it's hard to say, oh,

1259
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,066
there is no content

1260
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,334
when we talk about it,

1261
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,903
we are invoking content automatically.

1262
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,738
So yeah, there's a difficulty there.

1263
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:48,506
And about

1264
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,940
the autonomy

1265
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,209
of the dynamic of an interaction

1266
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:52,843
that's something

1267
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,011
that's really, really interesting.

1268
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,145
And there's been

1269
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:57,181
a great work on this by a

1270
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,482
is it Kelsey Paolo

1271
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,317
I don't know if you're familiar

1272
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:03,387
is working is an activist researcher

1273
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,956
is working on language too and I am

1274
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:08,292
I have been really inspired by his work

1275
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:08,893
and he's

1276
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:10,961
describing situations where like

1277
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:12,696
there are two people interacting

1278
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,733
and these two people as goals

1279
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,001
that are aligned.

1280
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,203
But because of the particular dynamic

1281
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,070
of the interaction,

1282
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,805
these goals don't come to fruition.

1283
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:22,606
For instance,

1284
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:25,609
you're walking in the in the corridor

1285
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,211
in there somewhere

1286
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,712
and you're facing somebody.

1287
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,148
And both of you want to like

1288
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:33,651
fluidly like pass each other, but

1289
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:37,488
you're both trying to go for on one side

1290
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:38,589
and then on one side

1291
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,324
and you're blocking each other

1292
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:42,860
that you're trying to

1293
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,861
achieve the same goal,

1294
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:46,063
which is individually

1295
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,431
passing past each other.

1296
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:49,199
But because of a dynamic

1297
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,734
that arises from your

1298
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:51,435
interaction, you're

1299
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,605
you cannot achieve this, this goal.

1300
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:55,205
So there

1301
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:56,106
there's really like this

1302
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:58,075
autonomous dynamic

1303
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,076
at the interaction

1304
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,344
that is really important.

1305
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:01,946
And I don't think

1306
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:03,314
obviously that's something that

1307
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:04,982
that we wanted to put in the paper

1308
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:07,351
because we're talking about

1309
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:10,187
interactive, dynamic, dynamic systems.

1310
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,188
But I don't think

1311
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,290
that I have succeeded in

1312
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,793
translating this in the way

1313
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:18,062
we think of shared field of affordances

1314
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:19,029
because I,

1315
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:20,731
I define shared filter

1316
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:23,000
avoidance is as the subset

1317
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:26,036
that is common to both

1318
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:27,938
individual fields of affordances.

1319
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,307
But I think that neglects this point,

1320
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:32,042
this autonomy of

1321
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:33,177
the field of affordances

1322
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:35,913
that is shared in the interaction.

1323
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:36,480
I don't know

1324
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,481
if I'm being clear,

1325
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:39,683
but I define the shared

1326
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:41,185
field of affordances

1327
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:44,221
as a product of the combination

1328
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:45,322
that a combination

1329
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:46,690
of the two individual

1330
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:47,791
fields of affordances.

1331
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,994
But it seems that there's

1332
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:51,061
a lack of autonomy

1333
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:51,795
in the shell

1334
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:52,262
field that

1335
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:56,333
I don't know how to account for.

1336
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,470
FRIEDMAN: That makes me think of the ants case

1337
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,940
where one nest may might be able to

1338
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:06,210
grab a single seed and carry home.

1339
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:10,180
So that would be compatible with a view

1340
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,382
on communication

1341
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:13,050
shaping the field of affordances

1342
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,251
because it modifies

1343
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:15,853
the capacity

1344
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:16,720
for another nest

1345
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,855
made to pick up that seed

1346
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,690
because it's been moved

1347
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,091
doesn't need to have any

1348
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:22,760
representational content,

1349
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,694
although especially when

1350
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:24,995
we're linguistically describing

1351
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:25,796
it does so

1352
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:27,998
definitely want to come back to that.

1353
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:31,101
Then there's this

1354
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:32,403
seed grabbing ability

1355
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,171
which is predicated on

1356
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,973
a lower level of audience,

1357
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:36,740
like the ability

1358
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,977
to grasp with the mandibles.

1359
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:42,279
And that lower level of audience enables

1360
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:44,748
true joint action

1361
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:46,884
like multiple nest mates

1362
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:47,718
working together

1363
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:50,154
to drag something bigger home,

1364
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:51,088
but dragging something

1365
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,623
bigger isn't in the fore,

1366
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,758
and so even exists

1367
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:56,727
at the single decimate level.

1368
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:59,096
So there's like shared affordances

1369
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:00,030
and joint action

1370
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,000
at the level of what we can both do.

1371
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:04,635
And then

1372
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:06,503
there's also this very interesting

1373
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:08,172
higher level view

1374
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:10,874
where perhaps novel affordances

1375
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:14,378
become accessible, but then whom

1376
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,145
or to what

1377
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:19,416
or when do these special affordances or

1378
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:21,819
maybe nested

1379
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:24,788
system affordances come into play?

1380
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:27,991
And how will we mediate the the handoff

1381
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:28,625
or like the way

1382
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:29,827
that those different levels

1383
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:31,228
of affordances

1384
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,865
come into relevance or out of relevance,

1385
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:38,368
Bleu.

1386
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,571
KNIGHT: So in terms of that modeling,

1387
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,772
the field of affordances

1388
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:44,408
like it changes through time.

1389
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:47,177
And this is why I like

1390
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,879
I was thinking about

1391
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:50,080
a competition

1392
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,382
like in a tug of war between two people.

1393
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:55,319
Both of them have the appearance to win

1394
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,321
or there could be a tie, right?

1395
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:59,523
But like it's a potential opportunity

1396
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:00,424
for either one to win,

1397
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,493
but only one can be the winner.

1398
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:04,261
And so then one person winning,

1399
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,864
like by default, you know, makes

1400
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:08,799
it makes the other person lose.

1401
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:09,500
And so this

1402
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,501
this field

1403
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:11,769
of avoidance, of thinking through

1404
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,537
time is really interesting

1405
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,672
and I think very broadly applicable

1406
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,544
for modeling all kinds of processes.

1407
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:21,278
TISON: Yeah, that's true.

1408
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,580
And the idea about

1409
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,048
the collective

1410
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:25,783
affordances, there's

1411
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,084
been some interesting,

1412
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,519
interesting work on that

1413
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:31,622
and clearly some organisms like ants

1414
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:33,991
don't perceive collective affordances.

1415
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:35,392
They perceive

1416
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:36,460
is they perceive something,

1417
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:36,960
they perceive

1418
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,362
their individual affordances

1419
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:40,364
and collectively level.

1420
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:43,367
There's the the taking of this

1421
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,368
higher level

1422
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:46,470
affordances, this collective affordances

1423
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,070
of our dance.

1424
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,473
But they don't perceive individually,

1425
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,107
probably

1426
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,242
I don't think they do perceive

1427
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:53,811
individually the audience.

1428
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,213
But some organisms such as humans,

1429
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:58,448
I think because we have

1430
00:46:58,448 --> 00:47:00,684
maybe a deeper generative of something,

1431
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:02,052
we are able to

1432
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:03,120
perceive some collective

1433
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,288
affordances because we're

1434
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:06,356
sensible to them.

1435
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:07,624
For instance,

1436
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:09,960
if I'm moving with a friend,

1437
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,295
I can perceive that

1438
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:12,229
a couch

1439
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,697
is unmovable by me,

1440
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:16,066
but I can perceive it as movable by us.

1441
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:17,434
And then I can see like, Oh,

1442
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:19,203
we could move this couch together

1443
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:20,204
because I perceive it

1444
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:23,707
as something that can be acted upon,

1445
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:26,143
not just by me, but with somebody else.

1446
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,111
And then I have a perception,

1447
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:29,680
it appears in my individual

1448
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,681
feed of our dance

1449
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,015
as a collective for dance.

1450
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,351
But that's different from the, the,

1451
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,286
the ants who

1452
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:37,754
achieve a collective action,

1453
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:39,823
but without having the perception

1454
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:41,525
their field of individual feeling,

1455
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,026
of affordances

1456
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,863
of this collective audience.

1457
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:47,130
FRIEDMAN: That's awesome.

1458
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,766
It makes me think of the human capacity

1459
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:51,602
to have counterfactuals

1460
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:52,436
and speculative

1461
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:55,873
realism on teams and projects like, Hey,

1462
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:59,643
everybody here, we could do X.

1463
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:01,712
So there's the ability to communicate

1464
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,047
semantically and representational

1465
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:04,781
anywhere needed

1466
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:07,618
plausible

1467
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:10,921
narratives or little sub niches.

1468
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:14,358
New things can be suggested and arise

1469
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:15,659
that are specifically

1470
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:19,796
about shared or collective affordances.

1471
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:20,898
And then additionally,

1472
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:24,334
there are special names for when we take

1473
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:27,070
individual level affordances

1474
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:29,806
that have consequences

1475
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:31,742
on other levels of decision

1476
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,011
making, like there might be

1477
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:36,246
a multisig wallet

1478
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:37,681
in cryptography

1479
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:40,150
or a voting system in democracy

1480
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:42,252
where an individual's affordances

1481
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,820
like to pull the lever

1482
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,289
or to fill in a box

1483
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,658
or to assign a transaction,

1484
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,960
and then it's being engaged in

1485
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:53,297
specifically because there's knowledge

1486
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,766
if 100 people do this,

1487
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,234
then this performance

1488
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:58,201
is going to happen.

1489
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,871
So it seems like there's many cases

1490
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:04,041
where we do

1491
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,277
our mandible closing

1492
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:10,080
the kind of lower level individual task,

1493
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:13,250
also with an explicit knowledge

1494
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:15,752
and a communicated knowledge around

1495
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:19,022
how someone's individual actions will

1496
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:20,724
influence group

1497
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:23,927
outcomes that could be like

1498
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:25,429
weakly emergent,

1499
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:26,096
like merely

1500
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:28,165
submitting the affordances

1501
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:29,633
taken by individuals

1502
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,401
as well as

1503
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:32,469
strongly emergent

1504
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:33,303
or more strongly

1505
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,738
emergent in the sense

1506
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:36,707
that there's, there's nothing different

1507
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:38,909
about anyone's pulling lever and voting,

1508
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:40,811
but there are phase transitions

1509
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:44,147
and dynamics that can be like top down

1510
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:49,586
deep.

1511
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:50,153
TICKLES: Yes.

1512
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,722
So when we have these experiences

1513
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:52,456
and they are

1514
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:55,726
kind of absolute in the sense that they

1515
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:58,362
they've happened, they've occurred and

1516
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,531
whether we can recall them or not,

1517
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,000
they they seem to have

1518
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,601
some kind of an effect

1519
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:06,837
on this relativity piece and

1520
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,038
and the relationship piece.

1521
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:10,440
I don't think it matters whether we

1522
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,110
see Newton on one side and then

1523
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:14,678
Chris Fields

1524
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,380
and an Einstein on the other,

1525
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,448
that the bottom line is, is that to

1526
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:20,217
what Daniel was just saying,

1527
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:21,952
the possible happens

1528
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:22,519
when we

1529
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,553
when we

1530
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:24,654
don't get stuck on

1531
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:25,489
what's the gauge

1532
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:27,124
of the transmission line,

1533
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:30,427
but what does that now allow us to do?

1534
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,997
So how do we move from the absolutes,

1535
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:38,368
the modeling piece to the process piece,

1536
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:40,904
the things that are out there

1537
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:43,073
that are have not happened yet,

1538
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:44,408
that are still in

1539
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,910
that possibility category.

1540
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:49,379
And now we're going to use communication

1541
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:50,847
not just to narrow

1542
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:53,350
down to the workbench.

1543
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:56,253
The ontology, which Daniel and I are

1544
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:57,921
our fast friends,

1545
00:50:57,921 --> 00:50:58,822
except when it comes

1546
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:01,124
to the specifics of ontology,

1547
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:02,659
the generalities of that,

1548
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:04,561
and the potential impossibility

1549
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,462
of that, really,

1550
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:07,664
maybe you can talk to us a little bit

1551
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:10,200
about that from the ecological lens.

1552
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:14,438
TISON: Yeah, that's a really good question.

1553
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:16,606
I think the one interesting thing

1554
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:18,542
about like collective

1555
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:21,878
and shared affordances is I think they

1556
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:24,948
they are learned

1557
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:26,783
in the same way that we learned

1558
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:28,785
individual affordances.

1559
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:29,786
So for instance,

1560
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:31,354
how do we learn how would we

1561
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:33,557
we we learn to perceive enough audience.

1562
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:35,392
We learn to perceive in that audience.

1563
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:37,627
We I think we gain a skill.

1564
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:38,728
When we gain

1565
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:39,696
a particular skill,

1566
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:41,598
we then can perceive in the

1567
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,233
over environment,

1568
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:44,701
the situations

1569
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:46,536
where we can apply the skill.

1570
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:47,904
So for instance,

1571
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:50,006
when we're really young, we can like

1572
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:51,842
I guess we can

1573
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:54,344
then maybe crawl a little bit.

1574
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:56,446
So we know where surfaces

1575
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,014
can be crawled upon

1576
00:51:58,014 --> 00:51:59,216
and we can grab things.

1577
00:51:59,216 --> 00:51:59,916
So we perceive

1578
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:01,818
where things can be grabbed.

1579
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:03,153
And so we start from this

1580
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:05,155
like basic skills

1581
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:06,857
and then we explore our environment.

1582
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:09,559
We do some things that we, we, we're

1583
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,728
gaining some abilities

1584
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:14,397
and when we do that,

1585
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:15,932
probably a little bit by trial

1586
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:16,600
and error,

1587
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,436
we, we begin to perceive some

1588
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:21,238
higher level affordances can

1589
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:21,972
because we can do

1590
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,473
some more complex things.

1591
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,742
And so our field of affordances

1592
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:27,110
deepens and become more

1593
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,345
it becomes more complex

1594
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:29,913
as our set of skills

1595
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:31,381
becomes more complex.

1596
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:33,483
But I think that interacting

1597
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,519
with others, with others

1598
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:38,955
and so sorry for my, my accent,

1599
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:39,890
it's not really good.

1600
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:42,225
I, I didn't want to say interacting with

1601
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:43,493
the animal others.

1602
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:46,062
So yes.

1603
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:47,797
So when we interact with others

1604
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:49,833
we are also learning

1605
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,835
to do some particular things.

1606
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:52,936
For instance,

1607
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:54,504
if I tried to

1608
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,540
to pick something up alone,

1609
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,375
I might not be strong enough to do it.

1610
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,410
So I don't have the skills.

1611
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,878
So I don't perceive that for dense.

1612
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:03,980
But if in some cases

1613
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:04,981
I picked something up

1614
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:06,950
and I see something, somebody else

1615
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,685
picking it up with me

1616
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,887
and we succeed in listing it

1617
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:13,790
and then I've gained the ability

1618
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,225
to see that

1619
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:18,161
with somebody else I can lift the stick,

1620
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,596
but it's not a different,

1621
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:21,331
different kind of learning.

1622
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:23,633
And in that case,

1623
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,868
from the kind of learning

1624
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:25,635
that I apply

1625
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:27,571
when I'm learning individual skills,

1626
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:29,272
it's just that interacting

1627
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:30,540
with your environment,

1628
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,209
you acquire skills,

1629
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,777
somebody sometimes with some

1630
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:35,912
somebody else, sometimes not.

1631
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:37,047
And you

1632
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:37,847
understand

1633
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:39,249
how you can apply these skills

1634
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,483
in your environment

1635
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:41,851
and then you

1636
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:43,186
navigate your field

1637
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:45,155
affordances accordingly.

1638
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:46,523
So how you perceive

1639
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:48,291
a possibility is about,

1640
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:49,226
Oh, you have to learn

1641
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,328
to do some things in the past.

1642
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:53,163
And then because of this learning,

1643
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:54,464
you perceive situations

1644
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:56,733
as affording these of actions.

1645
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:58,168
They can be individual,

1646
00:53:58,168 --> 00:53:59,502
but in communication

1647
00:53:59,502 --> 00:53:59,903
they are

1648
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,239
usually about what others can do

1649
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,174
and what we can do with others.

1650
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:06,209
And that's how you perceive

1651
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:08,778
like the possibilities that can be

1652
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:10,680
that can be

1653
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,281
brought upon,

1654
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:12,482
that can be done

1655
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:13,917
with with the person

1656
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,619
with which you're interacting.

1657
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:16,953
But I don't know if that held.

1658
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:19,356
But that's how I see it.

1659
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:21,458
TICKLES: From a, from a modeling standpoint.

1660
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:22,859
If you

1661
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:24,661
if you move away from the constraints

1662
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:26,830
and you look at the emancipation

1663
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:28,198
and the freedom piece, it

1664
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:29,899
obviously becomes combinatorial,

1665
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:31,334
the explosive very,

1666
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:32,035
very quickly,

1667
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:34,170
because it can go off in many,

1668
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,705
many directions.

1669
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:38,108
As a for example, as Daniel

1670
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:39,743
alluded to

1671
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:41,611
and we started today's live stream,

1672
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,413
this could go down many different paths.

1673
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:45,415
So he left it open.

1674
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:48,652
He left the freedom aspect in.

1675
00:54:49,152 --> 00:54:50,854
And so I was curious

1676
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:52,122
what you think about.

1677
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,190
So when we do leave that in,

1678
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,059
when we do move out of the laboratory

1679
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:59,763
or we do move away from the mechanics

1680
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:01,531
which you were just describing,

1681
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:03,900
and give our attention over to the

1682
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,970
the freedoms piece of it without without

1683
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:09,039
immediately assuming, oh, well,

1684
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:10,640
we're going to start modeling now

1685
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,008
because this is just going to

1686
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:12,842
blow up on us.

1687
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:14,177
I was wondering what you were thinking,

1688
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:16,012
what you're thinking is around

1689
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:17,881
that in terms of communication

1690
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:23,086
as a platform for the possible?

1691
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:23,420
TISON: Yes.

1692
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,256
So the idea of communication is,

1693
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:27,390
is that the role

1694
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,125
it plays in interaction is

1695
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,560
is a constraint.

1696
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,661
It's a constraint

1697
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:32,195
of the

1698
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:33,930
on the set of possible action

1699
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,665
that can be achieved.

1700
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,935
So the idea is that the what

1701
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:40,637
communication achieves

1702
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:43,940
it helps to limit the kind

1703
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,909
the scope of affordances

1704
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,144
that will be salient at a given moment.

1705
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:50,380
It's like you will center

1706
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,482
like the shared field of affordances

1707
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:53,750
around a certain set

1708
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,652
or a certain affordances.

1709
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:57,120
And this will limit

1710
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,955
this will restrict the set

1711
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:00,590
of affordances that will be

1712
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:03,193
considered or

1713
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:03,660
that can

1714
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,527
be acted upon

1715
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,596
by the individual participants.

1716
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:08,998
So that's the role that I don't know

1717
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:10,300
if that helps,

1718
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,769
but that's how communication works.

1719
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:14,371
I think in interaction

1720
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,839
that everybody does it

1721
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:19,242
in the dynamical systems terms.

1722
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:20,844
If the idea was that

1723
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:21,544
it allows

1724
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:24,214
to create interpersonal synergies

1725
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:26,683
in order to achieve the joint goals

1726
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:27,650
of the interaction,

1727
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,820
that was the suggestion in the paper.

1728
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,156
So for instance, two people

1729
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:35,125
being together in a in a room,

1730
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,092
they can be a lot,

1731
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:37,160
they can do a lot of thing.

1732
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,263
There's like an almost infinite

1733
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:42,165
set of affordances

1734
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:43,466
that are open to them.

1735
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:45,268
But if one of the people in the room,

1736
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:47,003
like, goes

1737
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,506
to the couch and see like couch

1738
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:52,242
or manifestly tries to lift it,

1739
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:54,377
then what is

1740
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:57,180
what is conveyed for 2 to 3?

1741
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,416
Take the transmission view idiom.

1742
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:00,750
What is conveyed or what

1743
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:01,618
to the effect that it

1744
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:04,621
as it will augment the salience

1745
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,891
of the sylvian of the audience,

1746
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:08,958
of taking the couch,

1747
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:10,427
and then this would restrict

1748
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:11,961
the set of affordances

1749
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:13,029
that are open,

1750
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:14,831
that are salient in the shared field,

1751
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:16,666
and then the other person will like,

1752
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:18,401
see, okay, that's what we're doing now.

1753
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:19,402
And they're going to

1754
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:20,403
take the couch together

1755
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:21,738
and list it and bring it.

1756
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:24,874
So so that's the role of communication

1757
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:27,477
is there's a whole set of affordances

1758
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:29,012
open at any moment.

1759
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:31,281
And what communication does it restricts

1760
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,549
and it constrains

1761
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:34,984
this set of affordances in order to

1762
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:38,221
better achieve that, the joint goals

1763
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:39,389
of interaction,

1764
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:41,424
that's what we tried to do

1765
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:42,225
in the

1766
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:42,992
in the paper

1767
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:45,061
to understand cooperative communication.

1768
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:47,130
TICKLES: You touched on

1769
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:47,831
an important

1770
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:50,467
difference, though, between is

1771
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,736
and if so, what is does

1772
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:56,840
actually put pretty strong

1773
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:00,810
what we kind of guardrails constraints.

1774
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:03,346
But if I ask what if

1775
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:03,847
I haven't

1776
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:04,681
put a constraint

1777
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:05,281
on something

1778
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:06,115
I would look now

1779
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:08,785
at the counterfactual and the possible

1780
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:10,753
and I haven't said

1781
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,155
that the first

1782
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,390
the first person that answers back to me

1783
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:16,793
is going to necessarily be

1784
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:18,261
now the new constraint.

1785
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:19,395
The whole point it

1786
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:21,798
if is the possible right

1787
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:23,533
and it is the freeing up

1788
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:24,834
and it's the whiteboard moment

1789
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,870
and you know all of this.

1790
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,505
So again, I

1791
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,173
in the context of this paper,

1792
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,741
what the is part of

1793
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:33,910
it is in terms of joint action.

1794
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:35,245
But is there a what

1795
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:37,881
is there a place in your research

1796
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:41,784
or the if within the same arguments

1797
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:42,151
that you're.

1798
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:43,453
I believe that there is

1799
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:45,622
but you didn't speak as clearly to them

1800
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:48,057
as you did to the is parts.

1801
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:49,092
The constrained parts.

1802
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:50,894
TISON: Yes.

1803
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:51,661
So the

1804
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:52,328
I think what

1805
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:54,430
you're talking about here is the

1806
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:55,265
the the

1807
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:57,500
communication about like future

1808
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,402
or counterfactual situation.

1809
00:58:59,402 --> 00:58:59,836
That's what

1810
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:00,670
that's what you're talking about.

1811
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:01,304
The key. Yeah.

1812
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:02,005
So what's

1813
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:04,374
what we, we tried to do in the paper

1814
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:05,875
is we introduce the notion

1815
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:06,910
of a simulation

1816
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,378
of a field of affordances.

1817
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,379
And that's where we're

1818
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:09,846
we're then

1819
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:10,980
thing really closely

1820
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,149
with like the notion of representation

1821
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:14,017
because our idea

1822
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:16,052
is that the representation of AI

1823
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,153
and therefore it is like

1824
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:19,355
it's like a fine, fine line to tread.

1825
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:19,956
But

1826
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:21,224
so, so

1827
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,091
there's this notion

1828
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:23,793
of a simulation of enough audience

1829
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:25,528
feel some

1830
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:27,630
sufficiently cognitively complex

1831
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,232
organisms such as humans

1832
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,668
and probably some primates can

1833
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:33,870
can produce

1834
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,638
a simulation of enough audience

1835
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:37,840
that will enter in this year

1836
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,443
hierarchical for dense competition.

1837
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,446
So you can like activate enough audience

1838
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:46,149
that is not immediately present

1839
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:47,784
in order to affect

1840
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:48,418
your current

1841
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:52,088
field of audience to a, to, to, to, for,

1842
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:52,755
for instance,

1843
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,891
go towards this simulation of

1844
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:56,426
does that based on the work

1845
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,027
of Paul Chozick,

1846
00:59:58,027 --> 01:00:00,129
which is at at Montreal

1847
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:01,030
and there's work on

1848
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:02,298
for a dance competition.

1849
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:03,800
And he argues that

1850
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:06,069
a lot of

1851
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:07,103
of the phenomena

1852
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,671
linked to cognitive control

1853
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:10,907
so such as the executive function

1854
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:12,175
and this kind of thing

1855
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:12,742
and working

1856
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:14,143
memory can be understood

1857
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:17,213
as these these effects of, of,

1858
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,950
of affordances at higher levels

1859
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,552
that will constrain

1860
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:24,120
the their lower levels

1861
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,289
of the field of affordances

1862
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,591
in order, for instance, to act

1863
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:32,595
accordingly to the desire level

1864
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:33,062
for this.

1865
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:33,630
So the example,

1866
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,698
the example that she gives

1867
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:37,066
is, for instance,

1868
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:39,302
suppose that there is a monkey

1869
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,637
on the, on a branch

1870
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,172
that like sees a little berry

1871
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:44,207
just, just beside it.

1872
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:45,174
So there's the dance

1873
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:46,509
of eating the berry.

1874
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:49,412
But suppose that there's

1875
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,247
an apple

1876
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:53,516
which is a bigger fruit, a bigger prize

1877
01:00:53,516 --> 01:00:55,618
further down on the on the branched

1878
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:57,353
and the monkey

1879
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:59,222
as the understanding that there's a

1880
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:00,690
in this apple for there there

1881
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:01,391
you can

1882
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:02,058
with this

1883
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:03,726
this simulation of the dance

1884
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:04,961
of eating this apple.

1885
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:05,828
I your level

1886
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,431
also like if I do that if I go there

1887
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:10,099
I will get this apple

1888
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:11,167
this simulation of a

1889
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,568
not for a dance at a higher level

1890
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:13,236
will constrain

1891
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:14,237
with diminish

1892
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,072
the salience of this immediate

1893
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:19,042
so sedation that and it will help him to

1894
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:22,045
like ignore this in the immediate berry

1895
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:23,112
and it will

1896
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:24,247
continue on the branch

1897
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:26,449
in order to get to the bigger

1898
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:27,383
through to the apple.

1899
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:29,886
So there's like the basic idea of how

1900
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:32,655
the simulation of affordances can play

1901
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:35,558
like a cognitive control

1902
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:38,928
role in order to constrain our behavior

1903
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:41,631
according to further goals,

1904
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:43,266
like in, in the future,

1905
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:44,467
future situation.

1906
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:45,134
So that

1907
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:46,502
that's the idea

1908
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:47,403
on which

1909
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:49,172
we, we speak about it really,

1910
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:50,339
really quickly in the paper

1911
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:53,109
because it's already a really big paper.

1912
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:54,410
But that's an important point.

1913
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:57,180
And that's the key to understanding that

1914
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:59,615
communication about future

1915
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:01,718
and the counterfactual situation.

1916
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,353
We talk about it in the last section.

1917
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:06,689
It's the displacement

1918
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:10,126
or did the absence reference discussion.

1919
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:10,626
So the idea

1920
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:11,894
how can we talk about things

1921
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,963
that are not immediately present

1922
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:15,898
in the special temporal sense?

1923
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:16,532
And the idea is

1924
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:18,367
that we can activate

1925
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,636
shared simulations of affordances.

1926
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:22,805
So I can speak about in affordances

1927
01:02:22,805 --> 01:02:23,806
that an audience

1928
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:25,675
that is not immediately present,

1929
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:27,944
but it can affect our

1930
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:30,046
our shared field of audience

1931
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:32,315
and it can drive our behavior

1932
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:34,417
toward this audience, for instance,

1933
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:36,452
even if it's not immediately present.

1934
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:37,520
But, yes,

1935
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,288
this poses the question of is

1936
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:40,556
are these simulations

1937
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:43,059
of affordances, representations?

1938
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:44,627
I'm not I'm on the fence

1939
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:45,661
on this question.

1940
01:02:45,661 --> 01:02:47,864
But if they are, they are probably like

1941
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,900
action oriented representations

1942
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:51,901
that we may be.

1943
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:52,835
Would be acceptable

1944
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:53,636
to an activist,

1945
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:56,706
an ecological psychologist

1946
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:57,974
sorry for my really long

1947
01:02:57,974 --> 01:02:59,041
and so that's something

1948
01:02:59,041 --> 01:02:59,876
that something

1949
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:02,712
that I've really thought about a lot.

1950
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:05,348
FRIEDMAN: Price Yeah.

1951
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:06,182
You want to add anything?

1952
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:09,886
Ah there's a few ways to go.

1953
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:10,686
KNIGHT: So I'm going to go ahead

1954
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:11,587
and take it away.

1955
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:12,221
FRIEDMAN: All right.

1956
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:13,222
Well, one

1957
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:14,323
interesting connection

1958
01:03:14,323 --> 01:03:16,292
with active inference.

1959
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:19,762
You mentioned there's nested affordances

1960
01:03:19,762 --> 01:03:23,166
is including ones that include that are

1961
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:25,568
plausible.

1962
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,938
So that reminded me a lot of the

1963
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:32,375
attention and metacognition

1964
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,076
as mental action,

1965
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:35,545
which we explored in Livestream

1966
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:38,047
25 with Sanford Smith at ALS Paper,

1967
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:40,116
where the same way

1968
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:42,985
that at the kernel layer

1969
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:44,921
of the partially observable

1970
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:46,289
Markov decision process

1971
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:48,357
or however we're doing active modeling

1972
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:50,760
at the most basil kernel layer,

1973
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:54,397
those pies, those policy selections

1974
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:56,566
and those ease, those affordances

1975
01:03:56,566 --> 01:04:00,336
have to do with the level of affordances

1976
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:02,672
that is embodied,

1977
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,540
like the actual actions

1978
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:05,842
that the eyes are taking

1979
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,543
in the ocular motor case

1980
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:09,512
or the actual direction

1981
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:10,913
that's taken

1982
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:13,649
left or right in a TMS example.

1983
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:16,519
And then nested modeling

1984
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:20,122
is using an analogous

1985
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:24,660
graphical structure where policies

1986
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:28,764
of nested levels reflect, attention

1987
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:33,436
being paid to various lower level,

1988
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:35,137
lower

1989
01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:36,939
levels of that

1990
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:39,242
hierarchical architecture.

1991
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:41,611
So there could be

1992
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:43,346
one lever they can go left and right

1993
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:44,747
and one that can go up and down.

1994
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:46,415
And then there's a higher level decision

1995
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:49,485
like which of these two levers

1996
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:52,021
should I be paying attention to and how

1997
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:53,623
where am I of

1998
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:55,758
which left are I'm paying attention to

1999
01:04:55,758 --> 01:04:57,526
and so on.

2000
01:04:57,526 --> 01:04:58,394
So I think

2001
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:01,697
the paper itself does not present any

2002
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,332
formal isms,

2003
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:05,167
but there's extensive

2004
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:08,671
linking to work in active inference

2005
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:11,407
and also to really resonate ideas

2006
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:14,410
that are in a non slash pre

2007
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:17,480
active inference framing

2008
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,482
that are immediately compatible

2009
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:21,550
like nested levels of affordances.

2010
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:22,952
The distinction

2011
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:24,120
between

2012
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,989
the primacy of the bodily affordances,

2013
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:29,258
but also for certain cognitive systems,

2014
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:32,461
the existence of what appear

2015
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:34,430
to be cognitive affordances

2016
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:37,199
and the desire to model those jointly,

2017
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,169
perhaps without taking on strong

2018
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:43,039
or specific baggage around

2019
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:44,941
how we are then

2020
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,876
constrained to think about the bodily

2021
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:49,145
or the cognitive aspects of that.

2022
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:50,313
Modeling blew

2023
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:55,451
up.

2024
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:58,487
And then one other thought was on like

2025
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:00,122
shared action,

2026
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:02,124
including shared planning.

2027
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:04,260
So planning to act together

2028
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:08,664
and about how events or activity

2029
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:12,068
planning in the future

2030
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:14,437
is like an activity

2031
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:16,472
that one person can do or groups can do.

2032
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,543
But it's about preparing a context

2033
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:24,480
so that a process can occur.

2034
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,916
And sometimes all that's needed

2035
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:29,251
is to send the calendar events invite.

2036
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:30,486
Other times

2037
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:32,755
there might need to be a lot of

2038
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:36,726
work to be done before the event itself.

2039
01:06:37,593 --> 01:06:40,129
However, what is the transmission

2040
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:42,999
view on planning

2041
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:47,003
that might be able to describe?

2042
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,170
And I think the paper does

2043
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,606
an excellent job of saying

2044
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:53,576
that the transmission view is not

2045
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:56,312
refuted by the ecological

2046
01:06:56,312 --> 01:06:57,713
and inactive angle.

2047
01:06:57,713 --> 01:06:59,148
You said no

2048
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:00,049
transmission, no

2049
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:01,917
communication, no communication.

2050
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:05,321
It's like it's an enabling aspect

2051
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:08,024
of this action orientation

2052
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:13,429
and this focus.

2053
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:14,630
Here's some

2054
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:17,133
other areas that we had written down

2055
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:22,972
from before.

2056
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:23,839
One I'm really

2057
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,074
curious to follow up on

2058
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:27,910
is about like language

2059
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:30,112
and maybe the role of

2060
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:32,448
our talking about these issues.

2061
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:34,683
What other media or formats

2062
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:38,454
have you found to be insightful?

2063
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:41,590
Do any and activists

2064
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:45,227
do presentations with

2065
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:47,897
silent films or with objects

2066
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:48,731
that are mailed to you

2067
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:52,201
and you play with or do this?

2068
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,471
I mean, how else can we

2069
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:57,506
point at the moon

2070
01:07:57,506 --> 01:07:59,642
and not have it be confused

2071
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:08,551
that we're talking finger anatomy?

2072
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:09,185
Read me first.

2073
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:13,355
Dental.

2074
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:13,923
TISON: Okay.

2075
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:17,293
Yeah, I think that that's that's hard to

2076
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:19,562
to

2077
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:24,700
to talk about academic subjects

2078
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:25,334
like this

2079
01:08:25,334 --> 01:08:26,469
without

2080
01:08:26,702 --> 01:08:29,839
having like an explicitly transmission

2081
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:34,643
view, like appearance of communication

2082
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:36,212
because

2083
01:08:37,813 --> 01:08:39,448
this, these kind of interactions

2084
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:42,451
are so far from the basic

2085
01:08:42,651 --> 01:08:43,919
interactive activities

2086
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:46,322
that were like the context

2087
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:48,524
of the evolution of communication,

2088
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:50,092
which is what I'm trying to

2089
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:51,427
to explain here.

2090
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:54,430
It's not like you imagine like you

2091
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:56,765
imagine like a tribe somewhere

2092
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:59,935
in the in the place, the person

2093
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:01,904
and like they're they're

2094
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:03,205
they're not trying to explain

2095
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:04,607
academic subjects to each other.

2096
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:06,041
They're trying to do things,

2097
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:07,610
concrete things together.

2098
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:08,277
And that's really

2099
01:09:08,277 --> 01:09:09,011
the context

2100
01:09:09,011 --> 01:09:10,112
of where

2101
01:09:10,112 --> 01:09:12,615
communication evolved and what it

2102
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:14,583
what purpose it served.

2103
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:16,385
But I think that it's hard to

2104
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:18,154
like envision the

2105
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:22,158
academic discussions such as

2106
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,025
that when we're I think

2107
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:25,928
now that would be

2108
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:27,663
like that would be more evidence

2109
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:28,964
toward the ecological view

2110
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:30,699
then for the transmission to do.

2111
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:32,568
I don't know if that

2112
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:34,937
that's here, but clearly like

2113
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:36,739
moving your couch together

2114
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:38,908
is a better instance of

2115
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:40,342
and the communication

2116
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:41,510
that takes place in this joint

2117
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:44,113
activity is probably a better example of

2118
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:45,514
our view

2119
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,016
than like speaking together

2120
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,083
about active and friends

2121
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:49,018
and communication

2122
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,987
because this is really a specific

2123
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:53,455
and really

2124
01:09:53,455 --> 01:09:55,891
highly complex form of social activity

2125
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:59,562
that is more, more readily described.

2126
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:01,030
For instance, in terms of

2127
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:05,434
of the transmission view, I think.

2128
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:06,202
FRIEDMAN: Yeah, nice.

2129
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:07,236
A lot to say there.

2130
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:10,039
Bleu.

2131
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,106
KNIGHT: So I think all of those

2132
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:11,607
things like

2133
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:12,408
even silent

2134
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:15,077
films are also representations, right?

2135
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:16,946
So whether it's a communication

2136
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:18,480
like with communication

2137
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,649
or even pointing to

2138
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:23,018
the moon would be like a well,

2139
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:23,886
maybe that would be different.

2140
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:24,420
I don't know.

2141
01:10:25,854 --> 01:10:27,990
I like this

2142
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:31,193
idea of communication as an action

2143
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:31,994
that we take.

2144
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:34,029
And I'm not leaving

2145
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:35,264
information transmission

2146
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:36,332
behind in the dirt.

2147
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:37,166
I don't think it

2148
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:38,734
I don't think it needs to go there.

2149
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:39,535
I think.

2150
01:10:40,102 --> 01:10:43,305
But but I do think that all actions are

2151
01:10:43,305 --> 01:10:44,907
in some way

2152
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:47,276
some kind of information transmission.

2153
01:10:47,676 --> 01:10:51,213
So even like like and study

2154
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:52,181
theory of mind.

2155
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:53,515
So I assume you're familiar

2156
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:55,484
with integrated information theory

2157
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:58,454
and the emergent properties

2158
01:10:58,454 --> 01:11:00,122
that information can

2159
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:02,291
help us to represent.

2160
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:05,094
And so I think

2161
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:09,932
like in some way even like eating food

2162
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:11,734
like tells the environment

2163
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:13,269
that you're hungry and,

2164
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:14,403
and takes away the food.

2165
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:15,070
And so there's,

2166
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:16,672
there's always some level

2167
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:18,207
of informational exchange,

2168
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:19,341
even if it's

2169
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:21,277
just trivial information exchange,

2170
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:22,411
even if it's not meaningful,

2171
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:23,912
it doesn't create some bigger

2172
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:29,251
emergent thing, right.

2173
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:35,457
FRIEDMAN: Thanks, Bleu Dean.

2174
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:36,725
TICKLES: I think it's an easy again.

2175
01:11:36,725 --> 01:11:39,094
I think it's it's I won't say it's easy.

2176
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:40,195
It's really

2177
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:41,730
did a good job of explaining this

2178
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:43,499
and not making it too obtuse.

2179
01:11:43,499 --> 01:11:44,333
If you

2180
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:47,336
if you use an example of moving a couch,

2181
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:49,104
the physical manipulation,

2182
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:50,472
it's not hard to extend

2183
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:53,575
that to communication and symbolic

2184
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:57,546
anyplace in the manipulation stays then

2185
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:59,682
then that sort of reinforces

2186
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:01,116
the idea that there is

2187
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:03,352
there a process at hand,

2188
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:05,688
something that we can observe.

2189
01:12:05,688 --> 01:12:07,890
But I'm still kind of confused about.

2190
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:11,960
So once that the chair been lifted

2191
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:12,661
or the

2192
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:14,163
the words have come out of my

2193
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:15,197
I heard the expression

2194
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:16,465
because I was watching

2195
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:18,100
the John Bourbaki thing yesterday

2196
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,735
and something comes out of my mouth

2197
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:21,170
whole now.

2198
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,905
It's it's done.

2199
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:24,773
It's a product.

2200
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:27,009
I mean, we can read, we can read,

2201
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,011
submitted or reflect on it or whatever,

2202
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:31,847
but it's there. It's now historical.

2203
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:32,681
And so

2204
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:35,084
that transition from process to product,

2205
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:36,518
I think, is

2206
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:38,087
something that

2207
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:40,089
the manipulation by itself

2208
01:12:40,489 --> 01:12:43,225
doesn't explain, have to kind of delink

2209
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:46,662
and see the sort of timelessness

2210
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:48,230
aspect of this.

2211
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:51,767
Carl talks about deep temporal models,

2212
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:55,404
and so I don't know that I'm not sure

2213
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:58,807
how communication manipulation, symbolic

2214
01:12:58,807 --> 01:13:00,943
manipulation gets explained

2215
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:02,678
in these deep chemical senses.

2216
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:04,113
And I'm not just talking about

2217
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:07,783
chiseling chiseling it into the stones,

2218
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:08,684
the tablets. Right.

2219
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:09,818
Like there's got to be

2220
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:10,753
another piece to this

2221
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:12,054
that you've looked into.

2222
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:12,721
I mean,

2223
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:14,990
obviously much deeper than I have.

2224
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:17,192
What what what is your sense of that?

2225
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:18,794
Once we get past

2226
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:20,629
the manipulation, processing

2227
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:23,565
and start seeing the the products

2228
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:30,205
pile up?

2229
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:30,873
TISON: Yes. So,

2230
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:35,010
yeah, it's hard to answer

2231
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:38,280
this question, but

2232
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:40,516
that's true of everything.

2233
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:43,385
That is something that happens

2234
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:44,086
at some point.

2235
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,687
It's it's it's there

2236
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:47,122
and you can't change it.

2237
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:50,726
So any event, communicative or not,

2238
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:52,828
or like a rug that falls or something

2239
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:54,763
that does that property to know

2240
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:55,898
it's it once

2241
01:13:55,898 --> 01:13:57,266
it happens, it's

2242
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,701
something to which we can go back.

2243
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:01,737
And I don't know if that's

2244
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,307
so, so in the same sense

2245
01:14:05,307 --> 01:14:08,076
that if you you talk to say something,

2246
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:10,546
this is something that that does happen

2247
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:12,781
and you can

2248
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:15,651
it's now

2249
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:16,351
a product

2250
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:18,720
and something to which you can allude to

2251
01:14:19,521 --> 01:14:22,391
it has influenced the

2252
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:26,595
your cognitive system and then you can

2253
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:28,430
I I'm

2254
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:29,131
I struggled to

2255
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:31,800
to see what was the question exactly.

2256
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:34,203
Well I don't know if that.

2257
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:34,837
TICKLES: One of the things

2258
01:14:34,837 --> 01:14:35,604
that you pointed to

2259
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:37,005
right at the very start of your paper

2260
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:39,808
was that what these symbols

2261
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,477
that have been manipulated

2262
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,212
now set down in this paper

2263
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:44,813
is not the end.

2264
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:46,682
It's the start of something.

2265
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:47,883
This product,

2266
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:48,917
this paper

2267
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:50,719
should be the start of a dialog

2268
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,921
or a trialogue or in case a quadra

2269
01:14:53,522 --> 01:14:55,190
and it has become something.

2270
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:56,992
Right. So so

2271
01:14:57,993 --> 01:14:58,627
it's the back

2272
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:00,028
and forth part

2273
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:01,730
that I find really interesting.

2274
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:03,165
And it's something you spoke

2275
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:03,866
to very clearly

2276
01:15:03,866 --> 01:15:04,967
at the very start of your paper.

2277
01:15:04,967 --> 01:15:06,401
You didn't say, okay,

2278
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:08,103
so if we get stuck

2279
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:09,638
in the transmission, do

2280
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:12,741
when when I stop talking, that's it.

2281
01:15:12,741 --> 01:15:13,442
That's over.

2282
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:15,811
And now we're going to start something

2283
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:16,278
else.

2284
01:15:16,278 --> 01:15:17,679
No, you basically said

2285
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,748
there's a continuum aspect to this.

2286
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:22,551
It isn't strictly episodic

2287
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:24,820
that we have to look at something

2288
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:25,554
more than just

2289
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:29,091
what Remi says, which I think is that it

2290
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:30,759
brilliant way to start a paper

2291
01:15:30,759 --> 01:15:31,994
and an even better way

2292
01:15:31,994 --> 01:15:33,629
to start a conversation.

2293
01:15:33,629 --> 01:15:36,565
So so there is a product piece to this

2294
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:38,867
and there's a process piece to this.

2295
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:40,369
You put something down

2296
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:41,336
and and a child

2297
01:15:41,336 --> 01:15:43,238
will start manipulating it

2298
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:44,039
and then they'll start

2299
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:46,008
manipulating the symbology

2300
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:46,942
that they're applying

2301
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:47,409
or actually

2302
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:49,211
getting associating with that.

2303
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,212
So again

2304
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:50,746
you've looked

2305
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:52,581
at that far deeper than I have,

2306
01:15:52,581 --> 01:15:53,615
obviously, because

2307
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:54,950
listen to how I ramble. Right.

2308
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:56,952
But I wondered what you're like.

2309
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:58,654
How do you take that

2310
01:15:58,654 --> 01:16:00,589
transition piece now

2311
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:01,990
and hold it up to other people

2312
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:02,925
who may

2313
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:04,359
be taking an activist procedure

2314
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:05,460
or to take

2315
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,062
more of an instrumentalist approach?

2316
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:07,696
Right.

2317
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:09,131
Because the bottom line

2318
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:11,967
is, it's hard to deny that it's

2319
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:15,504
it's done or it's it's still happening.

2320
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:16,972
But you focused on

2321
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:17,940
the it's still happening.

2322
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:21,076
So what are your thoughts.

2323
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:23,111
TISON: Yeah, I think that

2324
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:24,413
there's with communication

2325
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:25,914
there's a sedimentation.

2326
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:27,983
The Paolo talks about this too

2327
01:16:28,183 --> 01:16:30,385
like the symbol we use

2328
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,554
then the words that we speak

2329
01:16:32,554 --> 01:16:33,789
there's like this.

2330
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:36,925
And then there's also talking about

2331
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:39,261
first all your first order language

2332
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:40,829
and second order language.

2333
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:41,730
And so first order

2334
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:43,131
language is like the flow,

2335
01:16:43,131 --> 01:16:44,132
the dynamic

2336
01:16:44,132 --> 01:16:46,635
where every interaction is new,

2337
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:49,705
everything is always like on fly

2338
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:51,740
and there's always a transformation

2339
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:53,642
of the linguistic forms that we use.

2340
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:55,344
And the second order language

2341
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:57,346
is like the abstraction

2342
01:16:57,479 --> 01:16:58,447
where we can say,

2343
01:16:58,447 --> 01:16:59,581
Oh, that's the same word

2344
01:16:59,581 --> 01:17:00,482
that has been used

2345
01:17:00,482 --> 01:17:01,583
at the same sentence,

2346
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:02,718
that's the same meaning.

2347
01:17:02,718 --> 01:17:04,286
And the second order language

2348
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:05,587
is like a and

2349
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:07,422
something that's

2350
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:08,357
added up and

2351
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:11,493
that's an abstraction that's

2352
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:13,395
something traditional linguistic

2353
01:17:13,395 --> 01:17:14,997
has really focused on this second,

2354
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:16,264
second order language,

2355
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:17,733
which is like the product of language,

2356
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:20,802
which is like, okay, the language that,

2357
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:22,371
the language that we speak is

2358
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:24,606
a set of sentences, a set of words.

2359
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:25,941
And that's something that

2360
01:17:25,941 --> 01:17:26,541
that is

2361
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:27,643
identified at

2362
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:29,678
the level of the second order language.

2363
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:30,712
But when we're speaking

2364
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:31,913
where we're talking,

2365
01:17:31,913 --> 01:17:33,515
it's not at this level

2366
01:17:33,515 --> 01:17:34,449
that we're doing it.

2367
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:36,418
When we're acting, it's always new.

2368
01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:38,253
We always reconfigure being,

2369
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:39,721
we always transforming.

2370
01:17:39,721 --> 01:17:41,823
And it's only when we abstract

2371
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:42,391
from this,

2372
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:44,292
like, basic interaction

2373
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:46,795
and some patterns that we see. Okay.

2374
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:48,263
And the second order

2375
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:49,531
at the second level,

2376
01:17:49,531 --> 01:17:50,632
there is words,

2377
01:17:50,632 --> 01:17:51,500
there's a syntax,

2378
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,669
there's some rules that are followed.

2379
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:54,736
But it's not

2380
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:58,173
the real phenomenon.

2381
01:17:58,173 --> 01:17:58,573
Language,

2382
01:17:58,573 --> 01:17:59,841
phenomenal language

2383
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:02,310
is the first order, and that's the idea.

2384
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:05,347
So maybe that's a way to see like

2385
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:07,315
the real activity is the reader process.

2386
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:08,283
But if we abstract,

2387
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:10,318
if we look back on this process

2388
01:18:10,318 --> 01:18:11,253
and we analyze it

2389
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:12,821
and we abstract some parts of it,

2390
01:18:12,821 --> 01:18:14,656
then we can see these forms

2391
01:18:14,656 --> 01:18:15,991
emerging, these languages,

2392
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:19,628
these words that are used repetitively,

2393
01:18:19,828 --> 01:18:21,063
and then we can

2394
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:22,998
apply the product of language.

2395
01:18:22,998 --> 01:18:24,366
But in truth,

2396
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:26,168
language is always the process

2397
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:29,171
and that's the shift the terminology

2398
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:29,771
called shift

2399
01:18:29,771 --> 01:18:31,773
of not talking about language,

2400
01:18:31,773 --> 01:18:32,741
but language in

2401
01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:33,475
which is something

2402
01:18:33,475 --> 01:18:35,944
that is that an activist

2403
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:38,580
working on language to try to do

2404
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,582
that's really brings forward this

2405
01:18:40,582 --> 01:18:42,718
this notion of language is always

2406
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,419
an activity, always a process

2407
01:18:44,419 --> 01:18:45,921
and not like a set of words

2408
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:48,090
instead of symbols that are used.

2409
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:51,293
And these these analysis in terms of

2410
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,328
repeatable symbols

2411
01:18:53,328 --> 01:18:55,597
is something that we get when we

2412
01:18:55,597 --> 01:18:56,431
analyze it

2413
01:18:57,499 --> 01:18:58,333
like

2414
01:18:59,968 --> 01:19:00,836
after the fact.

2415
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:01,169
And we

2416
01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:02,637
see these patterns that are

2417
01:19:02,637 --> 01:19:03,572
that are used

2418
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,107
that we we get this thickened order.

2419
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:06,808
But when we are doing it

2420
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:08,510
at the fundamental level,

2421
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:10,245
it's really just that process

2422
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:12,414
of continual interaction.

2423
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:15,984
So that's maybe something

2424
01:19:15,984 --> 01:19:17,085
to think about.

2425
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:17,786
And there's

2426
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:19,054
something I want to say

2427
01:19:19,054 --> 01:19:20,255
really quickly about Bleu

2428
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:21,690
said about the information

2429
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:23,625
and the way in

2430
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:25,560
which information is always present

2431
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:26,428
and that that's true.

2432
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:26,862
That that's

2433
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:28,130
what I allude to

2434
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:30,799
at the end of the paper when I cite

2435
01:19:30,799 --> 01:19:32,400
Brian's terms, when I say, yeah,

2436
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,535
there's always information

2437
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:34,302
transmission, right?

2438
01:19:34,302 --> 01:19:36,571
Just moving in my environment,

2439
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:38,373
there's information that's transmitted.

2440
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:40,142
But yeah, that's exactly the point.

2441
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:41,076
And that's

2442
01:19:41,643 --> 01:19:42,210
the idea is

2443
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:44,546
that content is not information.

2444
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,081
Information is everywhere,

2445
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:47,849
everywhere, always.

2446
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:50,519
When we when anything happens

2447
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:51,419
in the environment,

2448
01:19:51,419 --> 01:19:52,454
in the universe,

2449
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:53,522
there's information

2450
01:19:53,522 --> 01:19:55,757
that is created as it transmitted.

2451
01:19:55,757 --> 01:19:57,793
But the idea is that information

2452
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,027
understood in this

2453
01:19:59,027 --> 01:20:01,429
in these terms and uncertainty reduction

2454
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:04,366
notion of information is not sufficient

2455
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:06,001
to explain communication

2456
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:07,269
because there's information

2457
01:20:07,269 --> 01:20:08,270
all the way everywhere.

2458
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:10,472
Does that the point that that

2459
01:20:11,273 --> 01:20:12,774
that people

2460
01:20:12,774 --> 01:20:13,909
who own the transmission

2461
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:14,376
that you think

2462
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:15,544
that they can rely

2463
01:20:15,544 --> 01:20:17,045
on this notion of information

2464
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:19,281
to explain it to communication

2465
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:20,582
but it's not that strong

2466
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:22,617
and thus notion of information.

2467
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:24,986
They need the notion of content

2468
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:25,754
to explain

2469
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:27,322
what they want to explain

2470
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:28,790
because, for instance,

2471
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:29,558
the information

2472
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:30,258
that you think about

2473
01:20:30,258 --> 01:20:33,295
when they eat, when they wave my arms

2474
01:20:33,395 --> 01:20:34,095
like that,

2475
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:35,063
there is information

2476
01:20:35,063 --> 01:20:36,231
because there is an exchange

2477
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:37,499
with my environment.

2478
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:39,634
But that's not sufficient

2479
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:40,936
to explain communication

2480
01:20:40,936 --> 01:20:42,204
because this information

2481
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:43,138
is everywhere

2482
01:20:43,138 --> 01:20:45,140
and communication is not everywhere.

2483
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:47,943
It's a property of certain behaviors

2484
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:48,944
that we have

2485
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:52,714
to be more specific to analyze.

2486
01:20:52,714 --> 01:20:53,715
FRIEDMAN: Thank you, Bleu.

2487
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:56,218
KNIGHT: So the

2488
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:59,688
information has to have context, right?

2489
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:01,623
It has to have relevance

2490
01:21:01,623 --> 01:21:03,358
for the communication,

2491
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:04,793
for the collective action,

2492
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:07,529
for the collaboration or something.

2493
01:21:07,829 --> 01:21:10,165
So so there's no like in an order

2494
01:21:10,165 --> 01:21:11,566
for a communication like that

2495
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:13,335
that's contextual.

2496
01:21:13,335 --> 01:21:13,869
I don't know.

2497
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:16,071
Imposition needs to exist I think.

2498
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:19,641
FRIEDMAN: Yeah. Nice.

2499
01:21:19,641 --> 01:21:21,409
So just a few notes.

2500
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:22,110
I really like

2501
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:24,646
this sedimentation of communication.

2502
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:27,949
It's a really rich, like riverbed

2503
01:21:27,949 --> 01:21:31,620
or or rock formation, natural analogy.

2504
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:31,920
That's.

2505
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,221
That's concordant

2506
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:35,857
with the ecological perspective

2507
01:21:35,857 --> 01:21:36,558
to reflect

2508
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:39,561
how the products of communication

2509
01:21:39,961 --> 01:21:43,832
are indeed sequentially layered, the

2510
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:47,335
pen marks on the page can't be erased,

2511
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:48,970
can't undo what was said.

2512
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:50,472
We can't on record,

2513
01:21:50,472 --> 01:21:52,908
we can't on transact, on the blockchain,

2514
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,809
all these different aspects

2515
01:21:54,809 --> 01:21:55,443
and even

2516
01:21:55,443 --> 01:21:57,145
including the scientific literature

2517
01:21:57,145 --> 01:21:59,581
being appended to continually.

2518
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:03,018
So there's a segmented aspect.

2519
01:22:03,018 --> 01:22:05,186
Yet also there's something

2520
01:22:05,186 --> 01:22:06,554
that is a process

2521
01:22:06,554 --> 01:22:07,255
like the river

2522
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:09,324
that is depositing the sediment.

2523
01:22:10,025 --> 01:22:12,360
And then that made me think about

2524
01:22:13,028 --> 01:22:13,862
how sometimes

2525
01:22:13,862 --> 01:22:16,531
communication is descriptive around

2526
01:22:16,531 --> 01:22:18,633
what was or is.

2527
01:22:18,633 --> 01:22:20,802
And this may map on to the variational

2528
01:22:20,802 --> 01:22:23,038
free energy inference

2529
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:25,774
which is kind of like now casting

2530
01:22:25,907 --> 01:22:28,043
or even retro casting.

2531
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:31,913
But once we enter into action mode

2532
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:35,050
and anticipatory or prospective

2533
01:22:36,318 --> 01:22:41,122
informing and communicating,

2534
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:42,791
looking forward

2535
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:45,093
to reduce uncertainty of our actions.

2536
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:48,196
Selection is vital for systems

2537
01:22:48,196 --> 01:22:50,799
to persist and thrive.

2538
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:52,667
However, as we've explored

2539
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:54,002
in many discussions,

2540
01:22:54,002 --> 01:22:56,638
sometimes from a really technical angle,

2541
01:22:57,272 --> 01:22:59,507
the introduction of action

2542
01:23:00,342 --> 01:23:02,877
into model selection

2543
01:23:02,877 --> 01:23:03,845
and just modeling in

2544
01:23:03,845 --> 01:23:07,349
general introduces several complexities

2545
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:10,251
how the space of possible

2546
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:13,021
is enumerated and scanned over.

2547
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,291
It's a simpler and a different question

2548
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:19,461
to do purely receptive inference

2549
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:22,497
on something about the past,

2550
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:25,033
but to inject one into the present

2551
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:27,035
and embody that present seeing

2552
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:31,106
requires one to act amidst uncertainty

2553
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:31,773
about what

2554
01:23:31,773 --> 01:23:33,375
the future of the general process

2555
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:34,109
will be

2556
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:35,844
and the consequences of action,

2557
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:37,512
which are either slightly

2558
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:39,948
or almost entirely unknown so.

2559
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:41,649
The introduction of action

2560
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:43,685
puts us into that realm of expected

2561
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:45,153
free energy

2562
01:23:45,153 --> 01:23:46,254
and highlights

2563
01:23:46,254 --> 01:23:49,290
all these really interesting dynamics

2564
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:52,494
and how the future is not the past.

2565
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,262
But it becomes that way.

2566
01:23:54,262 --> 01:23:56,398
Like you get sediment ID, but

2567
01:23:57,265 --> 01:23:59,401
this is the pre sedimentation.

2568
01:23:59,401 --> 01:24:01,269
There's some dust molecules there

2569
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:02,871
right next to each other in the river.

2570
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,639
One of them is going to sediment,

2571
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:05,373
the other one's going to

2572
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:06,708
go out to the Pacific Ocean.

2573
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:10,712
It may not be clear

2574
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:12,580
in that river

2575
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:13,248
which way

2576
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:14,716
the different particles are going to go.

2577
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:15,450
And so that's like

2578
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:16,785
where like all the complexity

2579
01:24:16,785 --> 01:24:20,822
and turbulence can be happening.

2580
01:24:20,822 --> 01:24:23,858
And so it's a very rich distinction and

2581
01:24:25,293 --> 01:24:26,861
something to to really

2582
01:24:26,861 --> 01:24:28,063
bring back

2583
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:30,532
about how the past is sediment did,

2584
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:31,699
but there's an openness

2585
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:34,202
in the action consideration

2586
01:24:34,202 --> 01:24:35,937
and that's where

2587
01:24:36,204 --> 01:24:38,673
planning as inference and joint action

2588
01:24:38,673 --> 01:24:40,809
and shared attention, all these features

2589
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:42,677
come into play.

2590
01:24:42,677 --> 01:24:44,979
TICKLES: Dean Yeah.

2591
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:47,549
Daniel I don't know if your

2592
01:24:47,549 --> 01:24:49,584
if indirectly referring back

2593
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:50,885
to the 47th series

2594
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:53,321
of the live stream, but there it was.

2595
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:54,689
We talked about

2596
01:24:54,689 --> 01:24:55,323
was that people

2597
01:24:55,323 --> 01:24:56,858
who have

2598
01:24:56,858 --> 01:24:58,793
look through in an activist lens

2599
01:24:58,793 --> 01:25:00,662
really make fantastic arguments

2600
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:02,330
about let's focus on process,

2601
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:04,766
let's focus on the process.

2602
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:06,334
Apologies

2603
01:25:06,334 --> 01:25:08,503
if if you're talking about people who

2604
01:25:08,803 --> 01:25:10,238
work in the instrumentalists,

2605
01:25:11,873 --> 01:25:13,708
hopefully that'll get answered.

2606
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:14,709
If you're talking about people

2607
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:15,477
walking in

2608
01:25:15,477 --> 01:25:17,245
through the instrumentalist lens,

2609
01:25:17,245 --> 01:25:19,114
they really to talk about product.

2610
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:19,714
They really want to say

2611
01:25:19,714 --> 01:25:20,915
this is a tool

2612
01:25:20,915 --> 01:25:23,218
and they argue fantastically for that.

2613
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:24,886
And I think what we tried to do in

2614
01:25:24,886 --> 01:25:26,654
the 47 was say,

2615
01:25:26,654 --> 01:25:28,323
you're both right,

2616
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:30,558
you both have fantastic arguments.

2617
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:33,228
As an agent who's trying to communicate,

2618
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:35,930
why would we say one

2619
01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:39,634
is necessary like we're acting first,

2620
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:42,270
why if we're active and first,

2621
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:43,404
first and foremost,

2622
01:25:43,404 --> 01:25:44,873
if we're always trying

2623
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:45,573
to scan

2624
01:25:45,573 --> 01:25:47,642
and survey that field of affordances,

2625
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:48,776
why would we drop

2626
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:50,378
one for the other and less

2627
01:25:50,378 --> 01:25:52,046
that was necessary?

2628
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:54,115
What isn't part of affordances?

2629
01:25:54,115 --> 01:25:56,317
The the ability to option

2630
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:56,784
and be able

2631
01:25:56,784 --> 01:25:58,987
to recognize the tool product

2632
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:02,857
and recognize the action in that moment

2633
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:06,027
carrying out that that data thread

2634
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:07,529
which we can now

2635
01:26:08,863 --> 01:26:09,631
act further on.

2636
01:26:09,631 --> 01:26:12,033
Is that a step Daniel said downstream.

2637
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:13,568
Right.

2638
01:26:13,568 --> 01:26:15,003
So again,

2639
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:17,071
I don't think anybody would argue

2640
01:26:17,071 --> 01:26:18,173
that activism

2641
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,074
and that ecological approach

2642
01:26:20,074 --> 01:26:22,644
is hugely important

2643
01:26:23,044 --> 01:26:23,811
in order to be able

2644
01:26:23,811 --> 01:26:26,147
to generate those affordances

2645
01:26:26,814 --> 01:26:28,850
and that maybe,

2646
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:30,251
maybe there's still people

2647
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:31,553
who want to argue

2648
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:34,022
no, if you just bring your toolkit,

2649
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:35,256
all of your all your

2650
01:26:35,256 --> 01:26:37,425
your problems will suddenly dissolve.

2651
01:26:37,592 --> 01:26:40,228
Or if you just walk into the room,

2652
01:26:40,495 --> 01:26:41,362
you'll know how to talk

2653
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:42,997
to all of these people

2654
01:26:42,997 --> 01:26:45,166
without really developing that

2655
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:48,169
that sense of, okay, so as you said,

2656
01:26:48,169 --> 01:26:49,771
first order and second

2657
01:26:49,771 --> 01:26:51,873
order communication, right?

2658
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,742
You just walked into the room

2659
01:26:54,742 --> 01:26:56,211
and then you reflect later.

2660
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:59,147
So the next time you walk into a room,

2661
01:26:59,147 --> 01:26:59,981
maybe you

2662
01:26:59,981 --> 01:27:01,616
you come at it

2663
01:27:01,616 --> 01:27:03,484
a little differently each time. Right?

2664
01:27:03,484 --> 01:27:05,553
So, again, Daniel,

2665
01:27:05,553 --> 01:27:07,322
I don't know if you were consciously

2666
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:08,923
or subconsciously referring back

2667
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:10,725
to the last livestream set,

2668
01:27:10,725 --> 01:27:13,228
but that's essentially where

2669
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:14,229
I'm kind of that well,

2670
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:16,464
I've been there for a bit now,

2671
01:27:16,464 --> 01:27:20,034
but I wonder how you can argue there can

2672
01:27:20,034 --> 01:27:21,169
only be one

2673
01:27:22,437 --> 01:27:24,472
if we're talking about affordances,

2674
01:27:24,472 --> 01:27:26,574
if we're not talking about fine,

2675
01:27:27,709 --> 01:27:28,509
it can be one.

2676
01:27:28,509 --> 01:27:30,945
But if we're talking about affordances

2677
01:27:30,945 --> 01:27:32,747
and we're optioning out,

2678
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:36,651
how can it be less than two?

2679
01:27:36,651 --> 01:27:40,154
FRIEDMAN: The menu is not diminished by selecting

2680
01:27:40,154 --> 01:27:42,657
what you want for that meal.

2681
01:27:42,657 --> 01:27:45,393
You don't rip the rest of the menu

2682
01:27:45,393 --> 01:27:47,462
and then also read one one.

2683
01:27:48,296 --> 01:27:49,130
Just insight.

2684
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:50,131
I've never heard it

2685
01:27:50,131 --> 01:27:50,765
phrase this way,

2686
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:52,233
but it's so interesting

2687
01:27:52,233 --> 01:27:54,902
and hopefully as many people

2688
01:27:54,902 --> 01:27:57,839
including us some directions is

2689
01:27:58,273 --> 01:27:59,607
you said it's hard to discuss

2690
01:27:59,607 --> 01:28:00,842
academic subjects

2691
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:03,711
without the transmission view and.

2692
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:07,982
That's just such a fundamental point.

2693
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:11,319
One could take a sort of sociological

2694
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:14,889
critique of, academic discourse

2695
01:28:15,356 --> 01:28:17,425
and, well, the practices

2696
01:28:17,425 --> 01:28:19,260
and the networks of academics

2697
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:20,094
and the genres

2698
01:28:20,094 --> 01:28:21,863
that they write in the venues

2699
01:28:21,863 --> 01:28:23,498
and the paywalls

2700
01:28:23,498 --> 01:28:24,232
and all of these

2701
01:28:24,232 --> 01:28:26,768
different sociological features,

2702
01:28:26,768 --> 01:28:30,338
structure, academic discourse to be such

2703
01:28:30,338 --> 01:28:34,342
and such a way that can feel lifted

2704
01:28:34,342 --> 01:28:37,578
from our first order experience.

2705
01:28:38,513 --> 01:28:40,615
And this actually takes an even

2706
01:28:40,615 --> 01:28:42,216
more fundamental

2707
01:28:43,584 --> 01:28:44,552
angle,

2708
01:28:44,552 --> 01:28:44,986
which is,

2709
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:48,089
yes, those sociological features

2710
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:50,158
may be what is explained,

2711
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:52,393
but fundamentally

2712
01:28:52,393 --> 01:28:54,829
on on that topic or anything, what is it

2713
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:57,999
about this conceptual or academic mode

2714
01:28:58,733 --> 01:28:59,634
of synchronous

2715
01:28:59,634 --> 01:29:02,837
and asynchronous discourse?

2716
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:04,772
Just what is it about?

2717
01:29:04,772 --> 01:29:06,441
What is it on?

2718
01:29:06,607 --> 01:29:08,543
And how can we evolve this

2719
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:09,911
and develop this

2720
01:29:09,911 --> 01:29:12,380
to create an ecology of communicate and

2721
01:29:13,381 --> 01:29:15,650
to integrate in a new way

2722
01:29:21,089 --> 01:29:24,726
for Rémi first and then anyone.

2723
01:29:24,726 --> 01:29:25,059
TISON: So yeah,

2724
01:29:25,059 --> 01:29:26,194
I think that the

2725
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:28,329
not just the academic discussions

2726
01:29:28,329 --> 01:29:31,532
but all our conceptions of education

2727
01:29:31,532 --> 01:29:33,234
and learning are influenced

2728
01:29:33,234 --> 01:29:34,369
by this transmission view

2729
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:35,803
also because the,

2730
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:37,805
the traditional views of, of,

2731
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:41,242
of education is the notion

2732
01:29:41,242 --> 01:29:42,510
that you transmit

2733
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:44,912
a certain knowledge, a certain view,

2734
01:29:44,912 --> 01:29:45,880
a certain

2735
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,916
content to like the, the student,

2736
01:29:49,417 --> 01:29:50,418
you're the teacher

2737
01:29:50,418 --> 01:29:51,953
and you have this this content

2738
01:29:51,953 --> 01:29:53,755
and you're giving it to the

2739
01:29:53,755 --> 01:29:55,189
that's like the tradition,

2740
01:29:55,189 --> 01:29:57,325
the traditional view of education.

2741
01:29:57,325 --> 01:29:57,859
And there

2742
01:29:57,859 --> 01:29:59,861
there's been push back in recent years

2743
01:29:59,861 --> 01:30:00,428
in the

2744
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:00,661
in the

2745
01:30:00,661 --> 01:30:01,796
fields of communication

2746
01:30:01,796 --> 01:30:03,765
and trying to

2747
01:30:03,765 --> 01:30:06,134
understand education and apply

2748
01:30:06,134 --> 01:30:07,502
more participative

2749
01:30:08,803 --> 01:30:10,338
methods of learning

2750
01:30:10,338 --> 01:30:11,406
that go against that.

2751
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:12,106
But really,

2752
01:30:12,106 --> 01:30:13,908
the view of education

2753
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:15,243
as transmitting knowledge,

2754
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:17,578
I think is really closely connected

2755
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:18,513
to this transmission

2756
01:30:18,513 --> 01:30:19,580
view of communication.

2757
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:20,848
And I think that's not

2758
01:30:20,848 --> 01:30:24,252
a particularly good

2759
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:27,422
view of applying

2760
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:29,924
pedagogic pedagogic practices.

2761
01:30:29,924 --> 01:30:32,827
I think that's that's really limited.

2762
01:30:32,827 --> 01:30:34,662
And there's been

2763
01:30:34,662 --> 01:30:35,196
the advent

2764
01:30:35,196 --> 01:30:37,231
it did for my for our paper

2765
01:30:37,231 --> 01:30:38,499
in 2021 to do that.

2766
01:30:38,499 --> 01:30:39,367
But yeah,

2767
01:30:39,367 --> 01:30:40,802
there's been in recent years

2768
01:30:40,802 --> 01:30:43,004
a lot of work in fields of education

2769
01:30:43,004 --> 01:30:44,806
in trying to push back again

2770
01:30:44,806 --> 01:30:46,374
this against this transmission

2771
01:30:46,374 --> 01:30:47,275
view of education

2772
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:48,543
and trying to

2773
01:30:48,543 --> 01:30:50,011
put like, yeah,

2774
01:30:50,011 --> 01:30:51,012
I think classrooms

2775
01:30:51,012 --> 01:30:52,246
that are more interactive

2776
01:30:52,246 --> 01:30:55,049
and which there is, there's

2777
01:30:55,049 --> 01:30:56,684
active learning from the

2778
01:30:56,684 --> 01:30:58,019
from the students

2779
01:30:58,019 --> 01:31:00,087
and they're just not just the receiving

2780
01:31:00,321 --> 01:31:00,888
and knowledge,

2781
01:31:00,888 --> 01:31:01,923
but they're

2782
01:31:02,089 --> 01:31:04,992
gaining skills by acting in the in their

2783
01:31:05,393 --> 01:31:08,596
in their in their and in an environment,

2784
01:31:08,596 --> 01:31:09,697
a learning environment

2785
01:31:09,697 --> 01:31:11,332
in which they're agents

2786
01:31:11,332 --> 01:31:12,934
and not just patients.

2787
01:31:12,934 --> 01:31:13,501
So that's

2788
01:31:13,501 --> 01:31:14,702
I think that's something that's

2789
01:31:14,702 --> 01:31:18,272
also useful to to to to discuss.

2790
01:31:19,674 --> 01:31:20,508
FRIEDMAN: Yes.

2791
01:31:20,508 --> 01:31:20,942
We had

2792
01:31:20,942 --> 01:31:22,176
some great times

2793
01:31:22,176 --> 01:31:24,212
discussing instruction ism

2794
01:31:24,212 --> 01:31:25,213
and interaction

2795
01:31:25,213 --> 01:31:27,715
ism in the context of skillful

2796
01:31:27,715 --> 01:31:30,117
performance and motor commands.

2797
01:31:30,585 --> 01:31:32,620
And the discussion was,

2798
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:34,222
are you sending

2799
01:31:34,222 --> 01:31:36,691
motor commands representational?

2800
01:31:36,724 --> 01:31:39,093
Are they instructions to be carried out

2801
01:31:39,794 --> 01:31:41,462
or are they interactions

2802
01:31:41,462 --> 01:31:43,498
that are being engaged in

2803
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:44,532
that might

2804
01:31:44,532 --> 01:31:45,733
not necessitate

2805
01:31:45,733 --> 01:31:48,035
taking a representational list view?

2806
01:31:48,035 --> 01:31:51,672
And in this same spirit and strength

2807
01:31:51,672 --> 01:31:52,607
of the active inference

2808
01:31:52,607 --> 01:31:53,808
framework that we can talk

2809
01:31:53,808 --> 01:31:56,143
about patterns across systems

2810
01:31:56,911 --> 01:31:58,279
here is instruction

2811
01:31:58,279 --> 01:31:59,847
ism and interaction ism

2812
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:00,982
in a very natural

2813
01:32:00,982 --> 01:32:04,151
setting of the ecological experience

2814
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:05,820
of learning.

2815
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:09,023
And one can take various

2816
01:32:09,757 --> 01:32:10,892
critiques or angles

2817
01:32:10,892 --> 01:32:13,694
on like tabula rasa or blank slate.

2818
01:32:14,762 --> 01:32:16,797
We don't need to endorse the view.

2819
01:32:16,797 --> 01:32:18,900
However, what it implies

2820
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:22,169
quite directly is that there's a canvas

2821
01:32:22,770 --> 01:32:24,038
and things are added

2822
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:26,641
sediment on the canvas,

2823
01:32:26,641 --> 01:32:28,376
and one can see that

2824
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:29,710
some writing is on the canvas

2825
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:31,779
or it's a different shape, or

2826
01:32:31,779 --> 01:32:34,081
those are specifying the metaphor.

2827
01:32:34,081 --> 01:32:36,684
But fundamentally the

2828
01:32:36,684 --> 01:32:39,487
knowledge accretion model of education,

2829
01:32:40,021 --> 01:32:41,889
the opt in model as,

2830
01:32:41,889 --> 01:32:43,024
well as the ignorance

2831
01:32:43,024 --> 01:32:45,459
destructive model of education,

2832
01:32:45,893 --> 01:32:47,929
which is a kind of counterpoint

2833
01:32:48,362 --> 01:32:50,398
to we're going to add good knowledge.

2834
01:32:50,898 --> 01:32:52,233
And then the shadow

2835
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:54,735
that is we're going to destroy

2836
01:32:54,769 --> 01:32:57,238
bad knowledge and unlearn.

2837
01:32:57,972 --> 01:33:00,207
Both of those are like working

2838
01:33:00,207 --> 01:33:01,776
in the riverbed.

2839
01:33:01,776 --> 01:33:04,111
Are we going to sediment this way

2840
01:33:04,111 --> 01:33:06,747
or let's modify these sediments.

2841
01:33:07,448 --> 01:33:09,884
It's still seeing the product

2842
01:33:09,884 --> 01:33:11,586
of education,

2843
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:13,721
which is a totally reasonable focus

2844
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:16,257
for industries and sectors

2845
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:16,891
that are focused

2846
01:33:16,891 --> 01:33:18,726
on the products of education,

2847
01:33:18,726 --> 01:33:19,961
the products of education

2848
01:33:19,961 --> 01:33:21,796
for the student, the certificate

2849
01:33:22,964 --> 01:33:23,197
and the

2850
01:33:23,197 --> 01:33:25,766
social recognition and status thereof,

2851
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,502
or just the outcomes of education

2852
01:33:28,502 --> 01:33:29,604
for the system,

2853
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:30,871
like amount of people

2854
01:33:30,871 --> 01:33:34,642
with a certain professional training and

2855
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:38,646
what is the river that is sediment thing

2856
01:33:39,313 --> 01:33:41,582
or sediments

2857
01:33:41,849 --> 01:33:44,318
that can get dropped.

2858
01:33:44,318 --> 01:33:46,287
And that's the active term

2859
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:48,556
in education learning by doing

2860
01:33:48,556 --> 01:33:51,292
as if even a lecture is doing something,

2861
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:52,960
you're looking, you're hearing,

2862
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:54,428
you're touching.

2863
01:33:54,428 --> 01:33:55,329
So

2864
01:33:56,197 --> 01:33:57,231
it is quite

2865
01:33:57,231 --> 01:33:59,700
an exciting area to explore how

2866
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:03,037
interaction ism

2867
01:34:03,037 --> 01:34:05,740
in settings that have been considered

2868
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:07,475
educational,

2869
01:34:07,608 --> 01:34:10,044
conventionally or unconventionally,

2870
01:34:10,044 --> 01:34:12,079
what the implications are.

2871
01:34:12,947 --> 01:34:14,882
And I'm sure that next week

2872
01:34:14,882 --> 01:34:16,083
we'll be able to explore

2873
01:34:16,083 --> 01:34:19,553
many more implications as we kind of

2874
01:34:20,187 --> 01:34:20,955
have crested

2875
01:34:20,955 --> 01:34:22,356
one hill

2876
01:34:22,356 --> 01:34:24,558
and look towards some implications.

2877
01:34:24,558 --> 01:34:25,159
But

2878
01:34:25,893 --> 01:34:28,729
how do you communicate differently

2879
01:34:30,131 --> 01:34:32,500
with what you know and have done

2880
01:34:32,933 --> 01:34:34,835
in philosophy

2881
01:34:34,835 --> 01:34:36,404
and science of communication?

2882
01:34:37,972 --> 01:34:38,873
TISON: Remmy

2883
01:34:42,376 --> 01:34:43,544
I think I'm

2884
01:34:43,544 --> 01:34:45,946
really bad at applying my

2885
01:34:47,415 --> 01:34:49,850
theory of communication.

2886
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:51,052
I think I,

2887
01:34:51,052 --> 01:34:54,321
I give a class in that to come and I,

2888
01:34:54,655 --> 01:34:56,023
I always like

2889
01:34:56,023 --> 01:34:58,359
I'm angry at myself because I really

2890
01:34:59,794 --> 01:35:02,163
like just automatically applies

2891
01:35:02,163 --> 01:35:03,597
this really

2892
01:35:04,231 --> 01:35:06,934
classical way of, of,

2893
01:35:07,768 --> 01:35:09,003
of transmitting knowledge.

2894
01:35:09,003 --> 01:35:10,638
And I'm always angry at myself

2895
01:35:10,638 --> 01:35:12,473
because I don't apply enough.

2896
01:35:12,473 --> 01:35:13,741
I think my,

2897
01:35:13,874 --> 01:35:16,544
my, my own ideas about communication.

2898
01:35:16,844 --> 01:35:18,679
But the I,

2899
01:35:18,679 --> 01:35:19,413
I think I should do

2900
01:35:19,413 --> 01:35:21,649
more to, to be a better,

2901
01:35:21,649 --> 01:35:22,717
provide better evidence

2902
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:27,254
for my own theory of communication.

2903
01:35:27,254 --> 01:35:27,822
FRIEDMAN: It's funny,

2904
01:35:27,822 --> 01:35:29,323
I'm sure it'll be

2905
01:35:29,323 --> 01:35:32,827
a lifelong process for all of us

2906
01:35:32,827 --> 01:35:34,295
because we have priors

2907
01:35:34,295 --> 01:35:37,498
that are templated on the forms

2908
01:35:37,998 --> 01:35:40,701
that we know.

2909
01:35:41,168 --> 01:35:43,704
That's what was and what is

2910
01:35:44,171 --> 01:35:47,508
and what maybe

2911
01:35:47,508 --> 01:35:49,577
and then there's that expected

2912
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:50,911
free energy

2913
01:35:50,911 --> 01:35:53,814
like active communication perspective

2914
01:35:54,548 --> 01:35:56,584
and are we going to select

2915
01:35:56,984 --> 01:35:59,687
only from yesterday's menu?

2916
01:35:59,687 --> 01:36:03,090
Or can new dishes

2917
01:36:03,657 --> 01:36:05,860
and new approaches be added

2918
01:36:05,860 --> 01:36:08,028
that we may want to select from?

2919
01:36:08,028 --> 01:36:11,432
Are there new modalities or approaches

2920
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:13,601
to communication

2921
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:15,669
in educational settings or otherwise

2922
01:36:17,071 --> 01:36:19,273
that are now

2923
01:36:19,673 --> 01:36:21,876
authorized or

2924
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:26,814
enabled by this perspective?

2925
01:36:26,814 --> 01:36:29,049
I'm sure we'll continue to discuss it.

2926
01:36:29,049 --> 01:36:31,385
But let's just say this

2927
01:36:31,385 --> 01:36:33,954
paper becomes a fundamental

2928
01:36:33,954 --> 01:36:36,757
reading for a communications department

2929
01:36:37,224 --> 01:36:38,959
or for

2930
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,896
early life

2931
01:36:41,896 --> 01:36:46,000
learning group like a public school.

2932
01:36:46,634 --> 01:36:49,336
What is different

2933
01:36:49,737 --> 01:36:51,372
in the short term

2934
01:36:51,372 --> 01:36:52,940
with the structural constraints

2935
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:55,209
and opportunities that exist

2936
01:36:55,209 --> 01:36:56,777
with someone thinking

2937
01:36:56,777 --> 01:36:58,913
and acting differently,

2938
01:36:58,913 --> 01:36:59,480
and then over

2939
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:02,416
slower time scales, the coevolution

2940
01:37:02,883 --> 01:37:04,451
of those individual

2941
01:37:04,451 --> 01:37:06,720
affordances, cognitive and bodily

2942
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:08,122
affordances,

2943
01:37:08,122 --> 01:37:11,959
and the kinds of systemic alterations

2944
01:37:11,959 --> 01:37:14,428
to the education architecture, then

2945
01:37:15,930 --> 01:37:21,869
I know you'll have a thought on that.

2946
01:37:21,869 --> 01:37:24,805
TICKLES: Part of what you were speaking to

2947
01:37:24,805 --> 01:37:25,639
is just

2948
01:37:25,639 --> 01:37:27,474
simply asking as as Remi did

2949
01:37:27,474 --> 01:37:28,843
at the beginning of his paper,

2950
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:29,977
and then what happens?

2951
01:37:29,977 --> 01:37:30,511
But then

2952
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:33,881
not racing to provide the answers.

2953
01:37:34,348 --> 01:37:36,317
It's it's it's essentially

2954
01:37:37,351 --> 01:37:38,018
opening.

2955
01:37:38,018 --> 01:37:39,486
Opening up the space.

2956
01:37:39,486 --> 01:37:40,487
And then

2957
01:37:40,487 --> 01:37:41,388
and then what happens

2958
01:37:41,388 --> 01:37:43,324
might mean that you

2959
01:37:43,324 --> 01:37:44,692
you move out of the classroom

2960
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:45,826
and you

2961
01:37:45,826 --> 01:37:48,629
and you take the classroom, migrates to

2962
01:37:49,330 --> 01:37:51,332
to the lookout on Mount Royal or you

2963
01:37:51,699 --> 01:37:54,101
or you you simply don't intervene.

2964
01:37:54,401 --> 01:37:56,637
You you kind of let the ecology

2965
01:37:56,937 --> 01:37:57,972
work itself through.

2966
01:37:57,972 --> 01:37:59,473
Now, that could be very

2967
01:37:59,473 --> 01:38:00,374
scary at first

2968
01:38:00,374 --> 01:38:01,508
because of course,

2969
01:38:01,508 --> 01:38:02,209
you're supposed to be

2970
01:38:02,209 --> 01:38:03,911
the one herding the cats.

2971
01:38:03,911 --> 01:38:06,180
But if you let the herd piece of it off

2972
01:38:06,747 --> 01:38:09,183
and see what cats do when

2973
01:38:10,217 --> 01:38:12,453
you're allowed to sort of

2974
01:38:12,686 --> 01:38:14,021
free think,

2975
01:38:14,021 --> 01:38:14,788
I think

2976
01:38:14,788 --> 01:38:16,924
I don't know that it provides the

2977
01:38:17,491 --> 01:38:19,426
the absolute specific answer,

2978
01:38:19,426 --> 01:38:20,661
but it will provide you

2979
01:38:20,661 --> 01:38:22,830
that joint action opportunity.

2980
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:23,664
If you're

2981
01:38:23,664 --> 01:38:24,732
if you're really, truly looking

2982
01:38:24,732 --> 01:38:25,699
for affordances

2983
01:38:27,001 --> 01:38:29,169
as opposed to specifics.

2984
01:38:30,137 --> 01:38:32,439
And and again, I think

2985
01:38:32,439 --> 01:38:36,010
even in an academic setting,

2986
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:37,778
I don't think it's I don't think it's

2987
01:38:37,778 --> 01:38:38,679
too far of a stretch

2988
01:38:38,679 --> 01:38:40,981
to say affordances matter.

2989
01:38:41,348 --> 01:38:42,917
And we would like to see

2990
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:44,785
if people can exercise those things.

2991
01:38:44,785 --> 01:38:47,087
We just want to get to crazy, right.

2992
01:38:51,258 --> 01:38:53,961
FRIEDMAN: Norms and guidelines

2993
01:38:54,461 --> 01:38:57,031
for affordances

2994
01:38:57,932 --> 01:38:58,699
help.

2995
01:38:59,033 --> 01:39:00,301
Don't know what else to say,

2996
01:39:00,301 --> 01:39:01,502
but certainly there are things

2997
01:39:01,502 --> 01:39:02,736
that one would prefer

2998
01:39:02,736 --> 01:39:05,406
not to see occur in a learning setting.

2999
01:39:05,973 --> 01:39:06,440
Right.

3000
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:08,108
Easy to enumerate.

3001
01:39:08,108 --> 01:39:11,312
And then there are the known

3002
01:39:11,312 --> 01:39:13,781
beneficial affordances or phenomena

3003
01:39:13,781 --> 01:39:17,017
and then part of interaction ism

3004
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:20,654
seems to leave the unknown unknown

3005
01:39:20,988 --> 01:39:23,791
quadrants open

3006
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:25,793
and to allow for

3007
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:29,296
individual or for collective outcomes

3008
01:39:29,897 --> 01:39:31,966
that are surprising and maybe not

3009
01:39:32,533 --> 01:39:35,002
explicitly navigated towards or

3010
01:39:35,002 --> 01:39:37,071
planned for.

3011
01:39:37,071 --> 01:39:38,272
But how to leave

3012
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:41,875
the unknown unknowns open

3013
01:39:41,875 --> 01:39:45,112
while derisking unknowns

3014
01:39:45,112 --> 01:39:48,082
and knowns is a challenge.

3015
01:39:48,382 --> 01:39:50,651
And so again, it's natural to see where

3016
01:39:51,585 --> 01:39:53,921
in the de-risking imperative

3017
01:39:54,688 --> 01:39:56,790
we de-risk

3018
01:39:57,992 --> 01:39:58,959
everything.

3019
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,695
And that introduces like

3020
01:40:01,695 --> 01:40:03,364
second order risks.

3021
01:40:03,364 --> 01:40:05,599
And it closes the door

3022
01:40:05,599 --> 01:40:08,268
on what may have even been the purpose.

3023
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:11,105
I mean, what's the safest car,

3024
01:40:11,105 --> 01:40:13,207
the one that doesn't move

3025
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:17,311
in that one limited local optimization

3026
01:40:17,311 --> 01:40:19,046
of like reducing the number

3027
01:40:19,046 --> 01:40:20,714
of high speed collisions

3028
01:40:20,714 --> 01:40:24,618
or something like that?

3029
01:40:24,618 --> 01:40:27,354
Yes, Remmy.

3030
01:40:27,354 --> 01:40:29,056
TISON: And so on that topic,

3031
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:30,824
I think there's

3032
01:40:30,824 --> 01:40:32,493
Bloomberg in the world

3033
01:40:32,493 --> 01:40:34,628
and give us time to talk about

3034
01:40:34,628 --> 01:40:38,132
an optimal grip on the field of.

3035
01:40:38,132 --> 01:40:38,966
I didn't see it,

3036
01:40:38,966 --> 01:40:40,501
I think, but their work was a great,

3037
01:40:40,501 --> 01:40:41,902
inspiring inspiration

3038
01:40:41,902 --> 01:40:44,371
for for my own work.

3039
01:40:44,371 --> 01:40:45,973
So they talk about an optimal grip

3040
01:40:45,973 --> 01:40:48,108
on the on that field of affordances.

3041
01:40:48,108 --> 01:40:49,510
And there's like

3042
01:40:50,744 --> 01:40:52,846
you're always trying to stay

3043
01:40:52,846 --> 01:40:55,849
in the point where you're there is like

3044
01:40:57,484 --> 01:40:58,452
the relevant

3045
01:40:58,452 --> 01:40:59,987
affordances are open to you,

3046
01:40:59,987 --> 01:41:01,021
but you stay,

3047
01:41:01,021 --> 01:41:02,523
you stay at the same time

3048
01:41:02,523 --> 01:41:05,359
open to switching to other F audiences.

3049
01:41:05,626 --> 01:41:07,861
And you're trying to,

3050
01:41:08,162 --> 01:41:09,630
in that process of interaction

3051
01:41:09,630 --> 01:41:10,764
with your field of affordances,

3052
01:41:10,764 --> 01:41:11,832
continually minimize

3053
01:41:11,832 --> 01:41:13,133
your own free in there in G.

3054
01:41:13,133 --> 01:41:15,302
But there is there's risk in that.

3055
01:41:15,302 --> 01:41:16,136
So there's

3056
01:41:16,203 --> 01:41:17,971
the idea that the example that they give

3057
01:41:17,971 --> 01:41:18,972
is the boxer

3058
01:41:18,972 --> 01:41:20,307
who was trying to maintain

3059
01:41:20,307 --> 01:41:22,643
a certain distance to its opponent,

3060
01:41:22,876 --> 01:41:24,511
because at that distance

3061
01:41:24,511 --> 01:41:27,081
it's the boxer is fighter.

3062
01:41:27,247 --> 01:41:29,049
It cannot reach with its punches.

3063
01:41:29,049 --> 01:41:30,150
If it's too close,

3064
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:32,219
maybe there's less impact

3065
01:41:32,252 --> 01:41:33,120
and maybe it's more

3066
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:34,721
open to it to be in it.

3067
01:41:34,721 --> 01:41:37,124
So there's like this optimal distance

3068
01:41:37,124 --> 01:41:38,759
to which the boxer as light,

3069
01:41:38,759 --> 01:41:42,029
flexible and multiple opportunities

3070
01:41:42,262 --> 01:41:42,963
that it can

3071
01:41:44,298 --> 01:41:45,566
the boxer can take.

3072
01:41:45,566 --> 01:41:46,400
And I

3073
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:46,900
think that's

3074
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:48,502
what we were always trying to do.

3075
01:41:48,502 --> 01:41:48,869
We're trying

3076
01:41:48,869 --> 01:41:51,872
to get to this optimal grip,

3077
01:41:51,872 --> 01:41:53,340
as did the field of affordances

3078
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:54,274
in which

3079
01:41:54,341 --> 01:41:57,311
there's multiple affordances, that

3080
01:41:57,311 --> 01:41:59,413
forward energy minimization,

3081
01:41:59,413 --> 01:42:01,548
and that we want to take that.

3082
01:42:01,548 --> 01:42:03,283
And that's obviously

3083
01:42:03,283 --> 01:42:05,352
something that can be hard to do.

3084
01:42:05,519 --> 01:42:06,620
But we have

3085
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:08,956
through our skillful interaction with

3086
01:42:09,456 --> 01:42:12,092
the environment, we learn these kinds of

3087
01:42:12,826 --> 01:42:13,861
of gradients.

3088
01:42:13,861 --> 01:42:16,163
Where should we go in the

3089
01:42:17,164 --> 01:42:18,232
in our environment

3090
01:42:18,232 --> 01:42:20,234
in order to find these optimal groups?

3091
01:42:20,234 --> 01:42:21,802
And like you're speaking about car,

3092
01:42:21,802 --> 01:42:23,971
I guess depending on your skill,

3093
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:25,172
you might want different car

3094
01:42:25,172 --> 01:42:27,141
to get this optimal grip on the

3095
01:42:27,141 --> 01:42:29,209
on the, on the road.

3096
01:42:29,209 --> 01:42:30,410
If you're like a fast driver

3097
01:42:30,410 --> 01:42:31,712
who likes to go

3098
01:42:31,712 --> 01:42:32,312
go really fast,

3099
01:42:32,312 --> 01:42:34,014
you might want a faster car.

3100
01:42:34,014 --> 01:42:34,982
But if you go too far

3101
01:42:34,982 --> 01:42:36,316
and you're getting an accident,

3102
01:42:36,316 --> 01:42:37,718
so there's depending on

3103
01:42:37,718 --> 01:42:39,153
our skills, there's different

3104
01:42:40,087 --> 01:42:41,755
optimal grips on the road feel develop

3105
01:42:41,755 --> 01:42:42,956
audience and something

3106
01:42:42,956 --> 01:42:45,592
was really afraid to go might go with it

3107
01:42:45,592 --> 01:42:47,661
like really slow car and that would be

3108
01:42:47,928 --> 01:42:49,429
it's that person's

3109
01:42:49,429 --> 01:42:50,998
optimal grip on the road.

3110
01:42:50,998 --> 01:42:52,232
That would be the

3111
01:42:52,232 --> 01:42:54,935
this would provide for for this person.

3112
01:42:55,302 --> 01:42:58,205
So that made me think about that.

3113
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:02,809
So some comments on optimal grip.

3114
01:43:02,809 --> 01:43:04,945
Thanks for bringing in yellow

3115
01:43:04,945 --> 01:43:06,380
all work it's

3116
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:07,781
it's really nice

3117
01:43:07,781 --> 01:43:08,649
that that was brought in

3118
01:43:08,649 --> 01:43:09,850
even several years ago

3119
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:12,286
into the active inference literature

3120
01:43:12,819 --> 01:43:15,355
and if we're imagining

3121
01:43:15,355 --> 01:43:18,425
tactile grip actual prevention

3122
01:43:19,526 --> 01:43:20,961
if we're not in a grip

3123
01:43:20,961 --> 01:43:23,230
strength competition

3124
01:43:23,230 --> 01:43:24,731
where one might just

3125
01:43:24,731 --> 01:43:27,401
monotonically prefer more grip,

3126
01:43:28,035 --> 01:43:29,870
if we were like on a playgrounds

3127
01:43:29,870 --> 01:43:30,704
and we're going to be

3128
01:43:30,704 --> 01:43:32,506
swinging among bars,

3129
01:43:32,506 --> 01:43:35,108
then the optimal grip has to satisfy

3130
01:43:35,976 --> 01:43:38,178
being able to keep us off the hot lava.

3131
01:43:38,178 --> 01:43:40,247
FRIEDMAN: But also it's not permanent.

3132
01:43:40,681 --> 01:43:43,183
And there's like a level of engagement

3133
01:43:43,183 --> 01:43:44,885
that is not as strong

3134
01:43:44,885 --> 01:43:45,719
as we could possibly

3135
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:46,987
grasp, but gets the job

3136
01:43:46,987 --> 01:43:48,889
done, keeps us in the air,

3137
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:50,490
and lets us easily

3138
01:43:50,490 --> 01:43:52,226
and without repetitive stress,

3139
01:43:52,226 --> 01:43:54,494
like grab the next bar.

3140
01:43:54,494 --> 01:43:57,197
So how might that be reflected

3141
01:43:57,197 --> 01:43:58,699
in some of the formal isms

3142
01:43:58,699 --> 01:44:00,367
of active inference?

3143
01:44:00,367 --> 01:44:01,668
While for expected

3144
01:44:01,668 --> 01:44:03,837
and variational free energy,

3145
01:44:04,171 --> 01:44:05,439
there are two terms.

3146
01:44:05,439 --> 01:44:06,840
One is reflecting

3147
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:08,809
a divergence minimization

3148
01:44:08,809 --> 01:44:11,612
and one is keeping the door open with

3149
01:44:12,579 --> 01:44:14,248
about future outcomes.

3150
01:44:14,248 --> 01:44:14,982
So in

3151
01:44:14,982 --> 01:44:16,083
that balance is

3152
01:44:16,083 --> 01:44:16,984
like the divergence

3153
01:44:16,984 --> 01:44:19,253
minimization of the boxer.

3154
01:44:19,253 --> 01:44:20,821
But then also there is something

3155
01:44:20,821 --> 01:44:22,422
about keeping it open

3156
01:44:22,422 --> 01:44:23,323
and then

3157
01:44:23,323 --> 01:44:25,592
it makes me wonder about optimal grip

3158
01:44:25,592 --> 01:44:28,195
with some of these educational

3159
01:44:28,562 --> 01:44:30,264
and academic ideas.

3160
01:44:30,264 --> 01:44:31,965
What is the optimal

3161
01:44:31,965 --> 01:44:35,969
in a given context of thermodynamics?

3162
01:44:36,870 --> 01:44:38,405
Could it be the optimal grip

3163
01:44:38,405 --> 01:44:40,140
in a easygoing

3164
01:44:40,140 --> 01:44:44,011
chill, qualitative conversation to know

3165
01:44:44,011 --> 01:44:46,380
that thermodynamics has to do with

3166
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:49,016
things like temperature?

3167
01:44:49,016 --> 01:44:51,151
And now we're going to talk

3168
01:44:51,151 --> 01:44:53,020
about something adjacent to it.

3169
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:54,521
That was just one

3170
01:44:54,521 --> 01:44:57,391
bar on the playground to jump among.

3171
01:44:58,258 --> 01:45:00,627
And so what does optimal grip

3172
01:45:00,961 --> 01:45:01,862
and feel like

3173
01:45:01,862 --> 01:45:04,097
and what are the ecologies that support

3174
01:45:04,865 --> 01:45:07,100
different individuals, optimal grip

3175
01:45:07,567 --> 01:45:10,237
on different concepts so that

3176
01:45:11,805 --> 01:45:13,307
people can be

3177
01:45:13,307 --> 01:45:15,242
engaging and interacting in a

3178
01:45:15,242 --> 01:45:18,412
way that is natural and and

3179
01:45:19,479 --> 01:45:21,615
seamless for them.

3180
01:45:21,615 --> 01:45:22,683
Yeah. Remi.

3181
01:45:23,417 --> 01:45:25,952
TISON: I think there's a case where did that

3182
01:45:26,219 --> 01:45:27,421
usually to get to talking

3183
01:45:27,421 --> 01:45:29,289
about the tactile grips

3184
01:45:29,289 --> 01:45:31,258
there can be an optimal grip in

3185
01:45:31,258 --> 01:45:32,459
in that sense.

3186
01:45:32,459 --> 01:45:33,093
And I think

3187
01:45:33,093 --> 01:45:35,162
in the communicative context,

3188
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:37,264
we can also see, for instance, the

3189
01:45:37,264 --> 01:45:39,266
the case where we're in

3190
01:45:39,266 --> 01:45:40,567
that we talked about example

3191
01:45:40,567 --> 01:45:42,636
of moving furniture together.

3192
01:45:42,636 --> 01:45:43,537
There is this

3193
01:45:43,537 --> 01:45:44,604
this optimal grip

3194
01:45:44,604 --> 01:45:45,038
where, okay,

3195
01:45:45,038 --> 01:45:46,673
you're holding the couch

3196
01:45:46,673 --> 01:45:48,308
and you can feel it slipping

3197
01:45:48,308 --> 01:45:49,142
sometimes and you're like,

3198
01:45:49,142 --> 01:45:51,745
oh dear, I must get a better grip.

3199
01:45:51,945 --> 01:45:52,879
But in that case,

3200
01:45:52,879 --> 01:45:55,415
you have an interactive component

3201
01:45:55,415 --> 01:45:56,850
and you have a communicative component

3202
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:57,751
because you can see

3203
01:45:57,751 --> 01:45:59,086
when you're feeling your grip

3204
01:45:59,086 --> 01:46:00,554
slips, you can see stuff

3205
01:46:00,554 --> 01:46:03,423
to the other person, to okay, so

3206
01:46:03,790 --> 01:46:05,759
to the other person can stop moving

3207
01:46:05,759 --> 01:46:06,993
and then you can get a better grip

3208
01:46:06,993 --> 01:46:07,928
on the on the couch.

3209
01:46:07,928 --> 01:46:10,230
So this aspect that

3210
01:46:10,230 --> 01:46:11,732
the idea that we tried to

3211
01:46:11,732 --> 01:46:12,566
to put in

3212
01:46:12,566 --> 01:46:13,233
in the paper

3213
01:46:13,233 --> 01:46:13,934
when we were talking

3214
01:46:13,934 --> 01:46:16,570
about cooperative communication is that

3215
01:46:16,570 --> 01:46:17,971
there can be an optimal grip

3216
01:46:17,971 --> 01:46:18,805
from a collective,

3217
01:46:18,805 --> 01:46:20,941
from an interactive perspective.

3218
01:46:21,108 --> 01:46:22,142
And communication

3219
01:46:22,142 --> 01:46:23,176
is a way of achieving

3220
01:46:23,176 --> 01:46:25,579
that, of achieving an optimal grip

3221
01:46:25,812 --> 01:46:28,281
by a group of individuals under

3222
01:46:28,982 --> 01:46:30,617
under the context of their

3223
01:46:30,617 --> 01:46:31,585
their joint action.

3224
01:46:31,585 --> 01:46:32,452
And so, for example,

3225
01:46:32,452 --> 01:46:33,420
if I'm

3226
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:35,255
moving a couch with somebody

3227
01:46:35,255 --> 01:46:36,990
and I feel my grip slipping,

3228
01:46:36,990 --> 01:46:39,092
I can say, oh, stop, because it will

3229
01:46:39,426 --> 01:46:41,762
it will stop the couch from moving,

3230
01:46:41,762 --> 01:46:43,330
and then it will help me

3231
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:44,331
get a better grip

3232
01:46:44,331 --> 01:46:45,232
in the literal

3233
01:46:45,232 --> 01:46:47,401
and figurative sense on the couch

3234
01:46:47,401 --> 01:46:49,636
so that we can further advance

3235
01:46:49,636 --> 01:46:54,508
our joint action of moving that couch.

3236
01:46:54,508 --> 01:46:55,242
FRIEDMAN: Thank you, Bleu.

3237
01:46:57,711 --> 01:46:59,813
KNIGHT: So something else like where

3238
01:46:59,813 --> 01:47:01,548
is an interesting place where we have

3239
01:47:01,548 --> 01:47:01,948
grip, where

3240
01:47:01,948 --> 01:47:03,517
we don't always think about it

3241
01:47:03,517 --> 01:47:07,220
is in the in the mental capacity.

3242
01:47:07,220 --> 01:47:11,057
So like when you talk about overthinking

3243
01:47:11,091 --> 01:47:12,426
so like you think something

3244
01:47:12,426 --> 01:47:14,861
you can under think underprepared

3245
01:47:15,395 --> 01:47:17,597
and then you can also overthink.

3246
01:47:17,597 --> 01:47:20,333
So there's also this optimal space.

3247
01:47:20,333 --> 01:47:23,136
And just as a practitioner of meditation

3248
01:47:23,136 --> 01:47:24,471
for a long time,

3249
01:47:24,838 --> 01:47:26,406
when you're meditating on something,

3250
01:47:26,406 --> 01:47:27,207
it's the same,

3251
01:47:27,207 --> 01:47:28,909
so like it's like this over

3252
01:47:28,909 --> 01:47:30,877
focus, like you have to hold it

3253
01:47:30,877 --> 01:47:32,712
there, the object of your meditation.

3254
01:47:32,712 --> 01:47:34,714
But like if you squeeze too tight,

3255
01:47:34,714 --> 01:47:36,583
like if you focus on it too intently

3256
01:47:36,583 --> 01:47:38,151
goes away, it pops up.

3257
01:47:38,151 --> 01:47:39,386
And lots of things are like,

3258
01:47:39,386 --> 01:47:39,619
I mean,

3259
01:47:39,619 --> 01:47:41,288
even if you literally grip something,

3260
01:47:41,288 --> 01:47:42,289
if you squeeze it too tight,

3261
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:43,623
it will pop out of your hand.

3262
01:47:43,623 --> 01:47:44,491
Just that the force

3263
01:47:44,491 --> 01:47:46,593
and the philosopher's acts

3264
01:47:46,593 --> 01:47:47,194
make it that way.

3265
01:47:47,194 --> 01:47:48,695
So I just wanted to bring that up.

3266
01:47:49,830 --> 01:47:50,130
FRIEDMAN: Thank you.

3267
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:50,897
Bleu one.

3268
01:47:50,897 --> 01:47:53,366
No, on the couch moving example.

3269
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:54,000
It's quickly

3270
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,235
become our favorite example.

3271
01:47:55,235 --> 01:47:56,570
We should definitely do some

3272
01:47:56,570 --> 01:48:00,874
visuals next time.

3273
01:48:00,874 --> 01:48:02,509
It's it's an

3274
01:48:02,509 --> 01:48:04,110
interesting example

3275
01:48:04,110 --> 01:48:06,546
because the communication

3276
01:48:06,546 --> 01:48:10,016
candy representational and linguistic,

3277
01:48:10,016 --> 01:48:11,885
we don't have enough room for my right

3278
01:48:11,885 --> 01:48:13,987
hand to come through this doorway.

3279
01:48:13,987 --> 01:48:16,923
It's very transmission view compatible,

3280
01:48:17,424 --> 01:48:18,258
but also there's

3281
01:48:18,258 --> 01:48:21,895
a direct, continuous time

3282
01:48:22,262 --> 01:48:23,129
communication

3283
01:48:23,129 --> 01:48:25,665
through the mechanics of the couch

3284
01:48:26,199 --> 01:48:27,534
that are synchronously

3285
01:48:27,534 --> 01:48:29,703
being experienced in real time

3286
01:48:29,703 --> 01:48:32,672
and mediated through artifacts

3287
01:48:32,672 --> 01:48:35,408
and through the niche itself.

3288
01:48:35,408 --> 01:48:37,978
Linguistic communication

3289
01:48:37,978 --> 01:48:40,981
has a linear, sequential

3290
01:48:40,981 --> 01:48:44,317
and turn taking aspect.

3291
01:48:44,317 --> 01:48:47,654
Active listening is a practice that

3292
01:48:49,189 --> 01:48:50,257
from the point of view

3293
01:48:50,257 --> 01:48:52,325
of the active listener,

3294
01:48:52,325 --> 01:48:55,028
whether they speak or not,

3295
01:48:55,028 --> 01:48:57,898
brings that real time and continuous

3296
01:48:58,164 --> 01:49:00,600
engagement to the discourse.

3297
01:49:00,901 --> 01:49:02,602
Even if they're listening to a recording

3298
01:49:02,602 --> 01:49:04,170
or whether they're participating or

3299
01:49:04,170 --> 01:49:05,372
listening in a conversation.

3300
01:49:06,907 --> 01:49:07,541
However

3301
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:08,375
it, feels like something

3302
01:49:08,375 --> 01:49:10,544
really important to unpack

3303
01:49:10,544 --> 01:49:11,611
as we look towards

3304
01:49:11,611 --> 01:49:12,812
the linguistic direction

3305
01:49:12,812 --> 01:49:14,314
to differentiate settings

3306
01:49:14,314 --> 01:49:16,683
where like through digital stigma g

3307
01:49:16,716 --> 01:49:18,151
and note taking

3308
01:49:18,151 --> 01:49:20,787
or through physical objects

3309
01:49:20,787 --> 01:49:22,188
like a rowing team

3310
01:49:22,188 --> 01:49:23,990
or the moving the couch,

3311
01:49:23,990 --> 01:49:25,926
there's a mediation

3312
01:49:25,926 --> 01:49:28,828
through the environments continuously

3313
01:49:29,229 --> 01:49:30,864
as opposed to

3314
01:49:30,864 --> 01:49:33,033
something like a correspondence

3315
01:49:33,033 --> 01:49:35,268
chess game or a phone call

3316
01:49:35,735 --> 01:49:37,170
where there's a linear

3317
01:49:37,170 --> 01:49:39,906
turn taking sedimentation,

3318
01:49:40,941 --> 01:49:42,208
even though there may still be

3319
01:49:42,208 --> 01:49:44,377
a continuous unfolding of experience

3320
01:49:44,377 --> 01:49:45,779
for the agents.

3321
01:49:45,779 --> 01:49:48,615
So that is a very rich area to look at.

3322
01:49:48,982 --> 01:49:49,749
Dean

3323
01:49:51,318 --> 01:49:52,485
Yeah, you're

3324
01:49:52,485 --> 01:49:54,220
just you're jumping in

3325
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:55,722
and saying things that I want to say.

3326
01:49:55,722 --> 01:49:57,157
So obviously the

3327
01:49:57,157 --> 01:49:58,058
some sort of substantive

3328
01:49:58,058 --> 01:49:59,492
simpatico is going on

3329
01:49:59,492 --> 01:50:00,327
communication wise.

3330
01:50:00,327 --> 01:50:01,628
But I was going to say,

3331
01:50:01,628 --> 01:50:02,963
I was going to kind of

3332
01:50:02,963 --> 01:50:04,197
now I'm going to build off what you said

3333
01:50:04,197 --> 01:50:05,632
and what you said.

3334
01:50:05,632 --> 01:50:07,033
One of the things that we used to always

3335
01:50:07,033 --> 01:50:08,902
bring to people's attention

3336
01:50:08,902 --> 01:50:10,737
in terms of their field of affordances,

3337
01:50:10,737 --> 01:50:11,371
that when you're

3338
01:50:11,371 --> 01:50:12,973
having to explain something, you have

3339
01:50:12,973 --> 01:50:13,740
to take your time.

3340
01:50:14,841 --> 01:50:16,009
TICKLES: You have to slow down.

3341
01:50:16,009 --> 01:50:17,911
I was working with younger people.

3342
01:50:17,911 --> 01:50:20,547
You have to slow down.

3343
01:50:20,547 --> 01:50:22,782
But the also the other part of it is

3344
01:50:22,782 --> 01:50:25,418
you have to know when to hit the hand up

3345
01:50:25,952 --> 01:50:28,021
reaction button in the zoom call.

3346
01:50:28,021 --> 01:50:29,789
You have to time your take

3347
01:50:29,789 --> 01:50:31,558
for full effect.

3348
01:50:31,558 --> 01:50:33,193
So you have to know

3349
01:50:33,193 --> 01:50:36,429
both of those relativities

3350
01:50:37,097 --> 01:50:39,366
when we're talking about communication

3351
01:50:39,366 --> 01:50:41,034
because if you are,

3352
01:50:41,034 --> 01:50:42,636
you can show your passion

3353
01:50:42,636 --> 01:50:43,336
by constantly

3354
01:50:43,336 --> 01:50:44,771
interrupting another person

3355
01:50:44,771 --> 01:50:47,374
and actually do yourself a disfavor.

3356
01:50:47,374 --> 01:50:49,542
So the first thing was always slow down.

3357
01:50:50,210 --> 01:50:52,379
The second thing was always think about

3358
01:50:52,379 --> 01:50:54,314
when you're putting up your hand,

3359
01:50:54,314 --> 01:50:56,449
think about when it's your turn.

3360
01:50:56,449 --> 01:50:57,517
Allow sometimes

3361
01:50:57,517 --> 01:51:00,587
for there to be a pregnant pause.

3362
01:51:00,587 --> 01:51:02,355
I know Daniel's very gifted at this.

3363
01:51:02,355 --> 01:51:03,423
There's lots and lots of times

3364
01:51:03,423 --> 01:51:04,591
as the moderator,

3365
01:51:04,591 --> 01:51:06,893
he could just fill in the space.

3366
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:08,862
But he's really, really good

3367
01:51:08,862 --> 01:51:09,529
at sometimes

3368
01:51:09,529 --> 01:51:11,264
letting the communication happen

3369
01:51:11,264 --> 01:51:12,265
when nothing is said.

3370
01:51:12,265 --> 01:51:14,167
So I'm going back to what he was asking

3371
01:51:14,167 --> 01:51:15,101
earlier is

3372
01:51:15,101 --> 01:51:16,636
can we signal something

3373
01:51:16,636 --> 01:51:18,171
by not saying something?

3374
01:51:18,171 --> 01:51:20,340
And I didn't jump in then, but

3375
01:51:21,041 --> 01:51:22,542
I was kind of hoping to be able

3376
01:51:22,542 --> 01:51:23,410
to explain that before

3377
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:24,978
we have to sign off today,

3378
01:51:24,978 --> 01:51:26,746
because that's a perfect example

3379
01:51:26,746 --> 01:51:28,982
of actually doing the signaling

3380
01:51:28,982 --> 01:51:31,384
without manipulating the symbols

3381
01:51:31,618 --> 01:51:36,456
per se.

3382
01:51:36,456 --> 01:51:37,457
FRIEDMAN: Interesting stuff.

3383
01:51:38,558 --> 01:51:40,660
Does anyone have any

3384
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:43,863
final thoughts in this one?

3385
01:51:43,863 --> 01:51:45,865
Yes, please. Renny.

3386
01:51:45,865 --> 01:51:46,132
TISON: Yeah.

3387
01:51:46,232 --> 01:51:49,269
Just quickly, the the the idea that

3388
01:51:49,269 --> 01:51:51,805
there's like a still in the

3389
01:51:52,505 --> 01:51:55,241
when to intervene speak too much speak

3390
01:51:55,241 --> 01:51:55,775
not enough.

3391
01:51:55,775 --> 01:51:57,110
It's it's like this

3392
01:51:57,110 --> 01:51:58,178
the dimension that went through

3393
01:51:58,178 --> 01:52:00,280
what is called pragmatics in

3394
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:01,781
in in linguistics.

3395
01:52:01,781 --> 01:52:04,284
And there's a really clear

3396
01:52:04,284 --> 01:52:06,720
of the notion of an optimal grip.

3397
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:08,388
Again, in terms of distance,

3398
01:52:08,388 --> 01:52:10,790
there's not an appropriate distance

3399
01:52:10,957 --> 01:52:11,591
to which you

3400
01:52:11,591 --> 01:52:14,060
you must send to your interlocutor.

3401
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:16,463
And that varies in function of culture.

3402
01:52:16,463 --> 01:52:17,430
So if you're really

3403
01:52:17,430 --> 01:52:18,498
so it's in some culture

3404
01:52:18,498 --> 01:52:19,999
and some for some person

3405
01:52:19,999 --> 01:52:21,234
it can be like really close

3406
01:52:21,234 --> 01:52:23,303
to you and your income for public for

3407
01:52:23,403 --> 01:52:24,037
but for them

3408
01:52:24,037 --> 01:52:25,705
it might be their, their optimal grip

3409
01:52:25,705 --> 01:52:27,340
in this communicative interaction

3410
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:28,641
for their for others.

3411
01:52:28,641 --> 01:52:31,044
Maybe your, your, you must be faster.

3412
01:52:31,044 --> 01:52:32,278
But then if you're too far, then

3413
01:52:32,278 --> 01:52:34,013
you might you're bad

3414
01:52:36,149 --> 01:52:36,983
less, less

3415
01:52:36,983 --> 01:52:38,318
and less good

3416
01:52:38,318 --> 01:52:39,285
understanding of what

3417
01:52:39,285 --> 01:52:40,553
this person is saying.

3418
01:52:40,553 --> 01:52:42,222
So there's this optimal group

3419
01:52:42,222 --> 01:52:43,890
also in the pragmatics

3420
01:52:43,890 --> 01:52:45,291
of the interaction that yes,

3421
01:52:45,291 --> 01:52:51,064
I think that was a good point.

3422
01:52:51,064 --> 01:52:54,467
FRIEDMAN: Optimal grip in space and time

3423
01:52:54,901 --> 01:52:58,138
and meaning, many spaces for.

3424
01:52:58,138 --> 01:52:59,873
A conversation.

3425
01:52:59,873 --> 01:53:03,143
Are you intimately familiar

3426
01:53:03,476 --> 01:53:06,312
and perturbing and six inches away

3427
01:53:07,013 --> 01:53:10,083
or are you yelling purely

3428
01:53:10,083 --> 01:53:12,185
strategic, impersonal information

3429
01:53:12,185 --> 01:53:14,487
from across the fields?

3430
01:53:14,487 --> 01:53:16,790
A lot of different ecologies,

3431
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:17,624
a lot of different agents.

3432
01:53:17,624 --> 01:53:22,495
So a lot of different communications,

3433
01:53:22,495 --> 01:53:23,429
blue or green,

3434
01:53:23,429 --> 01:53:24,631
if you have any other

3435
01:53:24,631 --> 01:53:25,698
thoughts otherwise.

3436
01:53:25,698 --> 01:53:29,035
That brings us to a very nice end

3437
01:53:29,736 --> 01:53:32,405
of 48 one,

3438
01:53:32,405 --> 01:53:32,739
and I'm

3439
01:53:32,739 --> 01:53:34,140
sure it'll be a great discussion

3440
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:40,146
to continue next week.

3441
01:53:40,146 --> 01:53:41,881
KNIGHT: Thanks for providing us

3442
01:53:41,881 --> 01:53:43,950
with such beefy, juicy

3443
01:53:44,551 --> 01:53:45,919
stuff to talk about.

3444
01:53:45,919 --> 01:53:47,187
I really enjoyed the paper

3445
01:53:47,187 --> 01:53:48,288
having you here. It's great.

3446
01:53:50,223 --> 01:53:50,523
TICKLES: Thank you.

3447
01:53:50,523 --> 01:53:51,424
Completely concur.

3448
01:53:51,424 --> 01:53:53,459
Review is a fantastic paper

3449
01:53:53,459 --> 01:53:54,327
and as I said,

3450
01:53:54,327 --> 01:53:56,229
there's nothing that I find

3451
01:53:56,229 --> 01:53:58,264
more intriguing when somebody writes

3452
01:53:58,264 --> 01:53:59,265
something down

3453
01:53:59,265 --> 01:54:01,434
not as providing all the answers,

3454
01:54:01,434 --> 01:54:02,735
but as opening up

3455
01:54:02,735 --> 01:54:04,270
all all these questions

3456
01:54:04,270 --> 01:54:06,105
that we've been able to share today.

3457
01:54:06,105 --> 01:54:08,441
So I'm very I'm

3458
01:54:08,474 --> 01:54:09,008
very happy

3459
01:54:09,008 --> 01:54:12,278
that you were able to join us.

3460
01:54:12,278 --> 01:54:12,946
FRIEDMAN: All right.

3461
01:54:12,946 --> 01:54:13,847
Thank you all.

3462
01:54:13,847 --> 01:54:16,349
See you next week.
