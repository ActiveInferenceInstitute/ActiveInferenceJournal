[Music]

5
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,539
all right

6
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,219
hello welcome it is September 2nd 2022.

7
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,100
and we're in active live stream number

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,320
48.0

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,000
welcome to the active inference

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,340
Institute we're a participatory online

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,860
Institute that is communicating learning

12
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,680
and practicing applied active inference

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,020
this is a recorded in archive live

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,059
stream so please provide feedback so we

15
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:55,800
can improve our work

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,140
all backgrounds and perspectives are

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,600
welcome and we'll be following video

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,940
etiquette for live streams

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,700
head to

20
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,680
activeinference.org or

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,240
activeinference.institute to come to our

22
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,760
website learn more

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,979
we are in active stream number 48 series

24
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:18,560
we're going to be discussing the paper

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,360
communication as socially extended

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,580
active inference and ecological approach

27
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,060
to communicative Behavior paper in 2021

28
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,720
by Remy Tucson and pierre-poyer the

29
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,360
video is a total introduction to some of

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,780
these ideas it's not a review or uh

31
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,180
capturing every aspect for that you can

32
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,220
read the paper and explore some of the

33
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,479
ideas

34
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,119
we are going to talk about aims and

35
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,520
claims abstract roadmap keywords and

36
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,579
bring up some notable points

37
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,299
it is still upcoming with the 48.1 and

38
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,659
48.2 so people are welcome to submit

39
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,820
questions or things to discuss write

40
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,159
comments and join the panel's live if

41
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,420
they want

42
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,740
so

43
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,719
let's begin with introductions and

44
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,780
warm-up I think we can share more uh

45
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,940
with our big question so Dean why don't

46
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,800
you say hello and introduce your big

47
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,780
question

48
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,879
thanks Daniel I'm Dina I'm here in

49
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,819
Calgary and um

50
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,160
well I could I could read out the big

51
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,720
question but it's pretty long-winded so

52
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,700
I'll just say that I'm always curious

53
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,980
about what happens when active inference

54
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,140
isn't something that we look at as a

55
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,640
subject or a topic but it's something

56
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,700
that we actually use or perceive as

57
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,280
being around us and so I think the

58
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,319
question of whether or not

59
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,840
you focus on what's inside of an

60
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,480
ecological space or or look at the

61
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,660
ecology and the system in which we

62
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,720
believe active inference

63
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,940
um

64
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,099
exists as and and maybe at within

65
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:59,519
because we in the 47 last 47 live stream

66
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,620
we kind of touched on the idea it could

67
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,580
be both

68
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,560
if we're gonna if we're going to expand

69
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,239
our Horizons and look at what kind of

70
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,159
limits are and describe that as an

71
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,720
ecology

72
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,239
um my question then is

73
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,200
as communication and of communication

74
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,459
what is the product of communication and

75
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,659
what is communication serve as so those

76
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,040
are kind of my big questions and I hope

77
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,080
in the next three live streams we can

78
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,140
start maybe at least staking out

79
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,140
where that ecology begins and ends

80
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,780
nice well very interesting thanks a lot

81
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,500
also for so much of the preparation here

82
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,159
we're uh still coming down off of 47 and

83
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,319
so I think it's gonna be interesting to

84
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,680
see how we approach pragmatism in this

85
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,659
discussions

86
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,939
so the big questions that brought me to

87
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:59,340
this paper or that I was thinking about

88
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,200
during the paper were what are the

89
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,060
applications and implications of

90
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,040
different interpretations of

91
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,540
communication

92
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,780
why does it matter what would be the

93
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,700
things in the world including the mind

94
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,560
that would be changed

95
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,918
as a factor with or Downstream of how

96
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:19,858
our interpretation of communication is

97
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,660
and then what are the causes and

98
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,740
consequences of different perspectives

99
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,600
we take on active inference where

100
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,940
perspective also includes action

101
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,560
propensity

102
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,139
and engagement with so perspective is

103
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,580
like where one is situated to end

104
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,160
viewing and so it's the view from

105
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,440
somewhere from something

106
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,979
rather than uh view from nowhere slash

107
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,320
everywhere and I think in that

108
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,360
specificity

109
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,400
we can uh have a lot of discussions

110
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,720
about ecology

111
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,620
as a great system to learn from Dean

112
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,660
yeah I think when we're outside or if we

113
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,900
perceive ourselves or we're we're

114
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,180
framing that would be the on this slide

115
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,340
that would be the first box

116
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,139
that's our sense that we're kind of

117
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,660
outside of the system looking in

118
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,199
whereas the the second box on the right

119
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,320
would be well we're embedded and now the

120
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,259
the the reason we're embedded is is the

121
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,539
genie came out got out and now it's all

122
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:23,280
around us it's kind of like

123
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,039
that the perfume has now been

124
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:27,840
distributed through the air and now

125
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,479
we're walking through it so which of

126
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,240
those two things depending upon how we

127
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,699
want to analyze which of those two

128
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,919
things produce what results sort of

129
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,180
thing and I think we're both kind of

130
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,680
asking the same question If This Then

131
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,180
what if that

132
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,580
then what

133
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,100
all right

134
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,500
I'll read the first half the abstract

135
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,020
in this paper we introduce an ecological

136
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,000
account of communication According to

137
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,160
which acts of communication are active

138
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,900
inferences achieved by affecting the

139
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,720
behavior of Target organism via the

140
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,479
modification of its field of affordances

141
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,639
constraining a Target organism's

142
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,220
Behavior constitutes a mechanism of

143
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,199
socially extended active inference

144
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,080
allowing organisms to proactively

145
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,720
regulate their interstates through the

146
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,220
behavior of other organisms

147
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,960
in this General conception of

148
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,580
communication the type of Cooperative

149
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,259
communication characteristic of human

150
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:31,740
communicative interaction is a way of

151
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,180
constraining interaction Dynamics

152
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,900
towards the goals of a given joint

153
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,280
action

154
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,979
by constructing and altering

155
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:42,780
shared fields of affordances this

156
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,360
account Embraces a pragmatist View

157
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,039
According to which communication is a

158
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,199
form of action aiming to influence the

159
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,819
behavior of a Target and stands against

160
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:55,099
the traditional transmission View

161
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:57,840
uh sorry I just have to pull it up here

162
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,599
because it kind of slid on my screen

163
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:02,880
where am I transmission view According

164
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,319
to which communication fundamentally

165
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,720
searched convey information

166
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,819
understanding acts of communication is

167
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,680
active inference under this ecological

168
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,900
interpretation allows us to link

169
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,539
communicative and ultimately linguistic

170
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:16,740
Behavior

171
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,539
to the biological imperative and

172
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,000
minimize free energy and emphasize the

173
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,620
action-oriented nature of communicative

174
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,000
action

175
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,919
interactions

176
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,080
all right nice

177
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,740
here's the roadmap and there's some

178
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,039
light sometimes consistent highlighting

179
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,419
at Play

180
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,720
the paper is prose based there are not

181
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,319
any figures or formalisms however many

182
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,039
are suggested so we'll have a

183
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,900
interesting time I think making some

184
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,360
representations using words maybe some

185
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,759
non-linguistic communication because

186
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,940
there's so much to add it's not

187
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,780
providing visual centers as many papers

188
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,199
outside of especially philosophy do so

189
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,900
first there's an introduction then the

190
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,599
central distinction or dialectic or

191
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,979
division is introduced the transmission

192
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:17,639
and the influencing the and versus but

193
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,199
or

194
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,660
the contrary to negations that we've

195
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,660
kind of explored this time that type of

196
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,819
a dyadic comparison is being brought to

197
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:29,960
two views of communication

198
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,479
two supporting Witnesses join

199
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,839
which are ecological interpretation the

200
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,140
ecological developments and the turn in

201
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,399
that area

202
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,380
and active inference

203
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,899
and they're going to then in

204
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,000
communication active inference focusing

205
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,180
on human Cooperative communication

206
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,080
describe how under ecological and active

207
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,080
inference starting points Justified

208
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,100
starting points as they'll argue that we

209
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,100
can endorse a pragmatist View

210
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,800
at the detriment to the transmission

211
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,279
View

212
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,600
any other thoughts yes

213
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,899
the authors are pretty clear they they

214
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:18,779
describe this paper or these arguments

215
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,220
as a sketch

216
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,620
so when we say roadmap here I think that

217
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,019
it's more of uh

218
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:25,740
um

219
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,880
it's it's it's not a a highly detailed

220
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,920
highly specified uh zoom in on a on a

221
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,740
you know very precise Google Map this is

222
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,080
kind of a back of the napkin idea for

223
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,580
for a conversation starter and so I

224
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,440
appreciate that because I mean at least

225
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,800
by the authors saying um we want to get

226
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,540
this down we want to stake this out and

227
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,700
then let people decide how to come at

228
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,800
this empirically to maybe fill in some

229
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,600
more of the Precision

230
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,899
yep it's like planning a road trip uh in

231
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:02,700
its implications especially without

232
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,140
itself is an entire completed work

233
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,360
um let's just jump to the aims

234
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,740
well the top two aims are some of the

235
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,839
largest they summarize their work as

236
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,180
introducing a pragmatist conception of

237
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,019
communication grounded in Ecology of

238
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,600
active inference so the three threads

239
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,420
are pragmatism ecological interpretation

240
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,860
and active inference about communication

241
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,399
and they're going to argue that all of

242
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,040
communication be understood as socially

243
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,800
extended active inference

244
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,800
be understood by whom when

245
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,740
and uh those are some of the points it

246
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,120
brings us to

247
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,540
secondly there are some direct

248
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,640
contradictions slash tensions

249
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,519
described and

250
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,500
um contrasting with the transmission

251
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,760
view which is the uh the dancing partner

252
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,560
of the advance of the ecological

253
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,980
pragmatic active view is to con is by

254
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,260
contrast with the transmission View

255
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,060
which can help a lot with literature

256
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,920
continuity

257
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,220
in in uh setting direction for research

258
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,480
field people looking for transmission

259
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,640
view can see that there's a paper

260
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,940
from 2021 that's that's connecting and

261
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,040
finding concordances and as Dean

262
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,560
mentioned they will stress in several

263
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,060
different ways that it's an initial

264
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,320
account

265
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,500
with many gestured two next directions

266
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,440
that we'll get to any other thoughts yes

267
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,740
yeah I I think without using these terms

268
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,339
they're they're saying um

269
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,779
you know there are nodes out there

270
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,519
there's there are connect there are

271
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,500
potential for connections out there one

272
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,240
way of viewing that is through a

273
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,100
transmission line and what we would like

274
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,560
to do is maybe

275
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,300
um

276
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,519
Advance the idea that those links are

277
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,620
are a little bit more embellished than

278
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,800
something simple and so again those

279
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,260
aren't the terms that they use but we've

280
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,060
uh Daniel you're better at this than I

281
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,160
am we had a recent live stream this year

282
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,500
I think where we talked about offloading

283
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,959
as being a really important part of

284
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,540
extending the active inference

285
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,160
okay

286
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,920
um remember which one that was

287
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,300
um kind of yeah yeah extended something

288
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,240
was extended let's look

289
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,660
yeah it was with a cognitive offloading

290
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,820
cognitive communicate um this is 48 oh

291
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,560
extended active inference constructing

292
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,240
predictive cognition Beyond skulls

293
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,940
number 41. right and that and that and

294
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,220
that live stream there wasn't really

295
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,920
there wasn't anything in that idea that

296
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,200
the betweenness

297
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,660
what was like the whole idea of how how

298
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,779
a Markov blanket May function

299
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:01,260
as as a way of of focusing or bringing

300
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,620
down the amount of noise and raising up

301
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,600
the amount of signal in a in a space

302
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,579
outside yourself there was no

303
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,500
we didn't have a lot of pushback on how

304
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,800
that theoretically would work so I don't

305
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,380
think that they're stepping into that

306
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,320
Zone by by mentioning this nice all

307
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,279
right

308
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,279
so they make several claims they're

309
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,740
summarized here but we'll we'll deal

310
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,240
them in

311
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,940
the sections in rough order anything to

312
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,940
add though okay

313
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,620
they're gonna come up yeah yeah these

314
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,300
are some summaries of some important

315
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,519
claims but we're going to come up with

316
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,519
them soon all right and then last last

317
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,760
stop before we jump into the background

318
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,699
which is one term and then the paper

319
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:51,920
itself what are the keywords in your eye

320
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,420
well I mean

321
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,720
we we had dynamical systems model in the

322
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,399
last live stream too so there's a lot of

323
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,060
people that are are depending on that

324
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,120
theory to advance whatever arguments

325
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,920
they want to make

326
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,899
um and the other I think the other term

327
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:11,579
that comes up quite often is joint

328
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:12,600
actions

329
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,240
without really getting into some hard

330
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,579
specifics about what that might look

331
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:21,660
like on a scale friendly level so I

332
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,459
think when the authors join us I think

333
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:25,380
both of those things are things will

334
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,560
have there's fertile ground there to to

335
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,320
grow some conversations

336
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,779
awesome the the one I would just want to

337
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,100
highlight is

338
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,620
dynamical systems model you you

339
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,000
mentioned how

340
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,639
maybe just rephrasing that people use it

341
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,639
to in a lot of different ways and it

342
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,980
just that being raised made me think

343
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,300
about

344
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,620
what is being Advanced by claiming that

345
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,019
alone or together something changes

346
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:55,980
Through Time

347
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,139
does anyone disagree and would it matter

348
00:14:58,139 --> 00:14:59,459
that everyone disagrees but what does

349
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:01,139
dynamical mean when we're talking about

350
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:04,320
time dependent real existing systems

351
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,899
what does it mean that you have a system

352
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:10,019
or a model or a systems model

353
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,000
what does that mean because that's

354
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,699
something that's an artifact or is it a

355
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:16,260
quote mental model

356
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,300
and so there's a lot to explore about

357
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,540
what is being meant by dynamical systems

358
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,320
model

359
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,899
we're thinking about time

360
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,540
or does it mean something more than that

361
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,600
continuous time discrete time

362
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,720
implementation effects

363
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,699
there's so many aspects to it and it's

364
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:36,959
actually going to come back at the very

365
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,120
end all right

366
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,759
and pragmatics

367
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,620
also the top part you could mention

368
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,660
anything otherwise Dean how does this

369
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:50,240
connect to what we discussed in 47

370
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,060
well I kind of wrote this out so I'd

371
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,740
rather read it um practices of an

372
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,600
interception especially the question of

373
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,660
what makes up an aim and I put in behind

374
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,920
in that the act that act the process

375
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,620
and aiming which is the stand for lining

376
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,600
which is we all know is the generative

377
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,839
model given targeting with what there's

378
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,220
still a question of what are we

379
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,500
targeting with when we when we put it

380
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,720
all under one umbrella called active

381
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,660
inference a situational analysis tool

382
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,600
this this is we've had lots and lots of

383
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,519
people claim that that's what's that's

384
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,800
what active inference is it's a range

385
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,560
finder with a depth of filter or is

386
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,360
active inference an importance generator

387
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,579
something that enables as collection

388
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,399
given through Framing and step

389
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,519
stabilization or both now if you want to

390
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,459
write an academic paper it's way easier

391
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:47,160
to just limit it to active inferences to

392
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,940
stabilizer now we have t0 T1 T2 and so

393
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:56,399
on but it's also a way to delimit that

394
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,800
temporal spatial temporal field so do we

395
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,779
just ignore that because it's easier to

396
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:04,220
write papers if we do

397
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,079
that's where the arrow of time meaning

398
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,299
we're kind of moving with the flow and

399
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:12,179
temporal depth through the memorial and

400
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,819
across the spec the spectral

401
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:18,599
uh range whatever we arbitrarily pick as

402
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,720
our projectional integration space

403
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,260
must both be induced or included in

404
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,959
whatever the representational is if we

405
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,880
analyze the entanglement along with the

406
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,900
entailment

407
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,840
so what is the relationship is I mean is

408
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,960
a relationship in the passing Rings no

409
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,000
of course it isn't but those symbols

410
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,380
still reinforce what's going on so can

411
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,059
we just say there's no

412
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,160
representationalism in this

413
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,880
it would be hard to do that on realistic

414
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,220
scales

415
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,440
that would be pragmatics in a nutshell

416
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,220
to me

417
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,720
very interesting

418
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,500
closure

419
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,940
well especially if you're if you're

420
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,580
recently involved in a in a long lasting

421
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,760
long-term relationship right

422
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,440
it's so true

423
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,000
um yeah the part I'll point out is just

424
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,100
a few highlighted words on the top

425
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,500
with a lot of citations provided

426
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,220
that are going to be taking a pragmatic

427
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,220
Federation approach broadly disparate

428
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,820
interests and Foci that are being used

429
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,460
by these authors in their advancement of

430
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,620
an anti-transmission view distributed

431
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,480
language hypothesis constraint view of

432
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,400
language participatory sense making

433
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,720
framework

434
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,640
maybe those fields are or aren't

435
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,679
connected in their citations or

436
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,500
co-authorship but then the authors are

437
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,299
able to connect these as kind of three

438
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,760
people pointing at the same process or

439
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,919
thing and that's like a

440
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,980
nice dense usage that could be really

441
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,280
catching people up on a few ways to

442
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,100
navigate these topics because there's a

443
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,299
lot of related topics it's like aren't

444
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:08,520
we just talking about how things are

445
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,960
including how modeling is

446
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,240
um they begin in the introduction with

447
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,520
an overview of the

448
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,500
layout of their paper

449
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,679
and they describe as Dean mentioned the

450
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:23,700
sketch

451
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,260
it's a pragmatist account of

452
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,419
communicative Behavior grounded in

453
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:29,640
ecological interpretation of

454
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,160
the active inference framework

455
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,260
contrasted with a transmission view of

456
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,299
communication According to which the

457
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,340
function of communicative behavior is to

458
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,660
convey information

459
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,799
so

460
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,100
a claim is that communication is about

461
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,620
information transmission

462
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,080
then they are contrasting that in light

463
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,320
of ecological psychology and Theory

464
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,280
broadly

465
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,240
and also giving an active inference

466
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,080
twist slash Theory integration

467
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,940
slash introduction of free energy

468
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,600
minimization or uncertainty reduction as

469
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,280
imperatives or modeling imperatives or

470
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,440
existence imperatives

471
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,659
whereas some of these previous threads

472
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:14,580
like ecological psychology more

473
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,980
neutrally wouldn't have necessarily a

474
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,159
formal or a first principle's way

475
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,179
to connect to Modern applications

476
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,100
though they may have a first principles

477
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,380
grounding in pragmatism

478
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,360
so many of the pieces have already been

479
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,580
assembled in terms of the ecological and

480
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,400
pragmatic and Echo and all of these

481
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,080
areas coming together

482
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,020
outside of the paper and so that will be

483
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,020
a theme what is linking out to other

484
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,320
empirical and philosophical literature

485
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,320
what is active inference doing in this

486
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,860
mediation as a framework

487
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,659
something that makes it an organized

488
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:57,539
principle organizing principle in a way

489
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:00,000
that merely the literature Corpus

490
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,940
of these areas which in many respects

491
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,440
have been connected

492
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,860
like the pragmatics of linguistics

493
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,480
so what does active inference doing

494
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,580
anything to add on that

495
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,400
well I I I again I don't think it's hard

496
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,200
to argue that um

497
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,080
to focus only on the string and the two

498
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,340
cups is probably reducing too far when

499
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,900
we're talking about communication I mean

500
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,640
they're they're entangles right like

501
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,860
they're now tied together but what the

502
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,299
authors are trying to point out here is

503
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:33,000
that there also are signalers and Signal

504
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
receivers in it and and as soon as you

505
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,220
add more layers to this of what's

506
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,039
actually going on suddenly an ecology

507
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,000
emerges so let's step back and look at

508
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,120
everything that is possibly

509
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,799
participating in this not just the

510
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:53,640
hardware and so again it will be hard to

511
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,159
argue against that at the same time

512
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,220
um if you and I don't have all of the

513
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,740
all of the things that we need to

514
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,720
communicate from Davis California to

515
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,880
Calgary Canada no matter how much we

516
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,580
screen there's no communication there's

517
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,780
no live stream 48 right now so again

518
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,840
to dismiss a transmission view I think

519
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,360
is also probably not the best idea in

520
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,360
the world because without that what do

521
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,559
you got

522
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,559
yep good point and they'll bring up that

523
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,140
sort of enabling system perspective in

524
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,940
the conclusion very clearly

525
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,179
yeah they set up the perspective of

526
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:35,220
communication as transmitting

527
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,080
information

528
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,179
symbolic information or other kinds of

529
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,720
information influencing

530
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,460
sculpting what is it influencing is it

531
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,280
modifying cognitive dials is it

532
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,679
modifying the field of affordances

533
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,679
is it doing both is it

534
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:54,360
any number of

535
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,539
ways that people have been studying

536
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:01,440
Nexus of communication

537
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,140
intra species interpersonally

538
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,559
everything

539
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,480
and you've done it I was going to say if

540
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,400
you read if you've read anything from

541
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,679
Charles Saunders Pierce you would have

542
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,539
to say it's both

543
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:18,059
like you you I mean if you're a first

544
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,400
follower you're not left with much

545
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,679
choice because there's a lot of

546
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,539
influencing going on because there's a

547
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,580
lot of interpreting happening

548
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,919
yeah

549
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,179
awesome

550
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:34,039
all right setting the context

551
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,220
do you want to mention it or do you want

552
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,440
me to mention it go for it all right

553
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,200
well the first footnote is about the

554
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,820
notion of information

555
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,360
and they describe different information

556
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,980
and uncertainty

557
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,480
Concepts

558
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,100
which we can address in later

559
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,100
discussions

560
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,159
they do not dedicate a lot of time and

561
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,679
space to

562
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,039
fleshing out the transmission View and

563
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,539
different ways that people off formally

564
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,220
informally addressed it causes and

565
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,500
consequences Etc however they have

566
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,200
provided a lot of citations

567
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,960
then in footnote 4

568
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,799
they are describing fridge

569
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,919
a writing in the 1890s

570
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,159
which is a very interesting connection I

571
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:24,840
don't know the details but some

572
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,940
information is provided in this section

573
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,100
footnote

574
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,200
it's an interesting path it'd be fun to

575
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,679
kind of go down more because we've now

576
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:37,559
brought back in Paris

577
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:41,220
to the discussion as others are and I

578
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,220
think walking the fine line between not

579
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,799
using last names for equations

580
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,940
while respecting the process and

581
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,520
contributions of past

582
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,919
researchers and and practitioners in

583
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,539
just different areas

584
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,159
will be really

585
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:00,720
part of what active inference brings

586
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,900
together

587
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,419
all right anything else

588
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:09,059
all I would say is that I I think what

589
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:11,700
this maybe points out again this is not

590
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,820
what they wrote in their uh notes but

591
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,320
with every transmission there are things

592
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,400
like conflict embedded in that or

593
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,900
complexity embedded in that I mean any

594
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,480
any good writer knows that you can't

595
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,039
just transmit a bunch of information

596
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:28,799
there are there are expectations around

597
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,120
what what are you moving towards and and

598
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,760
why would I continue to communicate and

599
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,400
so you have to have a context around

600
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,940
which that that continuing

601
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,000
um regime of attention is held up

602
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,400
yep share attention regime is of

603
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,740
attention joint action

604
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,500
um so setting the logic here they are

605
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,299
going to flesh out two primary reasons

606
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:56,159
to explore theoretical alternatives to

607
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,480
TV so not they're wrong they thought bad

608
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,659
but there are two reasons to explore

609
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:06,480
we're at camp and we're going to explore

610
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,100
some theoretical

611
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,220
alternatives

612
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,799
firstly TV entails a commitment to an

613
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,000
account

614
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,100
of the putative contents conveyed via

615
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,299
communication

616
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:20,159
providing such an account is notoriously

617
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,779
difficult especially if linguistic

618
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:24,059
practices cannot be invoked as part of

619
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:26,400
the explanation

620
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,900
very

621
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,720
deep points about what is linguistically

622
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,900
accessible consciously accessible

623
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,940
perceptible under difference

624
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,740
situations

625
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,500
through different kinds of memory and

626
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,000
anticipation

627
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,440
and

628
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,200
all these features which we know do play

629
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,620
roles in

630
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,340
semiosis

631
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,120
and then the seconds reason why to

632
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,240
explore a theoretical alternative is how

633
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,919
it's not clear that communication

634
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,480
conceived of as the transmission of

635
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,159
content could be relevant to the basic

636
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,840
allostatic processes which Drive the

637
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,860
behavior of organisms so you might say

638
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,179
biosemiotically the pancreas

639
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:11,400
communicates with different cells in the

640
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,559
body through hormone signaling

641
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:16,860
but in a transmission view would one be

642
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,500
committed to the Viewpoint insulin means

643
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,600
do x y z

644
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,039
to whom

645
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,380
under what conditions in what ways is

646
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,020
that a communication so especially at

647
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,600
scales and systems that aren't quite

648
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,460
literally humans talking about language

649
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,679
which is quite common

650
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:36,000
then

651
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,679
there's going to be an account that's

652
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,539
non-linguistic

653
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:41,600
so to what extent are we going to

654
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,600
privilege or Center

655
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,640
this type of linguistic discourse in

656
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,899
communication

657
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:53,279
in a broader Ecology of communication

658
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,539
right so if the content by itself can't

659
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:00,500
direct cannot

660
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:04,380
help us derive meaning than what this

661
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,419
essentially is saying is is that we need

662
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,760
more than that in order to get the equal

663
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,260
sign or symbol to

664
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:16,020
equate to meaning right so that's all

665
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,760
essentially what they're trying to talk

666
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,100
about here is if we're going to go past

667
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,380
TV why

668
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,320
yeah it could be a supplement to TV or

669
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,200
an extension of TV which yeah as they'll

670
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,179
point out later can never be denied or

671
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:34,740
rejected so then pragmatism they trace a

672
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,380
thread of scholarship

673
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,380
in which language is viewed as a form of

674
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,640
action

675
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,520
and I'm reminded of Professor Deborah

676
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,500
Gordon's paper vickenstein and ant

677
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,059
watching

678
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,059
seeing the behavioral ecologist as

679
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:53,820
they're observing ant Behavior

680
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,899
the multiple stages and steps and ways

681
00:28:56,899 --> 00:29:01,919
that knowing and acting and naming of

682
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,159
different kinds namings of activities as

683
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:07,799
an association of activities as named

684
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:12,120
with identities and that naming process

685
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,140
that comes in very late in the game in

686
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,779
terms of the actions taken to prepare

687
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:21,779
the context for that observation

688
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:23,580
so I thought that was a very interesting

689
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,200
link and here are those green

690
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,179
highlighted words from earlier so what

691
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:29,640
else would you add about pragmatism

692
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,539
well I think what what they were

693
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,760
moving towards here at least alerting us

694
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,740
to is that the fact that there are

695
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,380
aspects of a pragmatist view although it

696
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,179
may sound a little strange to say it at

697
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:44,640
first I think is true at least with a

698
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,279
pragmatist view you can now conjure

699
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,520
things that you can't do simply with

700
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,940
content I mean I can have a whole bunch

701
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,580
of ingredients and not have a recipe but

702
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,440
at least with a pragmatist view now I

703
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,240
can start experimenting and I think

704
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,299
that's all they're basically asking us

705
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:06,000
to contemplate

706
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,820
it's the experimentation piece it's not

707
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,340
just sort of leaving everything out on

708
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,159
the on the bench and going whoa well I

709
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,419
can take an account of this or an

710
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:17,220
inventory of it but not really do

711
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,399
anything with it so that's that's what I

712
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,039
took away from this part of the paper

713
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,179
nice

714
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:26,279
all right here's a discussion around

715
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:29,580
what signals mean anything to add

716
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,820
no just read it it's pretty straight up

717
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,500
yep

718
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,760
okay

719
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,679
in this section

720
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,200
setting active inference framework we've

721
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,059
informally introduced the ecological

722
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:43,860
interpretation

723
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:47,159
of the active inference framework

724
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:49,440
in the terms of which we will formulate

725
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,020
a pragmatist conception of communication

726
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,600
in section communication and active

727
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,299
inference

728
00:30:56,299 --> 00:30:59,039
when is it of the active inference

729
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,799
framework the genitive case when is it

730
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,840
in the active inference framework the

731
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,059
locative case

732
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:08,760
with the instrumental case there's so

733
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,659
many

734
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,299
routes to explore with linguistic and

735
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:15,600
non-linguistic communication

736
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,419
even only keeping with active inference

737
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:22,559
as the gripper and the gripped right

738
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,140
they provide a description which is

739
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,240
copied here

740
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,019
and one key line that they'll bring back

741
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:33,600
in service of communication is organisms

742
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,519
can reduce free energy

743
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,740
either by adjusting the sensory input to

744
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,179
the generative model

745
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:42,059
quote active inference or by adjusting

746
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:43,740
the generative model to the sensory

747
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,080
input perceptual inference which

748
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,600
correspond respectively to action and

749
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,679
perception

750
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,419
so one could ask whether active

751
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:53,519
inference only applies to adjusting

752
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,320
sensory input

753
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,500
or what whether action corresponds to

754
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,120
active inference and perception to

755
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,679
perceptual inference that's one way to

756
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,779
think about it it certainly is one sense

757
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:05,399
of active inference which is inference

758
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:07,080
about action

759
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,899
planning decision making and also the

760
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:11,460
consequences of action

761
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,500
being able to introduce preference into

762
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,620
future and current actions

763
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,059
and

764
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:20,220
we're talking about active inference

765
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,279
also as a framework

766
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:25,500
for considering this View

767
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,159
so

768
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,700
that was just the connection with active

769
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,159
inference there one connection so the

770
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,460
part so part of this and I'll ask you

771
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,679
because I'll ask let me ask the authors

772
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,399
let me do the dot one is up this stuff

773
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:42,659
that they just wrote out here because

774
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,519
we've seen this many many times people

775
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:46,860
just want to make sure that they're

776
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:50,059
following what the free energy principle

777
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:54,360
up to this point has this has has

778
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,240
generally been agreed to to mean my

779
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,159
question from that last organisms can

780
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:02,640
reduce free energy either by so if I

781
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,460
were to give the metaphor of getting the

782
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,419
toothpaste back into the tube

783
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:11,159
how does communication serve that

784
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:12,960
purpose

785
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,360
right because it's really really easy to

786
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,559
squeeze it out

787
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,200
but how do how does communication serve

788
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,419
get it back in

789
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:23,159
because it

790
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:26,519
it can but how does how does what

791
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:28,860
they're describing here as an ecological

792
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,380
View

793
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,799
speak to that

794
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,019
let's explore

795
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:40,140
yeah they then go to the ecological

796
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,480
interpretation of active inference

797
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,179
so after introducing just purely in

798
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:47,580
principle using some active inference

799
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:51,120
ontology terms and key ideas like

800
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,179
embodiment of generative models and

801
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:56,460
reduction of surprisal bounding that

802
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,500
through variational and expected free

803
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,940
energy

804
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,500
they

805
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,919
continue to add in ingredients to the

806
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:05,880
recipe

807
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,399
and uh

808
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,520
contrast a abstract Theory neutral

809
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,199
description

810
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,179
of active inference

811
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,760
which is their

812
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,119
framing of Act of vanilla or Standalone

813
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:22,260
or somehow

814
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,139
perhaps archetypal octave inference as

815
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,239
being Theory neutral

816
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,219
and hence compatible and therefore

817
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,780
compatible with many conceptions of

818
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,040
cognition

819
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,579
pointing to a citation where it's

820
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:37,918
described as a state Theory compatible

821
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,239
with many different process theories

822
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,699
which is why potentially someone

823
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,500
could and probably has argued for a

824
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,239
transmission View using active inference

825
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,760
as symbolic communication or semantic

826
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,859
communication or there's probably so

827
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:50,579
many

828
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:53,879
angles on that we know we could explore

829
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:55,940
um

830
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,800
bringing in the ecological papers

831
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,200
citing some of the earlier ecological

832
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,400
psychology

833
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,740
and perceptual work

834
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,200
in predictive processing and then just

835
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,540
connecting it to more recent papers for

836
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,000
example brunberg kerstein ritvelt

837
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,440
ramstead many of these authors

838
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,980
collaborations in about the past six

839
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,020
years

840
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,520
anything else dad

841
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,619
well I got some notes that I want to

842
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:27,480
talk about in The Dot one but I think

843
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,060
this is interesting because

844
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,660
um

845
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,180
it would be at this point where if they

846
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,119
wanted to introduce formalisms which

847
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:38,280
basically are just a bunch of symbols

848
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,460
set up operationally that they could but

849
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:46,200
they haven't so how do we explain or how

850
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,800
do we take into account all of those

851
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,040
formulas that we've looked at

852
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,500
throughout a number of live streams if

853
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,760
we're stop if we're talking about

854
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,400
something that's ecological

855
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,140
because they are there

856
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,780
so

857
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,060
so are they floating around us or are

858
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,400
they only something that we keep inside

859
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,520
of a very contained very constrained

860
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,079
very

861
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:16,680
condition set aspect of this of this

862
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,099
diverse very complex

863
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:21,359
um

864
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,180
situation that we find ourselves under

865
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,520
so yeah that when you as soon as you say

866
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,980
of I would I would assume that one of

867
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,200
the products of an ecological

868
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,540
interpretation would be a whole month to

869
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,099
formalisms

870
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:37,140
because you could derive those pretty

871
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,680
well I can't I'm not Carl or or Thomas

872
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,859
or one of those you know super math

873
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:46,920
people that they can so so what do we

874
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,240
how do we

875
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,359
how do we account for that

876
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,480
yeah one note on that is some of the

877
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,480
famous models of Predator prey type

878
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,339
Dynamics are those dynamical equations

879
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:05,640
are used in neuroimaging to model for

880
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,579
example winner list competitions amongst

881
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:09,720
brain regions or with different

882
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,020
signaling regimes so in many ways the

883
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,839
SPM package specifically as well as

884
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,359
Neuroscience more broadly

885
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:21,180
many threads and precursors are here

886
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,380
which

887
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,079
is why I really appreciate that

888
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:27,960
um you by interpreting

889
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,240
the way you are about how active

890
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,820
inference is being interpreted

891
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,060
there aren't just the bullet point or

892
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,099
the visual abstract

893
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:39,300
of

894
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,000
active inference if it that is the

895
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,920
active inference

896
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,800
that is the interpretation of the

897
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,140
authors

898
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,300
using active inference

899
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,920
like they're working through it and

900
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,200
making a trace in a process

901
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,300
versus just saying well this is the

902
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,680
Standalone author independent

903
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,480
interpretation

904
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,180
I'm not sure if that makes sense but

905
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,460
all right

906
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:09,300
this uh here's some text on a slide

907
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,500
to look at connecting uh

908
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,260
spatial temporal structure of

909
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,380
affordances in ecological settings

910
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,300
the concept known as field of

911
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,980
affordances or the landscape of

912
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,960
affordances

913
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,180
and different affordances different

914
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,880
kinds of action capacity

915
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,760
introducing how salience and attention

916
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,599
and proclivity towards an affordance

917
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:39,000
is determined by its free energy by the

918
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,400
free energy is expected to reduce

919
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,660
by the system entity or by the modeler

920
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,339
um

921
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:48,540
and there's a few more notes on

922
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,579
ecological psychology and affordances

923
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,020
sentence in the last bullet there I

924
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,760
think it's I think it's really important

925
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,579
too again to go back to the I won't ask

926
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:00,960
you to go back to the previous slide but

927
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,839
we don't carry around this

928
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:05,460
formalisms and those operations with us

929
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,500
but humans become attuned to social

930
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,420
affords by being immersed in and

931
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,180
participating in shared social cultural

932
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,079
practice

933
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:14,940
just very early in their development

934
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,060
that that seems pretty obvious this

935
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,640
immersion leads to the integration of a

936
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,040
social physics okay well then there is

937
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,280
math involved in this

938
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,800
which is the set of structured and

939
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,160
systemic social contingencies available

940
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,440
in an environment of development so even

941
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,540
if we can't identify what those

942
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,740
formalisms are those formalisms must be

943
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,920
present in order for this early this

944
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,440
thing that we call early development and

945
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,200
integration to exist it can't just be

946
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,000
met it can't just you can't just say

947
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,339
it's oh it's there but we can't explain

948
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:56,760
it there actually is something symbolic

949
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,859
and representational they didn't even

950
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:01,079
even if we can't conjure it ourselves

951
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:04,800
there are there are those aspects which

952
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,560
we need to to include

953
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,200
right just because I I don't I I don't

954
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,579
think of it as math

955
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:15,180
doesn't mean the math isn't present

956
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,280
so I think that I think that I think

957
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,740
that's a really important one here in

958
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,780
terms of making their argument

959
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,960
even though it's an ecology there's

960
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,480
still a lot of formalism

961
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,900
that that would seem to be abstract but

962
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:36,180
presents as as something real so

963
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,460
yeah

964
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:42,180
my little two cents yes that's a

965
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,800
interesting

966
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,700
Direction and made me think about

967
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:51,240
attractors Dynamics gravity in Social

968
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:56,040
settings and that puts quite a

969
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:01,560
spin on Bayesian mechanics as a social

970
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,300
physics

971
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,940
and sociophysics has been approached

972
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,380
from

973
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,200
um the classical Billiards case from the

974
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,240
statistical thermodynamic informational

975
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,420
case and probably more speculatively by

976
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,420
some from the quantum case so it's those

977
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,720
three mechanics classical statistical

978
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,980
Thermo info and Quantum yeah three five

979
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,839
however many there are

980
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,540
um are what are being proposed in their

981
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,180
integration by Bayesian mechanics which

982
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,359
we'll be discussing in uh

983
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:38,599
that next live stream actually in 49

984
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:41,880
with uh some really interesting

985
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,300
formalisms to re-enter into so I think

986
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,060
it's like seeing what's not there but

987
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,119
seeing depth in what they're pointing to

988
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,940
even just by discussing integration of

989
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,880
social physics we don't need to provide

990
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,700
100 citations to social crises or

991
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,020
tragedies

992
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,540
it is just what is

993
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:07,380
gestured towards with what the domain of

994
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,760
the work is

995
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,280
yeah

996
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,440
all right

997
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,839
in section communication

998
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,900
as socially extended active inference

999
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:21,119
here's some quotes anything you want to

1000
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,180
add

1001
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:24,839
I just want to read bullet three

1002
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:26,700
communication is thus understood as we

1003
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,220
might what we might call socially

1004
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,200
extended active inference situations

1005
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,140
where the organism reduces free energy

1006
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,180
by influencing the behavior of another

1007
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,839
organism in such a way that it's sensory

1008
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,700
input will correspond to the predictions

1009
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,500
of its generative model thereby

1010
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,079
regulating its own internal states by

1011
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,420
the behavior of the other organism

1012
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,960
other than through formalism how could

1013
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,180
we prove that

1014
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,520
would be my question

1015
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,920
yeah great question

1016
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,020
and uh

1017
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,940
what if well there what if there are

1018
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,140
many routes

1019
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:07,319
and one can ask somebody to stop

1020
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:11,400
writing on the sidewalk with chalk or

1021
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,020
they could just wash it while they're

1022
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,020
gardening or they could go in so many

1023
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,900
ways it's like the adjacent possible of

1024
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,839
the social physics

1025
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:24,720
is open in a way that

1026
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,560
contrived or designed settings art

1027
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,960
which isn't to say they are useful or or

1028
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,420
educational but that's not the same

1029
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,339
right the only way you could prove it

1030
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:37,280
though yeah I think is through

1031
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,380
representational symbolic

1032
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,540
operational like I don't know how

1033
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:45,839
because every time you try to repeat it

1034
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,819
someone like Dean comes along and says

1035
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:49,500
oh I think I know what the game is here

1036
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,440
I'm going to disrupt the game right so

1037
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,780
that there really is only one way to

1038
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:58,380
prove it and so yeah I I I like that

1039
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,560
they put this in here now and one of our

1040
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,540
colleagues Stephen likes to talk about

1041
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,440
the prefixes added to active inference

1042
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:10,079
and so again do we need those prefixes

1043
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,480
in order to be able to explain our

1044
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,220
argument is it for the convenience of

1045
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,980
our argument or do those things really

1046
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,240
happen

1047
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,000
and can we say can we say they really

1048
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,579
happen because we can prove it

1049
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:27,420
all right nice the following section is

1050
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,339
some cases of communication

1051
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:33,359
and three areas are highlighted

1052
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,940
some cases of communication

1053
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:39,480
and for those cases one could ask what

1054
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,780
is or could be a transmission view on

1055
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,480
that setting or how have people framed a

1056
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,400
certain case or instance or type of

1057
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,099
communication as transmission View

1058
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:53,579
and then how is an ecological active

1059
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:56,640
inference interpretation

1060
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,280
changing that challenging that

1061
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,700
going Beyond it and the three areas that

1062
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,400
they are looking at are aggressive

1063
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,720
behavior

1064
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,680
mating or sexual reproductive signaling

1065
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,900
and alarm signaling

1066
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,060
and they write about in each of these

1067
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:19,020
cases how one might see the type of

1068
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,420
behavior exhibited there as kind of a

1069
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,180
canonical signaling case like when you

1070
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,000
look up signaling you'll find these

1071
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,579
keywords describing it as categories of

1072
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:31,440
signaling and communication

1073
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,619
and one very excellent book to follow up

1074
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:37,800
on is Helen longedo's 2012 book studying

1075
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,540
human behavior how scientists

1076
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,480
investigate aggression and sexuality

1077
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,540
they're two of the go-to areas in

1078
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:49,140
behavioral study two of the go-to

1079
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:52,260
approaches and phenomena and framings of

1080
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,960
action interaction

1081
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,319
and this is a very multi and

1082
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:01,319
transdisciplinary book that addresses in

1083
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:02,940
the context of some recent historical

1084
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,119
debates around the relevance of genetic

1085
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:07,980
inheritance ecological inheritance

1086
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,839
social structuring all these different

1087
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,800
topics approached in a really

1088
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,780
edifying way I think it speaks to the

1089
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,220
gripper and the being gripped which is

1090
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,540
kind of the role of what history and

1091
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,640
philosophy of science

1092
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,859
has been doing

1093
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:26,280
in a disciplinary Academic Way with a

1094
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,200
certain approach and time frame and

1095
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,400
feedback

1096
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,000
method

1097
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,819
cool okay

1098
00:46:35,819 --> 00:46:38,640
human Cooperative communication

1099
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,300
um

1100
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,140
anything to add

1101
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,460
I'm always curious about

1102
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,339
um I put a little note on the on the

1103
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:51,140
actual paper my copy of the paper

1104
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,079
um

1105
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,540
about cooperation

1106
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,900
um and I'm no expert on cooperation so I

1107
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,420
I'm sketching this out like the authors

1108
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,180
are sketching certain things out but

1109
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,619
um

1110
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:07,880
I think this is what I wrote

1111
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,099
let me see here

1112
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:13,460
uh yes

1113
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,640
neither the um

1114
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,800
the transmission version nor the

1115
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,520
ecological field of affordance's model

1116
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,319
can say for certain how long the

1117
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:27,839
Cooperative state will exist for

1118
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,940
which requires a different type of

1119
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,359
analysis over the one that confirms that

1120
00:47:32,359 --> 00:47:35,280
communication lines are functioning

1121
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,940
regardless of function type

1122
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:42,180
so stepping back and saying that there

1123
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:45,180
is a type of communication which we'll

1124
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:48,480
call Cooperative is great

1125
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,339
um we can we can say that there's a type

1126
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:53,520
here but just naming it doesn't mean

1127
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,220
we've actually tamed or been able to

1128
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,680
explain why

1129
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,980
that type exists so that's one of those

1130
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,660
things again when we have the authors

1131
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:06,180
with this I like to chat about that a

1132
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,680
little bit more

1133
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,780
yeah what that makes me think about is

1134
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,880
even non-communication

1135
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,780
can be considered part of the

1136
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,220
drop shaping the landscape of

1137
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:20,040
affordances perhaps being communication

1138
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,680
of non-linguistic type and so how could

1139
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,140
we have a model of communication where

1140
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,119
the special cases of which there are

1141
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,300
infinite the special cases are

1142
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,760
Communications in their embodied sense

1143
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,000
and we can also abstract to people who

1144
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,119
only communicate through social networks

1145
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,760
through breathing the same air

1146
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,339
all these kinds of very loose only

1147
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,559
ecologically aligned if only on Earth

1148
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,420
aligns

1149
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,520
views of communication seeing that as

1150
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,160
like the field from which different

1151
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,079
forms of communication of cognitive

1152
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:58,319
entities arises from rather than

1153
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,720
something symbolic and transmissive

1154
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,599
which could only be instantiated kind of

1155
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,880
from the top down by a symbolic

1156
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,300
subsystem or sub functionality

1157
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,599
which isn't denied by a bottom-up view

1158
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:15,839
but it's contextualized

1159
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,180
as part of a process that includes the

1160
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,339
ecology and the shaping of the field of

1161
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:21,900
affordances and Landscapes and the

1162
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,839
stigmergy as something fundamental

1163
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:26,280
and that's where the call that's where

1164
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,500
the Ecology of the context does act as a

1165
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:32,220
constraint so yeah okay all right

1166
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,960
conclusion

1167
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,020
so they introduced a pragmatist

1168
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,940
conception of communication grounded in

1169
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:40,859
an ecological interpretation of the

1170
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:42,540
active inference framework

1171
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,760
there's a lot more to develop

1172
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,980
so where do papers end

1173
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,160
where do projects begin

1174
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,020
right and then they mentioned two

1175
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,900
different directions which are uh

1176
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,700
relatively well confirmed empirical

1177
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,500
results

1178
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:02,400
uh first is the work on joint attention

1179
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,559
and seeing joint attention as a relevant

1180
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:06,119
aspect

1181
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:07,980
in relationship to coordination on

1182
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,180
landscapes

1183
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,859
and relevant for language development

1184
00:50:10,859 --> 00:50:12,599
and then the second point of empirical

1185
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:15,119
evidence that they want to bring in is

1186
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,540
neuroimaging data showing co-activation

1187
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,040
or

1188
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,380
partnership in some way of different

1189
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:25,440
parts of the body and brain associated

1190
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,300
with certain actions that seem to be

1191
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,460
linked in a way that's best understood

1192
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,579
or core screened as being ecological or

1193
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:34,020
embedded

1194
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:37,440
and then here is the uh part mentioned

1195
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,359
earlier to conclude it is trivially true

1196
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,160
that pretty much any episode of

1197
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,900
communication can be described as a

1198
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,760
transmission of information

1199
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,280
as suggested in the section some cases

1200
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,760
of communication so no bird call

1201
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,380
no bird call

1202
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,839
hard to get around that one in practice

1203
00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:57,240
maybe there's some theoretical tricks

1204
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,220
but

1205
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,800
um what if communication is pre-planning

1206
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,220
really hear a bird call in five minutes

1207
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:06,780
really want that to happen or make that

1208
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:10,440
happen and then what happens

1209
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,900
um however there'd be no communication

1210
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,400
if there was no information in some

1211
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,900
sense

1212
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,819
that is some form of association between

1213
00:51:17,819 --> 00:51:19,559
a signal and affordance

1214
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:21,599
which constitute General ecological

1215
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:22,880
information

1216
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,540
semiosis

1217
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,420
Persian Triad

1218
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:30,359
abductive discussion we had in 47. so

1219
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:33,420
this is the biosemiotic ecological

1220
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,819
angle that we came from

1221
00:51:35,819 --> 00:51:37,500
last time

1222
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,940
and this paper is going to really

1223
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,460
highlight the ecological

1224
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,180
and the free energy

1225
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:48,660
minimizing aspect Via Field of

1226
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,819
affordance modifying

1227
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:54,480
through stigmergic modifications or

1228
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,640
other types of communication maybe just

1229
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,319
making your body visible in a certain

1230
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:59,160
way

1231
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,740
and using that as part of a joint

1232
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,900
socially co-enacted free energy

1233
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,520
minimization

1234
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,500
pointing the way towards models that

1235
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,180
would do that but not as the only

1236
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,260
endpoint

1237
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,900
but it's in a framing where models could

1238
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,000
conceivably do that like through

1239
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,680
software packages

1240
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:20,180
and model design processes

1241
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,740
I sometimes choose words

1242
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,200
not carefully and I know that I don't

1243
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,119
think that the word trivially was placed

1244
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,059
in that last bullet as a as a

1245
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:33,720
as a way of provoking but maybe it was I

1246
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:36,059
think basically

1247
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:39,059
um it's basically true but saying it's

1248
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:40,980
trivially true is like saying okay well

1249
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:44,220
a math proof is Trivial because it just

1250
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:47,940
is there I I think it's sometimes hard

1251
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:51,140
to to

1252
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,720
overstate how some of the basics matter

1253
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,540
that doesn't mean get locked in just and

1254
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,220
then stop because you got the basics

1255
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:00,660
right I mean there's a whole bunch of

1256
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,760
stuff that pops out of that and and

1257
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,920
included that too if you're looking at

1258
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,140
something realistically however

1259
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,300
um

1260
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,740
I don't know I don't know if it's very

1261
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:12,900
trivial or not like I don't know that

1262
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,559
it's that common some of these more

1263
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,180
interesting

1264
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:19,319
mathematical proofs

1265
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:21,119
we could say they are because they've

1266
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:22,980
already been proven but that doesn't

1267
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:25,020
mean everybody has access to it or even

1268
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,400
understands

1269
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,160
the importance of it so that's just a

1270
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,260
little side comment because I know I I

1271
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:33,200
catch myself regretting sometimes

1272
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,900
describing things in certain ways

1273
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,140
all right to defend the trivial I looked

1274
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:41,760
up the definition I really wanted to

1275
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,780
know

1276
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:45,900
um it turns out it is originating from

1277
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,400
Trivium

1278
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,800
which is an introductory curriculum at a

1279
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,140
medieval University involving the study

1280
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:55,800
of grammar rhetoric and logic

1281
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,119
so

1282
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,000
maybe it's it's so trivial

1283
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,099
it's just the kind of trivial details

1284
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:04,140
that you end up spending quite a long

1285
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,720
time working on awesome good good

1286
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,059
defense that would be that would be a

1287
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:11,220
funny interpretation you know bring back

1288
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,500
the Trivium

1289
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,319
um yeah our hope is that the model it

1290
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,839
describes inspires experimental designs

1291
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,240
that can lead to such

1292
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,119
theoretical or applied treatments okay

1293
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:27,680
what are your thoughts

1294
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:30,420
well as I wrote here I think that means

1295
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,339
keeping active inference on the bench

1296
00:54:32,339 --> 00:54:34,680
and constrained to a controlled setting

1297
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,579
I mean again if you want to be able to

1298
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:40,619
compare to

1299
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:43,680
a control this is

1300
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,559
this is your next step however since

1301
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,480
when does setting a condition liberate

1302
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,099
communication to do what communication

1303
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:51,599
does

1304
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:53,579
which is released understanding and not

1305
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:55,619
just aggregated for the sake of control

1306
00:54:55,619 --> 00:54:57,420
and I wrote your time to break out the

1307
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,099
meme launches Dan you've got more direct

1308
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:00,480
experience with

1309
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,700
with writing about active inference and

1310
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,099
memes than I have yes so

1311
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:08,700
that's the slide here we go yeah well

1312
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,740
just wanted to kind of explore this and

1313
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,859
leave some open space to go into it more

1314
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:16,380
yeah building on the work of our

1315
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,680
colleague marigula who is a professor in

1316
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,280
Monterey California yeah she had written

1317
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,099
about memes as quasi-arguments and about

1318
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:29,579
the kind of space that opens in

1319
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:32,000
between in

1320
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,700
enduring the meme and specifically image

1321
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,799
meme interpretation or interpolation

1322
00:55:37,799 --> 00:55:40,680
process so in addition to or an

1323
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,839
alternative to the purely dynamical

1324
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:46,859
descriptive and uh evolutionary Fitness

1325
00:55:46,859 --> 00:55:50,160
oriented meme definition commonly used

1326
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,339
by Dawkins and all synths

1327
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:56,099
this is a very media and

1328
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:59,579
cognitive interpretation of artifacts

1329
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:04,339
and through a paper in 2021 and in 2022

1330
00:56:04,339 --> 00:56:08,520
we used some previous work that had been

1331
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,339
done by equiha at all 2020

1332
00:56:11,339 --> 00:56:15,119
on a three-tier model of how to frame

1333
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:18,420
complex ecosystems the kinds that people

1334
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,280
are usually talking about when they

1335
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,740
mention ecosystems like the non-metaphor

1336
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,599
if there were a non-metaphor and it

1337
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:26,280
wasn't just app ecosystems and social

1338
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,440
ecosystems the one with you know the

1339
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,319
trees but don't they all

1340
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:34,500
um three layers being an instrumental

1341
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,260
layer of pure observations

1342
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,220
basically mapping onto observed States

1343
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:44,160
then a contextual layer which can bring

1344
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,020
in some knowledge about how different

1345
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:48,299
measurements or inferences about

1346
00:56:48,299 --> 00:56:50,339
measurements are linked like to Common

1347
00:56:50,339 --> 00:56:51,540
entities

1348
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,880
and then using this type of

1349
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,740
statistically inferred information and

1350
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:57,299
augmented information from the

1351
00:56:57,299 --> 00:57:00,500
contextual layer to do inference on pure

1352
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,000
unobservables those might be things that

1353
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,799
are observable but you didn't observe

1354
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:06,599
like the temperature at some point where

1355
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:09,599
there wasn't a thermometer or the true

1356
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:12,180
unobservables could be like propensity

1357
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:16,500
of this Mile Square of land to be used

1358
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,260
for this purpose in the next five years

1359
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:21,359
but that's not something that could be

1360
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:22,680
measured there's no measuring device

1361
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,200
other than the modeling process but it's

1362
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,359
an important modeling process and they

1363
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:30,059
did amazing work connecting complex

1364
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:34,920
systems and ecologies and on the rise in

1365
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,619
determined in spirit is discussions of

1366
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:40,260
digital ecosystems and ecological

1367
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:42,599
approaches to communication as noted by

1368
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:45,900
the authors here and hence by extension

1369
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,640
ecological approaches to digital

1370
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,020
communication

1371
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:53,099
and so we were able to modify or to

1372
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:55,680
translate and respect the ecosystem

1373
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,500
Integrity three-tier model provided by

1374
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,140
those authors

1375
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:03,540
onto the kinds of digital discourse

1376
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:07,859
analysis platforms that would be aligned

1377
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,440
in that ecological interpretation and

1378
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:11,339
way

1379
00:58:11,339 --> 00:58:13,260
so I think there'll be a lot to explore

1380
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,540
maybe now maybe next time go ahead yes

1381
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:18,299
quick just quickly so would you describe

1382
00:58:18,299 --> 00:58:21,359
what you did from a and transition to B

1383
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:24,500
as an inaction

1384
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,140
it was an action in the slides software

1385
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:30,900
of one type and then it becomes a

1386
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,240
different in action when it is shared as

1387
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,099
a asynchronous file or through live

1388
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:37,559
communication with a colleague it's a

1389
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:39,780
different inaction when the preprint is

1390
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:41,819
open source and available immediately

1391
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:44,880
upon completion there are many levels of

1392
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,920
in types of inaction

1393
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,780
all right

1394
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:53,280
then it closes with a discourse from

1395
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,059
skirms scurms 2010 suggests that in any

1396
00:58:57,059 --> 00:58:59,960
complex organization

1397
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,299
different highlighting information

1398
00:59:02,299 --> 00:59:05,520
transmission and processing and

1399
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,559
coordination of action

1400
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:10,440
may not be entirely separate

1401
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,220
gasp

1402
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:18,180
skirms 1996 and scurms 2010 these are

1403
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,440
actually really excellent books I hope

1404
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,299
that is not taken as dismissive but it

1405
00:59:21,299 --> 00:59:24,619
goes to show what views

1406
00:59:24,619 --> 00:59:28,020
are seen as and Justified to be often

1407
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,700
needing support

1408
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:33,660
and what that means or why that behavior

1409
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:37,500
is that way what is that linguistic

1410
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:41,160
string for in this

1411
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:44,520
quote from 2022 written

1412
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:47,160
originally in 2010

1413
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,140
and then the authors write what

1414
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:51,000
fundamentally matters is the control of

1415
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,500
behavior and not the transmission of

1416
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,660
information even if the control of

1417
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,520
behavior may be described as a form of

1418
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,160
information transmission so very much a

1419
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:02,880
syntax semantics question how many bits

1420
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,200
is the file

1421
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,660
what does the file mean syntax and

1422
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:07,740
semantics

1423
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:10,799
in the specific unfolding of the

1424
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:12,720
interpretation you can take a top-down

1425
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,140
overview like 55 of people who did this

1426
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:18,480
also did that and then there's a bottom

1427
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,460
up cognitive view which is the

1428
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:23,460
ecological embodied engagement with the

1429
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:25,380
image meme or with something like that

1430
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:29,940
with the animal signal or Mark or smell

1431
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:33,119
and then to paraphrase germs the

1432
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:35,760
information transmission gloss footnote

1433
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,160
35 with some Eagan citations

1434
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,319
the information transmission gloss on

1435
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,480
communication communicative Behavior if

1436
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,160
it is to prove useful at all might be

1437
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,720
thought of as an aspect of the control

1438
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,819
of behavior rather than the other way

1439
01:00:47,819 --> 01:00:50,000
around

1440
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:54,540
reversing Primacy but not denying

1441
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:56,400
we propose that conceiving Communication

1442
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,079
in such a way provides better insights

1443
01:00:58,079 --> 01:00:59,339
into the pragmatic nature of

1444
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:00,900
communicative behavior and its Evolution

1445
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:04,020
as a free energy minimizing activity and

1446
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:06,380
a paper

1447
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,420
what do you want to ask

1448
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:11,280
that's basically it we have a few things

1449
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,740
written down here 48.1 but what would

1450
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:16,920
you like to add on that I mean what I

1451
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:19,020
like about the conclusion is that they

1452
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:23,220
say I'm I'm I'm taking and paraphrasing

1453
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:24,720
in my own

1454
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,540
thinking in my own words

1455
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,599
um

1456
01:01:30,059 --> 01:01:31,980
just because you transmit doesn't mean

1457
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,420
that you're actually

1458
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:37,280
sussing out or determining or or

1459
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,079
confirming the difference between play

1460
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:43,619
as one kind of action playing

1461
01:01:43,619 --> 01:01:46,819
and then played so they really want to

1462
01:01:46,819 --> 01:01:49,319
incorporate that temporal piece which I

1463
01:01:49,319 --> 01:01:52,380
think is really smart which again I'm a

1464
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:55,079
I'm a big believer that there's a logic

1465
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:55,980
that

1466
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:59,160
supports that which D limits

1467
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:03,539
which direction you're necessarily uh

1468
01:02:03,539 --> 01:02:06,359
asking to look at time are you going

1469
01:02:06,359 --> 01:02:08,760
with time and there's only one direction

1470
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,400
are you enacting it or are you

1471
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,920
delimiting and able to

1472
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,220
Place some sort of

1473
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:20,760
um gap between the memorial and the

1474
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,400
projectional and the other thing is

1475
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,020
um

1476
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:26,520
I think

1477
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,440
when you walk when we walk into these

1478
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,020
situations and see them as ecologies we

1479
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:33,119
are going to miss things

1480
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:35,339
so I think we just have to accept that

1481
01:02:35,339 --> 01:02:37,680
there will be laterals and collaterals

1482
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:41,700
on the margins that will will sort of

1483
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:44,940
bleed into what our regime of attention

1484
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:48,420
is and so I think if you only focus on

1485
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:50,940
the transmission my turn your turn my

1486
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:53,579
turn your turn you don't have a hope of

1487
01:02:53,579 --> 01:02:56,160
trying to bring those very important

1488
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,980
things that that are essentially

1489
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:02,760
building up whatever you are taking away

1490
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,460
from this communication exercise so

1491
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:07,200
again I think that's something important

1492
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,839
that they raise in sketching this out

1493
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:12,180
there's actually a benefit or a feature

1494
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:14,460
in not filling it in

1495
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:17,940
to in with too much detail because how

1496
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:19,980
could they every time there's a

1497
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:22,140
communication act going on or a dyad

1498
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:25,559
happening the openness of that

1499
01:03:25,559 --> 01:03:27,960
means there's going to be some scale

1500
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,660
friendly Fallout that can't be predicted

1501
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:34,319
with certainty so that I really like

1502
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:37,260
their conclusion actually so

1503
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:39,240
yeah there's my there's my thoughts in

1504
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,460
those last couple of slides

1505
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:44,180
okay

1506
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:47,640
a lot to think about I guess and discuss

1507
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,500
in the coming weeks

1508
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,539
I think a few

1509
01:03:51,539 --> 01:03:54,420
last pieces here

1510
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:58,440
seeing transmission as enablements

1511
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,260
for semantics

1512
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:04,260
and connecting that to the piercing

1513
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:06,839
Triad and abductive logic

1514
01:04:06,839 --> 01:04:11,460
and as a uh escaping the nosedive of

1515
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:14,400
descriptionism and reductionism

1516
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,920
by holding space for the pragmatics if

1517
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,740
nothing else of higher order levels of

1518
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:21,660
analysis and coarse graining so whether

1519
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:23,640
you need to appeal to computational

1520
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,859
resources we won't be able to finish the

1521
01:04:25,859 --> 01:04:29,039
analysis or other kinds of pragmatics

1522
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:32,280
including meaning as pragmatics in the

1523
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:34,680
socially extended cognitive space then

1524
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,839
there's a very rich view in which we

1525
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:39,299
don't need to like reject Digital Signal

1526
01:04:39,299 --> 01:04:41,339
processing in order to have an

1527
01:04:41,339 --> 01:04:43,980
ecological interpretation

1528
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:44,700
um

1529
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:48,059
I think there's a a few other areas we

1530
01:04:48,059 --> 01:04:49,260
can go

1531
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,520
into

1532
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,980
so with that

1533
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:54,780
um we have there's other relevant Works

1534
01:04:54,780 --> 01:05:00,140
to share okay any final final thoughts

1535
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:04,980
no I mean what I appreciate is how uh

1536
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:07,260
how smoothly and quickly we're able to

1537
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:08,579
kind of go through this paper I think

1538
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:12,180
that's a testament to the authors

1539
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:14,420
um being clear about what they wanted to

1540
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:17,760
ascribe and what they wanted people to

1541
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,640
be able and extend off of so it kind of

1542
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,160
reinforces their idea of this extended

1543
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,900
active inference instead of them having

1544
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:27,359
all the answers they just planted some

1545
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:30,000
seeds and let people kind of take it

1546
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,859
pop in different directions which I

1547
01:05:31,859 --> 01:05:33,299
think would maybe was one of their goals

1548
01:05:33,299 --> 01:05:34,920
I don't know

1549
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,380
very nice totally agree I agreed that

1550
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,299
it's very readable

1551
01:05:39,299 --> 01:05:41,339
clear paper

1552
01:05:41,339 --> 01:05:44,099
that laid out a nice path with berries

1553
01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:46,799
to pick from a lot of footnotes and

1554
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:50,400
paths to explore and it is going to be

1555
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,680
great to discuss it in the coming weeks

1556
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,539
so Dean thanks so much for the

1557
01:05:54,539 --> 01:05:57,059
preparation and for joining live and

1558
01:05:57,059 --> 01:05:58,619
we'll see you very soon

1559
01:05:58,619 --> 01:06:00,720
same back right back at you buddy take

1560
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,379
