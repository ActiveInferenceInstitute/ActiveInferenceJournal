00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:30,330
FRIEDMAN: All right.

2
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,032
Hello. Welcome.

3
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,667
It is September 2nd, 2022,

4
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,037
and we're in ActInfLab

5
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,205
Livestream number 48.0.

6
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:41,608
Welcome to the Active

7
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,076
Inference Institute.

8
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,078
We're a participatory online institute

9
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:46,846
that is communicating, learning

10
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,982
and practicing applied active inference.

11
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:51,284
This is a recorded

12
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:52,485
and archived livestream,

13
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:53,820
so please provide feedback

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,989
so we can improve our work.

15
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:56,890
All backgrounds

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,892
and perspectives are welcome

17
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,527
and we'll be following video

18
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:02,095
etiquette for live.

19
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,632
Head to active inference dot org

20
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,101
or active inference institute

21
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,669
to come to our website.

22
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:10,770
Learn more.

23
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:13,306
We are in

24
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:16,209
active stream number 48 series.

25
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,079
We're going to be discussing the paper

26
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:19,946
communication

27
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,981
as socially extended, active

28
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,683
inference and ecological approach

29
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,785
to communicative behavior.

30
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:27,654
Paper in 2021

31
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,390
by RÃ©mi Thyssen and Pierre Poirier.

32
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,592
The video is a total introduction

33
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,327
to some of these ideas.

34
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:36,830
It's not a review or

35
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,698
capturing every aspect for that.

36
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,567
You can read the paper and explore

37
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,702
some of the ideas.

38
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,504
We are going to talk about.

39
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,039
Aims and claims, abstract

40
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,040
roadmap, keywords

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,908
and bring up some notable points.

42
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,411
It is still

43
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:55,215
upcoming with the 48.1 and 48.2.

44
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,217
So people are welcome to

45
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,485
submit questions

46
00:01:58,485 --> 00:01:59,552
or things to discuss,

47
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,753
write comments

48
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,822
and join the panels live if they want.

49
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,257
So

50
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:05,658
let's begin

51
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,727
with introductions and warmup.

52
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,729
I think we can share more

53
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,131
with our big question.

54
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:11,598
So Jean,

55
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:12,832
why don't you say hello

56
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:15,468
and introduce your big question?

57
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:16,803
TICKLES: Thanks, Daniel.

58
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,370
I'm Dina.

59
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,772
I'm Sharon, Calgary, and

60
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:21,674
well,

61
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:22,142
I could

62
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,376
I could read out the big question,

63
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:24,410
but it's pretty long winded.

64
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,713
So I'll just say that I'm always curious

65
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:27,580
about what happens

66
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,915
when active inference

67
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,617
isn't something that we look

68
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,051
at as a subject or a topic.

69
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,987
That is something that we actually

70
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,223
use or perceive as being around us.

71
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:38,658
And so I think the question

72
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,493
of whether or not

73
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,294
you focus on

74
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,495
what's inside of

75
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,863
an ecological space

76
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:47,267
or look at the ecology and the system

77
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:50,770
in which we believe active inference

78
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,974
exist this as and and

79
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:58,745
maybe within because we can the 2747

80
00:02:59,012 --> 00:02:59,579
live stream

81
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,980
we kind of touched on

82
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,815
the idea could be both

83
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:03,683
if if we're going to

84
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,251
if we're going to expand our horizons

85
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:05,618
and look at

86
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:06,819
what kind of limits are

87
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,522
and describe that as an ecology.

88
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,925
My question then is

89
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:16,262
as communication and of communication,

90
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:20,066
what is the product of communication

91
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,402
and what is communication serve?

92
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,572
And so that's kind of like the questions

93
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:25,838
and that's

94
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,307
what in the next three life

95
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,908
means, we can start

96
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:31,244
maybe at least staking out

97
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:36,950
where that ecology begins and ends

98
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:37,817
FRIEDMAN: by.

99
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,352
Well, very interesting.

100
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:39,786
Thanks a lot.

101
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:40,920
Also for

102
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,656
so much of the preparation here,

103
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:46,926
we're still coming down off of 47.

104
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,661
And so I think it's going to

105
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:49,262
be interesting

106
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,897
to see how we approach

107
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,566
pragmatism in this discussions.

108
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:55,168
So the big

109
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:55,802
questions that

110
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,137
brought me to this paper

111
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,672
or that I was thinking about during

112
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:00,740
the paper were

113
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,941
what are the applications

114
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:02,809
and implications

115
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,777
of different interpretations

116
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,746
of communication?

117
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,348
Why does it matter

118
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,950
what would be the things in the world,

119
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,753
including the mind that would be changed

120
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,155
as a factor with or downstream

121
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,924
of how our interpretation

122
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,026
of communication is?

123
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,561
And then what are the causes

124
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:22,862
and consequences

125
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,865
of different perspectives?

126
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,433
We take on active inference,

127
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,036
where perspective also includes action,

128
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,972
propensity and engagement with.

129
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:34,274
So perspective is like

130
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,609
where one is situated and viewing.

131
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,611
And so it's the view from somewhere

132
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,647
from something

133
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:43,383
rather than a view from nowhere.

134
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,351
Slash everywhere.

135
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,488
And I think in that specificity

136
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,490
we can have a lot of discussions

137
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,891
about ecology

138
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:55,595
as a great system to learn from in yeah.

139
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,430
I think when we're outside it earth

140
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,898
we perceive ourselves

141
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,301
where we're we're framing

142
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,236
that would be the on this slide

143
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,505
that would be the first box.

144
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,306
That's our sense

145
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,341
that we're kind of outside of the system

146
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,676
looking in,

147
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,211
whereas the second box on the right

148
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,515
would be, well, we're embedded.

149
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,183
And now the, the, the,

150
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,418
the reason we're at

151
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,553
it is as the genie came out, it got out

152
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:21,988
and now it's all around us.

153
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,791
TICKLES: It's kind of like that.

154
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,926
The perfume is now being distributed

155
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:27,527
through the air

156
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,928
and now we're walking through it.

157
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,397
So which of those two things,

158
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,667
depending upon how we want to analyze

159
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,469
which of those two things

160
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,071
produce, what results sort of thing.

161
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,005
And I think we're both kind

162
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,574
of asking the same question.

163
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,976
If this then what?

164
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:47,780
If that, then what?

165
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,481
FRIEDMAN: All right.

166
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,719
I'll read the first half, the abstract

167
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:53,519
in this paper

168
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,455
we introduce in ecological accounts

169
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,255
communication,

170
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,658
according to which acts of communication

171
00:05:58,658 --> 00:05:59,192
are active

172
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,159
inferences achieved

173
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,627
by affecting the behavior

174
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,363
of target organism

175
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,464
via the modification

176
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,599
of its field of affordances.

177
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,568
Constraining a target organisms

178
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,036
behavior constitutes

179
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,003
a mechanism

180
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:13,239
of socially extended active inference,

181
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,174
allowing organisms

182
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,843
to proactively regulate

183
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,112
their inner states through the behavior

184
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:23,716
of other organisms.

185
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,717
TICKLES: In this general conception

186
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,451
of communication,

187
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,120
the type of cooperative communication

188
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,187
characteristic of human

189
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,423
communicative interaction

190
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,625
is a way of constraining interaction

191
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:36,195
dynamics towards the goals of a given

192
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,497
joint action

193
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:39,265
by constructing

194
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,067
and altering

195
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,568
shared fields of affordances.

196
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,670
This account embraces a pragmatist view,

197
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,806
according to which communication

198
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:47,707
is a form of action,

199
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,142
aiming to influence

200
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,643
behavior of a target and stands

201
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,211
against the traditional

202
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:55,982
transmission view.

203
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:56,382
Sorry,

204
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:57,750
you just have to shut up here

205
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,787
because it kind of slid on my screen.

206
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,355
Where am I transmission to you?

207
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,723
According to which communication?

208
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,958
Fundamentally to convey information,

209
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,428
understanding acts of communication.

210
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:09,495
This act of inference

211
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:09,962
under this

212
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,464
ecological interpretation

213
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,599
allows us to link communicative

214
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,302
and ultimately linguistic behavior

215
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,938
to the biological imperative, minimize

216
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:20,106
free energy,

217
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:20,873
and emphasize

218
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:21,941
the action oriented nature

219
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,143
of communicative action

220
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,445
interactions.

221
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,247
FRIEDMAN: All right, nice.

222
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,249
Here's the road map,

223
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,418
and there's some light

224
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,387
sometimes consisting

225
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,622
highlighting at play.

226
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,225
The paper is prose based.

227
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,593
There are not any figures

228
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,361
or formal isms.

229
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,530
However many are suggested.

230
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,934
So we'll have an interesting time.

231
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,203
I think making some representations,

232
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:50,970
using words,

233
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,306
maybe some non linguistic communication

234
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:54,841
because there's so much to add.

235
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:58,878
It's not providing visual centers

236
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,247
as many papers outside

237
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,850
of especially philosophy do.

238
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,885
So first there's an introduction.

239
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,521
Then the central distinction or

240
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,757
dialectic or division is introduced.

241
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:12,892
The transmission

242
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,162
and the influencing

243
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,264
the and verses but or

244
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,834
the contrary is indications that we've

245
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,903
kind of explored this time.

246
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,371
That type of a dyadic

247
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,639
comparison is being brought

248
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,675
to two views of communication

249
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,912
to supporting witnesses join,

250
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,516
which are ecological interpretation,

251
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,452
the ecological developments and the turn

252
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,755
in that area and active inference.

253
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,891
And they're going to

254
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,260
then in communication, active inference

255
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,728
focusing on human

256
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,364
cooperative communication.

257
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,500
Describe how under ecological

258
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,936
and active inference starting points

259
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,639
justified starting points,

260
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,374
as they'll argue

261
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,610
that we can endorse a pragmatist view

262
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,546
at the

263
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,683
detriment to the transmission view.

264
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:11,584
Any other thoughts?

265
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:12,451
Yes.

266
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,454
TICKLES: Now, the authors are pretty clear.

267
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,222
They they

268
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,857
describe this paper

269
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,459
or these arguments as a sketch.

270
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:21,761
So when we say roadmap here,

271
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,796
I think that it's more of

272
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,967
it's not a

273
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:31,637
what a highly detailed, highly specified

274
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:36,309
zoom in on a on a you very precise

275
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,343
Google map.

276
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:38,311
This is kind of a back

277
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,912
of the napkin idea

278
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,481
for for a conversation starter.

279
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,217
And so I appreciate that

280
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,052
because I mean,

281
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,254
at least by the authors saying,

282
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,289
we want to get this down,

283
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,390
we want to stake this out

284
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,025
and then let people decide

285
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:53,826
how to come at this

286
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,094
empirically to maybe fill

287
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,797
in some more of the precision.

288
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,966
FRIEDMAN: Yeah, it's like planning a road trip

289
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:01,767
in its implications,

290
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,735
especially that

291
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:06,138
itself is an entire completed work.

292
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:11,644
Let's just jump to the aims.

293
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,179
Well, the top two aims

294
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,547
are some of the largest.

295
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,681
They summarize their work

296
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:16,549
as introducing

297
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,884
a pragmatist conception of communication

298
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:23,055
grounded in ecology of active inference.

299
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,725
So the three threads are pragmatism,

300
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,094
ecological interpretation

301
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,695
and active inference

302
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:32,064
about communication.

303
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,200
And they're going to argue

304
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,103
that all of communication be understood

305
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,472
as socially extended, active inference

306
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,975
be understood by whom, when,

307
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,712
and those are some of the points

308
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:47,880
it brings us to.

309
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,716
Secondly, there are some direct

310
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:54,620
contradictions slash tensions described

311
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,423
and contrasting

312
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:01,494
with the transmission view, which is the

313
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,064
the dancing partner of the advance

314
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:09,268
of the ecological pragmatic active view

315
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:10,469
is two

316
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:11,470
is by contrast

317
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,439
with the transmission view,

318
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,608
which can help a lot with literature

319
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,076
continuity

320
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:20,212
in in setting direction for research

321
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:20,913
field people

322
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:21,781
looking for transmission

323
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,849
view can see that there's a paper

324
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,451
from 2021

325
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:26,886
that's that's connecting

326
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,387
and finding concordance.

327
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:29,855
And as they mentioned

328
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:30,756
they will

329
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,158
stress in several different ways

330
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,460
that it's an initial account

331
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,763
with many gestured to next directions

332
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,066
that will get to any other thoughts.

333
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:40,833
TICKLES: Yes. Yeah.

334
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,836
I think without using these terms,

335
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:44,970
they're they're saying,

336
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:47,540
you know, there's

337
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,841
there are nodes out there,

338
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,042
there's interconnect,

339
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,444
there are potential connections

340
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,111
out there.

341
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,145
One way of doing

342
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,114
that is through a transmission line.

343
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,516
And what we would like to do is maybe

344
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,288
advance the idea that those links

345
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,423
are a little bit more embellished

346
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,058
than something simple.

347
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,159
And so,

348
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:07,560
again,

349
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,128
those are the terms that they use.

350
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,063
But with Daniel,

351
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,331
you're better at this than I am.

352
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:12,732
We have

353
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,265
a recent

354
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,133
live stream this year,

355
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,034
I think, where

356
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,535
we talked about offloading

357
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,704
as being a really important part

358
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:22,541
of extending the active inference.

359
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,811
You remember which one that was

360
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:27,646
kind of.

361
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,115
Yeah, yeah.

362
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,050
FRIEDMAN: Extent to which something was extended.

363
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,152
Let's look I f yeah.

364
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,122
It was with the cognitive offloading.

365
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:36,822
TICKLES: Cognitive all.

366
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:37,890
Communicate

367
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,258
this is 48 or extended

368
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,593
active inference constructing

369
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,527
predictive capacity

370
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,696
beyond Scholes number 41.

371
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:44,697
Right and that and that

372
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,332
and that live stream

373
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,566
there wasn't really

374
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,802
it wasn't anything in that idea that

375
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:53,973
the between this was like the whole idea

376
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:57,143
of how markup it may function

377
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,179
as a way of of of focusing

378
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,149
or bringing down the amount of noise

379
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,851
and raising up the amount of signal in a

380
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,419
in a space outside yourself.

381
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,687
There was no

382
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,122
we didn't have a lot of pushback

383
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,558
on how that theoretically would work.

384
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,660
So I don't think that they're stepping

385
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,328
into that twilight zone

386
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,030
by mentioning this.

387
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,431
FRIEDMAN: Nice. All right.

388
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,801
So they

389
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,002
make several claims

390
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,336
that are summarized here,

391
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,705
but we'll we'll deal them in

392
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,341
the sections in rough order.

393
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,976
Anything to add, though?

394
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:31,610
Okay.

395
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,812
TICKLES: These are just not really

396
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,079
going to come up yet.

397
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,247
FRIEDMAN: Yeah, these are some summaries

398
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,383
of some important claims,

399
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,651
but we're going to come up with them.

400
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,785
So. All right.

401
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,153
And then last,

402
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,555
last stop,

403
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,090
before we jump into the background,

404
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,492
which is one term

405
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,360
and then the paper itself,

406
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,298
what are the keywords in your eye?

407
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,600
TICKLES: Well, I mean,

408
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,303
we had dynamical systems model

409
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,571
in the last live stream, too.

410
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,439
So there's a lot of people that are

411
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,676
are depending on that theory

412
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,177
to advance

413
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,080
whatever arguments they want to make.

414
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,114
And the other

415
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,015
I think the other term

416
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:10,749
that comes up quite

417
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,852
often is joint actions

418
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,854
without really getting into some

419
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,689
hard specifics about what

420
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,490
that might look like on a

421
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,192
scale friendly level. So

422
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:21,894
I think when

423
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:22,661
the authors

424
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:23,195
join us,

425
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,231
I think both of those things are things

426
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:25,965
we'll have.

427
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,300
There's fertile ground there to

428
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,537
to grow some conversations.

429
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,404
FRIEDMAN: Awesome.

430
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:33,772
The one I would just want to

431
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:36,642
highlight is Dynamical Systems Model.

432
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,211
You you mentioned how

433
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,279
maybe just rephrasing

434
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,181
that people use it to

435
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,983
in a lot of different ways

436
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,085
and just that being raised

437
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,053
made me think about

438
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:51,757
what is being advanced by claiming that

439
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,226
alone or together,

440
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,195
something changes through time.

441
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,529
Does anyone disagree

442
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,297
and would it matter

443
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,031
that anyone disagrees?

444
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,332
But what does dynamical mean

445
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,734
when we're talking about time

446
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,736
dependent, real existing systems?

447
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:07,106
What does it mean that you have a system

448
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:10,175
or a model or a systems model?

449
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,310
What does that mean?

450
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,378
Because that's something

451
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,979
that's an artifact

452
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,482
or is it a, quote, mental model?

453
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,050
And so there's a lot to explore

454
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:18,684
about what

455
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,319
is being meant

456
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,554
by dynamical systems model.

457
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:23,989
We're thinking about time

458
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,559
or does it mean something more than that

459
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,796
continuous time, discrete time

460
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:31,697
implementation.

461
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,432
In fact,

462
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,334
there's so many aspects to it

463
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,201
and it's actually going

464
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,304
to come back at the very end.

465
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,271
All right.

466
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,907
And pragmatics,

467
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,142
also the top part,

468
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,643
you could mention anything otherwise.

469
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,045
Then how does this connect

470
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:51,250
to what we discussed in 47?

471
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,084
TICKLES: Well,

472
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,586
I kind of wrote this, so grab a read it.

473
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,422
Pragmatism in action,

474
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,423
especially the question

475
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,658
of what makes up an aim.

476
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:00,859
And I put in behind

477
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:04,396
that the act, the act, the process

478
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,165
and aiming,

479
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,132
which is the sense

480
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,500
aligning, which is

481
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,369
we all know as the generative model

482
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,638
given targeting with what there's

483
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:13,772
still a question of

484
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,007
what are we targeting with

485
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:15,708
when we,

486
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,010
when we put it all under one umbrella

487
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,778
called active inference,

488
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,780
a situational analysis tool.

489
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,016
This this is we've had lots

490
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,250
and lots of people

491
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,251
claim that that's what's

492
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,187
that's what active inference is.

493
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,188
It's a range finder

494
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,456
with a depth of filter

495
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,257
or is active inference

496
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,692
in a performance generator

497
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,661
something that enables as collection

498
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,428
given

499
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,130
to reframing or

500
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,366
depth stabilization or both?

501
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,834
Now, if you want to write

502
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,569
an academic paper,

503
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,738
it's way easier to just limit it to.

504
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,740
Active inference is a stabilize.

505
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,176
Now we have t01, two and so on,

506
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,712
but it's also

507
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:54,813
a way to

508
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,915
delimit that temporal,

509
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,117
spatial, temporal field.

510
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,818
So we just ignore that

511
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:00,886
because it's easier to write,

512
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:04,957
because if we do, that's

513
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,725
where the arrow of time,

514
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:07,292
meaning where

515
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,494
we're kind of more moving

516
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,696
with the flow and temporal depth

517
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,797
through the memorial

518
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,066
and across the spectrum, the spectral

519
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,070
range, whatever we arbitrarily pick

520
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,606
as our projection on integration space

521
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,176
must both be induced

522
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,044
or included

523
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,246
in whatever the representational is

524
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,281
if we analyze the entanglement

525
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,016
along with the attainment.

526
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,718
So what is the relationship is?

527
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,553
I mean, is the relationship

528
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,655
in the passing rings?

529
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:37,756
No, of course it isn't.

530
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,826
But those symbols still reinforce

531
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,327
what's going on.

532
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,463
So how can we just say

533
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:47,199
there's no representational ism in this?

534
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,401
It would it would be hard to do that

535
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:53,372
on realistic scans.

536
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,541
That would be pragmatics in a nutshell

537
00:17:55,808 --> 00:18:02,014
to me.

538
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:07,252
FRIEDMAN: Very interesting closure.

539
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,520
TICKLES: Well, especially if you're

540
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,355
if you're recently involved in a

541
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,990
in a long lasting, long

542
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,459
term relationship. Right.

543
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,495
FRIEDMAN: It's so true.

544
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:16,728
Yeah.

545
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:17,663
The part I'll point out

546
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:18,330
is just the few

547
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,299
highlighted words on the top

548
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,701
with a lot of citations provided

549
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,970
that are going to be taking a pragmatic

550
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,140
federation approach,

551
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,375
broadly disparate interests and foci

552
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:34,046
that are being used by these authors

553
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,314
in their advancement

554
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,216
of an anti transmission view

555
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:37,950
distributed language

556
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,152
hypothesis, constraint view of language,

557
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,955
participatory sense making framework.

558
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,190
Maybe those fields are connected

559
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,659
in their citations or co-authorship,

560
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,294
but then the authors

561
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,429
are able to connect these

562
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,763
as kind of three people

563
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:54,099
pointing at the same process or thing.

564
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:58,337
And that's like a nice dense usage

565
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,738
that could be really catching people

566
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,740
up on a few ways

567
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,143
to navigate these topics,

568
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,911
because there's a lot of related topics.

569
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:06,178
It's like,

570
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,112
aren't we just talking about

571
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,780
how things are,

572
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,485
including how modeling is?

573
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,219
They begin

574
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:14,953
in the introduction

575
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,723
with an overview of the

576
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:18,690
layout of their paper

577
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:20,492
and they

578
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,128
describe, as they mentioned, the sketch.

579
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:24,997
It's a pragmatist account

580
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,732
of communicative behavior

581
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,101
grounded in ecological interpretation of

582
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:32,337
the active inference framework,

583
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,872
contrasted with the transmission

584
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,340
view of communication,

585
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,808
according to which the function

586
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:37,509
of communicative

587
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,878
behavior is to convey information.

588
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,781
So a claim is

589
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:43,882
that communication

590
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:46,785
is about information transmission.

591
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,720
Then they are contrasting that

592
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,121
in light

593
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,556
of ecological

594
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,891
psychology and theory broadly,

595
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:56,228
and also giving an active inference

596
00:19:56,728 --> 00:20:00,132
twist slash theory, integration

597
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,334
slash introduction

598
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,001
of free energy

599
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,003
minimization or uncertainty reduction

600
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,705
as imperatives

601
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,073
or modeling imperatives

602
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,609
or existence imperatives.

603
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,311
Whereas some of these previous

604
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,246
threads, like ecological psychology

605
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,214
more neutrally,

606
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,315
wouldn't have

607
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,316
necessarily a formal

608
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:20,319
or a first principles way

609
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,655
to connect to modern applications,

610
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,191
though they may have a first principles

611
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:27,459
grounding and pragmatism.

612
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,261
So many of the

613
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:29,761
pieces have

614
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:30,896
already been assembled

615
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,263
in terms

616
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,398
of the ecological and pragmatic

617
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,667
and and all of these areas

618
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,170
coming together outside of the paper.

619
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,772
And so that will be a theme

620
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,775
what is linking out to other empirical

621
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,677
and philosophical literature.

622
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:48,780
What is active inference doing in this

623
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,950
mediation as a framework,

624
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:53,852
something that makes it

625
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:54,653
an organized

626
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,022
principle, organizing principle

627
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,156
in a way that merely

628
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:01,360
the literature corpus of these areas,

629
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,961
which in many respects

630
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,596
have been connected,

631
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,165
like the pragmatics of linguistics.

632
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,134
So what is active inference?

633
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,737
Doing anything to add on that?

634
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:12,170
TICKLES: Well,

635
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,373
again, I don't think it's hard

636
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,907
to argue that

637
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,443
to focus only on the string

638
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,012
and the two cups

639
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,681
is probably reducing to fork.

640
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:23,815
Or when we're talking

641
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,150
about communication, I mean, they're

642
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,285
they're entangled, right.

643
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,086
Like they're now tied together.

644
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,121
But what the authors

645
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,055
are trying to point out here

646
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,090
is that there also are signal

647
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,760
learners and signal receivers in it.

648
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,361
And as soon as you add

649
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,163
more layers to this of what's

650
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:38,730
actually going

651
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,933
on, suddenly an ecology emerges.

652
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,935
So let's step back

653
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,105
and look at everything that is possibly

654
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,974
participate painting in this,

655
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,542
not just the hardware.

656
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,110
And so again,

657
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,446
it will be hard to argue against that.

658
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,114
At the same time,

659
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,684
if you and I don't have all of the

660
00:21:59,351 --> 00:21:59,851
all of

661
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:00,952
the things

662
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:01,486
that we need

663
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,754
to communicate from Davis,

664
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,923
California, to Calgary, Canada,

665
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,725
no matter how much we scream,

666
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,193
there is no communication.

667
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,762
There's no live stream 48 right now.

668
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,731
So again,

669
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,867
to dismiss a transmission view, I think

670
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,169
is also probably

671
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,637
not the best idea in the world,

672
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:21,573
because without that, what do you got?

673
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,276
FRIEDMAN: Yup, good point.

674
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:24,609
And they'll

675
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:25,744
bring up that sort

676
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,879
of enabling system perspective

677
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,182
in the conclusion very clearly.

678
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,484
Yeah, they set up the perspective

679
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,253
of communication as transmitting

680
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,490
information, symbolic information

681
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,258
or other kinds of information

682
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,894
influencing sculpting.

683
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,062
What is it influencing?

684
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,765
Is it modifying cognitive dials?

685
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:47,833
Is it modifying

686
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,868
the field of affordances?

687
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,470
Is it doing both?

688
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,371
Is it

689
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,940
any number of ways

690
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,641
that people have been studying

691
00:22:56,641 --> 00:23:00,178
the nexus of communication,

692
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,782
intra species, interpersonally,

693
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:07,152
everything.

694
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,920
And you've done it a lot to say.

695
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,388
TICKLES: I'm going to say

696
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:09,888
if you read

697
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,256
if you've read anything

698
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:13,191
from Charles Sanders Peirce,

699
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:15,727
you would have to say it's both

700
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,828
like you.

701
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:19,231
I mean, if you're a follower,

702
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,866
you're not left with much choice

703
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,268
because there's a lot of in it's

704
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:23,935
nonsense going on

705
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,504
because it's a lot of interpreting and.

706
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:29,608
FRIEDMAN: Yeah, awesome.

707
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,076
All right.

708
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,312
Setting the context, do

709
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:35,080
you want to mention it or do

710
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,015
I mean to mention it? Go for it.

711
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:37,682
All right.

712
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:38,150
Well,

713
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,051
the first footnote is about

714
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:42,020
the notion of information.

715
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,656
And they describe different information

716
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,893
and uncertainty concepts

717
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,761
which we can address

718
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,663
in later discussions.

719
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:56,001
They do not dedicate a lot of time

720
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,169
and space

721
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:01,006
to fleshing out the transmission view

722
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,541
and different ways

723
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:03,542
that people have formally,

724
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,010
informally addressed it, causes

725
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,578
and consequences, etc.

726
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:07,813
However, they have provided

727
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,614
a lot of citations.

728
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:13,185
Then, in footnote four,

729
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:16,054
they are describing French

730
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,257
a writing in the 1890s,

731
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:22,861
which is a very interesting connection.

732
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,262
I don't know the details,

733
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:27,132
but some is provided in this section.

734
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:28,200
Footnote

735
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,435
It's an interesting path.

736
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,537
It would be fun to kind of go down more

737
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:36,908
because we've now brought back in Paris

738
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:40,278
to the discussion as others are.

739
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,047
And I think

740
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:43,081
walking the fine line

741
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:43,882
between

742
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,351
not using last names for equations

743
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:50,222
while respecting the process

744
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,724
and contributions of past

745
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,560
researchers and practitioners

746
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,530
in just different areas, will be really

747
00:24:59,364 --> 00:24:59,965
part of what

748
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:04,236
active inference brings together.

749
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,170
All right, anything else.

750
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:09,241
I, I would say is that I think what this

751
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,109
maybe points out, again,

752
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,210
this is not what they wrote

753
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,312
in their notes, but

754
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:15,714
with every transmission,

755
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:17,282
there are things like

756
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:20,619
conflict embedded in that or complexity

757
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:21,453
embedded in that.

758
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:22,187
I mean, any

759
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,154
any good

760
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:23,822
writer knows

761
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,457
that you can't just transmit

762
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,391
a bunch of information.

763
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:26,725
There are

764
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:29,528
there are expectation issues around what

765
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,430
what are you moving towards

766
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:35,600
and why would I continue to communicate?

767
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,603
TICKLES: And so you have to have a context around

768
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:41,373
which that that continuing

769
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,210
regime of attention is held up.

770
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,144
FRIEDMAN: Yep, sure.

771
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,846
Attention regimes of attention

772
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,214
joint action.

773
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,282
Oh yeah.

774
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,883
So setting logic

775
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,151
here, they are going to flush out

776
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,920
two primary reasons to explore

777
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,122
theoretical alternatives to TV.

778
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,823
So not they're wrong.

779
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,358
They thought that.

780
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:02,861
But there are two reasons to explore.

781
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:05,897
We're at camp and we're going

782
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,333
to explore some theoretical

783
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,100
alternatives.

784
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:11,369
Firstly,

785
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:14,039
TV entails a commitment to an account

786
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,341
of the putative contents

787
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,510
conveyed via communication.

788
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,444
Providing such an account

789
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:20,445
is notoriously difficult,

790
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,180
especially if linguistic practices

791
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,281
cannot be invoked

792
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:26,618
as part of the explanation in

793
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:29,054
very deep

794
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:29,454
points

795
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:31,456
about what is linguistically accessible

796
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:32,090
or consciously

797
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,060
accessible, perceptible under different

798
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,797
situations, through different kinds

799
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:41,433
of memory, anticipation,

800
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:44,803
and all these features

801
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:47,739
which we know do play roles in

802
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,275
symbiosis.

803
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:53,478
And then the second reason

804
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:56,348
why to explore theoretical iterative is

805
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,116
how it's not clear

806
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,584
that communication conceived of

807
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:00,919
as the transmission of content

808
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:01,553
could be relevant

809
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:02,153
to the basic

810
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:03,221
allosteric processes

811
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:05,290
which drive the behavior of organisms.

812
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,993
So you might say bio semiotic li

813
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:09,894
the pancreas communicates

814
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:10,996
with different cells

815
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,998
in the body through hormone signaling,

816
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,967
but in a transmission to you,

817
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,003
would one be committed to the viewpoint?

818
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,905
Insulin means do X, Y or z?

819
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,509
To whom under what conditions?

820
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,778
In what ways is that a communication?

821
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:29,247
So especially at scales and systems

822
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:30,215
that aren't

823
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,516
quite literally humans

824
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:33,051
talking about language

825
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:35,420
which is quite common, then

826
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,555
there's going to be an account

827
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:38,523
that's non linguistic.

828
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,825
So to what extent are we

829
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:44,195
going to privilege or center

830
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:47,499
this type of linguistic discourse

831
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:51,069
and communication in a broader ecology

832
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:54,139
of communication?

833
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,375
TICKLES: So if the if the content by itself can't

834
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,544
or cannot

835
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,548
help us derive meaning,

836
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:03,915
then what

837
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,550
this essentially is saying is,

838
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,118
is that we need more than that

839
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:08,253
in order to get

840
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,922
the equals sign or symbol to

841
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:14,526
equal weight to meaning.

842
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:15,193
Right.

843
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,761
So that's all essentially what you're

844
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:18,496
trying to talk about here is

845
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:21,499
if we're going to go past TV y.

846
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,236
FRIEDMAN: Yeah, it could be a supplement to TV or

847
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,971
an extension of TV,

848
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:28,440
which, as I point out

849
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,542
later, can ever be denied or rejected.

850
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,778
So then pragmatism.

851
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:36,781
They trace a thread of scholarship

852
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:39,851
in which language is viewed as

853
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:40,752
a form of action.

854
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,621
And I'm reminded of

855
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:44,456
Professor Deborah

856
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:45,590
Gordon's paper

857
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,293
that can sustain an ant watching,

858
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,462
seeing the behavioral ecologist

859
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:53,098
as they're observing ant behavior,

860
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,835
the multiple stages and steps and ways

861
00:28:57,368 --> 00:29:01,406
that knowing and acting and naming

862
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:04,609
of different kinds, names of activities

863
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,945
and then association of activities

864
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:09,481
as named with identities.

865
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,450
And that naming process

866
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,452
that comes in very late

867
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:15,720
in the game

868
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,723
in terms of the actions taken to prepare

869
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:21,126
the context for that observation.

870
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:22,827
So I thought that was a

871
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:23,928
very interesting link.

872
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,263
And here are those green

873
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,664
highlighted words from earlier.

874
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:27,832
So what else would you add about

875
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:29,834
pragmatism?

876
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:33,738
TICKLES: Well, I think what they were

877
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:34,939
moving towards here,

878
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:35,907
at least alerting us to,

879
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:36,841
is that the fact

880
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,143
that there are aspects

881
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,744
of a pragmatist view,

882
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:40,845
although it may sound

883
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:42,447
a little strange to say it at first,

884
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,782
I think is true,

885
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,750
at least with a pragmatist view.

886
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,186
You can now conjure things

887
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,289
that you can't do simply with content.

888
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:51,956
I mean,

889
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,626
I can have a whole bunch of ingredients

890
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,327
and not have a recipe,

891
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:57,896
but at least with a pragmatist view.

892
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,798
Now I can start experimenting,

893
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,499
and I think that's all they're

894
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:04,335
basically asking us to contemplate.

895
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:08,173
It's the experimentation piece.

896
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:09,073
It's not just

897
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,342
sort of leaving everything out on the

898
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,878
on the bench and going, Whoa, well,

899
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,113
I can take an account of this

900
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,247
or an inventory of it,

901
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,783
but not really do anything with it.

902
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:19,851
So that's

903
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:21,586
that's what I take away from

904
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,221
this part of the paper.

905
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,122
FRIEDMAN: Nice.

906
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:24,923
All right.

907
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,391
Here's a discussion around

908
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:29,828
what signals mean anything to add?

909
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,962
TICKLES: Not me.

910
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:31,996
It just read it.

911
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:32,430
It's pretty.

912
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,699
FRIEDMAN: Straight up. Yes.

913
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:35,433
Okay.

914
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,602
In this section

915
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:38,970
setting active inference

916
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:39,737
framework,

917
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:41,272
we've informally introduced

918
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:44,008
the ecological interpretation

919
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:47,312
of the active inference framework

920
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,547
in the terms of which we will formulate

921
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:52,283
a pragmatist conception of communication

922
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,484
in section

923
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:57,121
communication and active inference.

924
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,057
When is it of the active inference

925
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,259
framework, the genitive case?

926
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,594
When is it in the active

927
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,896
inference framework? The locative case

928
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,199
with the instrumental case?

929
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,701
There's so many

930
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,070
routes to explore with linguistic

931
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,339
and non linguistic communication.

932
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:18,543
Even only keeping with active inference

933
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:22,847
as the gripper and the drift right.

934
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:24,616
They provide a description

935
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,418
which is copied here,

936
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:30,121
and one key line

937
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,222
that they'll bring back

938
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,757
in service of communication

939
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,792
is organisms can reduce free energy

940
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,128
either by adjusting the sensory

941
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:39,330
input to the generative model,

942
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,066
quote, active inference, or by adjusting

943
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,701
the generative model to the sensory

944
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:45,770
input perceptual inference,

945
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,771
which correspond

946
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:49,007
respectively to action and perception.

947
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:50,708
So one could ask

948
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:51,876
whether active inference

949
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:54,245
only applies to adjusting sensory input

950
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,749
or what whether action

951
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,083
corresponds to active inference

952
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,852
and perception to perceptual inference.

953
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,720
That's one way to think about it.

954
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,354
It certainly is

955
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:04,622
one sense of active inference,

956
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,624
which is inference about action

957
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,359
planning,

958
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,260
decision making,

959
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,663
and also the consequences of action

960
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,131
being able to introduce preference

961
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:16,067
into future and current actions.

962
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,804
And we're talking about acting

963
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:21,339
inference also as a framework

964
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,909
for considering this view.

965
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,511
So

966
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,347
that was just the connection

967
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:30,448
with active inference there.

968
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,618
One connection a part is a part of this.

969
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,821
I ask you because I'll ask I may

970
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:39,524
ask the authors to do the dot one is

971
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:41,459
of this stuff

972
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,493
that they just wrote out here

973
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:43,861
because we've seen this many,

974
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:44,362
many times.

975
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:46,230
People just want to make sure

976
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,666
that they're following what

977
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,601
the three energy principle

978
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,670
up to this point has

979
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:56,374
has has generally been agreed to to mean

980
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:57,542
my question

981
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:57,909
from that

982
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,944
last organisms can reduce free energy

983
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:00,912
either by

984
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:04,582
so if I were to give you the metaphor

985
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:05,383
of getting the

986
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:08,987
toothpaste back into the tube,

987
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,788
how does communication serve

988
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,523
that purpose?

989
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:13,591
TICKLES: Right.

990
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:14,592
Because it's really,

991
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,694
really easy to squeeze it out.

992
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:19,097
But how does communication serve?

993
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:20,431
You get it back in

994
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:22,367
because

995
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,069
it it can.

996
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:25,770
But how does

997
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,605
how does what they're describing here

998
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:30,842
as an ecological view

999
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:35,546
speak to that?

1000
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:36,848
FRIEDMAN: Let's explore.

1001
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:37,849
TICKLES: Yeah.

1002
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,317
They then go to

1003
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,152
the ecological interpretation

1004
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:42,653
of active inference.

1005
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:43,855
So after introducing

1006
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,024
just purely in principle,

1007
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,325
using some active

1008
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:50,862
inference, ontology terms and key ideas

1009
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,364
like embodiment of generative models

1010
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,433
and reduction of surprise,

1011
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,802
or bounding that through variational

1012
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:00,138
and expected free energy,

1013
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:04,575
they continue to add in ingredients

1014
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:06,577
to the recipe and

1015
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:11,082
contrast a abstract theory

1016
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,117
neutral description

1017
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,154
of active inference, which is their

1018
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:20,324
framing of vanilla or standalone

1019
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,427
more somehow,

1020
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,862
perhaps archetypal active inference

1021
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:27,365
as being theory neutral

1022
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,766
and hence compiled,

1023
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:29,767
and therefore compatible

1024
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:32,170
with many conceptions of cognition,

1025
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,505
FRIEDMAN: pointing to a citation

1026
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,041
where it's described as a state theory

1027
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:37,942
compatible

1028
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:39,710
with many different process theories,

1029
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,879
which is why potentially someone

1030
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,214
could, and probably has argued

1031
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:43,915
for a transmission

1032
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,650
view using active inference

1033
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,118
as symbolic communication

1034
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,120
or semantic communication.

1035
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,788
There's probably so many

1036
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,356
angles on that we could

1037
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,229
bringing in the ecological papers,

1038
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:00,498
citing some of the earlier

1039
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,567
ecological psychology

1040
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,936
and perceptual work

1041
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,437
in predictive processing,

1042
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,738
and then just connecting it

1043
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:09,240
to more recent papers.

1044
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,310
For example, Bromberg, Christine

1045
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,979
Rietveld, Ramstad

1046
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,282
many of these authors collaborations in

1047
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,518
about the past six years,

1048
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:23,754
anything else that.

1049
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:24,288
TICKLES: Well,

1050
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:25,089
I got some notes

1051
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:25,756
that I want to

1052
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:26,891
talk about on the top one,

1053
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:29,527
but I think this is interesting because

1054
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:32,530
it would be at this point where

1055
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,032
if they wanted to introduce formalism,

1056
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,601
which basically are

1057
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:37,602
just a bunch of

1058
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:38,769
symbols set up

1059
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,072
operationally that they could,

1060
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,540
but they haven't.

1061
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,543
So how do we explain or

1062
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:47,879
how do we take into account

1063
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:51,315
all of those formulas that we've looked

1064
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,585
at throughout a number of live streams?

1065
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:55,987
If we're stop

1066
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,155
if we're talking about something

1067
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,590
that's ecological

1068
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,326
because they are they're so

1069
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:05,763
so are they floating around us

1070
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:07,698
or are they only something that

1071
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,967
we keep inside of a very contained,

1072
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:14,438
very constrained, very conditions set

1073
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:17,208
aspect of this of this diverse,

1074
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,278
very complex

1075
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:24,182
situation that we find ourselves under.

1076
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:24,815
So yeah,

1077
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,484
that when you as soon as you say,

1078
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:27,885
oh, I would

1079
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:28,519
I would assume

1080
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,488
that one of the products of

1081
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:31,923
an ecological interpretation

1082
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,158
would be a hold my formalism

1083
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,627
because you could derive this

1084
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:37,828
pretty well.

1085
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:38,696
I can't I'm

1086
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:42,033
not Carl or or Thomas or one of those,

1087
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:43,534
you know, super

1088
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,369
math people, but they can.

1089
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,538
So so what do we how do we

1090
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:51,275
are we account for that.

1091
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:51,776
FRIEDMAN: Yeah.

1092
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:52,510
One note on

1093
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,746
that is some of the famous models

1094
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:59,717
of predator prey type dynamics are those

1095
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,786
dynamical equations

1096
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,055
are used in neuroimaging

1097
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,390
to model, for example, winner

1098
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,092
list competitions

1099
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:09,227
among brain regions

1100
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,395
or with different signaling regimes.

1101
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,763
So in many ways

1102
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:15,032
the SPM package specifically

1103
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:18,603
as well as neuroscience more broadly,

1104
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:20,705
many threads and precursors are here,

1105
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:24,075
which is why I really appreciate that

1106
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,112
by interpreting

1107
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:29,080
the way you are

1108
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,581
about how active inference

1109
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,017
is being interpreted,

1110
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,952
there aren't just

1111
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,255
the bullet point or the visual abstract

1112
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,591
of active inference.

1113
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,927
If that is the active inference,

1114
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:46,163
that is the interpretation

1115
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:48,666
of the authors

1116
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,535
using active inference.

1117
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:52,670
They're working through it

1118
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,740
and making a trace in a process

1119
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,707
versus just saying, Well,

1120
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:57,842
this is the standalone

1121
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,877
author independent interpretation.

1122
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:00,978
Well, I'm

1123
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:03,080
not sure if that makes sense, but

1124
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:04,515
all right,

1125
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:08,486
this here's some text on a slide

1126
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,856
to look at connecting

1127
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,626
a spatial temporal structure

1128
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:18,629
of affordances in ecological settings.

1129
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,531
The concept known

1130
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:21,832
as field of affordances

1131
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:25,436
or the landscape of affordances

1132
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:26,837
and different affordances,

1133
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:30,074
different kinds of action capacity.

1134
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,943
Introducing how salience and attention

1135
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:35,546
and proclivity towards and affordances

1136
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:38,716
is determined by its free energy,

1137
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:39,450
by the free energy

1138
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,451
it was expected to reduce

1139
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:42,687
by the system

1140
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:47,491
entity or by the modeler.

1141
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,426
And there's a few more notes

1142
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:49,860
on ecological psychology

1143
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,163
and affordances, and I just.

1144
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,465
Require that it's in the last bullet.

1145
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:55,533
I think it's

1146
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:56,701
I think it's really important

1147
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:57,668
to again,

1148
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,569
to go back to the

1149
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,037
I want to ask you to go back

1150
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:00,705
to a previous slide

1151
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:03,240
that we don't carry around us formally

1152
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,476
as some send those operations with us.

1153
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,178
But humans become attuned

1154
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,212
to social thoughts

1155
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:09,213
by being immersed in

1156
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:10,047
and participating

1157
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:12,616
in shared social cultural practice

1158
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,252
just very early in their development,

1159
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:17,755
TICKLES: that that seems pretty obvious.

1160
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,890
This immersion leads to the integration

1161
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,726
of a social physics.

1162
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:22,126
Okay,

1163
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:22,560
well then

1164
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,262
there is math involved in this,

1165
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,532
which is the set of structured

1166
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,500
and systemic

1167
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,802
social contingencies available

1168
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:34,004
in an environment of development.

1169
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,040
So even if we can't identify

1170
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,109
what those formal isms are,

1171
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:41,312
those formal isms must be present

1172
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,581
in order for this early

1173
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:45,383
this thing that we call early

1174
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,252
development and integration to exist.

1175
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:49,387
It can't just be met.

1176
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,254
It can't just

1177
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:51,422
we can't just say,

1178
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,158
Oh, it's there, but we can't explain it.

1179
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:54,692
There actually

1180
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:55,926
is something

1181
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:57,962
symbolic and representational

1182
00:39:58,529 --> 00:39:58,863
need that

1183
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,265
even if we can't conjure it ourselves.

1184
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,133
There are

1185
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,168
there are those two aspects

1186
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,637
which we need to to include.

1187
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:08,072
Right.

1188
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,540
Just because I don't

1189
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,243
I don't think of it as map doesn't mean

1190
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,346
the map isn't present.

1191
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:16,814
So I think that I think that's

1192
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:17,415
I think that's

1193
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,383
a really important one here

1194
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:21,986
in terms of making their argument,

1195
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,588
even though it's only collages,

1196
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,691
there's still a lot of formalism

1197
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:29,994
that that would seem to be abstract

1198
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:34,165
but presents as as something real.

1199
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:35,699
So,

1200
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,034
yeah,

1201
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:39,570
my little $0.02.

1202
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,872
FRIEDMAN: Yes, that's

1203
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:44,675
interesting direction

1204
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:47,945
and made me think about attractors

1205
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:52,149
dynamics gravity in social settings

1206
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:54,885
and that puts quite a

1207
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:59,623
spin on Bayesian mechanics

1208
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,427
of social physics.

1209
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:04,962
And social physics

1210
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,431
has been approached from

1211
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:09,633
the classical billiards case,

1212
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,968
from the statistical

1213
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,304
thermodynamic informational case

1214
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,371
and probably

1215
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:15,239
more speculatively

1216
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,341
by some from the quantum case.

1217
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:20,811
So it's those three mechanics, classical

1218
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,014
statistical thermo info and quantum.

1219
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,884
TICKLES: Yeah. Three, five. How many there are

1220
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:29,153
are what are

1221
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,222
being proposed in their integration

1222
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,990
by Bayesian mechanics,

1223
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,560
which we'll be discussing in

1224
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,562
the next livestream actually in 49

1225
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:42,466
with some really interesting formalism

1226
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,301
to reenter into.

1227
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,070
So I think it's like seeing

1228
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,306
what's not there but seeing depth

1229
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:51,542
in what they're pointing to, even

1230
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:52,543
just by

1231
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:53,811
discussing integration

1232
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,346
of social physics.

1233
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,815
FRIEDMAN: We don't need to provide 100 citations

1234
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:00,584
to social crises or tragedies.

1235
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:01,952
It is just

1236
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:05,756
what is gestured towards with what

1237
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:11,462
the domain of the work is.

1238
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:12,229
All right.

1239
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:16,000
In section communication

1240
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,435
as socially extended active inference.

1241
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:20,437
Here's some quotes.

1242
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:23,507
Anything you want to add?

1243
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:24,608
TICKLES: I just want to read bullet

1244
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:25,476
through communication

1245
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,545
is that's understood as we might

1246
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,914
what we might call socially extended

1247
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:31,382
active inference situations

1248
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,050
where the organism

1249
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,251
reduces free energy

1250
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:35,786
by influencing the behavior

1251
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:38,255
of another organism in such a way

1252
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,190
that its sensory input

1253
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,792
will correspond to the projections

1254
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:43,494
of its generative model, thereby

1255
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,763
regulating its own internal states

1256
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,731
by the behavior of the other organism

1257
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:51,268
other than through formalism.

1258
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:54,371
How could we prove that

1259
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,707
would be my question.

1260
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:59,076
FRIEDMAN: Yeah, great question.

1261
00:42:59,076 --> 00:42:59,977
And

1262
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:02,346
what if well,

1263
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,348
what if there are many routes

1264
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:06,684
and one can ask somebody to stop

1265
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:10,654
writing on the sidewalk with chalk

1266
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:12,456
or they could just wash it

1267
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:14,158
while they're gardening,

1268
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:16,493
or they could go in so many ways.

1269
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:18,062
It's like the adjacent

1270
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:20,297
possible of the social physics

1271
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:23,267
is open in a way that

1272
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:27,771
contrived or designed settings art,

1273
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:29,573
which isn't to say

1274
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,742
only useful or educational,

1275
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:33,978
but that's not the same. Right?

1276
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:36,380
TICKLES: The only way you could prove it, though,

1277
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,948
I think, is to represent

1278
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,584
notational symbolic

1279
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:41,452
operations.

1280
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,953
Like I don't know how,

1281
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,289
because every time you try to repeat it,

1282
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,891
someone like Dean comes along and says,

1283
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:48,792
Oh, I think I know

1284
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:49,526
what the game is here.

1285
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:51,261
I'm going to disrupt the game right?

1286
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:54,565
So that there really is only one way

1287
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:54,999
to prove it.

1288
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:57,534
And so, yeah,

1289
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:00,638
I like that they put this in here now

1290
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:02,740
and one of our colleague, Stephen

1291
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:03,407
Dikes, talks

1292
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,042
about the prefixes

1293
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:07,144
added to active inference.

1294
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:10,280
And so, again, do we need those prefixes

1295
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:11,649
in order to be able

1296
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,983
to explain our argument?

1297
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:13,250
Is it

1298
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,119
for the convenience of our argument?

1299
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,521
Where did those things really happen?

1300
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:19,423
And can we say

1301
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:21,191
can we say they really happen

1302
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:22,059
because we can prove it?

1303
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:25,095
FRIEDMAN: All right, nice.

1304
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:26,730
The following section

1305
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,866
is some cases of communication

1306
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:32,703
and three areas are highlighted,

1307
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:36,106
some cases of communication.

1308
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:38,942
And for those cases, one could ask

1309
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:40,878
what is or could be

1310
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:43,480
a transmission view on that setting?

1311
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,350
Or How have people framed a certain case

1312
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:46,950
or instance

1313
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,052
or type of communication

1314
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:50,287
as transmission view?

1315
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:53,457
And then how is an ecological active

1316
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:56,827
inference interpretation

1317
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:58,395
changing that challenging?

1318
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:00,998
Not going beyond it.

1319
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:04,068
And three areas that they are looking at

1320
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:07,137
are aggressive behavior

1321
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,139
mating or sexual reproductive

1322
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,109
signaling and alarm signaling.

1323
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,344
And they write about

1324
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:17,314
in each of these cases how one might see

1325
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:20,250
the type of behavior exhibited

1326
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,251
there as kind of

1327
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:23,454
a canonical signaling case.

1328
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,689
Like when you look up signaling,

1329
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:28,392
you'll find these keywords describing it

1330
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,226
as categories

1331
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,595
of signaling and communication.

1332
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:33,597
And one very excellent

1333
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:34,598
book to follow up

1334
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:36,934
on is how in long of those 2012 book

1335
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:38,535
studying human behavior,

1336
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:40,637
how scientists investigate aggression

1337
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:42,106
and sexuality.

1338
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,273
There are two of the go

1339
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:46,910
to areas in behavioral study.

1340
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,712
Two of the

1341
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:49,780
go to approaches

1342
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,249
and phenomena and Framings of

1343
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:53,784
Action interaction.

1344
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,487
And this is

1345
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:57,421
a very

1346
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,490
multi and transdisciplinary book

1347
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:00,991
that addresses

1348
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:02,426
in the context of some recent

1349
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,961
historical debates

1350
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:05,195
around the relevance

1351
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:06,730
of genetic inheritance.

1352
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,098
Ecological inheritance,

1353
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,133
social structuring,

1354
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:11,068
all these different topics

1355
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:13,871
approached in a really edifying way.

1356
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:16,073
I think it speaks to the gripper

1357
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:16,774
and the being gripped,

1358
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:17,674
which is kind of the role

1359
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:18,308
of what history

1360
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:20,778
and philosophy of science

1361
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:22,546
has been doing

1362
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:25,549
in a disciplinary academic way

1363
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:27,050
with a certain approach

1364
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:33,791
and time frame and feedback method.

1365
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,959
GO okay.

1366
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:39,463
Human cooperative communication,

1367
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,831
anything that.

1368
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:44,101
TICKLES: I'm always curious about

1369
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:46,336
and I will put a little note

1370
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:47,838
on on the actual page,

1371
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:50,874
my copy of the paper

1372
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,778
about cooperation

1373
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,047
and I'm no expert on cooperation,

1374
00:46:57,047 --> 00:46:59,283
so I'm sketching this out

1375
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:00,951
like the authors are sketching

1376
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:01,952
certain things out, but

1377
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:05,189
I think

1378
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:08,926
this is what I wrote.

1379
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:10,427
Let me see here.

1380
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:11,962
I got

1381
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:17,634
neither the

1382
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:19,203
transmission version

1383
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:21,138
nor the ecological feel

1384
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:23,140
of affordances model

1385
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,341
and say for certain

1386
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,210
how long the cooperative state

1387
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:28,045
will exist for

1388
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:28,779
which requires

1389
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:30,414
a different type of analysis

1390
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:31,715
of the one that confirms

1391
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:34,885
that communication lines are functioning

1392
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,956
regardless of function type.

1393
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:41,658
So stepping back and saying

1394
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:44,595
that there is a type of communication

1395
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,431
which we'll call cooperative is great,

1396
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,166
we can

1397
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,901
we can say that there's a type here,

1398
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:52,302
but just naming

1399
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:53,303
it doesn't

1400
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:55,372
mean we've actually tamed

1401
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,041
or been able to explain why

1402
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:00,911
that type exists.

1403
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:02,346
So that's one of those things.

1404
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:03,614
Again, when we have the authors

1405
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:04,514
with this

1406
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:05,916
like to chat about that

1407
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,351
a little bit more.

1408
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,386
FRIEDMAN: Yeah, what that makes me think about

1409
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,487
is even non

1410
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:12,055
communication

1411
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,291
can be considered part of the

1412
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:16,660
perhaps shaping the

1413
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,562
landscape of affordances,

1414
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,163
perhaps being communication

1415
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:21,932
of non linguistic type.

1416
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:22,966
And so how could we have

1417
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:24,868
a model of communication

1418
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:26,336
where the special cases

1419
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:28,505
of which there are infinite

1420
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:29,840
special cases

1421
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,441
are communications

1422
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:33,310
in their embodied sense.

1423
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,345
And we can also abstract

1424
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:37,281
to people who only communicate

1425
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:39,182
through social networks,

1426
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:41,285
through breathing the same air,

1427
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:43,921
all these kinds of very loose,

1428
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,589
only ecologically aligned,

1429
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,791
if only on earth aligned

1430
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:49,993
views of communication.

1431
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:52,029
Seeing that as like the fields

1432
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:53,730
from which different forms

1433
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:54,564
of communication

1434
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:57,167
of cognitive entities arises from,

1435
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,136
rather than something

1436
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:01,571
symbolic and transmits, of which

1437
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:03,240
could only be instantiated

1438
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,042
kind of from a top down

1439
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:07,177
by a symbolic subsystem

1440
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:09,479
or sub functionality

1441
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:12,115
which isn't denied by a bottom up view.

1442
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,251
But it's contextualized

1443
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:17,387
as part of a process that

1444
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:19,056
includes the ecology

1445
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:19,723
and the shaping

1446
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:20,190
of the field

1447
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:20,857
of affordances

1448
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:21,625
and landscapes,

1449
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,726
and the stigma of g

1450
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:24,995
as something fundamental.

1451
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:25,462
Now, much more

1452
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,797
TICKLES: the less with the ecology,

1453
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,198
as the context does, act

1454
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:29,466
as a constraint.

1455
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,802
So yeah. Okay.

1456
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,171
FRIEDMAN: All right. Conclusion.

1457
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:36,273
So they introduced

1458
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:38,308
a pragmatist conception of communication

1459
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:38,875
grounded in

1460
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:40,544
an ecological interpretation

1461
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,746
of the active inference framework.

1462
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:44,982
There's a lot more to develop.

1463
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,184
So where do papers end?

1464
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:50,354
Where do projects begin?

1465
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:50,587
Right.

1466
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:51,722
And then they mention

1467
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:53,623
two different directions,

1468
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:56,259
which are relatively well confirmed

1469
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:59,529
empirical results.

1470
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:01,732
First is the work on joint attention

1471
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:03,900
and seeing joint attention

1472
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,303
as a relevant aspect

1473
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:07,137
in relationship

1474
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:09,373
to coordination on landscapes

1475
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:10,974
and relevant for language development.

1476
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:12,075
And then the second point

1477
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:13,343
of empirical evidence

1478
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,845
that they want to bring in

1479
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,747
is neuroimaging data

1480
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:20,751
showing co activation or partnership

1481
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:22,953
in some way of different parts

1482
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:23,653
of the body

1483
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:24,721
and brain

1484
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:26,523
associated with certain actions

1485
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:27,958
that seem to be linked

1486
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:28,458
in a way

1487
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:29,493
that's best understood

1488
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:30,694
or of course, screened

1489
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,963
as being ecological or embedded.

1490
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:36,233
And then here is the

1491
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,468
part I mentioned earlier to conclude,

1492
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:39,836
it is trivially true

1493
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:40,404
that pretty much

1494
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:41,138
any episode of

1495
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:42,572
communication can be described

1496
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:44,941
as a transmission of information,

1497
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:46,643
as suggested in the section.

1498
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:48,879
Some cases of communication.

1499
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,748
So no bird call, no bird call.

1500
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:54,217
Hard to get around that one.

1501
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,352
In practice,

1502
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:55,752
maybe there are

1503
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:58,288
some theoretical tricks, but

1504
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:01,992
what if communications pre-planning

1505
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:04,428
really hear a bird call in 5 minutes?

1506
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:06,163
Really want that to happen

1507
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:07,631
or make that happen,

1508
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:11,001
and then what happens?

1509
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:13,103
However, there'd be no communication

1510
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:14,071
if there was no information.

1511
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,572
In some sense

1512
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,641
that is some form of association

1513
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:19,676
between a signal and an inference

1514
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:20,510
which constitute

1515
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,979
general ecological information.

1516
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:25,682
Some ideas this person triad

1517
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:30,120
objective discussion we had in 47.

1518
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,589
So this is the bio semiotic ecological

1519
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:34,558
angle that we

1520
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:36,960
came from last time

1521
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:38,328
and this paper

1522
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:39,696
is going to really highlight

1523
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:44,401
the ecological and the free energy

1524
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:47,604
minimizing aspect via

1525
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:50,073
a field of affordances, modifying

1526
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:53,610
through stigmatic modifications

1527
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:56,079
or other types of communication.

1528
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,781
Maybe just making your body visible

1529
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,316
in a certain way

1530
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:00,183
and using

1531
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:01,618
that as part of a joint,

1532
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,420
socially connected

1533
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,689
free energy minimization,

1534
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:07,390
pointing the way towards models

1535
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:08,425
that would do that.

1536
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:10,427
But not as the only end point,

1537
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:12,062
but it's in a framing

1538
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:14,464
where models could conceivably do that,

1539
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:17,367
like through software packages and model

1540
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:20,670
design processes.

1541
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,006
TICKLES: I sometimes choose words,

1542
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:24,007
not carefully,

1543
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:25,375
and I know that I don't think

1544
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:26,443
that the word trivially

1545
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:29,112
was placed in that last bullet as a as a

1546
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,349
as a way of provoking.

1547
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:34,584
But maybe it was I think basically

1548
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,320
it's basically

1549
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,822
true, but saying

1550
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,357
it's trivially true is like saying,

1551
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:41,158
okay, well,

1552
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,160
a math proof is tricky

1553
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,428
because it just is there.

1554
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:47,631
I think it's sometimes

1555
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:51,001
to to

1556
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:52,636
overstate

1557
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:54,871
how some of the basics matter.

1558
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:56,006
That doesn't mean

1559
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,941
get locked in just and start

1560
00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:59,743
because you got the basics right.

1561
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:00,810
I mean, there's a whole bunch of stuff

1562
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,179
that pops out of that

1563
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,580
and they include that too.

1564
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,248
If you're looking at something

1565
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:09,719
realistically, however, I don't know.

1566
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:10,086
I don't know

1567
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:11,721
if it's very trivial or not.

1568
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,790
Like I don't know that it's that common.

1569
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:16,626
Some of these more interesting

1570
00:53:17,427 --> 00:53:19,496
mathematical proofs

1571
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:20,497
we could say they are

1572
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:22,432
because they've already been proven,

1573
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:23,233
but that doesn't mean

1574
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:24,634
everybody has access to it

1575
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:26,603
or even understands

1576
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:27,604
the importance of it.

1577
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:30,273
So that's just a little side comment

1578
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:30,707
because I know

1579
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,210
like I catch myself regretting sometimes

1580
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:36,980
describing things in certain ways.

1581
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:37,981
All right.

1582
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:39,583
FRIEDMAN: To defend the trivial,

1583
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:41,017
I looked up the definition

1584
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:42,786
I really wanted to know.

1585
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:45,255
It turns out it is originating

1586
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:46,623
from Trivium,

1587
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:47,924
which is

1588
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:49,392
an introductory curriculum

1589
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,061
at a medieval university

1590
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,896
involving the study of

1591
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,865
grammar, rhetoric and logic.

1592
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:59,569
So maybe it's it's so trivial.

1593
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,205
It's just the kind of trivial details

1594
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:03,573
that you end up spending

1595
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,408
quite a long time working on.

1596
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,410
TICKLES: Okay, that's good defense.

1597
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:08,345
FRIEDMAN: That would be

1598
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:10,380
that would be a funny interpretation.

1599
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,383
You know, bring back the Trivium.

1600
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:13,750
TICKLES: Where.

1601
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:15,252
FRIEDMAN: Our hope

1602
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,320
is that the model describes inspires

1603
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:18,855
experimental designs

1604
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:22,158
that can lead to such theoretical

1605
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:24,160
or applied treatments. Okay.

1606
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:28,565
What are your thoughts?

1607
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:29,699
TICKLES: Well, as I wrote here,

1608
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,301
I think that means keeping active

1609
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:32,869
inference on the bench and constraint

1610
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:34,871
to a control setting.

1611
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:37,207
I mean, again, if you want to be able

1612
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:41,611
to compare to a control,

1613
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:44,914
this is this is your next step.

1614
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:46,283
However,

1615
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:47,984
since when does setting a condition

1616
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:49,419
deliberate communication to do

1617
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:50,587
a communication does

1618
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:52,656
which is released

1619
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:54,190
understanding and not just aggregate it

1620
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:55,859
for the sake of control.

1621
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:57,294
And I wrote a time to break up

1622
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:57,894
meme watchers.

1623
00:54:57,894 --> 00:54:58,728
Then we've got more

1624
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:00,630
direct experience with,

1625
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,198
with writing about active inference

1626
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:03,900
and needs than I. Yes.

1627
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,136
FRIEDMAN: So that's the slide.

1628
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,204
TICKLES: You can go.

1629
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:08,471
FRIEDMAN: Yeah.

1630
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,173
Well just wanted to kind of explore

1631
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:11,041
this and

1632
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,076
leave some open space to go into it

1633
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:14,711
more. Yeah.

1634
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:17,447
TICKLES: Building on the work of our Mridula,

1635
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:20,550
who is a professor in Monterey,

1636
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:21,985
California.

1637
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:22,419
Yeah,

1638
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:24,154
she had written about memes

1639
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,622
as quasi arguments

1640
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:27,223
and about the kind of space

1641
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:29,793
that opens in

1642
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:32,228
between in

1643
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:34,297
enduring the meme

1644
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:35,732
and specifically image

1645
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:37,033
meme, interpretation

1646
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:38,935
or interpolation process.

1647
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:40,070
So in addition to

1648
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,171
or an alternative

1649
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,040
to the purely dynamical, descriptive

1650
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:47,744
and evolutionary fitness oriented

1651
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:51,548
meme definition commonly used by Dawkins

1652
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:54,951
and all since this is a very media

1653
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:57,987
and cognitive interpretation

1654
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:01,358
of artifacts and through a paper

1655
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,127
in 2021 and in 2022,

1656
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:07,731
we used some previous work

1657
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:08,865
that had been done

1658
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,501
by Equity Hall at all 2020

1659
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:13,670
on a three tier model of

1660
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:17,207
how to frame complex ecosystems.

1661
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:18,441
FRIEDMAN: The kinds that people

1662
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:19,876
are usually talking about

1663
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,378
when they mention ecosystems

1664
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,746
like the non metaphor.

1665
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:24,314
If there were a non metaphor

1666
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:26,015
and it wasn't just app ecosystems

1667
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:27,417
and social ecosystems,

1668
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:29,719
the one with, you know, the trees, but

1669
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:30,387
don't they all

1670
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:33,556
three layers

1671
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:34,924
being an instrumental layer

1672
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:37,494
of pure observations,

1673
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:40,096
basically mapping on to observe states,

1674
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,966
then a contextual layer

1675
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,101
which can bring in some knowledge

1676
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:47,370
about how different measurements

1677
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:48,371
or inferences about

1678
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:49,672
measurements are linked,

1679
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:51,741
like two common entities

1680
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,610
and then using this type

1681
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:54,811
of statistically inferred

1682
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:55,478
information

1683
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:56,913
and augmented information

1684
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,615
from the contextual layer

1685
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:01,951
to do inference on pure, on observables,

1686
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,852
those might be things

1687
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:03,720
that are observable,

1688
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,155
but you didn't observe

1689
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:06,523
like the temperature at some point

1690
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:08,324
where there wasn't a thermometer

1691
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:10,560
or the true on observables

1692
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:14,097
could be like propensity of this mile

1693
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,932
square of land

1694
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,400
to be used for this purpose

1695
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,436
in the next five years.

1696
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,703
But that's not something

1697
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:21,604
that could be measured.

1698
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:22,806
There's no measuring device

1699
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:24,841
other than the modeling process,

1700
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:26,743
but it's an important modeling process.

1701
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:28,144
And they did

1702
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:29,179
amazing work

1703
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:31,448
connecting complex systems and ecologies

1704
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:35,485
and on the rise in term

1705
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:36,553
and in spirit

1706
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:38,922
is discussions of digital ecosystems

1707
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,623
and ecological approaches

1708
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:41,724
to communication,

1709
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:43,726
as noted by the authors here,

1710
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:46,062
and hence by extension

1711
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:47,096
ecological approaches

1712
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:49,199
to digital communication.

1713
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:52,769
And so we were able to modify

1714
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:54,938
or to translate and respect

1715
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:55,872
the ecosystem

1716
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:57,841
integrity three tier model

1717
00:57:57,841 --> 00:58:01,311
provided by those authors onto,

1718
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,812
the kinds of digital

1719
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,582
discourse analysis platforms

1720
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,817
that would be aligned

1721
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:08,318
in that

1722
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:11,488
ecological interpretation and way.

1723
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,323
So I think there'll be a lot to explore

1724
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,757
maybe now, maybe next time.

1725
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:15,925
So go ahead. Yes.

1726
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:16,192
TICKLES: Quick.

1727
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:16,860
Just quickly,

1728
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,062
so would you describe what you did

1729
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:20,196
from a

1730
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:25,134
in transition to be as an in action?

1731
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:27,637
FRIEDMAN: It was in an action in the slides

1732
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:29,672
software of one type.

1733
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:30,773
And then it becomes

1734
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:31,708
a different in action

1735
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:32,942
when it is shared

1736
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:34,410
as an asynchronous file

1737
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,145
or through live communication

1738
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:37,180
with a colleague.

1739
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,214
It's a different in action

1740
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:40,049
when the preprint is open

1741
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:41,851
source and available immediately

1742
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,286
upon completion.

1743
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:45,054
There are many levels of and

1744
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:45,922
types of in action.

1745
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:47,724
All right,

1746
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:50,527
then it closes

1747
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:54,864
with a discourse from Squirms Screams.

1748
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,432
2010 suggests

1749
00:58:56,432 --> 00:59:00,403
that in any complex organization,

1750
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:01,804
different highlighting

1751
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:05,308
information transmission and processing

1752
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:07,744
and coordination of action

1753
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:10,647
may not be entirely separate

1754
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:11,848
gasp

1755
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:17,253
screams 1996 and storms 2010.

1756
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:18,655
These are actually really

1757
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,222
excellent books.

1758
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,857
I hope that is not taken as dismissive,

1759
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:23,660
but it goes to show what views

1760
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:26,963
are seen as and justified

1761
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:29,198
to be often needing support

1762
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:33,636
and what that means or why that behavior

1763
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:34,837
is that way.

1764
00:59:34,837 --> 00:59:37,674
What is that linguistic

1765
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:39,842
strength for in this

1766
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:43,680
quote from 2022 written

1767
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:47,584
originally in 2010?

1768
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:48,651
And then the authors

1769
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:50,119
write What fundamentally matters

1770
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:51,521
is the control of behavior

1771
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:53,523
and not the transmission of information.

1772
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:55,058
Even if the control of behavior

1773
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:56,426
may be described as a form

1774
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,494
of information transmission.

1775
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:01,397
So very much a syntax semantics question

1776
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:04,400
How many bits is the file?

1777
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,735
What does the file mean?

1778
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:09,606
Syntax and semantics in the specific

1779
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,774
unfolding of the interpretation,

1780
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,043
you can take a top down overview

1781
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:15,945
like 55% of people who did

1782
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:17,513
this also do that.

1783
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:18,715
And then there's a bottom up

1784
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:20,016
cognitive view,

1785
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:21,150
which is the ecological

1786
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:24,153
embodied engagement with the image mean

1787
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:25,622
or with something like that,

1788
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:28,758
with an animal signal or mark or smell,

1789
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:30,960
and then

1790
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:31,961
to paraphrase

1791
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,529
Kearns, the information

1792
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:35,298
transmission gloss,

1793
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,567
footnote 35 with some Egan citations,

1794
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:39,002
the information

1795
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:39,936
transmission gloss

1796
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:40,770
on communication

1797
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:42,271
and communicative behavior,

1798
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:43,773
if it is to prove useful at all,

1799
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,241
might be thought of as an aspect

1800
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:46,542
of the control of behavior

1801
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:50,513
rather than the other way around.

1802
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:53,049
Reversing primacy but not denying

1803
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:55,351
we propose

1804
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:56,552
they can see if in communication

1805
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:57,086
in such a way

1806
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:58,121
provides better insights

1807
01:00:58,121 --> 01:00:59,222
into the pragmatic nature

1808
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:00,256
of communicative behavior

1809
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:01,124
and its evolution

1810
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:03,593
as a free energy, minimizing activity

1811
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:07,664
and a favor.

1812
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:08,998
What do you want to add?

1813
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:10,533
That's basically it.

1814
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:11,267
We have a few things

1815
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:13,136
written down to 48.1, but

1816
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:15,271
what would you like to add on that?

1817
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:18,107
TICKLES: I mean, what I like about the conclusion

1818
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:21,210
is that they say I'm

1819
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:23,780
I'm taking and paraphrasing in my own

1820
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:26,582
thinking, in my own

1821
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:31,821
words, just because you transmit doesn't

1822
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:33,456
mean that you're actually

1823
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:35,825
sussing out or determining or

1824
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:39,128
or confirming the difference

1825
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:41,964
between play as one kind of action

1826
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:45,001
playing and then played.

1827
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:47,804
So they really want to incorporate

1828
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:48,938
that temporal piece,

1829
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:50,506
which I think is really smart,

1830
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:51,708
which again,

1831
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:52,475
I'm a

1832
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:53,710
I'm a big believer

1833
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,245
that there is a logic that

1834
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:58,314
supports that, which limits

1835
01:01:59,315 --> 01:02:02,552
which direction you're necessarily

1836
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:05,421
asking to look at time.

1837
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:07,690
Are you going with time

1838
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:09,092
and only one direction?

1839
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:10,660
Are you enacting it

1840
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:13,429
or are you delimiting and being able to

1841
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:17,400
place some sort of

1842
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,269
gap between the memorial

1843
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:21,370
and the projection?

1844
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:25,208
And the other thing is,

1845
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:26,409
I think

1846
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:27,410
when we walk

1847
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,011
when we walk into these situations

1848
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:30,646
and see them as ecologies,

1849
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:33,182
we are going to miss things.

1850
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:35,284
So I think we just have to accept that

1851
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:37,720
there will be laterals and collaterals

1852
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:41,624
on the margins that will will sort of

1853
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:43,826
bleed into what

1854
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:45,795
our regime of attention is.

1855
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:46,729
And so I think

1856
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:49,232
if you only focus on the transmission

1857
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:51,701
my turn, your turn, my turn, your turn.

1858
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:53,870
You don't have a hope of trying

1859
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:56,906
to bring those very important things

1860
01:02:56,906 --> 01:03:00,243
that that are essentially building up

1861
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:02,044
whatever you are

1862
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:03,212
taking away from this

1863
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:05,148
communication exercise.

1864
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:05,648
So, again,

1865
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:07,216
I think that's something important

1866
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:09,886
that they raised in sketching this out.

1867
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:12,221
There's actually a benefit or a feature

1868
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:15,258
in not filling it in to it

1869
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:17,026
with too much detail,

1870
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:18,961
because how could they

1871
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:19,529
every time

1872
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:20,863
there's a communication act

1873
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:22,298
going on or a dyad

1874
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:24,667
happening, the openness of that

1875
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:26,402
means there's

1876
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:28,871
going to be some scale friendly follow.

1877
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:31,607
It can't be predicted with certainty.

1878
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:33,709
So that

1879
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:35,545
I really like their conclusion actually.

1880
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:36,379
So

1881
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:38,414
yeah, there's my,

1882
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:39,115
there's my thoughts

1883
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:44,887
in those last couple slides.

1884
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:46,522
FRIEDMAN: A lot to think about,

1885
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:47,657
I guess, and discuss

1886
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,592
in the coming weeks.

1887
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:51,661
I think a few

1888
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:54,630
last pieces here.

1889
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:57,333
Seeing transmission as enablement

1890
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,603
for semantics

1891
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:04,941
and connecting that to the person triad

1892
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:07,009
and objective logic

1893
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:11,214
and as a escaping the nosedive

1894
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:13,683
of description, ism and reductionism

1895
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:16,719
by holding space for the pragmatics

1896
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:18,254
if nothing else

1897
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:19,288
of higher order

1898
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:21,390
levels of analysis and course screening.

1899
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:22,491
So whether you need to appeal

1900
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:24,627
to computational resources,

1901
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:26,696
we won't be able to finish the analysis

1902
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:29,198
or other kinds of pragmatics,

1903
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:31,801
including meaning as pragmatics

1904
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:33,035
in the socially extended

1905
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,470
cognitive space.

1906
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:36,639
Then there's a very rich view in which

1907
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,407
we don't need to like reject

1908
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:40,476
digital signal processing

1909
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:40,810
in order

1910
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:44,881
to have an ecological interpretation.

1911
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,416
I think there's a a few other

1912
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:48,451
areas we can go

1913
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:50,486
into.

1914
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:53,055
So with that

1915
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:53,723
we have

1916
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:55,725
there's other relevant works to share.

1917
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:56,459
Okay.

1918
01:04:56,525 --> 01:05:00,363
Any final, final thoughts?

1919
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:00,730
TICKLES: No.

1920
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:03,699
I mean, what I appreciate is how

1921
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:07,103
how smoothly and quickly we're able

1922
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:08,304
to kind of go through this paper.

1923
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:10,539
I think that's a testament to

1924
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:12,041
the authors

1925
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:13,276
being clear about what

1926
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:15,478
they wanted to ascribe

1927
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:16,646
and what they

1928
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:17,546
wanted people

1929
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:19,682
to be able to extend off of.

1930
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:21,784
So it kind of reinforces

1931
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:22,318
their idea

1932
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:23,786
of the extended active inference.

1933
01:05:23,786 --> 01:05:24,654
Instead of them

1934
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:25,788
having all the answers,

1935
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:26,756
they just

1936
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:27,657
planted some seeds

1937
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:30,393
and let people kind of take it

1938
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:31,460
off in different directions,

1939
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:32,128
which I think

1940
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:33,262
maybe was one of their goals.

1941
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:35,631
FRIEDMAN: That's very nice.

1942
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:36,832
Totally agree.

1943
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:39,502
Agreed that it's very readable.

1944
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:41,537
Clear paper

1945
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:44,240
that laid out a nice path with berries

1946
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,007
to pick

1947
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:46,676
from a lot of footnotes

1948
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:49,245
and paths to explore and.

1949
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:51,414
It is going to be great to discuss it

1950
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:52,648
in the coming weeks.

1951
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:53,215
So Dean,

1952
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:55,217
thanks so much for the preparation

1953
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:56,686
and for joining live

1954
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:57,653
and we'll see you very.

1955
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:00,423
TICKLES: Same back right back at you, buddy.

1956
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:01,157
Take care.

1957
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:21,444
FRIEDMAN: Peace.
