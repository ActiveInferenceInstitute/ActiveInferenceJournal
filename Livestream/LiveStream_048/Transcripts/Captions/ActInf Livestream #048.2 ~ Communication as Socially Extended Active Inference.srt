00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:25,258
FRIEDMAN: Hello.

20
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:26,259
Welcome.

30
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:29,162
It is September 14th, 2022

40
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,564
and we're in ActInf Livestream

50
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,633
number 48.2.

60
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:35,101
Welcome to the Active

70
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:36,569
Inference Institute.

80
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,838
We're participatory online institute

90
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:40,306
that is communicating,

100
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:41,641
learning and practicing

110
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,376
applied active inference.

120
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,077
You can find us

130
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,446
at some of the links on the slide.

140
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,447
This is a recorded

150
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,382
and an archived livestream,

160
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,650
so please provide feedback

170
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,852
so we can improve our work.

180
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:53,720
FRIEDMAN: All backgrounds

190
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,855
and perspectives are welcome here

200
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:56,689
and we'll follow

210
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,826
video etiquette for livestreams.

220
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,428
Head over to active inference

230
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,696
dot org to learn more about

240
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:05,398
how to participate in learning

250
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,533
groups and projects

260
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,635
such as livestreams and others.

270
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,939
Well, we are in our third discussion

280
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,275
around this paper

290
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,610
"Communication as Socially Extended

300
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,013
Active Inference: A Ecological Approach

310
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,581
to Communicative Behavior"

320
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,283
from 2021

330
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,285
by Remi Tison and Pierre Poirier.

340
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:29,722
and last week in 48.1

350
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:30,757
FRIEDMAN: with

360
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,093
FRIEDMAN: the very same

370
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,762
fellows in the conversation,

380
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,398
we had some explorations into

390
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:41,501
different aspects of the paper.

400
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:44,671
Perhaps we can each say hello again

410
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,040
and something if we want to,

420
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,008
that we remember from last week,

430
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:51,678
or that we'd like to explore today.

440
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,314
And then we can just be right in it.

450
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,183
So I'm Daniel.

460
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,751
I'm in California

470
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:02,255
and I'm interested to look towards

480
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:02,722
the latter

490
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:06,025
half the back nine of the paper

500
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,795
and see where we go,

510
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,096
which is kind of what we do

520
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:12,699
in Dot Two's usually.

530
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,435
FRIEDMAN: And I just have a feeling that

540
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,672
the exit from the slide on this one

550
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,775
may put our communication

560
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:25,745
and situated ness in a different place

570
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,349
than where we were before.

580
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,252
And I'll pass it to

590
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:37,257
KNIGHT: Bleu.

600
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:40,326
DEAN: Hi! I'm Bleu.

610
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,497
FRIEDMAN: I heard the initial part and

620
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:48,334
KNIGHT: then lost it, Bleu.

630
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,435
KNIGHT: You happen to hear me now?

640
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:53,806
Yeah, I am a Bleu

650
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,875
and I'm a researcher in New Mexico

660
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,144
and I am excited to dig

670
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,547
back in to this paper.

680
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,247
I think we left

690
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,815
a lot of things

700
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:06,586
to wonder about last week and and yeah,

710
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,788
excited to get to maybe more

720
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,757
into the meat of the paper itself

730
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,258
as opposed to just

740
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,561
discussing tangential ideas.

750
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,996
KNIGHT: And I'll pass to Dean.

760
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:18,531
DEAN: DEAN TICKLES: Thanks Blue.

770
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,267
DEAN: I'm I'm here in Calgary.

780
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,068
I'm interested in

790
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,036
seeing whether or not

800
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:23,970
the big road map

810
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,771
that I think that

820
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,539
this paper provides

830
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,943
also can be explained as a big score, as

840
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:30,577
as in a

850
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,879
kind of a musical analogy,

860
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,281
because I'm really interested in the,

870
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,115
in the interplay

880
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:36,883
or the interaction

890
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,252
between orchestration and arrangements.

900
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:40,486
We yesterday

910
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,455
there was a math string

920
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,624
that where our guest was

930
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,527
really good at sort of

940
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,196
describing the arrangement part of

950
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,531
of what's going on

960
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,566
and active inference potentially.

970
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,068
DEAN: And so I'm really kind of interested

980
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:55,835
in looking at that

990
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:56,703
because

1000
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:59,639
I think from a transmission versus

1010
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:00,840
ecological standpoint,

1020
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,508
we're kind of looking at the difference

1030
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,544
between mono and stereo.

1040
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,613
So I'm wondering if we should maybe

1050
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,482
look at that through that lens as well.

1060
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:10,250
TISON: Hi, I'm Remi Tison.

1070
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,621
I I'm though I'm

1080
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:18,224
a researcher at Cannes in Montreal

1090
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:21,527
and I'm the author of the paper,

1100
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:22,762
and I'm looking forward

1110
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,199
to discussing the paper more in detail

1120
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,234
and maybe go to

1130
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:31,004
towards the later parts of the paper

1140
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,905
and maybe talk about a bit

1150
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,374
about the language

1160
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,542
and linguistic communication,

1170
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,378
which is a big piece

1180
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,947
that is looming behind the paper,

1190
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,081
but it's not really

1200
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,583
that much discussed in it,

1210
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,085
but I think that's the way to that.

1220
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:46,619
TISON: That's what

1230
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,222
TISON: an account of communication aims to

1240
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:50,523
go towards.

1250
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,158
So I hope we'll have

1260
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:55,928
the chance to discuss it a little bit.

1270
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,898
FRIEDMAN: Let's go to language.

1280
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,967
It's what we're using,

1290
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,002
FRIEDMAN: among other modalities.

1300
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,972
But we are using language and

1310
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:07,740
so that sounds like a

1320
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,376
great place to start.

1330
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,811
So what was in the paper

1340
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,479
regarding language

1350
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,082
and what was not in the paper regarding

1360
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:24,424
language?

1370
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:25,091
TISON: Yeah. So

1380
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,760
the the idea

1390
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,862
was to open a window

1400
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,065
at the end of the paper

1410
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,066
towards that language.

1420
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,735
So we talked a bit about conventional

1430
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,339
forms of communication and we know that

1440
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,107
most people believe

1450
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,009
that language is conventional.

1460
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,445
So we tried to tie

1470
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,714
the are are

1480
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,350
the ideas that we put forward

1490
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,052
in the paper with work by Hampstead

1500
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,755
in a paper of 2016

1510
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,657
about conventional affordances.

1520
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,126
TISON: So we tried to say that

1530
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,628
that the linguistic community,

1540
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,764
the conventional nature of the language

1550
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:05,131
comes

1560
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,032
from the

1570
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,467
conventional affordances

1580
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,737
that are generated in the, in the,

1590
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,805
the communicative interaction.

1600
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:13,473
So that's what,

1610
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,006
that's the

1620
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,074
way to point

1630
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,510
toward language in our account.

1640
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:18,911
And

1650
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,115
we talked a bit about the act.

1660
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,282
So different types

1670
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:26,018
of active language, so

1680
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,221
informative or

1690
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,489
or declarative

1700
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,591
and interrogative imperative.

1710
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:32,825
TISON: So these kinds of distinctions,

1720
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,094
we try to account for them

1730
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,095
in our framework.

1740
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:39,465
So are these are various parts

1750
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:40,533
of what we considered

1760
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,534
to be language

1770
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,302
that we tried to treat in the paper.

1780
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:44,470
But there's a lot of things

1790
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,304
that we

1800
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,074
couldn't discuss, obviously,

1810
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,575
because it was like in the

1820
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,411
in the small section

1830
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:51,677
and the

1840
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,079
at the end we cannot like explain

1850
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,714
all of language.

1860
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:54,947
TISON: Yeah.

1870
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,916
TISON: Even in their paper or in their book

1880
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,350
and so,

1890
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,684
so in the small section,

1900
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,019
that would be obviously way

1910
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:05,258
too ambitious.

1920
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,360
FRIEDMAN: What are we looking to explain

1930
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,363
or what is needed for language to be

1940
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,167
encompassed or at home

1950
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,837
or native to the ecological view,

1960
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,808
rather than the transmission view,

1970
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:27,613
or in addition to the transmission view?

1980
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,516
Read me first then others.

1990
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:30,750
TISON: Yeah.

2000
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,086
TISON: A point that is interesting is that

2010
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,289
the transmission view comes with the

2020
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,226
opposition about what

2030
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,962
has to be explained by a theory of

2040
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:45,231
of language.

2050
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,532
It comes with the idea

2060
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,835
that we have to account for the meaning

2070
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,171
of the

2080
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,040
the expressions that are used first.

2090
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,907
So we have to understand

2100
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,175
whether the meaning

2110
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:59,212
of the words that we use and how

2120
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:00,213
these meanings

2130
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,013
are encoded

2140
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,181
in the, in the brains

2150
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,417
and the heads of the

2160
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,586
of the speakers of other language.

2170
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,422
TISON: But that's

2180
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,257
misleading from the point of view

2190
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,925
that we adopt in the papers.

2200
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:16,562
So this it's kind of hard to say

2210
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,731
what we have to explain

2220
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:19,532
in order to explain

2230
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,300
language, because for so long

2240
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,370
we have based in

2250
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,271
we have

2260
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:29,575
been in the the the transmission view.

2270
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,178
And so we are used to believe

2280
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,679
that in order to explain language,

2290
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,981
we have to explain these kinds

2300
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,415
of contents.

2310
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,285
TISON: That language transmits so

2320
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,154
but if we do away with these contents,

2330
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,391
it's kind of the open the question of

2340
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,159
how do you account for language.

2350
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,428
It becomes kind of open in a new way.

2360
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,064
And I don't really know

2370
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:54,600
exactly what we have to account

2380
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,036
for in order to account for language,

2390
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,639
because it kind of changes

2400
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,941
our view of what language is.

2410
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:05,278
So I think there's a lot of open space

2420
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,482
in there in this question of

2430
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,716
how do we account for language

2440
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:11,918
if we do away

2450
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,120
with the transmission, you.

2460
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:23,029
FRIEDMAN: D or blue.

2470
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:28,634
DEAN: You got blue.

2480
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:29,569
KNIGHT: So I just looked,

2490
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,670
looking back over the paper,

2500
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,139
I think it might be useful to

2510
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:37,944
maybe delineate the the specific types

2520
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,845
of language interactive

2530
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,847
versus imperatives

2540
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,549
and like the specific,

2550
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,217
the specificities underlying

2560
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,919
each one of those right now

2570
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,355
that that would be maybe a good place to

2580
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,123
to just dove into the meat of the paper.

2590
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:52,491
FRIEDMAN: So

2600
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:57,930
how can we see

2610
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,366
these different types of speech?

2620
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,168
Speech acts

2630
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,403
as shaping the field of affordances.

2640
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:08,240
What is being done ecologically

2650
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,978
with these different speech behaviors

2660
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,115
as opposed to the

2670
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,917
enabling aspect

2680
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,151
of the transmission view?

2690
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,920
I think they're fairly clear

2700
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,622
within the transmission view

2710
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,425
what these statements are about.

2720
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:27,693
And as you pointed out, it's

2730
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,161
almost like hard to escape

2740
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,296
viewing

2750
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,431
what these speech behaviors are

2760
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:33,432
by the content,

2770
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:34,800
like if not their content

2780
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,401
quite literally,

2790
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,103
then what would they be about?

2800
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,671
FRIEDMAN: Even talking about what they're about,

2810
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,140
but informative would be sharing

2820
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,310
a proposition, an or a some reducing

2830
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,845
some of the uncertainty about the state

2840
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,446
of something in the world.

2850
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:50,149
I'm feeling this way or that way.

2860
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,684
Is this much

2870
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,688
and so on for other statements,

2880
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:56,689
because indeed

2890
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,924
they're defined by the content

2900
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,926
and their structure.

2910
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,862
So ecologically,

2920
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,164
I mean, what might these types

2930
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:09,468
of speech behaviors be doing?

2940
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,069
TISON: So these

2950
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,738
these types of active language

2960
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,940
are well accounted for in their

2970
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,176
in the transmission view.

2980
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,744
But there are some questions

2990
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:19,378
that remain

3000
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:19,645
about

3010
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:22,114
the imperative form of communication,

3020
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:26,585
because it's it's not clear

3030
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,055
that interactive communication

3040
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,122
can be understood

3050
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,525
as a form of transmission of content,

3060
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:36,095
because we have the feeling that when we

3070
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:37,930
come in something

3080
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,166
or request something, we are not

3090
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,169
transmitting information

3100
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,904
or we are not

3110
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,274
aiming at changing

3120
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,476
the mental states of the person

3130
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:51,477
that we are talking to.

3140
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,646
TISON: We are aiming at making them

3150
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,048
do something in the world directly.

3160
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:56,849
So so there is

3170
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,118
there's kind of a mismatch there,

3180
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,453
it seems.

3190
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,755
So obviously

3200
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:04,857
people in the transmission

3210
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,525
you will evidence or they will say that

3220
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,461
like when I have,

3230
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,563
for instance, that desire

3240
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,297
or the intention

3250
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,865
that something is the case,

3260
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,900
I then an imperative

3270
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,901
act of communication

3280
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,737
is my transmitting this intention

3290
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,637
or this desire

3300
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,005
to that person that we then

3310
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,941
as this desire or this intention,

3320
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,343
and then can bring

3330
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,178
about the state of affairs

3340
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,180
that I intend to achieve.

3350
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,816
TISON: But it's not I'm not sure.

3360
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,551
Obviously, you can delve into details,

3370
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:33,452
but I'm not sure that's

3380
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,820
exactly what we want to do.

3390
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,588
When we

3400
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:36,522
state we

3410
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,324
when we produce an imperative active

3420
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,860
language, obviously we won't.

3430
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:42,628
We just

3440
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,196
don't just want that the person

3450
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,031
as the intention of doing something.

3460
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:49,068
We want the thing done in the world.

3470
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:52,371
So I believe that the imperative

3480
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,839
kind of communication

3490
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,040
is not really

3500
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,741
well accounted

3510
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,043
for in the transmission view.

3520
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,513
TISON: And what's interesting is that in a way,

3530
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,548
the imperative form of communication

3540
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:02,882
is like

3550
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:03,783
the basic form

3560
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,951
of communication in our framework,

3570
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:10,022
because that what's what a communication

3580
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,625
is, is acting through the behavior

3590
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,526
of somebody else,

3600
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,394
by affecting its field of avoidance

3610
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:19,165
so that we can we can go back to, like,

3620
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,233
the forms of animal communication

3630
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,135
that we describe earlier in the paper.

3640
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:23,969
TISON: And these are all

3650
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,171
TISON: can all be considered

3660
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:25,771
to be

3670
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,840
imperative forms of comedy or proto

3680
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,942
imperative forms of communication.

3690
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:34,313
So that's like the starting point.

3700
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,047
And we,

3710
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,349
we achieve these acts under the purview

3720
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:37,983
of somebody else

3730
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,119
by altering their field of affordances

3740
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,488
to make them something, to do something.

3750
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,656
But how do we account

3760
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,891
for informed, informative

3770
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,393
acts of communication?

3780
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:48,427
TISON: And an idea

3790
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,329
that we put forward in the paper

3800
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,065
is that an informal

3810
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:54,934
the kind of

3820
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,068
acts of communication

3830
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,170
that that we consider to be informative

3840
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,140
will be acts that aim to construct

3850
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,443
or alter a shared field of affordances

3860
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,978
in a way

3870
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,146
that is more durable

3880
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,347
than just an immediate

3890
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,216
interactive act of language.

3900
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,383
So what we are doing,

3910
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,852
we are changing

3920
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,421
the layout of the context

3930
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,589
that we take for

3940
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,624
to be relevance to our joint action.

3950
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,560
TISON: And this is changing of affordances

3960
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,629
do not have to be immediately

3970
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:24,463
acted upon.

3980
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:25,164
I can say, oh,

3990
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,966
there's something in the in the context

4000
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:27,933
that's relevant.

4010
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,869
TISON: It does not necessarily call

4020
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,237
for action immediately,

4030
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,438
but it's something that is like

4040
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,539
in the background

4050
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,241
of our context of action.

4060
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,175
And so it's change.

4070
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:36,809
It changes

4080
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,344
the shared field of affordances, but

4090
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,079
it's not directly

4100
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,114
soliciting an

4110
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:42,781
action from the

4120
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,350
interlocutor, as would be the case

4130
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,051
for the imperative act of language.

4140
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,320
TISON: So in a way,

4150
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,423
it's like as this in the beginning,

4160
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,826
an informative, active language is like

4170
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,095
a long term imperative

4180
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,230
or a dispositional imperative.

4190
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,899
We put something in the context,

4200
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,966
we say, Oh, that's relevant.

4210
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,902
We can act on it at some point,

4220
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,037
but it's not necessarily immediately

4230
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,538
to be acted upon.

4240
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:10,075
So that's how we can like put the,

4250
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:10,809
the idea that, okay,

4260
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,045
we can change our context of action,

4270
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,280
what we can take

4280
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,448
to be relevant in the context of action.

4290
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,584
TISON: And we can come back to it

4300
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,785
later when,

4310
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,420
when it's relevant and act on it.

4320
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,554
But it's not something

4330
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,456
that is to be acted upon immediately.

4340
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,492
And so that's like the, the,

4350
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,594
the difference

4360
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,663
between imperative and formative

4370
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,065
begins to do to be

4380
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,367
discerned there where an imperative is

4390
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,335
like I'm

4400
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:37,736
seeing that this, so

4410
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:38,404
this affordances

4420
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,239
should be acted upon immediately

4430
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,640
and informative is like I'm

4440
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,108
putting this in the context,

4450
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,210
it changes the layout of affordances.

4460
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,012
TISON: So for instance,

4470
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:48,747
there would be

4480
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,783
a, I don't know

4490
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,584
if to come up with an example,

4500
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,253
but if I inform you of something,

4510
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,587
I'm putting

4520
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,423
I'm changing the layout of the audience

4530
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,891
that we take for granted

4540
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,160
in the context of our interaction.

4550
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,028
And it changes

4560
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,830
in the long term, the interaction,

4570
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,532
and it can like drive

4580
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,000
the interaction in various ways,

4590
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,235
but it's not something to be acted

4600
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,570
directly immediately.

4610
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,906
TISON: So that's the basic distinction.

4620
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,076
And that's like the beginning

4630
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:17,910
TISON: of a distinction

4640
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,045
between informative and imperative.

4650
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,047
And I can say a few words

4660
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,882
about the interrogative too.

4670
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:27,453
So as we said and,

4680
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,521
and communication is acting

4690
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:30,956
typically acting

4700
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,158
through the behavior of somebody else

4710
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,593
bye bye

4720
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,663
by altering its field about audience

4730
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,398
and the interrogative.

4740
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,099
It's interesting

4750
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,534
because it's exactly the distinction

4760
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,137
between imperative and interrogative is

4770
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:46,772
really similar to the

4780
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:47,506
this distinction

4790
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,974
between pragmatic value

4800
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,142
and epistemic value

4810
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,343
and active inference.

4820
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,177
TISON: So, for instance,

4830
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,146
when we produce an action

4840
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:57,349
TISON: that aims to maximize pragmatic value,

4850
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,184
we are trying to, for instance, do

4860
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,086
to

4870
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,023
make the state of the world correspond

4880
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,058
to a prediction of our derivative model.

4890
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,893
And when we make something

4900
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,661
which is guided by epistemic value,

4910
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:10,562
what we try to do

4920
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,231
is trying to reduce in certain

4930
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,732
uncertainty about our

4940
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,134
our niche, for instance,

4950
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:18,170
but so in a way, so for instance,

4960
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,305
when I'm eating something, I'm,

4970
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,941
I'm maximizing my,

4980
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:24,643
my interest in my pragmatic value

4990
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,145
because I'm, for instance,

5000
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,414
reducing a prediction error

5010
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,382
that I'm hungry and I want to.

5020
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,317
TISON: So that's a basic example.

5030
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,420
But when I'm exploring my environment,

5040
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,921
TISON: when I'm making a visual

5050
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,123
aid to explore my needs.

5060
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,692
So that would be an epistemic

5070
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,161
action, so to speak.

5080
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,662
So interrogative

5090
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:44,563
acts of language

5100
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,699
are exactly analog to epistemic actions,

5110
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,501
but they are epistemic actions

5120
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,403
through the behavior of somebody else.

5130
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,839
So instead of, for instance, by myself

5140
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,008
exploring the niche, exploring the field

5150
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,410
about audience, I can produce this act

5160
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,212
that will make the other person

5170
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,380
disclose to me

5180
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,949
an element of the field of audience that

5190
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,085
can then reduce my

5200
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,019
uncertainty about

5210
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,921
what is the context of our action.

5220
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,656
TISON: So that's really the distinction

5230
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:11,557
between interactive

5240
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,292
and interrogative is really

5250
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:13,959
to be understood

5260
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,294
along the line of the distinction

5270
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,595
between pragmatic value

5280
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,097
and epistemic value.

5290
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,131
So that's

5300
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,233
a beginning to an introduction to these

5310
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:24,403
these distinctions in the in the types

5320
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:29,241
of acts of language.

5330
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:29,741
KNIGHT: Don't start me.

5340
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,410
KNIGHT: You totally you totally read my mind.

5350
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,445
They're about what I wanted

5360
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,380
to, to elaborate on,

5370
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,115
even though my question

5380
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,250
was like very partly framed.

5390
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:38,550
Yeah,

5400
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,886
I think that that's very useful for

5410
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:41,954
especially in

5420
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,155
like the goal directed

5430
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,958
aspect of imperatives

5440
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,760
versus interrogative or informative

5450
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:49,995
like what,

5460
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,264
how they interact with our maybe

5470
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,066
we don't have a joint goal versus

5480
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,167
we do have a joint goal

5490
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,768
or the goal is to develop

5500
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:57,870
some shared state

5510
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,038
of a shared mental state.

5520
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,006
KNIGHT: So that was really helpful.

5530
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,142
KNIGHT: Thank you.

5540
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,078
FRIEDMAN: Another note is that the informative

5550
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,481
behavior is like

5560
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:13,352
the base class of the transmission view

5570
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,721
because it seems to be like it's

5580
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,157
updating one on the details.

5590
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:18,824
Like what

5600
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,758
if I'm saying

5610
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,995
there is a gallon of milk in the fridge?

5620
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,830
Truly what else could be conveyed

5630
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,864
other than the content?

5640
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,000
So it seems like the most natural.

5650
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,168
And then there are specific

5660
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,471
kinds of content like

5670
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,139
sharing the content

5680
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,040
that you have a question

5690
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,108
or sharing the content

5700
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,976
that you would like somebody to act.

5710
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,579
And so in that way, as you described,

5720
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:42,915
many forms of speech behavior

5730
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,416
are well accounted for

5740
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,751
in the transmission view,

5750
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:46,151
and that

5760
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,586
accounting is actually kind

5770
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,320
of a callback

5780
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,890
to that mouth stream for David Spivak

5790
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,859
about accounting system.

5800
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,329
So these are like accounting models.

5810
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:00,899
And then you highlighted that imperative

5820
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:05,270
in the inactive and ecological view,

5830
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,207
all communication that the imperative is

5840
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,842
perhaps the basic form of communication,

5850
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:13,412
and that can be seen developmentally

5860
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,480
through a child

5870
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,316
and the kinds of communications

5880
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,450
that they may engage

5890
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,851
in, as well

5900
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,486
as from an evolutionary perspective,

5910
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,990
with the kinds of audio or chemical

5920
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,358
or physical stigma

5930
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:27,759
and marks that different

5940
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,594
kinds of creatures

5950
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,028
use to communicate within

5960
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,263
and across species.

5970
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,164
FRIEDMAN: So those are action

5980
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,466
oriented communications,

5990
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,468
as we can

6000
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,936
then say, all action

6010
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,905
oriented communication

6020
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,306
or all communication

6030
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:42,307
we can say is action

6040
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,576
oriented in an obvious way.

6050
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,511
So then imperative becomes

6060
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,614
the base class

6070
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,515
shaping the field of affordances.

6080
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,150
If that's what the ecological view on

6090
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,785
communication is,

6100
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,320
is going to be most natural

6110
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,588
with kinds of expressions

6120
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,191
that we can say are imperative.

6130
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:02,060
FRIEDMAN: And then informative updates

6140
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:03,462
are like

6150
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,329
one step

6160
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:07,165
removed from direct action requests.

6170
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:08,800
So saying

6180
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,668
turn the handle to

6190
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,970
the left is an imperative.

6200
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:13,272
If you said,

6210
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:14,840
I'm going to

6220
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,941
inform you about two things,

6230
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,976
the handle can be turned to the left.

6240
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,711
And if this happens,

6250
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:21,613
you may want to turn the handle.

6260
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,182
Those are breaking down a capacity

6270
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:28,153
for action into sequential or modular

6280
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,222
or re composable

6290
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:32,791
statements.

6300
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,128
FRIEDMAN: But those statements are like hiding

6310
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,131
the consequences of action.

6320
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,399
And so in that way, we

6330
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,933
we can have an action

6340
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,569
oriented view on communication

6350
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,406
and then see different kinds of other

6360
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,909
behavior as like

6370
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:55,013
modified or truncated or censored

6380
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:58,817
or hidden action modification.

6390
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,587
And that may or may not entail needing

6400
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,623
to even explain

6410
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,024
how meaning is represented,

6420
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:10,028
transmitted or received.

6430
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:13,131
FRIEDMAN: Yes, from me.

6440
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:13,999
TISON: That's exactly it.

6450
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,234
TISON: So the that's really the

6460
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,170
the idea extended very well.

6470
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,071
And another example

6480
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:22,040
that we that we often use here is the

6490
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,110
the joint action of cooking a meal

6500
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,678
with various people.

6510
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,547
So like an example,

6520
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,449
we use that in the last discussion,

6530
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,050
the example of moving a couch

6540
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:32,984
to another example

6550
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,286
maybe to change a bit

6560
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:35,954
our intuitions about communication.

6570
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,022
TISON: So when people are cooking

6580
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,056
a meal together,

6590
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:40,459
we can suppose that some people,

6600
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:41,493
some of the

6610
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:42,094
so suppose

6620
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,228
that we're in the kitchen

6630
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:44,696
of one of the person

6640
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,564
and the other doesn't know

6650
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,733
exactly where all the things are.

6660
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,801
And so at first the person could say

6670
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:52,204
there's flour in there in the

6680
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,639
in the cupboard or in the pantry

6690
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,808
and saying that that's an important

6700
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:58,477
and informative language.

6710
00:22:58,477 --> 00:22:59,277
TISON: But that could

6720
00:22:59,277 --> 00:22:59,945
that's like

6730
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,346
that might be a hidden

6740
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:04,449
imperative insofar as at some point

6750
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:05,517
in the interaction

6760
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:06,885
in the cooking of the meal,

6770
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,620
the flour might be needed.

6780
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,654
And at this point,

6790
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:10,589
this alteration

6800
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:11,790
of the field of affordances,

6810
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,658
the appearance of the flour

6820
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:14,793
as an affordances

6830
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,128
in the context might drive

6840
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,696
the action of the person

6850
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:18,930
when the flour is needed.

6860
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,132
TISON: At a certain point,

6870
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,500
the person will have this software

6880
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,270
dense field and will go to to to seek it

6890
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,705
if it's necessary at that point.

6900
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,807
So the informative is,

6910
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:29,641
as I said,

6920
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:33,512
something like a dispositional or long

6930
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,013
term imperative.

6940
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,215
So something of a hidden imperative

6950
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,484
that can drive behavior

6960
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:40,852
in the long term.

6970
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,654
So so it's like at the beginning

6980
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:43,655
this distinction is more

6990
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:46,391
is a distinction of like

7000
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,894
is this effort tends to be acted upon

7010
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,062
immediately by you or

7020
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:53,165
is it posed in the context

7030
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:54,299
and can

7040
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:55,133
like alter

7050
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:55,834
the dynamic

7060
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,335
without being directly

7070
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:58,570
acted upon immediately.

7080
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,572
TISON: So that's out there would be

7090
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,040
the distinction is drawn.

7100
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,742
And yeah, I,

7110
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:05,177
I think that that's,

7120
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,611
that's how we try to to

7130
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,046
account for informative

7140
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:10,482
without

7150
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,317
describing it as

7160
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:13,518
transmitting a content

7170
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,053
or an information.

7180
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:16,655
So that's that's the idea.

7190
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:17,889
And I think that you explain it

7200
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:21,159
very well in your in your in your your.

7210
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,094
Yeah.

7220
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:26,631
In your explanation.

7230
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,334
FRIEDMAN: But yeah, it's very

7240
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,268
interesting.

7250
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:33,071
It's just another

7260
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:36,441
consequence of centering action.

7270
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:39,778
So many things, the pragmatic turn,

7280
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,447
pragmatism earlier

7290
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:43,782
than the so-called pragmatic

7300
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,951
turn in the neurosciences

7310
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,152
and all of the developments

7320
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,222
in cognitive science.

7330
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,390
In many cases, it's been like

7340
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,161
an information or an inference view

7350
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,331
yielding to an action view,

7360
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:00,866
and that just played out

7370
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,869
differently on different frontiers.

7380
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,837
FRIEDMAN: And it feels like in a way,

7390
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,640
language is like the stronghold

7400
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,510
of information views

7410
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,980
because it's like so amenable

7420
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,149
to syntactic and discourse analysis

7430
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,952
in a and composition ality

7440
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:22,921
and all these features

7450
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,790
that we see in formal models and in

7460
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,758
computer systems

7470
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:28,560
that it feels

7480
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,294
like, oh, maybe

7490
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:30,262
all the funny stuff

7500
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,297
that people do and say,

7510
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,933
we'll figure that one out to

7520
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,068
Blue.

7530
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:42,140
FRIEDMAN: And then Dean.

7540
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,843
KNIGHT: So I just wonder about

7550
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,645
like mimicry,

7560
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,179
which is something that we see

7570
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,582
like in the animal kingdom a lot.

7580
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:54,219
And like whether that is imperative,

7590
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:54,920
I mean, sometimes

7600
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,589
I guess it can be imperatives like

7610
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,391
watch me do this and then you do it,

7620
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,092
but not always.

7630
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,461
So sometimes it's like,

7640
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:04,129
you know,

7650
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:04,663
an animal,

7660
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,164
we'll see another animal do something.

7670
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:07,766
KNIGHT: And then they try it too.

7680
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,768
And so what?

7690
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:10,502
I don't know.

7700
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,671
I just don't know how to look

7710
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:13,405
at it

7720
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,407
in the terms of teaching and learning

7730
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,475
and like shared goal directness.

7740
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,844
Like what is maybe the role of mimicry

7750
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:20,979
and how does that like

7760
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:21,813
what is the effect

7770
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,481
on the field of affordances?

7780
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:24,616
Does it just open up

7790
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:25,917
like you see someone do something

7800
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:26,751
and then your field of

7810
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,320
affordances opens to

7820
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,754
that is also possible for me?

7830
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:30,722
KNIGHT: Or does that

7840
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:33,391
not have maybe like a semantic analog?

7850
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:36,595
I don't know.

7860
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,063
KNIGHT: Yeah, that's a really good question.

7870
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:42,000
And often people with either

7880
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,368
TISON: the transmission view

7890
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,570
will adopt the view

7900
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,205
that the main driver

7910
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:50,241
of the evolution of language in human

7920
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:52,477
societies was the transmitting of

7930
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,747
of knowledge and of skills,

7940
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:56,481
for instance,

7950
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:59,150
then of, of various types of activities.

7960
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,051
So that's like a,

7970
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:03,254
a clear example where it seems

7980
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,756
that the transmission view

7990
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:07,559
as a story to say

8000
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,295
when, if we, if we take for granted

8010
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,463
that like

8020
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,800
in imitating somebody or, or,

8030
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:17,135
or learning

8040
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,404
something to somebody is in effect

8050
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:22,641
transmitting a knowledge or a certain

8060
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,174
kind of,

8070
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:26,111
of, of mental state or cognitive state.

8080
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:29,014
TISON: So there's clearly

8090
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:30,448
something interesting there

8100
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:31,683
for the transmission of you,

8110
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:32,817
but I think that's

8120
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,253
an alternative possible analysis.

8130
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:38,390
You just heard that it is the idea

8140
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,991
that you

8150
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,060
when you're interacting with somebody

8160
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,796
and specifically with somebody of your

8170
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,197
of your own species,

8180
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:47,465
seeing this person do

8190
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,534
something can open

8200
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,436
new affordances for yourself.

8210
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:52,003
For instance,

8220
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:52,871
if I see I see

8230
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,406
somebody that looks like me

8240
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,640
do something.

8250
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,009
TISON: I'm I have learned that when

8260
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:00,812
somebody looks like me, does something

8270
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,481
usually be with a little bit of effort.

8280
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:04,349
I can do it too.

8290
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,151
So somebody doing

8300
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,720
something is a way of opening,

8310
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,588
opening up new affordances for me

8320
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:11,890
and trying to achieve it.

8330
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,125
So in many case,

8340
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,060
mimicry will not

8350
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,195
necessarily be communicative.

8360
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,697
That is because an organism

8370
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,098
can do something without.

8380
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:23,101
TISON: I mean, no, it is not communicating

8390
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,269
nothing to anybody,

8400
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,003
but it happens

8410
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:26,905
that somebody else watches it and

8420
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:28,506
imitates it.

8430
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:28,773
So in

8440
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:29,074
that case,

8450
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,643
there's not necessarily communication,

8460
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:32,477
but in cases

8470
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,679
where there is communication involved,

8480
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:37,082
I think we can analyze and analyze it,

8490
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:38,516
just as you said.

8500
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:41,453
That is saying that

8510
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,155
the action of the organism opens up

8520
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,123
and you have far

8530
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,759
for the person who's watching it,

8540
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:48,393
doing it.

8550
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,396
TISON: And usually in cases of explicit

8560
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:55,233
TISON: skill learning, for instance,

8570
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,235
the experts will like do the thing

8580
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,303
more deliberately,

8590
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,104
more slowly,

8600
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:01,539
more explicitly to like show

8610
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:02,941
what are the relevant movement

8620
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,343
that has to be made in order to achieve

8630
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:06,644
so that like

8640
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:07,879
making more salient

8650
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,948
the kind of, of the, of movement

8660
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:13,051
that has to be made to, to,

8670
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,786
to succeed in the

8680
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,554
in performing their skill.

8690
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:18,757
TISON: So I think that's a way

8700
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,225
that we can understand

8710
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:20,992
this kind of skill

8720
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:22,560
learning in the transformation

8730
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,561
of the affordances

8740
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:25,363
that are available to the person

8750
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,999
that's receiving the the communication,

8760
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:30,201
that that's

8770
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,904
how I would I think I would analyze it.

8780
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,474
FRIEDMAN: One simple

8790
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,276
example kind of building on this, making

8800
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,811
certain actions deliberate,

8810
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:43,114
then being interested for your thoughts,

8820
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:46,417
even showing something deliberately,

8830
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,554
verbally calling attention,

8840
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,689
or just the position of the body

8850
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:53,725
for a physical skill.

8860
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,493
It shapes the field of affordances,

8870
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:57,896
specifically where somebody can look.

8880
00:29:58,496 --> 00:29:59,798
So if you're like, okay, I'm

8890
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,399
going to swing the bat

8900
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,300
and then now I'm going to show you

8910
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,301
what my hand

8920
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:03,635
you know,

8930
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,003
this isn't usually how I do it,

8940
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:05,804
but I'm going to show you how

8950
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,839
I was holding it at that time.

8960
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:08,640
FRIEDMAN: You have shaped

8970
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,541
their field

8980
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,343
of ocular motor affordances and

8990
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,245
and that is what enables

9000
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,482
their generative model to update.

9010
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:21,219
And so nowhere in that account is

9020
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,022
I'm transmitting that

9030
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,123
this is to be held

9040
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,025
between these two fingers,

9050
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:27,692
let alone

9060
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:28,893
counterfactuals, like,

9070
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:29,627
here's what you do

9080
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:32,130
if your hand is slippery.

9090
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:35,166
But but by bodily posture,

9100
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,403
including vocal box bodily posture,

9110
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:41,406
we can have an integrated account of

9120
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,476
mimicry, skill transfer

9130
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:46,711
again, transfers playing

9140
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:47,011
way too

9150
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,581
strongly into a transmission view, but

9160
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,952
skill resonance or something similar

9170
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,720
that helps recognize

9180
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,257
the cognitive entities learning process

9190
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:04,495
then.

9200
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:05,463
DEAN: Okay, well,

9210
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:06,631
I want to take what you're saying,

9220
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:07,565
but I'm going to put a little bit

9230
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:08,700
of a weird flex on it

9240
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,735
because I want to try to combine

9250
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:13,404
Blues PIN and Remi's pin and Daniel's

9260
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,974
pin into one kind of question

9270
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:17,208
that comes back to the paper.

9280
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,810
So like the last

9290
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,112
5 minutes of the conversation

9300
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:22,313
has been focused on

9310
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:24,582
the back of

9320
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:26,217
and as typing

9330
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,085
when it pertains

9340
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,087
to language and communication

9350
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:31,723
and blue bringing mimicry and is a

9360
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:35,360
is a form of as person

9370
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,195
who a lot of the emphasis in the paper

9380
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,397
which is on the art

9390
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:40,832
of communication and language.

9400
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:44,269
DEAN: So here's my question.

9410
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,904
I went back and read the paper again

9420
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,872
and I caught myself asking,

9430
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:50,174
DEAN: what do I hear

9440
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:51,276
when I'm reading something?

9450
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,478
Or I'm listening to someone?

9460
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,747
What do I hear

9470
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,116
as both processor and the producer?

9480
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,018
As

9490
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:03,154
we mentioned off camera, an arranger

9500
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:06,224
of something being signaled,

9510
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:09,160
which I'm picking up on and decoding.

9520
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:10,895
So

9530
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,197
rather than just leave it

9540
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:14,699
there a part that for a second

9550
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,334
because I think that's that

9560
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,670
the the of what I want to ask

9570
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,571
as a processor

9580
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,173
and a producer as an arranger,

9590
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:24,776
I can hear things in mono,

9600
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,611
I can hear things in stereo,

9610
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,478
I can even hear things

9620
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,013
if I go to my Apple Music

9630
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,782
in spatial audio.

9640
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:32,617
DEAN: So

9650
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,553
that is a field of affordances,

9660
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:38,056
a question as opposed to a source

9670
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:39,157
DEAN: of affordances question

9680
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,591
And if I only limit myself

9690
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:41,793
to the source,

9700
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,860
I'm going to be asking

9710
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,396
all the above type questions,

9720
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:47,598
right?

9730
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:50,969
So if I want to stay in the as of

9740
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:51,836
if I want to be able

9750
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,104
to hold up to things

9760
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:53,671
at once,

9770
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,974
at a minimum, the stereo or the spatial,

9780
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,609
that's when I get into the ecological,

9790
00:32:58,609 --> 00:32:59,577
even if it's

9800
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:01,879
specific ecological because I'm not

9810
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,717
collapsing down to a single source

9820
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,219
as my point of contact,

9830
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,056
which then asks leads me to ask the fact

9840
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:12,790
that communication

9850
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,260
can be formed as an of types, meaning

9860
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:20,031
mono stereo or spatial

9870
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:22,233
mimicry interrogation.

9880
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:24,402
DEAN: The fact that it can be broken out

9890
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:27,071
DEAN: into those things, does that introduce

9900
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:31,642
self production into the self processing

9910
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,412
in your paper?

9920
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,280
Because I know there's a heavy emphasis

9930
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,484
on the above on the processing,

9940
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:43,021
but I wonder if you keep the as

9950
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,522
when blue brings it up

9960
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,591
or when Daniel brings it up.

9970
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:46,991
If we're

9980
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:47,959
if we're keeping an eye on that,

9990
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:50,094
even a specific ecological level,

10000
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,431
are we not, when we hear something,

10010
00:33:53,431 --> 00:34:05,043
producers as well.

10020
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,945
FRIEDMAN: What are we producing?

10030
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,147
DEAN: I have no idea.

10040
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,148
But I know I hear something

10050
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,216
even when I read what you're typing.

10060
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,585
I'm not just hearing the tap any tap,

10070
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:16,754
I'm hearing something.

10080
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:19,023
DEAN: We are product

10090
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,124
produced,

10100
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,627
we are produce like it's changing.

10110
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:25,129
I'm hearing that

10120
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:25,963
not

10130
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,066
reading the.

10140
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,535
So if I incorporate that,

10150
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:31,803
what am I doing?

10160
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:34,138
And I'm not the expert on communication,

10170
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:36,174
so I wonder what the expert

10180
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:41,646
can tell me about them.

10190
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:44,182
TISON: Yeah, that's a good question.

10200
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:44,749
Um,

10210
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,085
yeah.

10220
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,787
TISON: I'm not sure what to say about.

10230
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,625
FRIEDMAN: Luc first and then we'll continue.

10240
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:57,195
KNIGHT: So I wonder if what you're hearing,

10250
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:57,528
FRIEDMAN: Dean,

10260
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:58,763
has anything to do

10270
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,299
with the internal monologue.

10280
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:02,366
So like,

10290
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,502
as you are reading something,

10300
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,671
then you are also hearing something.

10310
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:09,073
And so it's like there's this internal,

10320
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:09,841
I mean,

10330
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:12,944
like I have a very I'm a talker person

10340
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:13,711
and so I like

10350
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:13,945
I have

10360
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,113
strong internal monologue

10370
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,481
like all the time running like through

10380
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:17,582
even getting ready in the morning.

10390
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:18,783
KNIGHT: Okay, I need to get my shoes

10400
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,817
and get my purse

10410
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,419
and my keys and I have to pack my lunch.

10420
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,087
And like all these things

10430
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:23,821
like that happen.

10440
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:26,124
So I'm constantly hearing that like,

10450
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,959
as if I'm saying it maybe to myself,

10460
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,694
even though I'm not speaking, but,

10470
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,762
but I wonder what you know.

10480
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,898
So I definitely am a producer

10490
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,166
of whatever I am reading.

10500
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,367
KNIGHT: Like I reproduce it.

10510
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,169
I reproduce it though, right?

10520
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,171
So I have in my own

10530
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,140
mind my own internal monologue.

10540
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,107
But I wanted to like

10550
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:43,708
I know not

10560
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,710
everyone has this internal monologue

10570
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,079
and so so what is it then?

10580
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,314
The same for the people that don't

10590
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,283
perhaps have this internal monologue.

10600
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,017
I mean, maybe they carry

10610
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:54,452
around a picture of all the things

10620
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:55,086
that they need

10630
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,054
to get ready in the morning. So yeah.

10640
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,191
DEAN: Justin Yeah.

10650
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,460
And I think you bring up a good point.

10660
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,694
Is it a monologue?

10670
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,796
Is it a stereo log?

10680
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:08,399
Is it a Quadra Phonic log

10690
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:09,600
for some people?

10700
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,001
I mean,

10710
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,569
I mean, there was an availability

10720
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,237
way back when, maybe

10730
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,273
even before some of you were born,

10740
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,441
there was Quadra Phonic Sound.

10750
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:19,877
I remember that album in Quadrant Phonic

10760
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,213
Sound and like

10770
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:26,250
to my simple years, I didn't understand

10780
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:27,585
what that even meant.

10790
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:28,052
DEAN: Just because

10800
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,820
they were able to break it out

10810
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,124
into four parts, didn't didn't change

10820
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:36,327
DEAN: what I was producing and processing.

10830
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:39,931
So for the fact that we can type it

10840
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:41,098
like that,

10850
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:43,167
like not tape it up and literally

10860
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,870
turn it into tapes, is the part

10870
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,306
where I don't really have the background

10880
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:50,074
to be able to explain

10890
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,076
how that that ability

10900
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:53,611
that field of affordances

10910
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:54,712
as opposed to

10920
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:55,580
examining this

10930
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,982
as a single source of affordances

10940
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:01,852
changes the the communication game

10950
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:02,787
because it doesn't it

10960
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,956
certainly does speak to mimicry

10970
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:06,991
and what we can and cannot pick up.

10980
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,760
DEAN: It certainly speaks to Daniel's point

10990
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,630
about about what happens when

11000
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,432
when layers

11010
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,334
appear and disappear

11020
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,402
because we narrow down

11030
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,172
what we're picking up on versus

11040
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,608
have have both of our ears working,

11050
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:25,977
even though we think it's our eyes

11060
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,212
that are doing all the skating.

11070
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:28,879
Right.

11080
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:32,850
So again, I'm not I'm not trying to ask

11090
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:33,884
the impossible question.

11100
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:34,619
I'm just

11110
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,687
curious in the sense of producer

11120
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:38,889
and processor

11130
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,192
and what that arrangement is

11140
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,194
dependent upon, what

11150
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,328
what the because Dan,

11160
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:45,129
you brought it up in

11170
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:46,797
in the last livestream

11180
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:48,032
circumstances matter

11190
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,803
so but as a hearer

11200
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:55,439
I wonder I wonder if we if we

11210
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:58,909
if we know enough about ourselves

11220
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:00,945
to really be able to,

11230
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:01,712
to, to

11240
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,848
give this anything more than it is,

11250
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,051
DEAN: as Rami kindly pointed out in the paper,

11260
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:08,853
give this more than

11270
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:11,856
sort of a big roadmap deal.

11280
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:15,559
If we if we are taking context

11290
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:18,763
into consideration.

11300
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:19,497
FRIEDMAN: Thank you.

11310
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:22,633
Let me.

11320
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,701
TISON: Yeah, I think the discussion

11330
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:26,203
about the internal monologue

11340
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:27,672
FRIEDMAN: is really interesting.

11350
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,040
And there's a lot of things

11360
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,940
that you said that

11370
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,309
that I think really interesting.

11380
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,344
But I want to go back to the

11390
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:34,912
idea of the monologue.

11400
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:35,680
And

11410
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,482
there are some people who believe

11420
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,552
that, like Chomsky, you believe that

11430
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:44,155
language is not even for communication.

11440
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,923
It's about structuring thought.

11450
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,391
TISON: And so there's there are people

11460
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,492
who believe that

11470
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,629
the language is, first

11480
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:52,263
and foremost

11490
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,597
something that

11500
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:54,932
is a property

11510
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,467
of the structure of our thoughts

11520
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,002
and not a property

11530
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,571
of systems of communication and

11540
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:05,076
so there's this idea that like the

11550
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,012
the the

11560
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,081
inner monologue comes first

11570
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:12,049
and comes the communication

11580
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:14,085
of this inner monologue in the

11590
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:16,053
in communication.

11600
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:20,257
So we have this basic that is once a

11610
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,259
what's more inherent

11620
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:23,694
in the transmission view

11630
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,529
that we have our train of thought.

11640
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,232
TISON: We are we have our

11650
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:29,967
in our speech that we that

11660
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:30,801
we have in our heads.

11670
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:31,502
TISON: And then

11680
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,771
we translate this in our speech, in

11690
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:36,240
overt speech that is then

11700
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,742
taken by somebody else.

11710
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,845
And I think that this gets

11720
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:44,048
the priorities wrong.

11730
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,449
And between outer

11740
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,450
speech and inner speech

11750
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:46,984
and there's been

11760
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,186
a lot of work in the philosophy by

11770
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:53,491
Wilfred Sellers and by others

11780
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:56,494
in in psychology, like if you go ski,

11790
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:58,562
we say that

11800
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:01,599
the first form of speech is overt speech

11810
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:05,002
that is then internalized in in

11820
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,771
that becomes like

11830
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,073
that, that becomes inner.

11840
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,207
TISON: But first,

11850
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:11,342
in the beginning,

11860
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,477
there's only overt speech.

11870
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:15,212
A child that learns language

11880
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:16,614
does not have an inner speech.

11890
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,249
There is only outer speech

11900
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,284
that is expressed directly

11910
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:21,585
the child's speech.

11920
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,420
The child

11930
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,954
then do things with his words

11940
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:24,855
in its environment

11950
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:26,957
and does not directly, automatically

11960
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:28,492
as the

11970
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:29,794
corresponding inner

11980
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,061
monologue in its head.

11990
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:32,129
And there's a process

12000
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:32,997
TISON: that's really interesting.

12010
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:36,033
TISON: I think that is

12020
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,536
where we see that beginning to happen,

12030
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:41,071
where the child speaks to itself alone,

12040
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,773
when there's nobody else around.

12050
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:43,340
And so

12060
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,341
there's this transition

12070
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:45,643
where language is used

12080
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:47,011
in communicative interaction.

12090
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:48,212
And at some point

12100
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:51,048
the child use language alone.

12110
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:53,083
And there's a question of why,

12120
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:53,918
why does it do?

12130
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,453
And I think that our view

12140
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,887
of communication is really

12150
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,658
interestingly linked with use of

12160
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:02,193
of the inner

12170
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:03,828
monologue as self cueing

12180
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,429
or self regulation.

12190
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:08,466
TISON: And so the child can

12200
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,433
actually regulate.

12210
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:10,601
TISON: It's still about for a dance

12220
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,169
when it's alone,

12230
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:13,871
when there's nobody else around.

12240
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:16,874
And in time this in the outer

12250
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:21,412
zone for this outer monologue but alone

12260
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:22,713
monologue

12270
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:25,816
becomes overt because the child learns

12280
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,818
to not necessarily produce

12290
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,987
the sound that correspond

12300
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,655
to the producing of these acts.

12310
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:32,556
And there's there's

12320
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:33,757
this integration that's

12330
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:35,793
there is this internalization of

12340
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:37,561
our third discourse

12350
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:38,829
that becomes in our discourse.

12360
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,531
TISON: And there's a lot of

12370
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:41,832
cute anecdotes about that.

12380
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:45,169
My nephew is a I have a nephew,

12390
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:46,170
the son of my

12400
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,371
TISON: my sister

12410
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,440
and is like when is

12420
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,242
is about to go to sleep.

12430
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,142
He's in his bed.

12440
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:55,579
And every night is like rehearsing

12450
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:56,247
the events

12460
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:57,481
that happen in in the day

12470
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:59,750
and you seeing like the

12480
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,353
the comments that that the rules

12490
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,921
the norms that he heard in the

12500
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,222
oh I don't have to do that

12510
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:06,156
I must do that.

12520
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:07,625
TISON: And so he's like, we're you

12530
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,026
TISON: what happened in the day?

12540
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,161
So this outer monologue

12550
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:12,663
when he's alone in his bed

12560
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,865
is like the beginning of inner thought.

12570
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,634
We're seeing is starts

12580
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:19,603
out in the open and

12590
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:20,771
at some point this

12600
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:21,272
this outer

12610
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:23,374
monologue will become internalized

12620
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:26,610
and we won't hear the he's his thoughts

12630
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,679
out in the open.

12640
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:29,413
But I think

12650
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,682
that's like the process that it takes.

12660
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:34,018
TISON: And there's also the idea another point

12670
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,787
that we, for instance, when we read,

12680
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,423
usually we read silently,

12690
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:40,524
so we read

12700
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:41,191
what's written

12710
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:42,660
and we have the corresponding

12720
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,327
inner monologue.

12730
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,163
But it's known that in ancient times

12740
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:47,398
when people were reading,

12750
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,499
usually they were reading

12760
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:50,134
automatically aloud,

12770
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:53,571
loud, loudly, and it took a training

12780
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:54,471
in order

12790
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:55,272
to be able

12800
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,308
to read without speaking the words.

12810
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:00,611
TISON: And so, so like in middle age

12820
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:02,846
and I'm not perfectly sure it's

12830
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:06,150
if it's certainly accurately we should

12840
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:07,851
verify it.

12850
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:10,120
But I believe that's that's true.

12860
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:12,122
And it seems that they heard that.

12870
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:13,624
So it seems that

12880
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:15,626
first there's the outer monologue,

12890
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:17,661
the outer dialog,

12900
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:19,830
and then there's the outer monologue,

12910
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,032
and then there's the inner monologue

12920
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:23,300
that comes after that.

12930
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,402
TISON: And I think that's more the

12940
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:27,471
the true direction of priority

12950
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:28,739
between inner

12960
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,007
monologue and other monologue

12970
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:36,847
flow.

12980
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:37,548
KNIGHT: So I just

12990
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,850
have a cute anecdote

13000
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,552
about, about learning, learning to talk.

13010
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:42,820
So I have two kids

13020
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,722
and they're super different.

13030
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:47,191
My son did as your nephew did me

13040
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:49,026
like would be in his crib

13050
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:50,260
talking to himself,

13060
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,562
talking to his stuffed

13070
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:54,231
animals and kind of recreating events

13080
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:56,533
in a similar way.

13090
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:59,670
He also babbled a lot like a lot of like

13100
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:01,171
just always bluff above about like

13110
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:01,939
just saying

13120
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:03,841
nothing from the time he was tiny

13130
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:06,276
and has an incredible vocabulary.

13140
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:07,411
KNIGHT: I mean, now he's six,

13150
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:08,212
but people are like,

13160
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:09,146
wow, how old is this kid?

13170
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,114
KNIGHT: I mean, he's reading at three

13180
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:12,349
and just is like very, very verbal.

13190
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:15,452
And my my daughter is super different.

13200
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,721
So she did not really babble,

13210
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,556
but she signed like crazy.

13220
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:21,091
And they both went to the same school.

13230
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:22,192
They both teach them

13240
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:23,794
the same signs like say,

13250
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:25,229
milk and cracker and cheese

13260
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:26,397
and you know, bathroom

13270
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:27,564
and all the things.

13280
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:28,065
KNIGHT: So like

13290
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:29,967
they both went to the same daycare,

13300
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,402
same environment,

13310
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:32,836
and she picked up the signing

13320
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,405
KNIGHT: much more than my son ever did.

13330
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:35,973
Has maybe one or two signs.

13340
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:36,940
She's like 20.

13350
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,709
Like, I had to go learn the signs

13360
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,010
and before she could sign,

13370
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,011
she would just like stand

13380
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,746
in the kitchen and scream,

13390
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:44,581
like just unable to communicate

13400
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,517
whatever it was that she wanted.

13410
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,485
KNIGHT: And it's so odd.

13420
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:48,986
Like,

13430
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:50,020
they're just like two

13440
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,155
totally different kids.

13450
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:53,424
KNIGHT: But she when she was learning Chinese,

13460
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:55,392
I had a parent teacher conference

13470
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:55,726
with the two

13480
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:56,760
and they're both in learning

13490
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,294
Chinese now.

13500
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:57,995
They're in private school

13510
00:44:57,995 --> 00:44:58,595
and they've been learning

13520
00:44:58,595 --> 00:44:59,663
for like eight years.

13530
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:01,432
So when she was first starting to learn,

13540
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:03,067
she wouldn't speak in class.

13550
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:04,401
And the teacher and I had a conference

13560
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:05,669
and the teacher said like, Oh,

13570
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:07,938
I am concerned about your daughter.

13580
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:09,239
KNIGHT: She doesn't participate in class.

13590
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:10,541
Like she doesn't have to take Chinese.

13600
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,675
It's not mandatory.

13610
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:12,543
If you wanted to put her

13620
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,310
in a different class

13630
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,078
and she could have a silent

13640
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:14,878
reading grade

13650
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:18,849
and I was like, Oh, so it occurred to me

13660
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:20,684
like and I knew that she and,

13670
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:22,052
and because she didn't babble

13680
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:22,886
and like I would,

13690
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,221
somebody handed her a lollipop.

13700
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:24,955
KNIGHT: She was like two

13710
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:26,724
KNIGHT: and she said, Say thank you.

13720
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:27,758
And she did the same for it.

13730
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:28,092
But, but,

13740
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:30,260
I mean, she really did not speak

13750
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,895
would not form clear words

13760
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,030
unless she knew

13770
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,998
she could see them perfectly.

13780
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:36,667
And so I said at a tutoring

13790
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:37,801
with the Chinese tutor,

13800
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,670
like just twice, three times.

13810
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,004
And then it began,

13820
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:42,339
like she was like listening.

13830
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,007
KNIGHT: Can I repeat this to my engage

13840
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,676
with this word correctly.

13850
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,611
And she just was very more

13860
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:49,146
much more careful in that.

13870
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:50,380
But both kids,

13880
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,615
as soon as they could talk,

13890
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:53,917
talked in their sleep like crazy.

13900
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,786
So Anyway, there's like kids start

13910
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:01,158
like stories.

13920
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:03,694
FRIEDMAN: The development of the self cueing

13930
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:08,098
and self speaking is very interesting.

13940
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:11,201
Even earlier on

13950
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:15,038
in behavioral analysis and behaviorism,

13960
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:16,173
like in B.F.

13970
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:18,742
Skinner's work, there's extensive

13980
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:22,346
exploration of how covert

13990
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,548
monologues and covert

14000
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:26,717
speech and societies of mind.

14010
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:29,887
And then I guess more recently

14020
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:30,754
it's become

14030
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:31,588
better understood

14040
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:34,558
how electrical activity in the body

14050
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,527
and in the brain are still

14060
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:39,863
initiated during covert speech like.

14070
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:41,465
FRIEDMAN: It's not an audible speech,

14080
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,167
but actually in various ways

14090
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,435
it still is embodied.

14100
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:48,672
And then this question of reading

14110
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,208
perhaps is another area

14120
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,677
where we're talking about

14130
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:57,648
in this language area,

14140
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,650
what is similar or different

14150
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,351
with listening

14160
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:04,321
to speech, participating in speech

14170
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,789
audibly?

14180
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,492
Is it different if it's read or Braille?

14190
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:11,295
How does the modality

14200
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:13,163
and the media influence

14210
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,500
some of these things you

14220
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:17,668
and

14230
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:20,838
DEAN: again.

14240
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,173
DEAN: I think the proportions of two ears

14250
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,074
to one mouth

14260
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:24,708
is something

14270
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:27,311
that we need to kind of really

14280
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:28,145
hold on to

14290
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:30,147
in this idea of single source

14300
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:32,015
and monologue versus

14310
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,884
what potentially is a stereo log

14320
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:35,419
in a field of affordances

14330
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:40,791
as opposed to a single source.

14340
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:42,759
I don't know why why we've been

14350
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:43,861
I don't know what advantages

14360
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,696
are given by having

14370
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,232
an ability to hear in stereo, but

14380
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:49,766
it must be

14390
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:52,302
better than having a single year

14400
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:53,670
or a single receipt,

14410
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,240
a single reception site.

14420
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,976
DEAN: And yet we we don't have two mouths.

14430
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:02,312
So again, I think it's understandable

14440
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:04,014
why from a

14450
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:05,616
transmission point of view,

14460
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:07,651
the deliverer standpoint,

14470
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:11,221
we always collapse to a source,

14480
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:12,623
a single source.

14490
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:13,523
But if we

14500
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:14,258
flip that

14510
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:15,692
and now think about it

14520
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:17,294
from the receiving standpoint,

14530
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:19,296
how does that

14540
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:21,365
how does that change our sense of what

14550
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:22,399
communication is?

14560
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,133
Because

14570
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:24,968
it doesn't change

14580
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,937
if I cover one of my years

14590
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:28,038
or if I have an earbud in

14600
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:29,406
and it cancels.

14610
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,474
DEAN: And yet something

14620
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:32,309
fundamentally must change

14630
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:33,377
in terms of communication

14640
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:34,845
DEAN: and the joint action,

14650
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:37,714
even if it's monologue in my own head

14660
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,651
versus dialog or trialogue

14670
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:41,985
required to log.

14680
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:43,053
Now again,

14690
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:44,388
I haven't done any research

14700
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:44,922
to try

14710
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,089
to try to

14720
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:46,490
figure out

14730
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:47,858
what other people have done in terms

14740
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:48,692
of looking at that.

14750
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:50,961
But to your point, though, Renee,

14760
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:51,828
in terms of

14770
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:52,863
let's get this,

14780
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:55,165
you can get past transmission.

14790
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:56,066
DEAN: We're getting trying

14800
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:57,134
to get past the idea

14810
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:59,169
of what is being delivered

14820
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:01,638
and being trying to gain a deeper

14830
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:03,874
appreciation of what is being heard.

14840
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,677
So blue.

14850
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:08,378
I'll tell you a little story

14860
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,981
I have a loquacious son

14870
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:12,582
is in his thirties now,

14880
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:13,717
but he's actually, as he's

14890
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:16,920
gotten smarter and wiser, speaks less

14900
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:19,189
like a occasionally

14910
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:21,425
he gets out of a developing words

14920
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:21,959
silence

14930
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,361
that could serve an entire community.

14940
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:27,464
DEAN: And I find that really fascinating.

14950
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:30,100
I don't have to comment on it.

14960
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,436
It's just you notice that as people know

14970
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:35,772
more, they maybe they sign more,

14980
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,741
maybe they find other ways

14990
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:39,943
to to make their point.

15000
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,678
And it goes back to that timing

15010
00:49:41,678 --> 00:49:43,113
your take thing.

15020
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:46,650
So yeah.

15030
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,018
FRIEDMAN: Great.

15040
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:49,186
There's so many

15050
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:51,488
references like the true way

15060
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:54,191
is the one that can't be spoken of or

15070
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:55,459
those who do do

15080
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:56,693
and those who can't teach

15090
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,996
all these kinds of funny,

15100
00:49:58,996 --> 00:49:59,329
you know,

15110
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,431
poking fun at different archetypes

15120
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:02,432
and so on.

15130
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,001
And how that's related to wisdom.

15140
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:05,702
The two

15150
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:08,972
ears and one mouth,

15160
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:10,941
which you've been referencing

15170
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:12,843
throughout the conversations

15180
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,678
and the Quadra Phonic sound.

15190
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,280
FRIEDMAN: Quadrophenia, I'm sure, was amazing.

15200
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,115
DEAN: From.

15210
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:20,317
FRIEDMAN: It.

15220
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:23,286
FRIEDMAN: It is true that the enrichments

15230
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:26,256
and the spatial nature

15240
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:29,960
of heard sounds, soundscapes

15250
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,830
is it's like something that can't be

15260
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:35,932
turned off.

15270
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:37,200
Like the receiver.

15280
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,337
All of our receiving is bilateral

15290
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:43,240
visual

15300
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:45,542
nostrils and smell

15310
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:48,045
proprioceptive is heavily multilateral,

15320
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:51,148
but it has a coarse bilateral symmetry.

15330
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:52,315
But

15340
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:55,485
the mouth,

15350
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:58,388
as our action states,

15360
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:01,024
needs generative

15370
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,960
cohesion.

15380
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,996
Perhaps just a just so story,

15390
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:06,663
but I don't know

15400
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:10,100
of any cases where there are

15410
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:12,903
now there are some bodily

15420
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,072
sounds that are bilateral,

15430
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,908
like perhaps the

15440
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,177
vibration of a cricket.

15450
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:20,811
FRIEDMAN: So it's not

15460
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:21,678
FRIEDMAN: that like

15470
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:24,247
FRIEDMAN: sound production can't be bilateral.

15480
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:25,048
TISON: Right?

15490
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:28,652
FRIEDMAN: It's just that wherever sound production

15500
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:34,324
is localized on the sender, when we

15510
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:36,593
when we highlight content

15520
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,128
in its transmission,

15530
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:39,663
where does that account begin?

15540
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:41,565
What has to begin with the content

15550
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:43,567
and the representation in the sender?

15560
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,302
And then you could ask

15570
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:46,770
whether it was fully

15580
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:47,504
or partially

15590
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,639
or deceptively recognized

15600
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:51,508
by the recipients, potentially

15610
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:54,177
when we censor the

15620
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:55,812
recipients action,

15630
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:56,646
but even calling them

15640
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:57,447
a recipient kind of

15650
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,748
puts them on to a back foot.

15660
00:51:58,748 --> 00:51:59,516
FRIEDMAN: We're just centering

15670
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:01,952
the agents engagements ecologically

15680
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:03,620
and they're interfacing

15690
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,256
with fields of affordances.

15700
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,592
Then we we do see that

15710
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:12,896
stereophonic enrichments

15720
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:15,832
of everything.

15730
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:18,902
And no matter how narrow or

15740
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,472
how many, Shannon bits

15750
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:24,541
or kolmogorov bits,

15760
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,610
it doesn't really matter

15770
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,512
because it's going to be unpacked

15780
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:33,717
in a generative model that in aspects

15790
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:36,520
that aren't and don't need to be

15800
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,122
in the signal and hence

15810
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:41,791
aren't or don't need to be in account

15820
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:45,529
of the signaling.

15830
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:45,896
DEAN: Just think

15840
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:47,631
DEAN: I'm trying to bring back the inference

15850
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:48,832
and to the active inference here,

15860
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:49,533
because the active part

15870
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:51,801
is definitely the transmission piece.

15880
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:55,071
So thank you for for reinforcing that.

15890
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:57,374
But I do

15900
00:52:57,374 --> 00:52:59,576
I do wonder when we do

15910
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,344
bring the inference back,

15920
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:04,314
why are our sensing

15930
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:08,818
affordances are those bilateral forms?

15940
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:11,922
There must be some advantage to that.

15950
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:13,323
And so is it.

15960
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:16,993
DEAN: As Blue pointed out, because of as not

15970
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:19,563
just the heavy emphasis on the out?

15980
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:20,463
Well,

15990
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:22,832
what was the product of my transmission?

16000
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:26,469
How am I pulling in this communication?

16010
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:28,838
And what advantages are there

16020
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:31,908
to not getting strung out

16030
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:35,111
or hung up on the mono log?

16040
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:39,082
The single source.

16050
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:40,483
FRIEDMAN: One thing that makes me think about

16060
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:43,687
is in caricature disinfo

16070
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:45,789
representations of bug vision,

16080
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:47,023
insect vision.

16090
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:47,991
It will look like

16100
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:50,994
they're seeing many separate cells,

16110
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:53,263
whereas if

16120
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:54,397
one were just to take a breath

16130
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,298
and think about their own

16140
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:56,266
visual experience,

16150
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:59,069
we don't see two fields of you,

16160
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,938
so it's like not really making sense

16170
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:04,741
why an insect would see multiple.

16180
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:08,979
FRIEDMAN: So the visual field, because there's

16190
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:10,981
no objects out there.

16200
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:12,515
We have all of these different ways

16210
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:14,117
that we can talk about

16220
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:14,618
how we know

16230
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:14,884
that we're

16240
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:16,486
experiencing an integrated

16250
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:17,420
generative model

16260
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,755
like the blind spot,

16270
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:19,422
the differences

16280
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,657
in visual acuity,

16290
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:22,125
in the peripheral vision, color

16300
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:23,827
vision in the periphery,

16310
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:25,161
ocular motorcycle aids,

16320
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:26,496
in the way that attention

16330
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:28,698
is suppressed ordering secreting

16340
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:30,567
so that it's not causing us nausea.

16350
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:32,669
FRIEDMAN: All these features are really important,

16360
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:36,172
and they point beyond a photon

16370
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:39,376
transmission view of vision into this

16380
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:42,579
generative stereophonic vision.

16390
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,248
And then in the audio setting,

16400
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,417
having multiple

16410
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,453
aural orifices

16420
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:53,456
and also even covering them up

16430
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,724
like they're still transduction

16440
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:58,828
through the skull and so on.

16450
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:01,264
We are also seeking to flesh out

16460
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:01,965
a generative

16470
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:05,168
model of sounds in our environments.

16480
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:08,605
FRIEDMAN: So if we cover our ears

16490
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:11,441
like that, proprioception

16500
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:13,143
will help us understand that

16510
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,978
even if something sounds kind of quiet,

16520
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:15,945
FRIEDMAN: we actually

16530
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:17,280
we can recognize that

16540
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,249
it's still a loud noise.

16550
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:22,519
Or if we have one ear in a pillow,

16560
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:24,621
we could recognize

16570
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:25,789
that something is happening,

16580
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:27,924
even though if it is being heard

16590
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:32,028
differently on both sides.

16600
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:34,864
So having multiple sensors

16610
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,402
is very compatible

16620
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:40,937
with a unified

16630
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:42,939
generative model experience

16640
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:44,574
because it forces

16650
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:46,409
one to abstract

16660
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:48,945
beyond any sensor reading.

16670
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:51,448
FRIEDMAN: If you have one midline thermometer,

16680
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:54,284
then that's your point.

16690
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:56,820
Estimate for temperature.

16700
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,055
Or you could have like a Gaussian blur.

16710
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:00,657
Like I'm just less

16720
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:02,425
confident about the temperature further

16730
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:04,561
from my one central sensor.

16740
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:05,829
But maybe I'm

16750
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:07,564
maybe it's a tight Gaussian,

16760
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:08,732
maybe it's very broad,

16770
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:10,233
but this is the best estimate.

16780
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:12,435
Why would I have any

16790
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:15,071
other estimate centered anywhere else

16800
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:17,741
when you have two thermometers?

16810
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:18,875
FRIEDMAN: Now, there's a generative

16820
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,143
modeling question

16830
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:21,010
about whether it's

16840
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:21,945
going to be a Gaussian

16850
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:22,946
with a peak in the middle

16860
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:23,980
or whether you're going to have a peak

16870
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,248
more on one side

16880
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:25,682
and have it

16890
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:26,649
just go through the other

16900
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:28,918
depending on those sensor readings.

16910
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:30,320
But at that point,

16920
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,522
you're ending up with some distributions

16930
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:35,191
which if we think of that distribution

16940
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:36,593
as like what is experienced,

16950
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:37,026
as like

16960
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:39,662
maybe the product of the sensing process

16970
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:42,665
that distributions enrichment

16980
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:45,468
is of a different type

16990
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,072
and yet of a different simplicity

17000
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:52,876
then any number of sensor readings

17010
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:54,911
in terms of what

17020
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:57,247
their raw information are.

17030
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:01,017
FRIEDMAN: So it seems very relevant this to ears,

17040
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:02,218
one mouth

17050
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:03,586
not just for listening

17060
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:04,988
twice as much as we speak,

17070
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:08,024
but for

17080
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:10,627
listening twice as actively as we speak

17090
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:17,033
or something like that.

17100
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:18,268
What do you think about sensors?

17110
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:18,902
TISON: Rami

17120
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:22,172
Yeah, I think that

17130
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:24,541
you you explained it well.

17140
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:26,576
It's

17150
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:29,179
yeah, I think it's useful,

17160
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:32,015
as you said, to have multiple sensory

17170
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:34,250
channels that can be active,

17180
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:37,253
because I think that's an argument

17190
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:40,457
from how we and it's in its book

17200
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,293
in 2013 book on predictive,

17210
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:44,494
predictive mind.

17220
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:47,197
I think he says that

17230
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:49,065
if you have a

17240
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:51,835
tribunal and you're

17250
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:53,837
trying to establish the

17260
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:58,741
culpability of the of a convict, you

17270
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:00,710
you hope that you have multiple

17280
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:03,179
independent sources of information,

17290
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:04,948
because if these sources of information

17300
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:06,749
are influenced each other,

17310
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:09,486
you have a less reliable

17320
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,288
I would say

17330
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,691
I forget the world

17340
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:17,260
at the moment in my years, unlikely

17350
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:18,495
in English.

17360
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,529
TISON: So I forget the word.

17370
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:22,432
But you have a less reliable and

17380
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:25,335
TISON: the information about

17390
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:28,638
the about the the

17400
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:30,306
the the case

17410
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:32,141
so like it's useful from

17420
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:35,078
from a reliability some point to to have

17430
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:36,813
multiple independent

17440
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:38,381
source of information

17450
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:40,984
so so that may be an expression of why

17460
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,753
we have that maybe an explanation of

17470
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:46,556
the relative modularity

17480
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:48,324
of of perception.

17490
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:49,158
TISON: So there are

17500
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:50,193
we know that there are

17510
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,594
limits to that modularity,

17520
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:52,328
but there is a

17530
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:54,631
certain degree of independence

17540
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:58,902
in the different sensory

17550
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:01,604
modalities that we have.

17560
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:03,840
So yes, about the two

17570
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:04,774
here is that obviously,

17580
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:06,809
I think maybe if we had

17590
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:10,647
if our auditory sensory system

17600
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:12,682
was only devised to

17610
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:14,384
communicative interaction, maybe to

17620
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,452
it would be okay to just have one here

17630
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:18,121
when because

17640
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:18,755
we could like

17650
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:20,523
we know who's talking to us.

17660
00:59:20,523 --> 00:59:22,659
TISON: And so we, we can direct our,

17670
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:25,361
our sensory

17680
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:27,931
apparatus to do this communicative

17690
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:30,266
signal.

17700
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:32,602
But because we use our ears

17710
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:34,170
not just to, to attuned

17720
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:35,738
to a communicative interaction,

17730
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,273
but also to know what's

17740
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:38,474
in our surrounding, it's

17750
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:39,943
really clearly more useful

17760
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:40,877
to have that

17770
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:43,546
to to have a greater reception

17780
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:44,681
from from information

17790
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:46,049
from anywhere around us.

17800
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:49,752
So I maybe if if addition was only about

17810
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:50,954
communication,

17820
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:52,755
it would be okay to have just one ear.

17830
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,123
TISON: But because we want to know

17840
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:56,225
as precisely what's happening there

17850
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,061
and at the same time know

17860
00:59:58,061 --> 00:59:58,861
what's happening there,

17870
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:00,563
maybe it's it's it's there.

17880
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:01,965
It has been more useful

17890
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:03,600
to have these two here

17900
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,301
two years on both sides.

17910
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:07,971
So maybe there's something about that.

17920
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:08,371
DEAN: That.

17930
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:09,505
FRIEDMAN: You have one short note

17940
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:10,440
and then Dean is

17950
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,741
there are also

17960
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:13,309
animals with anatomy

17970
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:15,278
so that they can direct to their ears,

17980
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,013
which is seemingly very analogous

17990
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:19,182
to the ocular motor skating.

18000
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:21,484
It's like an audio postcard

18010
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:23,786
and it just the human form

18020
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,054
outside of the ear wiggling,

18030
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:26,522
which is maybe slightly

18040
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:28,658
vestigial representation of that.

18050
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:32,128
But we have opted for a strategy

18060
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,930
with fixed ear positioning,

18070
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,231
but a mobile neck

18080
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:36,899
which also makes a cage.

18090
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:37,634
FRIEDMAN: So that's kind of our

18100
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:42,305
low speed audio skating team.

18110
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:44,941
DEAN: Yeah, I think the only advantage

18120
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:46,409
FRIEDMAN: I could see to having two models

18130
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:47,677
is that I could eat the French fries

18140
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:50,079
and drink milkshake at the same time.

18150
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:50,680
And I don't know what

18160
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,348
that would be like,

18170
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:54,550
just overpowering, but

18180
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:55,118
what I think is

18190
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:57,420
interesting is in the .2.1

18200
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,623
blue brought up the idea of, so

18210
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:02,191
how do we make sure that there's

18220
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:02,558
a difference

18230
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:04,627
between content and context?

18240
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:06,796
DEAN: And I think whether it's two eyes,

18250
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:09,632
two ears, two nostrils, whatever,

18260
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,869
there must be some advantage to the form

18270
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:14,370
because as I said

18280
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:17,573
even if you cover one of those intakes,

18290
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:20,643
it's not just a redundancy issue, it's

18300
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:22,011
a recursion issue.

18310
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:25,815
It creates that ability to see context

18320
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:29,285
here, context and smell context.

18330
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:30,053
I don't believe

18340
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:32,155
we would have those things.

18350
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:32,822
DEAN: And as I said,

18360
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:35,058
DEAN: I think I'd get overwhelmed with context

18370
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:36,459
and having both French

18380
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:37,694
fries and milkshake,

18390
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:39,996
it would just blow me up.

18400
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:43,466
So but that that's just a statement

18410
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,601
that says it's not self.

18420
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:47,437
They do not give people to models.

18430
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:48,905
It can be overpowering.

18440
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:49,338
TISON: Well.

18450
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:51,574
FRIEDMAN: One aspect might return us

18460
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:55,144
to the question of composition analogy.

18470
01:01:56,412 --> 01:01:58,881
It seems like visual

18480
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:01,350
composition and temporal composition

18490
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:04,754
in music and in heard speech

18500
01:02:05,988 --> 01:02:07,256
as

18510
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:09,692
speaking

18520
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:12,295
in terms of generative models

18530
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:14,931
have highly factor, sizable

18540
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:17,400
or sparsely connected generative models

18550
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:20,303
famously connected to like the where

18560
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:20,636
and the

18570
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:24,073
what streams in visual neuroanatomy.

18580
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:24,874
And that's been explored

18590
01:02:24,874 --> 01:02:26,776
in some active inference papers

18600
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:29,612
with awareness and whiteness as being

18610
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:32,281
factor visible in the generative model

18620
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:33,850
because it really is the case

18630
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:35,918
that different layers

18640
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,620
can host different. What's.

18650
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:39,122
And so it makes sense to have

18660
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:40,323
those two totally separate

18670
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:42,759
taste and

18680
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,094
smell which are

18690
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:48,898
there are more midline,

18700
01:02:48,898 --> 01:02:50,433
though there are two nostrils.

18710
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,768
I'm not totally sure on

18720
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:52,602
whether there's like, you know,

18730
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,805
one or two smell chambers or anything

18740
01:02:55,805 --> 01:03:00,243
composition of chemical bouquets

18750
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:03,379
seems quite different,

18760
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:04,680
like two paintings

18770
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,749
that you like next to each other

18780
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:09,051
or to songs in succession

18790
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:12,155
that you like.

18800
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:15,725
FRIEDMAN: Or it's a little bit different than to

18810
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,995
smells or tastes sequentially

18820
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:23,132
or composed.

18830
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:26,169
And so maybe these more

18840
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:28,337
sometimes called basil, sensory

18850
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:31,140
or cognitive features

18860
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,143
are less affable.

18870
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:38,281
And this kind of relates to a cognitive

18880
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:40,750
stack

18890
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,386
where verbal

18900
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:45,855
and symbolic communication is

18910
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:49,992
like the tip of the iceberg.

18920
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:52,562
Support it by

18930
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:54,063
biological processes

18940
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:56,899
that are differently or less affable

18950
01:03:57,733 --> 01:04:00,069
and at first only pointed towards

18960
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:01,637
like through metaphors and speech,

18970
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:05,041
butterflies in my stomach and so on,

18980
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:05,341
but then

18990
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:08,211
ultimately entirely inexpressible,

19000
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:11,080
maybe with some stop in between,

19010
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,215
like being able to express

19020
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:13,683
through the body,

19030
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:14,050
like what

19040
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:16,319
it's like to do a certain

19050
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,154
bodily position

19060
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:19,522
or have a certain experience

19070
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:23,492
or be in a certain physiological state.

19080
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:25,094
FRIEDMAN: And

19090
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:26,729
this kind of casts

19100
01:04:26,729 --> 01:04:28,831
a light on the transmission view,

19110
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:32,101
complementing the ecological view,

19120
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:34,170
the transmission view

19130
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,572
is like down, propagating

19140
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:39,709
symbolic communication

19150
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,077
and seeking for that

19160
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:43,713
to apply all the way on down.

19170
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:47,550
Whereas a more bottom up and arguably

19180
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:50,720
eco evo devo informed perspective

19190
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:56,292
is grounded in the ecological setting

19200
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:59,195
and then allows for

19210
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:00,930
the crystallization

19220
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:03,232
of symbolic processes,

19230
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,835
including communicated

19240
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:08,104
symbolic processes which

19250
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:08,771
are aren't

19260
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:10,039
they supposed to be the stronghold

19270
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:11,807
of the transmission view?

19280
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:16,746
FRIEDMAN: But then if even that phenomena

19290
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:18,080
can be

19300
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:21,450
captured within an ecological frame,

19310
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:24,387
then there's an extremely strong basis

19320
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:27,623
for the integrative cohesion

19330
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:30,760
of an ecological view, as opposed to

19340
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,196
an extremely piecemeal and

19350
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:38,067
question begging transmission view

19360
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:40,770
like we talked about.

19370
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:41,604
So meiosis

19380
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:44,373
and biosimilars, this in live stream 47.

19390
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:49,211
So will we see

19400
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:51,547
verb verbal communication and behavior

19410
01:05:52,381 --> 01:05:54,450
as something that is enabled

19420
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:55,418
and with analogy,

19430
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:57,453
but not the same as

19440
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:59,322
cellular transduction?

19450
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:00,256
FRIEDMAN: Or are we going to seek

19460
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:02,491
a cellular transduction explanation

19470
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:10,232
based on verbal behavior?

19480
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:14,637
Let's return to some of our topics.

19490
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,006
All right. Few areas to go blue.

19500
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:17,540
Any thoughts?

19510
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:20,743
Just any way you want.

19520
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:21,077
KNIGHT: Yeah.

19530
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:22,178
So I just wanted to follow up

19540
01:06:22,178 --> 01:06:23,813
on what you said.

19550
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,014
And I just think that the beauty

19560
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:26,916
of the ecological approach

19570
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:28,951
to understanding communication

19580
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:32,755
is that communication between cells, bit

19590
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:34,790
semiotic representation or other,

19600
01:06:35,091 --> 01:06:35,825
and between

19610
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:36,692
animals, maybe

19620
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:38,761
with gestures, maybe interspecies

19630
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:39,962
communication like, you know,

19640
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:40,663
you tell your cat,

19650
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:41,130
come here

19660
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,799
and the cat comes or dog or whatever.

19670
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,901
KNIGHT: So I think that that the ability

19680
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:48,170
to model systems

19690
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:52,808
like our systems is very important.

19700
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:53,876
Like if,

19710
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:55,144
if the transmission view

19720
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:57,146
is not capable of representing

19730
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:58,814
all of the situations

19740
01:06:58,814 --> 01:06:59,582
from cell

19750
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:01,017
to cell communication

19760
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,519
to human to dog communication, and,

19770
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:05,788
and all along the line,

19780
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:10,993
I think that maybe it's in the way

19790
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:11,527
that the

19800
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:12,728
ACP inactive in France

19810
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:15,765
is still free and slick doesn't have.

19820
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:16,832
But I mean

19830
01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:17,867
KNIGHT: it's across

19840
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,036
any hierarchical temporal

19850
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,904
cognitive scale.

19860
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:23,239
I think that that the way

19870
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:24,473
that we view communication

19880
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:32,882
also needs to be broadly applicable.

19890
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:33,516
FRIEDMAN: Yes, really.

19900
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:36,719
TISON: So yeah, that's that's the aim.

19910
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:39,622
But clearly

19920
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:42,558
some people will say that

19930
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:44,860
sophisticated linguistic communication

19940
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:48,330
can thus be accounted for in terms of

19950
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:49,865
in terms

19960
01:07:49,865 --> 01:07:50,399
of the

19970
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,535
ecological communication, because,

19980
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:54,403
as Daniel said,

19990
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:56,572
the symbolic communication

20000
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,040
characteristic of language

20010
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,242
seems to be too removed

20020
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:02,211
from the kind of basic interaction

20030
01:08:02,211 --> 01:08:04,013
described by the ecological approach.

20040
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:07,016
So there's this like

20050
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:08,851
there's a lot of work to be done

20060
01:08:08,851 --> 01:08:11,620
still to to really explain these

20070
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,489
the high level

20080
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:14,557
linguistic interactions

20090
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:15,591
that we have in our

20100
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:18,194
in terms of the, of the ecological

20110
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:19,895
in active communication.

20120
01:08:19,895 --> 01:08:22,131
TISON: But yeah, there's another example of,

20130
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:24,967
of communication,

20140
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:25,668
as you

20150
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:28,304
said, we can I come to me before a

20160
01:08:29,472 --> 01:08:31,440
communicative interaction between cells

20170
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,675
but there's also

20180
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:33,642
there's been the work

20190
01:08:33,642 --> 01:08:36,312
on communication between between plants

20200
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:38,247
and how plants

20210
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:39,949
perceive their their environment

20220
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:41,750
in terms of affordances.

20230
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:42,985
And there's been work on that.

20240
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:43,652
And so

20250
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:44,520
I think that

20260
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,821
there's it's just to say

20270
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:47,623
that there's a it's another

20280
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,792
and another way in which we can develop

20290
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,560
the ecological approach.

20300
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,395
TISON: And it seems that

20310
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:56,532
that if we yeah.

20320
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:59,335
TISON: If any, any,

20330
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:01,504
any organisms, that organism

20340
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:02,505
that behaves in

20350
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:03,339
the organism

20360
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:04,206
will have a field

20370
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:06,809
of that far dense and it seems that if

20380
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:11,580
it wants to act on other organisms

20390
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:12,481
in its environment,

20400
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:13,916
it will act

20410
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:16,752
in affecting its field about audience.

20420
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:19,355
And it looks like

20430
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:20,422
the kind of communication

20440
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:21,190
that is at play

20450
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:22,892
between trees, for instance,

20460
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:25,895
which alerts each other about,

20470
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:26,595
for instance,

20480
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:29,365
the threats in the, in the forest

20490
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:33,502
or sources of, of useful resources

20500
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:34,904
in the, in the drone.

20510
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:37,072
TISON: So these kinds of modifications of

20520
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:41,810
of of of the yeah,

20530
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,947
I don't know exactly the mechanism

20540
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:48,350
by which these the these these

20550
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,486
these communication take place,

20560
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:52,054
but we can also see them

20570
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:53,255
as modifications

20580
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:54,924
of the field of affordances, of trees.

20590
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:56,425
So I think that that was

20600
01:09:56,425 --> 01:09:58,460
when I saw that I was really

20610
01:09:58,460 --> 01:09:59,495
I thought it was really cool

20620
01:09:59,495 --> 01:10:00,429
that the trees

20630
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:02,765
behaved at a really, really slower

20640
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:04,833
timescale, obviously, but like behavior

20650
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:08,270
when they go in the sand, like their

20660
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:09,972
their roots in certain directions

20670
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:11,106
and things like that,

20680
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:12,942
we can see it as them

20690
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:15,411
exploring their environment, them

20700
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:17,479
reacting to a field of avoidance that

20710
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:18,781
TISON: that they.

20720
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:19,615
TISON: So obviously that

20730
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:21,183
that's also

20740
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,918
controversial because there's

20750
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:23,752
all this debate

20760
01:10:23,752 --> 01:10:26,755
about the cognitive states of of plants

20770
01:10:26,755 --> 01:10:29,959
and do they have a consciousness

20780
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:30,626
or a left thing.

20790
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:32,228
But I think that we can see that

20800
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,128
they probably have

20810
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:35,431
something like a field of us audience

20820
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:36,599
and it seems that they can

20830
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:40,002
communicate with each other

20840
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:41,303
via these modifications

20850
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:42,238
of their field of avoidance

20860
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:43,172
without us

20870
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:43,872
having to say

20880
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:45,674
that they are transmitting content,

20890
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:47,443
which would be really weird

20900
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:51,981
from the standpoint of a plant.

20910
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:53,349
FRIEDMAN: Thank you. Blue.

20920
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:56,552
So just like if you haven't

20930
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:58,988
seen the plant robot created by the MIT

20940
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:00,322
Media Lab, like,

20950
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:01,390
FRIEDMAN: check it out

20960
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:02,358
because the plant, like,

20970
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:03,125
they connected it

20980
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:05,094
to a set of wheels and a motor

20990
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:07,029
and literally will wheel itself

21000
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:08,998
back and forth from window to window,

21010
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:10,432
like searching for sunlight.

21020
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:11,233
So So, I mean,

21030
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:12,001
when you modify

21040
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:13,102
the field of affordances

21050
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:13,802
of a plant,

21060
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:14,236
it will

21070
01:11:14,236 --> 01:11:15,704
it will take advantage of

21080
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:17,139
this affordances

21090
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:20,075
for movement or any other kind of thing.

21100
01:11:20,075 --> 01:11:22,911
KNIGHT: And as to the complexity of

21110
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:26,582
like linguistic communication, okay.

21120
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:29,385
But like also like the complexity

21130
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:32,154
of cellular communication, especially in

21140
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:34,023
like developmental biology

21150
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:35,457
and all of the growth factors,

21160
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:36,325
signaling cues.

21170
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:38,460
And I mean it's highly complex

21180
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,228
and like the re

21190
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:40,763
combinatorial aspect

21200
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:42,464
is also incredibly crazy.

21210
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:44,133
Like I think

21220
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:45,901
it would take a lot to convince me

21230
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:47,336
that linguistic communication

21240
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:50,239
is more sophisticated or more advanced

21250
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:52,574
than biological communication

21260
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:54,310
in a developing organism.

21270
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,146
KNIGHT: I'm not sold on that.

21280
01:11:58,013 --> 01:11:58,547
Thanks, Steve.

21290
01:12:00,382 --> 01:12:01,216
DEAN: We're making it.

21300
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:01,517
And you

21310
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:02,751
help me understand a little bit

21320
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:04,620
more about the

21330
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:09,258
the influence piece in the joint action.

21340
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:11,527
If if I'm in Madrid,

21350
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:13,962
a lot of people

21360
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:15,798
who are trying to get my attention,

21370
01:12:15,798 --> 01:12:17,800
I'm not very I'm not

21380
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,568
I don't speak Spanish very well,

21390
01:12:19,568 --> 01:12:21,303
just barely get by.

21400
01:12:21,303 --> 01:12:22,705
And so a lot of times

21410
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:25,908
things are spoken to me and there is a

21420
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,109
there seems to be a break

21430
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:29,578
in terms of the amount of sensing I get.

21440
01:12:30,112 --> 01:12:32,881
DEAN: And so that joint action could you maybe

21450
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:33,882
especially in the

21460
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:36,218
in the light of that earlier

21470
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:39,221
part where you talked about young kids,

21480
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:40,055
they think

21490
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:40,723
it appears

21500
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:42,658
they're talking to themselves,

21510
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:44,693
but they're talking to the world

21520
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:45,194
and maybe

21530
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:47,229
they're not influencing the world,

21540
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:48,697
but they would like to.

21550
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:50,265
Could you maybe talk about that

21560
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:51,300
sort of sensing side

21570
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:52,401
of that joint action?

21580
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:53,836
TISON: Yeah.

21590
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:55,771
TISON: So I think that what

21600
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:58,374
kids that alone are doing they're nuts.

21610
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:00,943
TISON: They learn to talk by talking

21620
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:01,510
to each other

21630
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,212
and affecting other persons.

21640
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,012
But when they learn

21650
01:13:04,012 --> 01:13:05,647
to talk to each other, they're doing

21660
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:07,950
they're they're influencing themselves.

21670
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:08,450
I think that

21680
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:10,319
that's the part about self cueing.

21690
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:11,887
So what they're doing, they're,

21700
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:13,155
they're modifying their own

21710
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:14,223
field of affordances

21720
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,291
with their, with their

21730
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:17,693
this inner speech

21740
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:19,094
and that's how they the

21750
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:20,496
they they don't to self cue

21760
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:22,197
and self-regulate themselves

21770
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:24,433
by bringing some

21780
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:27,035
some images in mind or things like that.

21790
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:28,337
TISON: So that's the

21800
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:30,439
I think that's what happens when the

21810
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:33,075
when the child

21820
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:35,310
learns to do to speak alone.

21830
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:37,146
And there's obviously

21840
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:39,448
a lot more to say about that

21850
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:40,916
when there's.

21860
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:41,850
So the question

21870
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:45,621
of of the of different languages

21880
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:47,623
when you're in another country

21890
01:13:47,623 --> 01:13:51,193
and you don't so you're spoken to

21900
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:54,863
and you're not understanding correctly.

21910
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:55,297
But you

21920
01:13:55,297 --> 01:13:56,565
you pick up some

21930
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:58,600
some parts of what's said.

21940
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:01,136
TISON: So I think that, um,

21950
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:03,305
I think that

21960
01:14:03,305 --> 01:14:05,340
the, the learning of a language

21970
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:07,409
is, often,

21980
01:14:07,509 --> 01:14:12,247
is often understood as the, the, the,

21990
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:15,851
as the, as the learning a code.

22000
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:16,652
So learning

22010
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:19,755
a set of associations between

22020
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:20,622
between

22030
01:14:21,657 --> 01:14:24,159
meanings and between forms

22040
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:27,763
that can be either written or spoken.

22050
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:29,798
But I think that in the

22060
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:31,633
the approach that we're

22070
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:33,569
we had been seeing here,

22080
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:34,002
learning

22090
01:14:34,002 --> 01:14:35,337
the language is really more like

22100
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:36,972
learning, learning a skill.

22110
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:38,340
TISON: So you learn you're learning to

22120
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:39,174
to speak

22130
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:39,708
and learning

22140
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:40,676
to understand

22150
01:14:40,676 --> 01:14:41,910
and interact correctly

22160
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:43,145
in a given language

22170
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,813
as you're learning to do

22180
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:45,781
anything else,

22190
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:47,683
TISON: you're learning to play a game,

22200
01:14:47,683 --> 01:14:49,618
you're learning to play hockey.

22210
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:52,654
So our play soccer or whatever is the

22220
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,089
the same kind of learning

22230
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:55,624
and you're learning to interact

22240
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:57,626
in that kind of game.

22250
01:14:57,626 --> 01:15:00,362
And probably there's a similarity

22260
01:15:00,362 --> 01:15:02,130
between various languages

22270
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:04,766
and the because it's

22280
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:07,436
there's, there's a similarity

22290
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:08,403
and there's

22300
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:11,607
like like very

22310
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:12,140
I would

22320
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:13,709
I could talk about Gideon Stein there

22330
01:15:13,709 --> 01:15:14,643
once, once again.

22340
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:15,244
TISON: But like

22350
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:17,779
there's this the various languages

22360
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:20,115
resemble each other

22370
01:15:20,115 --> 01:15:21,250
TISON: because they have this

22380
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,151
this family resemblance.

22390
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:24,152
So because you have

22400
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:25,254
this familiarity

22410
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:27,356
with speaking in a language,

22420
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,991
even when you're

22430
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:29,925
in another place

22440
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:31,426
where don't understand the language,

22450
01:15:31,426 --> 01:15:32,661
you have a basic grasp

22460
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:34,563
of some of the structures of the game

22470
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:35,564
that is being played.

22480
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:38,467
And so from that context, you can get

22490
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,036
understand some of the things that are

22500
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,304
said, understand, understand

22510
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:43,505
some of the things that are

22520
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:45,173
expected of you

22530
01:15:45,173 --> 01:15:46,575
because you have this grasp

22540
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:48,777
of what kind of game is played.

22550
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:50,212
TISON: When we speak our language.

22560
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:52,648
And so even if you're in in them

22570
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,383
in another country,

22580
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,817
when you don't speak the language

22590
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:57,653
TISON: from the context

22600
01:15:57,653 --> 01:15:59,154
in which you find yourself,

22610
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:00,022
you may be able

22620
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:01,924
put some things together.

22630
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:03,959
Obviously, if you're like

22640
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:05,193
just in a place

22650
01:16:05,193 --> 01:16:06,595
with absolutely no context,

22660
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:09,698
you're in a white room completely empty

22670
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:10,933
and somebody is talking to you.

22680
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:11,633
TISON: You have no context.

22690
01:16:11,633 --> 01:16:13,368
Probably you won't understand anything.

22700
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:15,237
But if you're in that context

22710
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:16,905
where you can understand

22720
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:19,274
that in some games of of

22730
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:19,942
there are some,

22740
01:16:19,942 --> 01:16:23,011
TISON: some goals that are that are in place

22750
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:24,112
and some people around

22760
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:26,148
you are trying to achieve some goal.

22770
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:28,016
You can apply your understanding

22780
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:28,550
of the game

22790
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:30,152
that you play your own language

22800
01:16:30,152 --> 01:16:31,119
through this new language.

22810
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:33,155
TISON: And so you can get some things

22820
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,123
you can understand some things about

22830
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:36,024
what's what's

22840
01:16:36,024 --> 01:16:37,025
what you have to do

22850
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:38,727
and how you should behave

22860
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:40,095
and how you can respond.

22870
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:42,397
But I think that that's a better way

22880
01:16:42,397 --> 01:16:43,265
of understanding

22890
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:44,733
the kind of limited

22900
01:16:44,733 --> 01:16:46,535
understanding that you have

22910
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:48,870
in these kind of interactions

22920
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:50,138
rather than in

22930
01:16:50,138 --> 01:16:52,441
you having a code of your language.

22940
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:53,942
TISON: And then you try to apply this code

22950
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:56,345
in this you I think that that then

22960
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:58,480
TISON: the idea of learning a skill, learning

22970
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:01,016
how to play a game is a better analogy

22980
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:02,384
to understanding

22990
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:04,052
how you come to learn a language

23000
01:17:04,052 --> 01:17:05,821
and how you come to apply this,

23010
01:17:05,821 --> 01:17:07,089
this knowledge

23020
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:09,091
in other contexts where the language

23030
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,360
that is spoken is not the same that you

23040
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,594
that you're mastering.

23050
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:13,862
DEAN: Does that kind of confirm that

23060
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:15,697
it couldn't be content first,

23070
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:18,000
that it would have to

23080
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,838
DEAN: be context bound?

23090
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:24,873
TISON: Yeah, in my view,

23100
01:17:24,873 --> 01:17:29,578
the context is a central element in

23110
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:33,482
in in any communicative interaction

23120
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:34,816
and in any cooperative

23130
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:35,884
communicative interaction.

23140
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:38,186
I think it's the it in the context

23150
01:17:38,453 --> 01:17:38,920
what the what

23160
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:41,189
I call the context in the paper appears

23170
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:43,025
as a shared field of audience.

23180
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:44,192
So that's

23190
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:44,760
the audience

23200
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:47,963
that are present in the, in the, in the,

23210
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:50,265
the environmental context

23220
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:51,433
in which you find yourself in

23230
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:52,734
with the other person.

23240
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:54,836
TISON: And that's that's

23250
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:57,472
just an element that often exists.

23260
01:17:57,472 --> 01:17:59,141
The communicative interaction

23270
01:17:59,141 --> 01:18:00,242
TISON: is a great,

23280
01:18:00,242 --> 01:18:01,843
great source of constraint

23290
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:04,179
on the communicative interaction.

23300
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:04,880
So yeah,

23310
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:05,180
when you,

23320
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,716
when you come to speak with somebody,

23330
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:09,117
you're almost

23340
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:13,121
never like in a absolutely free place.

23350
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:13,855
You're always

23360
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:15,724
in a restaurant in there,

23370
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:18,060
in, I don't know, in the bus, in the

23380
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:20,262
in the in the grocery store.

23390
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:21,530
TISON: You're somewhere

23400
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,732
there's this basic set of affordances

23410
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:25,200
that are shared that you understand

23420
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,368
that you can do this,

23430
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:27,302
you cannot do that.

23440
01:18:27,302 --> 01:18:29,671
And this this set of constraints

23450
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:31,973
offered by this charge feel about

23460
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:32,841
really drives

23470
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:33,642
and constrains

23480
01:18:33,642 --> 01:18:35,811
how the communicative interaction

23490
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:36,978
will unfold.

23500
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:37,345
So

23510
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:38,647
I think that even

23520
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:40,248
if you're in another country,

23530
01:18:40,248 --> 01:18:41,349
a friend,

23540
01:18:41,349 --> 01:18:43,118
the context will be hard to pick up.

23550
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:44,219
TISON: But sometimes

23560
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:45,787
TISON: there will be shared context

23570
01:18:45,787 --> 01:18:48,123
that you can get a grasp on

23580
01:18:48,123 --> 01:18:48,990
and that you can

23590
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:50,559
that can.

23600
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:53,562
So that can lead to a

23610
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:57,766
I'm sorry, I'm losing my words

23620
01:18:57,766 --> 01:19:00,268
that can lead to an interaction that is

23630
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:04,539
that is optimal.

23640
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:05,474
FRIEDMAN: I brought it

23650
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:08,443
in the physical Rosetta Stone

23660
01:19:09,211 --> 01:19:11,780
as a special case of of low

23670
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:14,282
context asynchronous communication.

23680
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:16,151
One can imagine

23690
01:19:16,151 --> 01:19:17,919
there would be a million

23700
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:19,588
different contexts

23710
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:22,958
by which the analysis of the stone

23720
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:23,358
could have

23730
01:19:23,358 --> 01:19:26,161
accelerated, such as a person reading

23740
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:27,429
any of them,

23750
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:30,632
the rules or descriptions being enacted,

23760
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:32,501
or a labeled image,

23770
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:33,235
or any

23780
01:19:33,235 --> 01:19:34,469
number of contexts

23790
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:36,905
that we would use to interpret

23800
01:19:37,339 --> 01:19:39,407
and act upon the texts that we read

23810
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:41,543
in this setting

23820
01:19:41,543 --> 01:19:41,910
where

23830
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:43,812
we were historically removed

23840
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:45,714
from the creation.

23850
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:47,015
FRIEDMAN: Then there's still

23860
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:48,784
was residual context,

23870
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,852
and it turned out that that was enough

23880
01:19:50,986 --> 01:19:54,156
to interpret the symbolic

23890
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:57,259
materials.

23900
01:19:57,325 --> 01:19:58,226
But this

23910
01:19:58,226 --> 01:20:02,063
is not like the base communication case

23920
01:20:02,564 --> 01:20:03,098
that we

23930
01:20:03,098 --> 01:20:05,333
then need to see all communication

23940
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:06,134
and all learning

23950
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:07,636
and education of languages

23960
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:08,136
and active

23970
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:09,838
inference ontology

23980
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:12,240
as being like a Rosetta Stone,

23990
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:13,909
like the definitions of words

24000
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:16,244
are not codes to crack.

24010
01:20:17,012 --> 01:20:19,381
They're like inside jokes

24020
01:20:19,915 --> 01:20:22,784
or ways of communicating a sports team

24030
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:24,219
that have to do

24040
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:26,888
with the context of the setting and

24050
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:30,625
asynchronous

24060
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,961
modifications in the environments,

24070
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:35,430
especially symbolic asynchronous

24080
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:38,567
modifications which are relatively new,

24090
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:42,237
potentially existing in their

24100
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:44,539
modern form for several hundreds

24110
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:46,241
to several thousands of years,

24120
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:47,843
depending on how we think about it.

24130
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:50,245
Symbolic, asynchronous modification

24140
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:54,883
is a low context communication,

24150
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:59,221
whereas even the interpretations

24160
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:01,923
of asynchronous symbolic communication

24170
01:21:03,058 --> 01:21:04,893
still uses and embodies

24180
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:06,962
their context in the perception.

24190
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:07,929
FRIEDMAN: So we know that we have

24200
01:21:07,929 --> 01:21:09,564
stereophonic communication

24210
01:21:09,564 --> 01:21:12,000
just because stereophonic,

24220
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,268
even if we are getting

24230
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:17,439
just a morse code symbol.

24240
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:17,772
But

24250
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:20,909
it is a

24260
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:23,111
non-controversial here.

24270
01:21:23,111 --> 01:21:24,646
But interestingly,

24280
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:26,581
it sounds like elsewhere

24290
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:27,983
that we would want to think

24300
01:21:27,983 --> 01:21:30,252
about communication broadly

24310
01:21:30,819 --> 01:21:33,488
as being action oriented and embedded

24320
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:36,191
rather than

24330
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:38,226
kind of like reverse engineered

24340
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,428
from the kinds of artifacts

24350
01:21:40,428 --> 01:21:41,596
that we have today

24360
01:21:41,596 --> 01:21:43,665
with quite literally computer codes

24370
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:47,636
and other kinds of, you know,

24380
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:53,475
Turing computers and so on.

24390
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:54,075
FRIEDMAN: Okay.

24400
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:58,313
TISON: I think that too often they explain

24410
01:21:58,313 --> 01:21:59,915
the idea is that

24420
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:01,149
the ideas that I'm trying

24430
01:22:01,149 --> 01:22:03,385
convey really better than me

24440
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:04,719
then, you know,

24450
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:07,122
I'm not really fluent in English though.

24460
01:22:07,822 --> 01:22:09,624
Thank you for explaining better than me

24470
01:22:09,624 --> 01:22:12,727
the idea that I'm trying to say

24480
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:13,828
thank you.

24490
01:22:13,995 --> 01:22:14,729
I appreciate it.

24500
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:17,365
FRIEDMAN: And you wrote the paper.

24510
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:21,069
And so it's unsurprising, it seems novel

24520
01:22:21,469 --> 01:22:23,471
and I couldn't say it in any other way.

24530
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:25,173
KNIGHT: Even when you

24540
01:22:25,173 --> 01:22:26,107
speak English,

24550
01:22:26,107 --> 01:22:28,843
Daniel can still like better than than

24560
01:22:28,843 --> 01:22:30,312
you mean it more effectively.

24570
01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:32,013
The idea is that you're trying to convey

24580
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:32,881
even when English

24590
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:34,316
is your first language.

24600
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:35,750
DEAN: Well.

24610
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:38,253
FRIEDMAN: Context is non-fungible.

24620
01:22:38,253 --> 01:22:41,256
So I don't think that there can be

24630
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:45,393
FRIEDMAN: a best or a final communication.

24640
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:46,728
It's just like a best

24650
01:22:46,728 --> 01:22:47,796
or a final species

24660
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:50,465
or state for an ecosystem to be in.

24670
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:53,168
And I guess in the last

24680
01:22:53,168 --> 01:22:58,306
25 minutes or however,

24690
01:22:58,306 --> 01:22:59,941
now that our ecosystem

24700
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:04,512
has been modified,

24710
01:23:04,512 --> 01:23:06,481
however it has been

24720
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:07,682
in these conversations

24730
01:23:07,682 --> 01:23:09,484
and through reading and

24740
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:11,886
opening up threads,

24750
01:23:12,053 --> 01:23:13,254
how will it

24760
01:23:14,022 --> 01:23:17,225
shape our field of affordances

24770
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:19,260
and how will we

24780
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:23,565
stream and play differently in.

24790
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:26,601
DEAN: So I'm curious from all three of you

24800
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:31,072
as a strategy,

24810
01:23:31,072 --> 01:23:32,674
if you want to get past monologue,

24820
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:33,375
what do you do?

24830
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:36,945
How many times do you play play in play?

24840
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:38,980
So as an example of like a

24850
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:40,849
real pertinent one, right now

24860
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,451
the way that the livestreams

24870
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:44,252
have been set up,

24880
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:46,821
I've always been sort of a pre brief,

24890
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:50,825
an introduction with the authors or play

24900
01:23:51,259 --> 01:23:55,397
and then a play, a debrief used to this.

24910
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:57,766
DEAN: And so the communication is never left

24920
01:23:57,766 --> 01:24:01,503
as a, as a one off exercise.

24930
01:24:01,503 --> 01:24:02,737
DEAN: I just read the paper.

24940
01:24:02,737 --> 01:24:03,738
There's a, there's,

24950
01:24:03,738 --> 01:24:06,975
there is affordances set up to interact

24960
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:08,877
with information

24970
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:11,880
to be able to receive it

24980
01:24:11,913 --> 01:24:13,915
at multiple different time points.

24990
01:24:13,915 --> 01:24:15,550
Because I think in the one room

25000
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:16,684
you said we could look at it

25010
01:24:16,684 --> 01:24:18,386
as slices of time,

25020
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:20,221
but that's probably not

25030
01:24:20,221 --> 01:24:22,690
accurate in terms of the dynamic

25040
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:23,658
that's in place.

25050
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:24,559
DEAN: So

25060
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:26,227
one of the things

25070
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:26,694
the Active

25080
01:24:26,694 --> 01:24:30,165
Insurance Institute also does is has a

25090
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:32,100
textbook group.

25100
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:33,234
Now, I've not been

25110
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:34,736
part of the text group, book group,

25120
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:36,805
and I don't know whether they do it in

25130
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:38,239
sets of three as well

25140
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,608
to create that kind of triangulation

25150
01:24:40,608 --> 01:24:41,976
so that the interactions

25160
01:24:41,976 --> 01:24:44,879
of the communication doesn't become

25170
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:49,084
monolithic or monastic

25180
01:24:49,717 --> 01:24:50,885
or here,

25190
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:51,619
here's here

25200
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:52,287
is the words

25210
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:54,589
that have come down now off the mount.

25220
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:56,558
DEAN: Accept them and start

25230
01:24:56,558 --> 01:24:57,559
start carrying them out.

25240
01:24:57,559 --> 01:24:58,560
Even though you don't have

25250
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,662
a context, right?

25260
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:02,764
Chiseling them into the stone

25270
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:04,933
doesn't increase their priority,

25280
01:25:05,133 --> 01:25:06,801
at least if you don't have the context.

25290
01:25:06,801 --> 01:25:09,037
So what I'm curious about from

25300
01:25:09,037 --> 01:25:10,271
the three of you is

25310
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:11,673
if you want to get past

25320
01:25:11,673 --> 01:25:13,374
instructional ism in terms

25330
01:25:13,374 --> 01:25:15,376
or if you want to get past transmission,

25340
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:18,813
is there a basic requirement

25350
01:25:19,214 --> 01:25:22,417
to have multiple reinterpretations

25360
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:24,252
or at least the opportunity

25370
01:25:24,252 --> 01:25:25,353
to reinterpret,

25380
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:26,321
like just

25390
01:25:26,321 --> 01:25:28,556
from a communication standpoint,

25400
01:25:28,556 --> 01:25:31,593
do we must we have reflection

25410
01:25:35,096 --> 01:25:36,030
and time for that.

25420
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:37,932
DEAN: We have to have time built in for that.

25430
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:41,069
Or are we are we then bound to

25440
01:25:41,102 --> 01:25:42,770
a transmit state on

25450
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,242
anybody can answer.

25460
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:47,675
FRIEDMAN: Yes.

25470
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:50,712
FRIEDMAN: Bloopers.

25480
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:52,013
KNIGHT: So it's not

25490
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:55,517
like in the way that we have reflection

25500
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:56,784
like we have a pre brief

25510
01:25:56,784 --> 01:25:58,353
and then to the actual brief

25520
01:25:58,353 --> 01:25:58,753
and then

25530
01:25:58,753 --> 01:25:59,254
and then

25540
01:25:59,254 --> 01:26:00,221
the reflection

25550
01:26:00,221 --> 01:26:02,390
time in the livestream series.

25560
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:04,559
So, so not in that way

25570
01:26:04,559 --> 01:26:07,829
but but I do think that in this

25580
01:26:08,062 --> 01:26:10,365
in effective communication

25590
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:12,901
is like reflection

25600
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:15,370
as an essential component of that,

25610
01:26:15,803 --> 01:26:17,038
like communication

25620
01:26:17,038 --> 01:26:18,940
when you have a conversation,

25630
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:21,342
it's shouldn't be about

25640
01:26:21,342 --> 01:26:23,711
just waiting for your turn to talk.

25650
01:26:23,711 --> 01:26:26,181
KNIGHT: I mean, there should be some reflection

25660
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:26,447
of what

25670
01:26:26,447 --> 01:26:28,316
the other person is saying

25680
01:26:28,316 --> 01:26:30,485
in what you're saying back to them.

25690
01:26:30,485 --> 01:26:31,286
KNIGHT: It's like,

25700
01:26:31,486 --> 01:26:33,121
Hello, how are you doing today?

25710
01:26:33,121 --> 01:26:34,289
I want scrambled eggs.

25720
01:26:34,289 --> 01:26:36,591
Like if that was the conversation went,

25730
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:39,360
it wouldn't be it wouldn't work, right?

25740
01:26:39,661 --> 01:26:40,295
So there

25750
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:42,230
to be some element of reflecting back

25760
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:44,432
what the other person is saying to you

25770
01:26:44,432 --> 01:26:46,367
in communication that's effective.

25780
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:49,037
KNIGHT: It's not just this like Tower of

25790
01:26:49,604 --> 01:26:54,008
KNIGHT: disjointed blocks being built.

25800
01:26:54,008 --> 01:26:54,676
FRIEDMAN: Yes. For me.

25810
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:55,910
TISON: Yeah.

25820
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:56,578
TISON: I think

25830
01:26:56,744 --> 01:26:57,712
I think that

25840
01:26:57,812 --> 01:26:59,881
what you said is is interesting,

25850
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:02,217
a really important element

25860
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:04,419
TISON: of cooperative communication

25870
01:27:04,419 --> 01:27:07,222
is that when you're talking to somebody,

25880
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:08,489
when you're in the dialog,

25890
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:08,957
you have

25900
01:27:08,957 --> 01:27:11,192
to concede a part of your autonomy.

25910
01:27:11,492 --> 01:27:12,927
You have to

25920
01:27:12,927 --> 01:27:14,762
accept to be regulated

25930
01:27:14,762 --> 01:27:15,797
by the other person.

25940
01:27:15,797 --> 01:27:17,732
And that's, I think,

25950
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:19,934
where some people who like

25960
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:21,202
to talk past each other

25970
01:27:21,202 --> 01:27:22,437
and don't listen to each other,

25980
01:27:22,437 --> 01:27:23,004
an interaction

25990
01:27:23,004 --> 01:27:24,272
that happens that really offends

26000
01:27:24,272 --> 01:27:25,807
some friends don't like.

26010
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:27,709
TISON: It seems like when when they're waiting

26020
01:27:27,709 --> 01:27:28,710
they're just waiting.

26030
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:29,377
When they're listening,

26040
01:27:29,377 --> 01:27:30,211
they're just waiting

26050
01:27:30,211 --> 01:27:31,913
to see what they want to say.

26060
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:34,716
So these don't like don't respect that

26070
01:27:34,716 --> 01:27:37,118
kind of pragmatic principle

26080
01:27:37,819 --> 01:27:39,187
of like you have to

26090
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:40,121
to pay attention to what

26100
01:27:40,121 --> 01:27:41,289
the other person is saying

26110
01:27:41,289 --> 01:27:43,591
and to have a proper to have a correct

26120
01:27:44,058 --> 01:27:45,193
communicative interaction

26130
01:27:45,193 --> 01:27:49,397
us to concede the like,

26140
01:27:49,397 --> 01:27:50,632
you have to accept

26150
01:27:50,632 --> 01:27:51,966
that your field of performance

26160
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:52,800
is regulated

26170
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,269
by the person who's sucking through you.

26180
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,304
TISON: You have to let yourself be

26190
01:27:57,639 --> 01:27:59,607
influenced, be constrained by either

26200
01:27:59,607 --> 01:28:01,209
by the person that was talking to you

26210
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:02,176
just because you

26220
01:28:02,176 --> 01:28:03,511
you have to listen to it

26230
01:28:03,511 --> 01:28:04,979
and you have to

26240
01:28:04,979 --> 01:28:06,948
refrain from like turning away

26250
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:08,616
and go go do something else.

26260
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:11,653
So you have to like it's really

26270
01:28:11,653 --> 01:28:13,454
just accepting,

26280
01:28:13,454 --> 01:28:14,956
conceding a part of your autonomy.

26290
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:18,126
And that's another idea from a De Paolo

26300
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:20,561
as an active approach of language

26310
01:28:21,195 --> 01:28:21,729
where

26320
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:23,965
there's been communicative interaction

26330
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:26,100
in the, in any cooperative interaction.

26340
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:26,401
TISON: But in

26350
01:28:26,401 --> 01:28:28,503
TISON: community of interaction particular,

26360
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:29,971
you have to

26370
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:31,072
write inhibit

26380
01:28:31,072 --> 01:28:32,940
a part of your field about for a dance

26390
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:34,409
to participate

26400
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:36,678
in this interaction and listen.

26410
01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:38,746
Because suppose that

26420
01:28:38,746 --> 01:28:40,682
what I'm saying is really boring to you

26430
01:28:40,682 --> 01:28:41,816
and you just want to go

26440
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:42,917
eat your piece of cake

26450
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:44,118
in the in the fridge

26460
01:28:44,118 --> 01:28:46,487
like us do in order to participate,

26470
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:47,655
to maintain

26480
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:49,157
the interaction,

26490
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:50,658
you have to inhibit this.

26500
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:52,560
TISON: There's that part to the solicitation

26510
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:53,761
and to,

26520
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:54,195
to, to

26530
01:28:54,195 --> 01:28:55,763
let me regulate your

26540
01:28:55,763 --> 01:28:57,365
your your field about for a dance.

26550
01:28:57,365 --> 01:28:58,900
And so there's this part of

26560
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:00,234
like I concede that

26570
01:29:00,234 --> 01:29:01,436
I concede something

26580
01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:03,204
in order to maintain the interaction.

26590
01:29:03,204 --> 01:29:05,239
And when there is no no more interest

26600
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:09,010
or I'm not able to to I don't want to

26610
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:09,944
to be regulated.

26620
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:11,379
And there's another solicitation

26630
01:29:11,379 --> 01:29:12,280
outside the interaction

26640
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,449
that's more interesting to me.

26650
01:29:14,449 --> 01:29:16,751
But then I will leave the interaction.

26660
01:29:16,751 --> 01:29:18,986
But to maintain the interaction,

26670
01:29:18,986 --> 01:29:21,723
you have to have a and

26680
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:24,559
a capacity of inhibition that

26690
01:29:24,559 --> 01:29:25,593
exit of executive

26700
01:29:25,593 --> 01:29:26,728
some form of

26710
01:29:26,728 --> 01:29:28,796
what would be called executive control

26720
01:29:28,963 --> 01:29:32,667
to be able to listen and take

26730
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:33,968
what the person is saying.

26740
01:29:33,968 --> 01:29:35,036
If you don't have that, you're

26750
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:37,205
just going to think about something else

26760
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:40,141
and not let yourself be take

26770
01:29:40,942 --> 01:29:41,709
be constrained

26780
01:29:41,709 --> 01:29:42,877
by the coming captive

26790
01:29:42,877 --> 01:29:49,884
acts of the other person.

26800
01:29:49,884 --> 01:29:50,585
FRIEDMAN: So

26810
01:29:51,986 --> 01:29:54,055
back to Dean's

26820
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:57,625
point about multiple art and multiplayer

26830
01:29:59,026 --> 01:30:01,729
communication and engagements

26840
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:05,733
when we only have one communication,

26850
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:08,336
then it can feel like a transmission

26860
01:30:08,703 --> 01:30:09,871
like the Rosetta Stone

26870
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:11,172
transmitted from the past.

26880
01:30:11,172 --> 01:30:14,175
We don't get a dot two or a dot one

26890
01:30:14,175 --> 01:30:16,444
on the Rosetta Stone

26900
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:19,714
structuring

26910
01:30:20,314 --> 01:30:22,049
learning groups

26920
01:30:22,049 --> 01:30:23,451
and other activities

26930
01:30:23,451 --> 01:30:25,186
and relationships and.

26940
01:30:25,186 --> 01:30:27,555
Co-operative communication

26950
01:30:27,555 --> 01:30:29,557
as something unfolding,

26960
01:30:30,124 --> 01:30:32,827
bumping into each other twice

26970
01:30:32,827 --> 01:30:35,096
says something about those particles

26980
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:38,065
that bumping together just once

26990
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:39,767
FRIEDMAN: dozens.

27000
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:41,035
FRIEDMAN: It's almost like

27010
01:30:41,035 --> 01:30:43,671
when I say once there's an accident

27020
01:30:43,671 --> 01:30:45,440
twice as a coincidence

27030
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,875
three times is a party or

27040
01:30:49,177 --> 01:30:50,578
something like that.

27050
01:30:50,578 --> 01:30:53,014
So especially with three,

27060
01:30:53,981 --> 01:30:56,150
because one, two, three,

27070
01:30:56,150 --> 01:31:00,054
there may be a enough

27080
01:31:00,054 --> 01:31:01,556
of a recurrent engagements

27090
01:31:01,556 --> 01:31:03,324
and interweaving

27100
01:31:03,324 --> 01:31:05,960
to support reflection and development

27110
01:31:06,427 --> 01:31:07,628
to de-emphasize

27120
01:31:07,628 --> 01:31:10,164
any single of those events,

27130
01:31:11,032 --> 01:31:13,401
because none of them are even half

27140
01:31:13,734 --> 01:31:15,937
of the total series of three.

27150
01:31:16,537 --> 01:31:18,139
FRIEDMAN: So none of them can even be

27160
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:20,808
said to be a plurality or a majority

27170
01:31:21,275 --> 01:31:24,011
FRIEDMAN: if the .01 and two were to vote

27180
01:31:24,812 --> 01:31:25,913
to vote one of them out

27190
01:31:25,913 --> 01:31:28,783
or something like that.

27200
01:31:28,783 --> 01:31:30,985
And I think it does point towards

27210
01:31:31,752 --> 01:31:34,388
the reality of our continued interaction

27220
01:31:34,388 --> 01:31:36,390
with materials

27230
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:40,027
and then towards structures

27240
01:31:40,027 --> 01:31:43,598
that allow us to engage naturally.

27250
01:31:44,365 --> 01:31:45,132
TISON: Remy

27260
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:50,872
I think that what

27270
01:31:52,206 --> 01:31:54,141
communicating

27280
01:31:54,242 --> 01:31:56,277
in there repetitively

27290
01:31:56,677 --> 01:31:57,512
the same people,

27300
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:59,580
what it achieves, it's,

27310
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:00,882
it obviously it

27320
01:32:00,882 --> 01:32:02,116
shapes the generative

27330
01:32:02,116 --> 01:32:04,685
model, it aligns them in some ways.

27340
01:32:04,685 --> 01:32:07,889
So we come to share expectations

27350
01:32:07,889 --> 01:32:10,625
and share fields of affordances.

27360
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:13,694
So it clearly eases

27370
01:32:14,228 --> 01:32:15,630
communicative interaction

27380
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:17,932
because we have to communicate as much

27390
01:32:18,165 --> 01:32:19,767
when there's this tradeoff

27400
01:32:19,767 --> 01:32:20,101
between

27410
01:32:20,101 --> 01:32:22,470
if you have a lot of shared context,

27420
01:32:22,803 --> 01:32:23,237
you don't

27430
01:32:23,237 --> 01:32:24,505
have you don't

27440
01:32:24,505 --> 01:32:25,840
have to communicate as much.

27450
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:26,707
TISON: And if you don't have

27460
01:32:26,707 --> 01:32:27,675
a lot of social context,

27470
01:32:27,675 --> 01:32:28,476
you have to communicate

27480
01:32:28,476 --> 01:32:31,812
more to, to, to, to a

27490
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:36,150
yeah, as a, a useful interaction

27500
01:32:36,150 --> 01:32:37,852
to have a productive interaction.

27510
01:32:37,852 --> 01:32:40,788
And so what I think we, we have done is

27520
01:32:40,988 --> 01:32:42,990
we have like aligned

27530
01:32:42,990 --> 01:32:44,926
our different models in ways

27540
01:32:44,926 --> 01:32:47,094
that helps us understand

27550
01:32:47,094 --> 01:32:48,629
each other better than

27560
01:32:48,629 --> 01:32:49,797
we did at the beginning.

27570
01:32:51,332 --> 01:32:52,233
TISON: For instance, we can

27580
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:53,668
refer to things that.

27590
01:32:53,668 --> 01:32:55,102
We said in the past

27600
01:32:55,102 --> 01:32:55,970
we can say, Oh, well,

27610
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:57,939
when you said that.

27620
01:32:58,406 --> 01:32:59,774
So I think that's relevant now.

27630
01:32:59,774 --> 01:33:02,577
And so we can make

27640
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:04,845
can point to relations, to things

27650
01:33:04,845 --> 01:33:06,514
that that we said earlier.

27660
01:33:06,514 --> 01:33:09,350
So there's this

27670
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:10,751
there's this continual

27680
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:12,687
easing of communication.

27690
01:33:12,687 --> 01:33:13,854
And when you have repetitive,

27700
01:33:13,854 --> 01:33:16,157
communicative interaction with somebody,

27710
01:33:16,157 --> 01:33:18,492
that's I think that I think is

27720
01:33:18,492 --> 01:33:21,729
why we can come to believe that people

27730
01:33:21,762 --> 01:33:22,496
we are living with,

27740
01:33:22,496 --> 01:33:24,332
we can read each other's mind

27750
01:33:24,332 --> 01:33:25,399
with or without talking,

27760
01:33:25,399 --> 01:33:27,501
because there is so much shared context

27770
01:33:27,501 --> 01:33:29,303
that something can happen

27780
01:33:29,303 --> 01:33:31,238
and it can make us think some

27790
01:33:31,238 --> 01:33:33,040
something that is shared without us

27800
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:34,442
even saying anything.

27810
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:36,944
TISON: So there's this this context come to be

27820
01:33:37,545 --> 01:33:39,280
really complex and really,

27830
01:33:40,348 --> 01:33:41,682
really deep.

27840
01:33:41,682 --> 01:33:44,719
And so yeah, interacting repetitively

27850
01:33:45,686 --> 01:33:50,458
obviously is, is communication.

27860
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:52,493
FRIEDMAN: Okay, so we can

27870
01:33:52,493 --> 01:33:55,262
meet multiple times due preparation,

27880
01:33:56,664 --> 01:33:58,733
engagement and reflection

27890
01:34:00,001 --> 01:34:02,837
before, during and after a communication

27900
01:34:03,504 --> 01:34:05,673
and structure communication

27910
01:34:05,673 --> 01:34:07,174
so that there are multiple

27920
01:34:07,174 --> 01:34:09,610
such kind of peaks, troughs

27930
01:34:10,711 --> 01:34:14,548
we can talk about aligning or

27940
01:34:15,549 --> 01:34:16,484
synchronizing

27950
01:34:16,484 --> 01:34:18,185
in the general synchronous sense,

27960
01:34:18,185 --> 01:34:19,920
not making it identical,

27970
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:20,554
but rather

27980
01:34:20,554 --> 01:34:22,890
coordinating our generative models

27990
01:34:23,157 --> 01:34:25,326
through perception and learning.

28000
01:34:26,994 --> 01:34:29,430
As you mentioned, helps us understand

28010
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:31,265
each other better.

28020
01:34:31,265 --> 01:34:33,267
FRIEDMAN: Like a goal of a communication

28030
01:34:33,267 --> 01:34:35,002
could be epistemic

28040
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:37,505
let's get to know each other

28050
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:40,441
and it could also have an element

28060
01:34:40,441 --> 01:34:42,343
of pragmatic value,

28070
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:44,345
like let's take epistemic action

28080
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:44,912
to find out

28090
01:34:44,912 --> 01:34:47,481
if a collaboration is relevant here.

28100
01:34:47,481 --> 01:34:48,215
And then

28110
01:34:48,215 --> 01:34:49,283
going to engage

28120
01:34:49,283 --> 01:34:52,086
in these pragmatic actions.

28130
01:34:52,086 --> 01:34:52,820
TISON: Remmy

28140
01:34:54,321 --> 01:34:57,191
Yeah, and I think that a lot of

28150
01:34:58,225 --> 01:35:00,261
interaction

28160
01:35:00,461 --> 01:35:03,264
that we share in our academy can

28170
01:35:04,031 --> 01:35:07,268
a linguistic in advanced societies

28180
01:35:07,268 --> 01:35:08,102
really often

28190
01:35:08,102 --> 01:35:10,838
look like transmission interaction.

28200
01:35:11,138 --> 01:35:13,074
So we're seeing things

28210
01:35:13,074 --> 01:35:14,975
that we're thinking to each other,

28220
01:35:14,975 --> 01:35:17,011
but I think that is epistemic

28230
01:35:17,244 --> 01:35:19,613
or communicative

28240
01:35:19,613 --> 01:35:21,615
in terms of transmission

28250
01:35:21,615 --> 01:35:22,616
is a communicative

28260
01:35:22,616 --> 01:35:23,851
transmission

28270
01:35:23,851 --> 01:35:27,221
interactions are are the way they are

28280
01:35:27,221 --> 01:35:28,723
because they are explicit

28290
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:30,024
aims of the interaction

28300
01:35:30,024 --> 01:35:31,092
in which we are engaged.

28310
01:35:31,092 --> 01:35:31,826
TISON: That is,

28320
01:35:31,826 --> 01:35:33,561
TISON: we are transmitting content

28330
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:35,096
now when we're talking to each other

28340
01:35:35,096 --> 01:35:36,397
because

28350
01:35:36,931 --> 01:35:37,465
in a way

28360
01:35:37,465 --> 01:35:39,834
that that's the goal of the interaction.

28370
01:35:40,167 --> 01:35:43,771
But in other contexts like it's

28380
01:35:43,771 --> 01:35:46,040
because we have come get practices

28390
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:46,941
that we have developed

28400
01:35:46,941 --> 01:35:49,310
that we can have these these goals

28410
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:52,146
that can drive an interaction.

28420
01:35:52,646 --> 01:35:55,082
And if we're at the grocery store,

28430
01:35:55,116 --> 01:35:56,650
if we're in other context,

28440
01:35:56,650 --> 01:35:57,351
we're doing something

28450
01:35:57,351 --> 01:35:58,085
with something else.

28460
01:35:58,085 --> 01:36:00,154
TISON: But when we're in academic contexts,

28470
01:36:00,154 --> 01:36:02,523
often the goal of the interactions is

28480
01:36:02,823 --> 01:36:03,624
talking about

28490
01:36:04,725 --> 01:36:06,627
transmitting some, some,

28500
01:36:06,627 --> 01:36:08,763
some contents, transmitting some, some,

28510
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:10,030
some theories,

28520
01:36:10,030 --> 01:36:10,431
for instance,

28530
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:11,298
explaining theories,

28540
01:36:11,298 --> 01:36:12,633
explaining arguments.

28550
01:36:12,633 --> 01:36:14,135
And so these interactions.

28560
01:36:14,135 --> 01:36:15,703
We look at them and we're like,

28570
01:36:15,703 --> 01:36:17,772
Oh, that's clearly there's

28580
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:18,873
we're transmitting content

28590
01:36:18,873 --> 01:36:19,807
when we're talking.

28600
01:36:19,807 --> 01:36:21,408
But the idea is that

28610
01:36:21,408 --> 01:36:23,210
this is really a small subset of,

28620
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:25,146
the cases of communicative interaction

28630
01:36:25,146 --> 01:36:27,815
that we engage in in everyday life,

28640
01:36:28,115 --> 01:36:32,953
and we take these as paradigmatic cases

28650
01:36:32,953 --> 01:36:34,555
of communicative interaction

28660
01:36:34,555 --> 01:36:37,291
when they are really

28670
01:36:37,291 --> 01:36:39,160
the pinnacle of the

28680
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:41,729
the linguistic civilization.

28690
01:36:41,729 --> 01:36:44,231
TISON: We're in a really rarefied

28700
01:36:46,367 --> 01:36:48,969
context where academic discussions are

28710
01:36:48,969 --> 01:36:51,639
not what we do in everyday settings.

28720
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:53,607
When we talk to each other

28730
01:36:53,607 --> 01:36:56,343
and we we do this, it's

28740
01:36:56,343 --> 01:36:58,012
because it's an explicit

28750
01:36:58,012 --> 01:36:59,580
aim of our interaction

28760
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:02,216
now that we do this. But in other cases,

28770
01:37:03,684 --> 01:37:04,618
in many in

28780
01:37:04,618 --> 01:37:06,320
most cases, when we speak to each other,

28790
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:07,922
that's not the aim.

28800
01:37:07,922 --> 01:37:09,690
TISON: The explicit aim is not to transfer

28810
01:37:09,690 --> 01:37:11,792
some information or talk about theories.

28820
01:37:11,792 --> 01:37:13,994
It's about doing things together.

28830
01:37:14,161 --> 01:37:16,530
And now we're doing something together.

28840
01:37:16,530 --> 01:37:18,532
We're talking about active inference,

28850
01:37:18,532 --> 01:37:22,303
but it looks as if it can be understood

28860
01:37:22,303 --> 01:37:24,004
in in terms of content

28870
01:37:24,004 --> 01:37:25,706
sharing and content transmission.

28880
01:37:25,706 --> 01:37:27,708
But that's because it's the goal

28890
01:37:27,708 --> 01:37:29,009
of our interaction.

28900
01:37:29,009 --> 01:37:29,310
It's that

28910
01:37:29,310 --> 01:37:29,910
because it's

28920
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:34,014
the nature of communication.

28930
01:37:34,014 --> 01:37:37,551
TISON: And I don't know if I'm being clear

28940
01:37:37,551 --> 01:37:38,252
yet.

28950
01:37:38,552 --> 01:37:40,721
FRIEDMAN: Dingyadi or Henry.

28960
01:37:40,721 --> 01:37:43,290
DEAN: I just I think

28970
01:37:44,291 --> 01:37:45,292
I don't want to put

28980
01:37:45,292 --> 01:37:46,861
my philosopher's cap on, but I will.

28990
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:47,995
Just briefly,

29000
01:37:47,995 --> 01:37:49,763
I think we use language of communication

29010
01:37:49,763 --> 01:37:50,464
to save time.

29020
01:37:50,464 --> 01:37:53,100
It's an exploitation strategy.

29030
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:55,502
And so I think when we put a 13 week set

29040
01:37:55,502 --> 01:37:56,270
of parentheses

29050
01:37:56,270 --> 01:37:59,673
around a learning moment or opportunity,

29060
01:38:00,207 --> 01:38:01,675
we oftentimes get it,

29070
01:38:01,675 --> 01:38:03,244
get the cart ahead of the horse.

29080
01:38:03,244 --> 01:38:04,178
DEAN: We don't

29090
01:38:04,178 --> 01:38:06,347
we don't see the pragmatics

29100
01:38:06,347 --> 01:38:08,716
DEAN: because we're busy transmitting.

29110
01:38:09,917 --> 01:38:10,618
And what ends

29120
01:38:10,618 --> 01:38:11,118
up happening

29130
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:13,320
is the plan forward that affordances,

29140
01:38:13,621 --> 01:38:14,855
that exploitation

29150
01:38:14,855 --> 01:38:17,992
or optimization or savings of time

29160
01:38:18,659 --> 01:38:20,461
jumps ahead of practice

29170
01:38:20,461 --> 01:38:22,196
to participate in the permeate.

29180
01:38:22,196 --> 01:38:24,498
Now we can see that's a luxury.

29190
01:38:24,498 --> 01:38:25,966
But is it

29200
01:38:25,966 --> 01:38:28,936
if we don't respect the fact that people

29210
01:38:29,637 --> 01:38:32,106
maybe don't necessarily learn as well

29220
01:38:32,673 --> 01:38:34,174
when they're handed the plan,

29230
01:38:34,174 --> 01:38:35,576
as opposed to

29240
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:37,144
given an opportunity to build

29250
01:38:37,144 --> 01:38:37,811
one or form

29260
01:38:37,811 --> 01:38:39,980
one themselves through preparation,

29270
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:41,849
participation, permeation.

29280
01:38:41,849 --> 01:38:43,984
DEAN: We could go away from this live stream

29290
01:38:43,984 --> 01:38:44,652
and each of us

29300
01:38:44,652 --> 01:38:47,788
could literally now design a better plan

29310
01:38:48,489 --> 01:38:49,957
as opposed to

29320
01:38:49,957 --> 01:38:51,992
DEAN: Remi came to us with a plan,

29330
01:38:51,992 --> 01:38:53,027
what really came to us,

29340
01:38:53,027 --> 01:38:56,263
what was a sketch.

29350
01:38:56,263 --> 01:38:58,532
And then we perhaps

29360
01:38:59,333 --> 01:39:01,669
participated and permeated.

29370
01:39:01,669 --> 01:39:02,403
Now

29380
01:39:02,803 --> 01:39:04,071
that the sophistication

29390
01:39:04,071 --> 01:39:05,773
of whatever comes out of that

29400
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:08,208
in terms of a goal for each one of us

29410
01:39:08,676 --> 01:39:11,312
is orders of magnitude greater

29420
01:39:11,745 --> 01:39:13,981
because somebody didn't say, Oh,

29430
01:39:14,381 --> 01:39:15,783
well, I've only got 13 weeks.

29440
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:17,618
DEAN: I don't have the luxury

29450
01:39:17,618 --> 01:39:20,487
to be able to be pragmatic about this.

29460
01:39:20,487 --> 01:39:22,923
So there, I'll take my hat off again.

29470
01:39:22,923 --> 01:39:24,658
I don't mean to sermonizing,

29480
01:39:24,658 --> 01:39:27,061
but I think when we actually feel

29490
01:39:27,094 --> 01:39:30,230
what it's like to let the plan

29500
01:39:31,532 --> 01:39:33,867
naturally evolve and become

29510
01:39:34,735 --> 01:39:35,970
a part of the ecology

29520
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:38,205
as opposed to driving the ecology,

29530
01:39:38,205 --> 01:39:39,640
the single source,

29540
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:41,408
it changes everything.

29550
01:39:41,408 --> 01:39:42,609
DEAN: And over and over again,

29560
01:39:42,609 --> 01:39:44,411
every time we have one of these

29570
01:39:44,411 --> 01:39:47,314
three set live streams, it reinforces

29580
01:39:47,881 --> 01:39:48,649
what you could do.

29590
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:49,183
And again,

29600
01:39:49,183 --> 01:39:53,721
you don't even have to be on the the zoo

29610
01:39:54,655 --> 01:39:56,824
as long as you get over

29620
01:39:56,824 --> 01:39:57,825
the amount of time

29630
01:39:57,825 --> 01:39:58,959
to see and sense

29640
01:39:58,959 --> 01:40:02,930
what it's like to prep, participate.

29650
01:40:03,097 --> 01:40:05,165
And I think the most important

29660
01:40:05,165 --> 01:40:07,768
one of all stick around for the Permian

29670
01:40:07,768 --> 01:40:08,268
because that's

29680
01:40:08,268 --> 01:40:10,437
where the real nuggets seemed.

29690
01:40:10,437 --> 01:40:12,706
DEAN: Daniels metaphor of icebergs,

29700
01:40:13,607 --> 01:40:15,109
things float

29710
01:40:15,109 --> 01:40:16,577
to the surface

29720
01:40:16,577 --> 01:40:18,245
when you give it enough time.

29730
01:40:18,245 --> 01:40:19,913
But I understand

29740
01:40:19,913 --> 01:40:21,615
there's also a 13 week window,

29750
01:40:21,615 --> 01:40:23,584
and when paying thousands of dollars

29760
01:40:23,584 --> 01:40:26,620
to just sit in your class and come on,

29770
01:40:27,688 --> 01:40:28,856
exploit the daylights

29780
01:40:28,856 --> 01:40:29,056
out of

29790
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:30,391
your communication,

29800
01:40:30,391 --> 01:40:31,892
and I just don't know

29810
01:40:31,892 --> 01:40:33,394
that people don't realize

29820
01:40:33,394 --> 01:40:35,462
that they're cutting off their noses

29830
01:40:35,462 --> 01:40:37,531
to spite their they're learning.

29840
01:40:38,265 --> 01:40:39,099
FRIEDMAN: So

29850
01:40:44,772 --> 01:40:46,740
interesting a lot

29860
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:50,511
their permeation letting it pervade

29870
01:40:51,345 --> 01:40:54,114
our generative model or percolate,

29880
01:40:54,415 --> 01:40:56,417
letting those messages be passed,

29890
01:40:57,184 --> 01:41:00,487
letting that ripple or the perturbation

29900
01:41:02,356 --> 01:41:04,291
take effect

29910
01:41:04,291 --> 01:41:06,660
slower and deeper levels.

29920
01:41:07,895 --> 01:41:11,198
And it is really a challenge

29930
01:41:11,665 --> 01:41:13,967
when the logistical and transmission

29940
01:41:13,967 --> 01:41:17,438
aspects of communication

29950
01:41:17,905 --> 01:41:19,640
are scaffolded.

29960
01:41:19,773 --> 01:41:22,109
And those are like the metadata fields

29970
01:41:22,109 --> 01:41:24,011
that have to be filled out, the boxes

29980
01:41:24,011 --> 01:41:25,779
that have to be checked,

29990
01:41:25,779 --> 01:41:29,850
and they can feel constraining.

30000
01:41:29,850 --> 01:41:30,684
FRIEDMAN: Yet

30010
01:41:31,952 --> 01:41:34,922
simply removing them

30020
01:41:34,922 --> 01:41:38,092
is not a positive solution.

30030
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:39,626
And so the path of least action

30040
01:41:39,626 --> 01:41:42,196
for many learning scenarios

30050
01:41:43,097 --> 01:41:45,632
is to replicate the prior.

30060
01:41:45,632 --> 01:41:46,133
DEAN: You're.

30070
01:41:47,167 --> 01:41:49,403
FRIEDMAN: Over the decades a professor

30080
01:41:49,803 --> 01:41:50,804
who might teach the

30090
01:41:50,804 --> 01:41:52,239
same class in the same way.

30100
01:41:54,074 --> 01:41:57,277
And there's pros and cons to that.

30110
01:41:57,277 --> 01:41:59,880
In fact, some of the most

30120
01:42:00,747 --> 01:42:02,883
enlightened learning communities

30130
01:42:04,051 --> 01:42:06,587
have like a vibrancy that transcends

30140
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:09,590
an almost ironically static

30150
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:11,692
learning experience.

30160
01:42:11,692 --> 01:42:13,494
Like, we all read this thing.

30170
01:42:13,494 --> 01:42:14,328
So it's not that

30180
01:42:14,328 --> 01:42:17,531
that I think the mode of communication

30190
01:42:17,531 --> 01:42:18,332
and cooperation

30200
01:42:18,332 --> 01:42:20,400
in education that we're exploring here

30210
01:42:20,934 --> 01:42:21,502
means that

30220
01:42:21,502 --> 01:42:23,237
every single experience

30230
01:42:23,237 --> 01:42:25,639
is going to be like

30240
01:42:26,039 --> 01:42:29,209
some kind of full attention,

30250
01:42:29,243 --> 01:42:32,646
transformative depth psychology.

30260
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:35,749
FRIEDMAN: I think it would feel more

30270
01:42:38,085 --> 01:42:39,319
normal and natural

30280
01:42:39,319 --> 01:42:42,523
and just like participating in

30290
01:42:42,523 --> 01:42:45,259
a cool ecosystem

30300
01:42:45,259 --> 01:42:48,262
that works with that individual's

30310
01:42:48,695 --> 01:42:55,669
situation, what else can we add

30320
01:42:56,003 --> 01:42:59,306
or where can we go?

30330
01:42:59,473 --> 01:43:00,674
Where is active inference

30340
01:43:00,674 --> 01:43:08,715
in all of this?

30350
01:43:08,715 --> 01:43:11,652
Where do you see active inference?

30360
01:43:11,718 --> 01:43:14,021
Not like, you know,

30370
01:43:14,021 --> 01:43:15,022
what are your intentions

30380
01:43:15,022 --> 01:43:16,623
with my child, but

30390
01:43:19,126 --> 01:43:19,493
where

30400
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:20,594
is active inference in

30410
01:43:20,594 --> 01:43:22,496
your further research agenda?

30420
01:43:22,496 --> 01:43:22,863
TISON: Me

30430
01:43:25,065 --> 01:43:27,935
I think it gives the,

30440
01:43:27,935 --> 01:43:29,570
the like

30450
01:43:30,404 --> 01:43:31,872
all encompassing

30460
01:43:31,872 --> 01:43:34,908
framework and

30470
01:43:34,908 --> 01:43:40,080
yeah, the, the,

30480
01:43:41,081 --> 01:43:43,951
the, the abstract ness

30490
01:43:43,951 --> 01:43:44,751
of their framework

30500
01:43:44,751 --> 01:43:46,620
allows us to apply

30510
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:48,689
it to, as we said, light,

30520
01:43:48,689 --> 01:43:49,923
come and get the communication

30530
01:43:49,923 --> 01:43:51,291
between cells

30540
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:53,493
and communication between like

30550
01:43:54,127 --> 01:43:56,697
countries or, or groups of individuals

30560
01:43:56,697 --> 01:44:00,033
with this multi-scale

30570
01:44:00,167 --> 01:44:01,535
property of active and friends

30580
01:44:01,535 --> 01:44:03,937
I think is really useful in the,

30590
01:44:03,937 --> 01:44:06,406
in enabling us to describe

30600
01:44:06,406 --> 01:44:07,474
communicative interaction

30610
01:44:07,474 --> 01:44:10,210
between these various kinds of

30620
01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:12,946
of free their minimizing

30630
01:44:14,648 --> 01:44:15,182
yeah.

30640
01:44:15,182 --> 01:44:17,284
TISON: Agents and

30650
01:44:19,386 --> 01:44:21,555
so there's this that

30660
01:44:21,555 --> 01:44:23,690
that's useful I think that

30670
01:44:25,892 --> 01:44:26,994
yeah the, the,

30680
01:44:26,994 --> 01:44:30,497
the learning mechanisms that are

30690
01:44:30,497 --> 01:44:32,866
that are at work in active inference

30700
01:44:33,033 --> 01:44:33,967
are really useful

30710
01:44:33,967 --> 01:44:37,471
also to explain our come together

30720
01:44:37,471 --> 01:44:39,139
in direction is conducted

30730
01:44:39,139 --> 01:44:40,507
in our repeated

30740
01:44:40,507 --> 01:44:41,708
communicative interaction

30750
01:44:41,708 --> 01:44:43,377
can lead to

30760
01:44:43,377 --> 01:44:44,778
that form of synchronizing

30770
01:44:44,778 --> 01:44:45,812
of the generated model

30780
01:44:45,812 --> 01:44:48,482
as has been explored by Vasyl

30790
01:44:48,782 --> 01:44:51,485
in that paper and in 2020.

30800
01:44:51,485 --> 01:44:52,819
TISON: I think so

30810
01:44:52,819 --> 01:44:53,787
I think that's

30820
01:44:53,787 --> 01:44:55,222
that's really useful

30830
01:44:55,222 --> 01:44:56,657
and there's a lot of,

30840
01:44:56,657 --> 01:44:57,724
a lot of things that

30850
01:44:58,959 --> 01:44:59,259
that I

30860
01:44:59,259 --> 01:45:00,060
think we can

30870
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:00,727
take from

30880
01:45:00,727 --> 01:45:03,130
the active inference framework.

30890
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:04,564
And yet

30900
01:45:05,198 --> 01:45:07,501
the idea that's all

30910
01:45:07,501 --> 01:45:09,169
I think this fundamental intuition

30920
01:45:09,169 --> 01:45:10,671
is that all,

30930
01:45:10,671 --> 01:45:12,706
all action is free

30940
01:45:12,739 --> 01:45:15,509
and there are minimization

30950
01:45:15,509 --> 01:45:17,678
that's trivial that that's meant.

30960
01:45:17,878 --> 01:45:20,580
But I think there's a pragmatist

30970
01:45:21,114 --> 01:45:23,250
insights in active inference

30980
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:27,587
that we can use to to,

30990
01:45:27,587 --> 01:45:30,123
to support the

31000
01:45:31,425 --> 01:45:33,226
pragmatic view of communication.

31010
01:45:33,226 --> 01:45:33,560
TISON: Yeah.

31020
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:35,462
TISON: That everything that an organism does

31030
01:45:35,462 --> 01:45:37,831
TISON: it does it to minimize the three

31040
01:45:37,831 --> 01:45:40,334
and active inference is no different.

31050
01:45:40,334 --> 01:45:43,370
And a communicative active inference

31060
01:45:43,370 --> 01:45:44,971
as a form of active inference

31070
01:45:44,971 --> 01:45:46,673
also aims to minimize

31080
01:45:46,673 --> 01:45:47,874
the free energy of an overturned

31090
01:45:47,874 --> 01:45:48,875
down is them.

31100
01:45:48,875 --> 01:45:51,378
And so when an organism tries, it

31110
01:45:51,745 --> 01:45:54,514
finds itself in a situation where it's

31120
01:45:55,415 --> 01:45:56,683
there's a lot of free energy

31130
01:45:56,683 --> 01:45:58,051
or there's a lot of error of prediction.

31140
01:45:58,051 --> 01:45:59,619
TISON: It will try to

31150
01:45:59,619 --> 01:46:01,521
engage it in its endeavor intervening.

31160
01:46:01,521 --> 01:46:02,589
It's an environment

31170
01:46:02,589 --> 01:46:04,524
in order to bring itself

31180
01:46:04,524 --> 01:46:07,661
back in the available in, viable states.

31190
01:46:08,061 --> 01:46:09,930
And so all these ideas

31200
01:46:09,930 --> 01:46:11,765
and when we apply them to communication,

31210
01:46:11,765 --> 01:46:13,500
I think they lead

31220
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:15,335
not necessarily by implication,

31230
01:46:15,335 --> 01:46:16,303
but I think the

31240
01:46:16,303 --> 01:46:19,172
there's a path to these ideas, true

31250
01:46:20,173 --> 01:46:21,241
to the

31260
01:46:21,241 --> 01:46:22,075
pragmatic view of

31270
01:46:22,075 --> 01:46:23,510
communication, the idea

31280
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:25,679
that communication is another form of

31290
01:46:26,413 --> 01:46:28,448
is just a mechanism of regulation

31300
01:46:29,583 --> 01:46:30,417
of organisms

31310
01:46:30,417 --> 01:46:31,952
in order to minimize their free energy.

31320
01:46:31,952 --> 01:46:32,185
TISON: I think

31330
01:46:32,185 --> 01:46:35,889
there's this kind of basic biological

31340
01:46:36,156 --> 01:46:38,191
and understanding

31350
01:46:38,191 --> 01:46:40,227
of the behavior of organism.

31360
01:46:40,494 --> 01:46:42,863
TISON: I think it leads us more toward

31370
01:46:42,863 --> 01:46:45,198
the pragmatist view of communication

31380
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:47,601
rather than toward the

31390
01:46:47,601 --> 01:46:49,269
the more informational

31400
01:46:49,269 --> 01:46:51,805
or transmission view that is

31410
01:46:51,805 --> 01:46:54,674
that is more at home in our

31420
01:46:54,708 --> 01:46:56,343
like really

31430
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:58,645
highly advanced and complex

31440
01:46:58,645 --> 01:46:59,813
linguistic interactions.

31450
01:46:59,813 --> 01:47:01,248
And I think that this like

31460
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:04,050
basic biological framework

31470
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:05,385
is a good place.

31480
01:47:05,385 --> 01:47:07,120
TISON: Try to understand

31490
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:08,822
communication in the pragmatist.

31500
01:47:08,822 --> 01:47:10,957
FRIEDMAN: You a

31510
01:47:12,325 --> 01:47:14,361
very nice answer

31520
01:47:15,262 --> 01:47:17,431
all I'll read a comment from Stephen

31530
01:47:17,798 --> 01:47:20,500
and then we can give a thought on it

31540
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:21,468
as well as provide

31550
01:47:21,468 --> 01:47:23,970
some closing thoughts.

31560
01:47:23,970 --> 01:47:24,905
So Stephen wrote

31570
01:47:26,206 --> 01:47:27,240
Explicit aims

31580
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:28,275
of interaction

31590
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:30,243
are important and can be invisible.

31600
01:47:30,243 --> 01:47:31,678
Thus communication appears

31610
01:47:31,678 --> 01:47:33,246
to be based on transmission.

31620
01:47:33,246 --> 01:47:35,415
Should we identify the context

31630
01:47:35,415 --> 01:47:37,784
through the affordances or via

31640
01:47:37,784 --> 01:47:39,119
naming the water

31650
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:40,954
like the water we swim in?

31660
01:47:40,954 --> 01:47:43,690
FRIEDMAN: That is is the context

31670
01:47:43,690 --> 01:47:44,491
and the explicit

31680
01:47:44,491 --> 01:47:46,927
aims apparent via the affordances?

31690
01:47:47,694 --> 01:47:49,696
Or is there a special source

31700
01:47:49,696 --> 01:47:50,464
FRIEDMAN: that flavors

31710
01:47:50,464 --> 01:47:51,598
the cultural waters

31720
01:47:51,598 --> 01:47:55,802
in which we are swimming?

31730
01:47:55,802 --> 01:47:56,102
Yeah,

31740
01:48:00,474 --> 01:48:01,808
Steve, special sauce.

31750
01:48:01,808 --> 01:48:02,542
DEAN: Real quick on that.

31760
01:48:02,542 --> 01:48:05,479
I think what maybe you did build on

31770
01:48:05,479 --> 01:48:06,279
what Remy just said.

31780
01:48:06,279 --> 01:48:07,481
I think

31790
01:48:07,481 --> 01:48:10,717
perhaps active inference opens up

31800
01:48:10,717 --> 01:48:11,718
that space.

31810
01:48:11,718 --> 01:48:12,786
It's to the

31820
01:48:12,786 --> 01:48:14,955
to the idea of a special sauce.

31830
01:48:14,955 --> 01:48:15,755
It doesn't guarantee

31840
01:48:15,755 --> 01:48:16,923
that there will be one,

31850
01:48:16,923 --> 01:48:19,292
and it certainly doesn't promise.

31860
01:48:20,594 --> 01:48:22,729
But what it does do is it says,

31870
01:48:22,729 --> 01:48:25,966
what are the possibilities within this?

31880
01:48:25,999 --> 01:48:28,869
Not just what are we collapsing down to?

31890
01:48:29,302 --> 01:48:30,971
I mean, throughout this series,

31900
01:48:30,971 --> 01:48:32,739
I've been talking a lot about,

31910
01:48:32,739 --> 01:48:35,041
well, we can't leave the absolutes,

31920
01:48:35,041 --> 01:48:36,676
the things that we've experienced

31930
01:48:36,676 --> 01:48:38,144
out of this equation.

31940
01:48:38,144 --> 01:48:39,145
But I think what the

31950
01:48:39,145 --> 01:48:39,779
what I think

31960
01:48:39,779 --> 01:48:42,349
the active inference affords is that

31970
01:48:42,983 --> 01:48:44,317
those relativities

31980
01:48:44,317 --> 01:48:46,353
in those those entanglements

31990
01:48:46,486 --> 01:48:47,787
and those entanglements

32000
01:48:47,787 --> 01:48:49,589
always to be determined

32010
01:48:49,589 --> 01:48:52,225
can be moved towards

32020
01:48:52,225 --> 01:48:54,828
and and maybe accepted

32030
01:48:54,828 --> 01:48:57,063
with with more abundance

32040
01:48:57,063 --> 01:48:58,798
if we use active inference.

32050
01:48:58,798 --> 01:49:04,538
DEAN: But that's just my optimistic take on.

32060
01:49:04,538 --> 01:49:06,907
FRIEDMAN: Do you have any other closing words

32070
01:49:06,907 --> 01:49:08,942
before we hear some final thoughts

32080
01:49:08,942 --> 01:49:12,846
from the others?

32090
01:49:12,846 --> 01:49:14,781
Excellent. Okay.

32100
01:49:14,781 --> 01:49:18,685
Blue or Remy with some final thoughts.

32110
01:49:18,685 --> 01:49:21,288
How's this?

32120
01:49:21,288 --> 01:49:27,360
How will it permeate with you?

32130
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:28,728
TISON: Okay, so I'll go ahead.

32140
01:49:28,728 --> 01:49:31,531
So, yeah, I was really happy

32150
01:49:31,531 --> 01:49:32,899
to have the chance

32160
01:49:32,899 --> 01:49:35,402
to talk about the paper with you.

32170
01:49:35,835 --> 01:49:37,470
I think that one of the

32180
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:38,471
most important things

32190
01:49:38,471 --> 01:49:41,474
that I would take home is that now

32200
01:49:41,474 --> 01:49:44,277
I have a really salient solicitation to

32210
01:49:44,511 --> 01:49:46,413
see the Planet Robot

32220
01:49:47,581 --> 01:49:48,315
in action.

32230
01:49:48,315 --> 01:49:49,282
So like

32240
01:49:49,282 --> 01:49:49,649
at the

32250
01:49:49,649 --> 01:49:50,817
second that I close

32260
01:49:50,817 --> 01:49:51,918
the Zoom meeting, I'm

32270
01:49:51,918 --> 01:49:53,253
going to go see that.

32280
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:54,487
TISON: That's really something

32290
01:49:54,487 --> 01:49:56,022
that I taking

32300
01:49:56,022 --> 01:49:58,758
from the citizen discussion.

32310
01:49:58,758 --> 01:49:59,359
But yeah, no,

32320
01:49:59,359 --> 01:50:00,694
it was really interesting

32330
01:50:00,694 --> 01:50:01,227
to see

32340
01:50:01,227 --> 01:50:02,462
different perspectives,

32350
01:50:02,462 --> 01:50:05,498
different backgrounds and

32360
01:50:05,498 --> 01:50:06,766
what, what

32370
01:50:06,766 --> 01:50:07,701
these different

32380
01:50:07,701 --> 01:50:08,535
differing backgrounds

32390
01:50:08,535 --> 01:50:12,005
can bring to a discussion that is,

32400
01:50:13,239 --> 01:50:15,342
I think that was really enlightening

32410
01:50:15,709 --> 01:50:18,478
for me and I was really happy to to be

32420
01:50:18,478 --> 01:50:21,881
there.

32430
01:50:21,881 --> 01:50:23,450
KNIGHT: Just say thanks for coming.

32440
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:24,584
I mean, we really enjoyed

32450
01:50:24,584 --> 01:50:25,251
this discussion.

32460
01:50:25,251 --> 01:50:25,685
And for me,

32470
01:50:25,685 --> 01:50:28,355
I think what will permeate is like the,

32480
01:50:29,589 --> 01:50:31,324
KNIGHT: you know, everything I think about now,

32490
01:50:31,324 --> 01:50:32,325
I just think about

32500
01:50:32,325 --> 01:50:33,293
how can I model this

32510
01:50:33,293 --> 01:50:34,861
in terms of active influence?

32520
01:50:34,861 --> 01:50:38,231
And I feel like this paper will,

32530
01:50:38,231 --> 01:50:39,966
you know, influence

32540
01:50:39,966 --> 01:50:42,202
maybe the way that I think about

32550
01:50:42,202 --> 01:50:42,836
communication,

32560
01:50:42,836 --> 01:50:44,437
which is a big part of modeling,

32570
01:50:44,437 --> 01:50:45,605
active influence

32580
01:50:45,605 --> 01:50:46,706
period, especially like

32590
01:50:46,706 --> 01:50:48,642
in a multi-agent dynamical system.

32600
01:50:48,642 --> 01:50:52,145
KNIGHT: So I think I will probably leverage

32610
01:50:52,145 --> 01:50:53,546
the psychological approach

32620
01:50:53,546 --> 01:50:55,615
in the way that I think about it

32630
01:50:55,815 --> 01:50:56,449
going forward.

32640
01:50:56,449 --> 01:50:58,318
So I appreciate the opportunity

32650
01:50:58,318 --> 01:51:00,887
to learn about it.

32660
01:51:00,887 --> 01:51:01,921
FRIEDMAN: Awesome.

32670
01:51:01,955 --> 01:51:04,290
My closing thought.

32680
01:51:04,758 --> 01:51:07,560
What I'm left with here is active

32690
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:10,997
inference as about affordances

32700
01:51:11,965 --> 01:51:14,834
is about the content of the model

32710
01:51:15,201 --> 01:51:16,603
is about affordances,

32720
01:51:16,603 --> 01:51:19,172
and active inference is an affordances.

32730
01:51:19,172 --> 01:51:22,242
It allows us to realize epistemic

32740
01:51:22,242 --> 01:51:24,511
and pragmatic value today

32750
01:51:24,511 --> 01:51:26,413
and in the future.

32760
01:51:26,413 --> 01:51:28,381
And in that way

32770
01:51:28,381 --> 01:51:31,351
we can see it as a gripper and gripped.

32780
01:51:31,851 --> 01:51:33,920
Just like we could talk about the hand

32790
01:51:34,154 --> 01:51:35,955
as gripper and gripped,

32800
01:51:35,955 --> 01:51:37,290
whether it's holding hands

32810
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:40,460
or grabbing an object, and especially in

32820
01:51:40,460 --> 01:51:44,497
this thought to some very nice points

32830
01:51:44,497 --> 01:51:48,068
added on language as gripper and gripped

32840
01:51:48,768 --> 01:51:50,437
and contextualizing

32850
01:51:50,437 --> 01:51:53,273
this kind of breakaway verbal community

32860
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:57,677
of research and scholarly education

32870
01:51:57,677 --> 01:51:58,945
and academia,

32880
01:51:58,945 --> 01:52:02,115
and recognizing that breakaway community

32890
01:52:02,115 --> 01:52:03,550
and skill

32900
01:52:03,650 --> 01:52:05,885
as something that's crystallizing

32910
01:52:05,885 --> 01:52:08,021
out of a much more inclusive

32920
01:52:08,021 --> 01:52:10,223
and pragmatically oriented niche.

32930
01:52:10,724 --> 01:52:13,827
And I think that will be a win win

32940
01:52:14,027 --> 01:52:18,598
framing because it will help ground

32950
01:52:18,898 --> 01:52:20,366
what can be abstract

32960
01:52:20,366 --> 01:52:23,503
and lofty discussions and also

32970
01:52:23,903 --> 01:52:26,773
elevate and bring what

32980
01:52:27,841 --> 01:52:29,275
bring attention

32990
01:52:29,275 --> 01:52:29,943
and support

33000
01:52:29,943 --> 01:52:33,646
to some areas and types of communication

33010
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,282
that are absolutely natural

33020
01:52:36,616 --> 01:52:37,817
in field of affordances

33030
01:52:37,817 --> 01:52:39,452
view and the ecological view,

33040
01:52:39,452 --> 01:52:40,920
but are not always respected.

33050
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:42,288
FRIEDMAN: So highly unsure

33060
01:52:42,288 --> 01:52:44,657
like a symbolic transmission view

33070
01:52:44,657 --> 01:52:46,526
and the closing image

33080
01:52:46,526 --> 01:52:48,962
for me is making the source underwater.

33090
01:52:49,596 --> 01:52:50,997
I'm just imagining it's like,

33100
01:52:50,997 --> 01:52:52,832
I don't know, SpongeBob SquarePants

33110
01:52:52,832 --> 01:52:53,199
or someone's

33120
01:52:53,199 --> 01:52:54,300
trying to cook

33130
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:55,535
and make the sauce,

33140
01:52:55,535 --> 01:52:57,570
but we're adding things.

33150
01:52:57,570 --> 01:52:58,404
And it's more

33160
01:52:58,404 --> 01:52:59,339
just like happening

33170
01:52:59,339 --> 01:53:01,741
in this diffusive space.

33180
01:53:01,741 --> 01:53:02,442
And in a way,

33190
01:53:02,442 --> 01:53:04,711
all kitchens are in fluids.

33200
01:53:05,011 --> 01:53:06,679
FRIEDMAN: That's why we can smell

33210
01:53:06,679 --> 01:53:07,981
what we're cooking.

33220
01:53:07,981 --> 01:53:09,682
But it's different enough

33230
01:53:09,682 --> 01:53:12,152
that the sauce stays in the pan.

33240
01:53:12,152 --> 01:53:13,787
And I think the social

33250
01:53:13,787 --> 01:53:14,721
and action of active

33260
01:53:14,721 --> 01:53:18,525
inference is when the sauce is spilling

33270
01:53:18,525 --> 01:53:21,961
out of the pan.

33280
01:53:21,961 --> 01:53:22,328
All right,

33290
01:53:23,329 --> 01:53:23,930
Remy, you're

33300
01:53:23,930 --> 01:53:24,931
always welcome

33310
01:53:24,931 --> 01:53:26,766
back, so hopefully

33320
01:53:26,766 --> 01:53:28,401
you'll share some developments

33330
01:53:28,401 --> 01:53:28,968
in this line.

33340
01:53:28,968 --> 01:53:31,805
Good luck with the rest of your work.

33350
01:53:31,805 --> 01:53:33,206
DEAN: Thanks to. You.

33360
01:53:33,206 --> 01:53:35,108
FRIEDMAN: All right. Very well.

33370
01:53:35,642 --> 01:54:13,646
TISON: Bye.
