welcome to the active inference lab the

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,119
active inference lab as i share my

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,200
screen is an experiment in

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,360
online team communication learning and

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,520
practice related to active inference

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,559
you can find us on our website

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,160

from everybody

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,040
to learn more about active inference

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,119
live streams for 2021

36
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,759
you can go to this rb.gui link where

37

you'll find a spreadsheet

38
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,560
today we are on january 26 14.2 with our

second

40
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,360
participatory group discussion on the

41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,360
math is not the territory with author

42
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,640
mel andrews

43
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,520
and next week as we head into february

44
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,200
we'll go to a different paper

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,799
so check out this spreadsheet if you

46
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,560
want to read the papers ahead of time

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,600
and get familiarized with them today

48
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,560
in active infant stream 14.2 we're going

49

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,479
warm-ups and then we're going to walk

52
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:48,799
through

53
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,600
14.2 again being a follow-up on the math

54
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,640
is not the territory

55
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,720
navigating the free energy principle by

56
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,439
mel andrews in october 2020

57
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,759
and we're able just to kind of chill

58
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,920
talk raise some questions that come to

59
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,600
mind as we continue

60
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,360
and then next week we're going to be on

61
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,799
a different wavelength

62

104
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,040
questions we'll just dwell on them

105
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,599
they're just openings and just

106
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,280
opportunities for us to raise the kinds

107
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,640
of things we've been

108
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,680
thinking about today and so what is the

109
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,360
uh what's something you're excited about

110
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,360
today and then also

111
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,680
what did the article or last week's

112
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,399
discussion

113
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,758
make you curious about

114
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,400
so something you're bringing exciting

115
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,400
today or just a question

116
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,040
or even if it's adjacent or it's not a

117
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,560
quote from the paper or anything like

118
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:28,960
that

119
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,040
like who are we that has brought us

120
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,639
today to this conversation

121
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,960
marco and then i believe it's stephen

122
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,560
but stephen and mel if you could add

123
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,120
your name on jitsi but marco and then

124
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,479
uh stephen yeah um

125
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,360
well last last week we uh ended the

126
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,080
discussion

127
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,440
with uh please three pill now me and uh

128
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,120
alex keeper on the uh

129
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,800
uh the prospect of continuing discussion

130
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,400
about the relation between a

131
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,080
thermodynamic entropy and information

132
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,320
through

133
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,360
so very much excited to explore that

134
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,720
because i think that was very crucial

135
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,440
parts in the

136
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,199
paper that deserve more on

137
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,280
cool steven and then anyone else

138
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,080
yeah i'm i'm bringing it an interesting

139
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,280
um dimensionality and and how that

140
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,639
relates in

141
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,759
like high dimensional spaces low

142
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,560
dimension

143
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,639
spaces and entropy so that that was

144
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,840
something that

145
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,759
this paper really kind of got me

146
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,280
thinking about

147
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,880
so i think while it seems very abstract

148
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,199
okay could you also speak a little bit

149
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,800
more directly into your

150
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,400
microphone um but thanks for that so yes

151
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,440
yes okay so definitely um yes

152
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,320
philosophy paper abstract general

153
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,400
theoretical a lot of adjectives that we

154
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,280
hear with philosophy but then this is

155
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,240
almost about the

156
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,880
philosophy of utility and about the

157
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,720
reality of the models that we

158
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,199
make so it's kind of uh has a hand in

159
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,000
both of those

160
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,600
worlds which is what makes it an

161
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,199
interesting thing to think about i'm

162
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,000
also

163
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,240
curious about that intersection of how

164
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,639
do we generalize and abstract correctly

165
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,880
in order that we can make more effective

166
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,680
action

167
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,440
and i'll just put up the last two

168
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,039
questions and anyone else is

169
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,120
welcome to raise their hand what is

170
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,960
something that you liked or remembered

171
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,000
about the paper

172
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,600
and then what is something that you're

173
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,199
wondering about or would like to have

174
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,440
resolved by the end of the

175
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,080
um paper or by the end of the discussion

176
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,400
today

177
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,199
so one thing i'll just start with is uh

178
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,039
if the math and yvonne you can you too

179
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,120
please thank you so if the math is not

180
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,080
the territory

181
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,199
then what what is our metaphor

182
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,080
here like what is the territory or what

183
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,960
is the math

184
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,800
if we're gonna go with the title of the

185
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,400
paper that

186
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,360
the math isn't the territory what is our

187
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,840
uh

188
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,479
complete spatial metaphor if that's even

189
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,520
helpful to

190
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,720
walk down but it's just um

191
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
uh yeah just a few thoughts anyone else

192
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,520
want to raise anything

193
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,440
i i guess i have a maybe a general

194
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,680
question which is um

195
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,800
for mel like uh almost like a

196
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,440
one to ten or how how mel maybe feels

197
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,120
that fep

198
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,599
contributes to like epistemic unfolding

199
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,560
like

200
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,880
the best possible tools to allow us to

201
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,800
ask the most relevant questions

202
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,120
that's

203
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,520
yeah mel yeah i think i so i i think i

204
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,520
i am came at this

205
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,800
with maybe a kind of naive and outdated

206
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,280
view

207
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,400
of of the scientific method

208
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,440
and i really didn't like very

209
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,440
general very abstract models and i

210
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
really didn't like

211
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,720
use of metaphor um

212
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,879
because i saw a lot of the the kind of

213
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,720
mistakes that were being made

214
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,599
with very abstract models and with with

215
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,400
kind of analogy

216
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,160
okay please do not yeah thanks

217
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
make sure that everyone's audio let's

218
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,440
take a few minutes before

219
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,039
the hour begins so that we're here on

220
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,560
time so that everything is prepared but

221
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,840
thanks a lot the audience also

222
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,720
appreciates it now continue

223
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
what happened oh there's just audio on a

224
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,719
loop

225
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,799
cool not me knowers yes not you

226
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,839
although i was also late

227
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,679
yeah so i i i tended to think of um

228
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,800
certain uh

229
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,880
approaches in sciences as being kind of

230
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,800
bad because i saw a lot of

231
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,399
of mistakes that were being made with

232
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,800
them so a lot of um kind of reification

233
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,000
where we start with

234
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,240
an analogy like oh you know we've got

235
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,279
selfish genes

236
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,399
or oh we've got you know borrowing

237
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,399
models from physics into biology you

238
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,040
know and then

239
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,680
and then um confusing them refining

240
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,880
them um but the

241
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,680
the mistakes are not are not the methods

242
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,279
right there's a distinction between the

243
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,880
mistakes that come along with with

244
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,959
certain methods and methods themselves

245
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,560
and there are mistakes that come along

246
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,399
with everything and um

247
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,399
without with any kind of approach you're

248
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,000
going to take complaints

249
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,519
and um especially when it comes

250
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,040
to sort of uncharted waters

251
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,200
um you really need

252
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,399
to be more creative um

253
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,440
you really need more generic models you

254
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,800
need to be borrowing models

255
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,200
from one domain and importing it into

256
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,880
the new domain

257
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,720
kind of casting in that right so when

258
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,959
when you've got um

259
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,160
you know very simple systems and in like

260
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,399
classical physics and chemistry

261
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,440
um you can kind of build up direct

262
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,640
models

263
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,760
um without doing much analogizing right

264
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,959
um but when it comes to dealing with

265
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,000
something like

266
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,040
the human brain or an ecosystem things

267
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,800
you know or even like social structures

268
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,870
were um

269
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,680
[Music]

270
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,680
where we're just sort of out of our gap

271
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,279
you need a lot more

272
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,519
looseness and

273
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,959
for that reason i think when it comes to

274
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,200
the kind of systems that we want to

275
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,399
understand in

276
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,360
future science things like the fcp are

277
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,120
actually going to be

278
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,480
the way to go cool well this whole

279
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,200
future

280
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,959
science i'm sure that's something we can

281
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,720
return to but this was a really

282
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,600
great point that when we're exploring or

283
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,279
constructing a new area

284
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,399
we do need to borrow ideas vocabulary

285
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,959
methods etc because otherwise what is

286
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:01,680
there to be

287
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,000
discussing or converging on but these

288
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,079
come with baggage preconception

289
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,240
and uh just incompleteness because

290
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,240
they're not the godelian incompleteness

291
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,560
just

292
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,160
they're metaphors they're not total

293
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,480
one-to-one of everything so how do we

294
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,120
navigate borrowing from the past but

295
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,880
also moving into something that has

296
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,839
different attributes

297
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,360
so stephen then anyone else

298
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,360
that's a very good point in terms of

299
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,519
um you mentioned about this like does it

300
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,040
belong to science

301
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,560
so we often think about is something in

302
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,720
engineering or applied science or is it

303
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,040
science but then i suppose there's a

304
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,800
question of

305
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,320
when is something useful to have in a

306
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,360
philosophical sense

307
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,959
somewhere in between science and

308
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,880
philosophy so not completely philosophy

309
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,600
but maybe there is another category of

310
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,320
um foundational knowing um

311
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,040
that we kind of then you then use to

312
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,480
build other things upon

313
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,040
so maybe there's something in that yeah

314
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,560
it's it's almost like this question

315
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,240
about whether the natural kinds are

316
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,040
disjoint

317
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,320
or not and then okay all the stuff or

318
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,920
all the approaches that we can take

319
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,720
there's science and not science is that

320
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,240
a clean break

321
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,920
or is there multiple kinds of

322
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,760
non-science even multiple kinds of

323
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,399
science

324
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,360
so this is the demarcation problem and

325
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,079
maybe the

326
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,160
simplest demarcation would just be uh

327
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,120
the bright line

328
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,959
and line in the sand but what if the

329
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,040
demarcation problem is a little bit more

330
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,880
nuanced and it has islands or it has

331
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,279
other

332
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,480
attributes that are not just a

333
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,519
line across the gymnasium floor so mel

334
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,399
i'd be curious

335
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,480
how did you think about the demarcation

336
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,959
problem early on in your research or

337
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:47,600
when you

338
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,680
initiated this and then where has that

339
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,880
taken you on the demarcation problem

340
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,040
which is again about what is science and

341
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,880
what isn't science

342
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,959
yeah i'm um unfortunately i think the

343
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,160
longer i spend

344
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,200
um my background isn't cognitive science

345
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,839
i was doing

346
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,279
i i had some bio background um and some

347
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,480
psychic concerts um so so this is the

348
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,079
first time i've been

349
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,200
you know full-time a philosopher

350
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,279
um and i find that the longer that i

351
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,880
immerse myself in philosophy

352
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,680
um the more equiney and i become which

353
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,240
is

354
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,079
it sort of to my chagrin i i didn't um

355
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,519
expect to see myself going that

356
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,360
direction what is that

357
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,959
sorry what does that mean the quiney in

358
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,720
in this context

359
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,880
yeah um naturalism

360
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,720
which means no backdoor to knowledge

361
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,199
the um the only access we have to

362
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:43,839
knowledge

363
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,040
is empirical so

364
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,480
uh there's

365
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,600
there's like science and there's

366
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,320
commentary on science um

367
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,639
and and there's this i view the

368
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,920
relationship as

369
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,519
as between science and philosophy

370
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,720
um as being

371
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,240
kind of intrinsically connected they

372
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,839
need they need each other you know the

373
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,760
philosophy

374
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,160
comes up with new questions and that

375
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,519
they don't know how to ask yet

376
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,240
empirically

377
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,680
and then we figure out over time ways to

378
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,440
go about these

379
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,839
these questions empirically and we we

380
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,360
come up with methodologies and then the

381
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,160
methodologies

382
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,800
fail they hit a they hit a standstill

383
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,839
and then

384
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,720
um philosophers have to come in and say

385
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,560
well look you know you you've kind of

386
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,000
arbitrarily narrowed yourself to the

387
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,279
outset we need to start thinking a

388
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,320
different way right

389
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,440
um and i don't think i think like you

390
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:39,680
know

391
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,480
in contrast to what what sort of quan

392
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,160
there's a there's a kind of popular

393
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,720
um thought that goes along with

394
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,040
naturalism nowadays which is just that

395
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,160
philosophy is this kind of finite stock

396
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,600
of questions and as we hand off as we

397
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,519
as we pull the questions out of magic

398
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,040
hat and have them off between empirical

399
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,160
sciences

400
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,199
we run out of questions and so

401
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,959
you know fortunately in the near future

402
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,399
philosophers will run out of questions

403
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,600
to ask

404
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,360
because the scientists will have solved

405
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,040
all the questions and then you know then

406
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,560
we'll be out of block right

407
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,199
which i think is just kind of hopelessly

408
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,399
ridiculous

409
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,000
i mean it's it's really a it's a really

410
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,279
simplistic picture and

411
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,600
i'm you know fortunately for me i don't

412
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,480
think

413
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,480
will ever be out of a job i don't think

414
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,079
scientists will ever be out of a job i

415
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,360
don't think philosophers will ever be

416
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,279
out of a job i think i think

417
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,680
there will always be questions for as

418
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,279
long as we persist

419
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,560
um but uh

420
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,839
i i do think that ultimately i am i am

421
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:42,959
starting to come around

422
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,720
to the idea that there's just an

423
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,639
empirical route to knowledge

424
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,759
and um

425
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,240
that means to me where i'm at with that

426
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,880
right now

427
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,800
in in kind of processing that and

428
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,880
digesting that it's um

429
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,320
that there may not be a sharp dividing

430
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,839
like there might not be a a bright line

431
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:08,720
distinction

432
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,320
between science and not fights um

433
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,360
and what i really hate about this is is

434
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,600
i

435
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,040
i really want i really want um

436
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,839
math to be entirely conventional i want

437
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,000
math to be

438
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,040
invented not discovered constructed

439
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,959
and to be a naturalist

440
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,279
about mathematics you have to kind of

441
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,759
record it more

442
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,480
reality and naturalness than i i want to

443
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:40,880
but

444
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,880
you know so that's where i'm at that's

445
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,120
my i might have to but i might have to

446
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,320
bite that bullet

447
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,000
um what what uh stephen was saying

448
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,160
um there's a so the the two people

449
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,680
what you were saying about kind of like

450
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,360
foundational things that come before

451
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,839
science

452
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,480
um this ties into what

453
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,160
uh is being said by uh inez de polito

454
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,119
and um what was said by um matteo

455
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,480
colombo and cory wright

456
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,919
in a 2017 piece um about about first

457
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,839
principles

458
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,439
um so there's a there's a piece 2017

459
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,160
piece called first principles in the

460
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,880
life sciences

461
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,160
something in mechanism um

462
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,559
i think it's in bjps why matteo colombo

463
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,679
and quarter right

464
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,440
about first principles and the fep it's

465
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,880
about the fpp but but

466
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,320
but this first principles approach

467
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,960
in the live chat put it in there so cool

468
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,240
people can check that out

469
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,039
do you want to continue yeah or sarah do

470
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:49,760
you want to

471
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,480
uh go ahead after you've adjusted your

472
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,120
chair but

473
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,679
go ahead yeah i'm pulling a wire from

474
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,559
under my desk

475
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,679
um yeah i have a question for you mel um

476
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,000
i'm

477
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,840
i'm as a person a new student in

478
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,520
philosophy of science i'm bumping and

479
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,120
somebody who came from physics

480
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,160
i'm i'm bumping up against this like

481
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,720
dynamic that i see between philosophers

482
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,080
and science where

483
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,360
you know science will come up with

484
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,640
something and then there's this kind of

485
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,039
like ankle-biter dynamic where like

486
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,320
philosophers will be like well what

487
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,000
about yeah but what about and i'm just

488
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,799
like

489
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,440
i mean i want a more positive conception

490
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,520
of what philosophy can be and the only

491
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:25,919
one

492
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,080
so far that i see that's really clear

493
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,160
and i'm a new student so it's not like

494
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,039
so i'm probably missing a lot but like i

495
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,720
really like chris fields because he's

496
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,840
he's more like

497
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,000
not afraid to be sci-fi you know like

498
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,840
he's not afraid to have a speculation

499
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,400
which is

500
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,160
originally what a lot of philosophers

501
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,400
did so i'm like i just i really want

502
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,799
advice as like a student about what

503
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,480
what how you feel that dynamic can be

504
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,440
we'll go mel with a direct ask and then

505
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,160
marco then stephen

506
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
yeah chris hughes is awesome he gave a

507
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,640
talk recently to our um

508
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,400
to one of our working groups and that

509
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,480
was fascinating a lot of it was over my

510
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,039
head it's

511
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,559
just introducing so many new concepts

512
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,000
but really fantastic

513
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,919
and he's joining in march early march

514
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,440
for active17

515
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,480
he'll be on yes what are we reading

516
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,799
tbd to be determined but we'll find out

517
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,320
very soon fantastic yes

518
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,320
awesome yeah and there's something i

519
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:24,720
read

520
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,280
recently i'm there's a long story um

521
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,880
i i wouldn't i don't want anyone

522
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,919
thinking that i would just go out and

523
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,440
read heidegger because i wouldn't

524
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,679
um what happened was there's a long

525
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:36,480
story about

526
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,760
tracking down quine's typewriter and

527
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,240
and like writing back and forth with

528
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,960
quen's

529
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,440
son and finding a heidegger scholar who

530
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,360
had just acquired the typewriter of

531
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,799
martin heidegger who i used to

532
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,480
correspond with as a kid

533
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,960
um but i ended up reading some height

534
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,840
in in part of as a sort of part of

535
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,600
writing a piece up with a heidegger

536
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,400
scholar

537
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,120
um and uh just just a couple paragraphs

538
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,360
but but there's um

539
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,039
there was this there's a line about um

540
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,400
that uh there's this sort of

541
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,720
um and this is you know this isn't like

542
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,760
at the time of like the vienna

543
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,840
historical at the time of

544
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,840
sort of the the positivism right

545
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,960
and and and there was this line about

546
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,159
logic and philosophy of science kind of

547
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,280
like limping after the sciences and

548
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,080
sweeping things up and putting cobbling

549
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,200
things back together you know like

550
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,280
cleaning up after science

551
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,720
in this very um kind of horrible

552
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,000
lame way um and and it wasn't

553
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,880
contributing

554
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,400
anything of its own it was sort of doing

555
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,679
like you know like logical

556
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,520
reconstruction of

557
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,440
scientific developments but but nothing

558
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,960
that actually really

559
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,200
you know contributed to to furthering

560
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,480
the ends of science and

561
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,400
um haiduker was was declining that

562
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,360
and saying that we need uh a generative

563
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,640
logic

564
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,080
that we need to go back to the model of

565
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,039
um the relationship between philosophy

566
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,080
and science

567
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,480
um of the time of like plato and

568
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,080
uh aristotle and and the

569
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,159
you know thinking ahead of science and i

570
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,799
i i just think

571
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,559
i i very much think that's what we need

572
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,480
and i think to some extent

573
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,320
um there's still very much like a live

574
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,679
tradition in philosophy

575
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,640
that is stuck in this kind of um

576
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,320
we're just we're just describing

577
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,280
we're just doing the bookkeeping right

578
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,000
um

579
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,679
but at the same time there's

580
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,720
i think very much a live and active

581
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,240
tradition of philosophy of science today

582
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,360
that is

583
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,799
that is really thinking ahead of science

584
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,280
and um coming up with new questions

585
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,600
problematizing things

586
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,280
in a way that um that leads to

587
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,799
real breakthroughs cool marco

588
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,360
then steve

589
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,720
thanks yeah i really like the discussion

590
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,159
so far um

591
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,000
i i i i would like to point to the uh

592
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,960
notions of uh abductive inference and

593
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
the uh exploration expectation

594
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,159
um um complementarity uh

595
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,600
to maybe approach this relation of

596
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,919
science and philosophy so i mean i

597
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,640
i also have my qualms with philosophy uh

598
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,919
like sarah and

599
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,799
also noted i i personally really hate

600
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,320
the um

601
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,480
excessive well in my in my view a test

602
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,520
of trend to uh

603
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,679
seem authoritative and absolute tears

604
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,559
and these

605
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,559
weird fetishes enough of universal

606
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,960
truths and stuff i i i'm not fun of that

607
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,919
what i'm more fond of

608
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,280
is is the it's almost for me it's an art

609
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,720
right so it's the art of

610
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,200
taking something a given sets of

611
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
assertions or propositions whatever

612
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,880
and then generating more territory to

613
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,760
explore from that

614
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,880
right so the way i see it is

615
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,400
for under active inference knowledge is

616
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,159
generative right

617
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,960
and so that generativity can be seen as

618
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,640
leading to abductive inference

619
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,600
so it generates new hypotheses um but it

620
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,559
can also be seen as imagination and

621
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,320
um the that level that that that step

622
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,279
of gender generativity is then itself

623
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,360
rooted in what's been generated upon a

624
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,559
direct contact with

625
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,880
empirical reality and so for me it's

626
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,480
like an intermediate kind of step it's

627
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,279
like a

628
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,919
a detour you create all these hypotheses

629
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,440
you explore the maps you create it

630
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,320
yourself

631
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,720
and then you you can return to the

632
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,919
imperial grounding

633
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,000
and so that's kind of how i see uh

634
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,080
philosophy it's kind of a deep work

635
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,600
and like mel said they're they're

636
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,440
inextricably connected without an

637
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,679
empirical basis you have no

638
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,480
grounds uh on which to imagine and

639
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,039
explore

640
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,600
and reconceive right but at the same

641
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,039
time you need to pass back everything

642
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,360
that's recons reconceptualized explored

643
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:19,600
and

644
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,799
imagined these philosophical uh

645
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,679
modes of inquiry can then return to the

646
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,039
scientific realm so it's nice back and

647
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,080
forth at least that's

648
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,840
that's how i see it and then and like

649
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,360
mel said there's no clear demonication

650
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,440
yeah i don't also don't think there's a

651
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,520
clear demarcation it's simply

652
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,200
for me the gradient of how well grounded

653
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,960
it is in the empirical

654
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,840
uh roots of these inferential processes

655
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,840
how much weight does it have

656
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,120
um where the other extreme of the

657
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,400
spectrum would be that

658
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,240
you generate a lot of understanding or

659
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,320
sense or reduced

660
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,600
uncertainty by virtue of this reflexive

661
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,400
engagement

662
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,039
with your knowledge i think ryan smith

663
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,640
had a paper on model

664
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,760
uh expansion and elaboration so maybe

665
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,760
that's also a nice connection that makes

666
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,039
sense cool

667
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,840
but yes um you use them

668
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,480
sorry say again who that was that had an

669
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,279
idea

670
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,320
you just right at the end oh right yeah

671
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,760
yeah i think ryan smith has something on

672
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,360
model expansion and stuff

673
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,400
um but i'm not sure um but also you can

674
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,240
also put the paper on abductive

675
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,919
inference and curiosity and insight

676
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,039
which is actually the paper i

677
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,480
co-authored with the

678
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,159
pearl in 2017 um yeah but that's kind of

679
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,919
what i really always like abductive

680
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,559
influence it's

681
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,880
well yeah inductive reasoning is when

682
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,640
you go from the particular

683
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,279
to the general and then deductive is

684
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,960
when you go from the general or the

685
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,880
philosophical idea to the specific

686
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,000
and then abductive is uh when you go

687
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,840
sort of laterally like your your

688
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,600
abductor or something like that it's off

689
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,559
to the side

690
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,120
and so that's this imaginative or

691
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,480
generative way

692
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,559
that we're talking about as kind of

693
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:07,760
threading between

694
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,000
science with the exploit and philosophy

695
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,960
with the explorer

696
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,559
are we ever going to be trapped into

697
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,400
this dialectic philosophy's broadening

698
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,120
our horizon

699
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,039
and science is narrowing them and then

700
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,039
it's almost like there's this abductive

701
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,600
sideway that we can take where there's a

702
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,159
fruitful

703
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,480
discussion and so that's kind of the uh

704
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,919
niche and the intersection we're

705
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:26,799
reimagining

706
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,480
so stephen and then anyone else who

707
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,240
raises their hand

708
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,600
steven then mel yeah

709
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,440
i think that the actually that's a very

710
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,039
good point about abduction and

711
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,720
in a way you have to say everything that

712
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
we know started with abduction

713
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,080
from a child because it's only with time

714
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,000
that you start to set

715
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,559
um i i often think with induction is

716
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,279
also

717
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,799
you've got a target and you try and

718
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,400
narrow the gap you know

719
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,240
so you but you've got a target so

720
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,679
where's the target come from how did you

721
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,200
know what the target was

722
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,559
um and um

723
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,039
you've also got that question then of so

724
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:03,840
i think this is

725
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,080
these these questions about how they get

726
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,200
applied

727
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,240
are very very relevant to

728
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,640
um to bringing in this question of

729
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,760
philosophy

730
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,000
you know are you applying it to help

731
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,039
scientists

732
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,000
or are you applying the philosophy to

733
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,559
help

734
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,320
you know you decide to sit and how am i

735
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,760
going to sit in church or how am i going

736
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,679
to spiritually be in myself

737
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,159
so you've got this kind of and i think

738
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:28,960
this is where

739
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,440
you're starting to see that the same

740
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,440
philosophical questions being addressed

741
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,640
with the same framework

742
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,320
as opposed to it being like okay

743
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,320
that's for them you know it's starting

744
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,080
to break down some of the silos i think

745
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,120
of how

746
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,120
it hits the ground and i think that's

747
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,120
quite important

748
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,840
yeah now

749
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,919
yeah it's sort of sort of what mark

750
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,120
grove said but also sort of

751
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,880
something you said in the beginning

752
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,640
which is um i guess

753
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,760
dan you said this um which is if the map

754
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,360
is not the territory what isn't that

755
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:03,919
right

756
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,840
if the if the math is not deterred for

757
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,080
what is in that um

758
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,000
uh and i think there's there's a kind of

759
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,480
um classical position in

760
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,960
in i guess both science um and

761
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,840
philosophy

762
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,279
maybe even also the the popular

763
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,399
conception of science um

764
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,200
which is very prevalent in modern times

765
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,159
which is that there are

766
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,919
there are like a finite number of atoms

767
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,360
in the universe

768
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,960
and you know we're we're

769
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,050
picking away at um

770
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,240
[Music]

771
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,919
psychology and we're picking away at the

772
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,760
social sciences and we're picking away

773
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,200
at biology and chemistry

774
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,600
and and so on and so forth but there is

775
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,919
some some fundamental

776
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,120
level of reality you know whether that's

777
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,480
atoms or or you know

778
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,080
whether that's the quantum level or

779
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,919
whether that's string theory or what

780
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:00,480
have you

781
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,159
but there's there's some ultimate level

782
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,600
of reality

783
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,640
and eventually

784
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,320
you know we're going to figure out how

785
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,399
the psychology reduces to the biology

786
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,799
how the social reduces to the psychology

787
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,039
how the biology reduces to the chemistry

788
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:15,919
and fitness right

789
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,960
and then and then we'll be done and i

790
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,720
think that this is

791
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,240
this is a very um mistaken outdated view

792
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,679
of

793
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,480
what um what reality is like but more

794
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,640
more so what are our kind of epistemic

795
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,480
acquaintance with reality

796
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,360
it's like i think it's it is as as mark

797
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,799
was saying far more far more

798
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,880
degenerative right where we're um

799
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,240
we're instead of instead of uh instead

800
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,360
of

801
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,720
kind of constantly reducing

802
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,399
the the allowable frames of reference

803
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,679
for for understanding the world

804
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,440
we're actually um constantly generating

805
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:01,760
them

806
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,080
you know we we are we should be doing

807
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,760
right something like model selection

808
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,399
right

809
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,559
some models some theories some accounts

810
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,039
and the sciences

811
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,440
do similar work to others and are not as

812
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,240
good

813
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,559
and those get weeded out right but we're

814
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,039
also constantly coming up with new

815
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,399
approaches because any frame of

816
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,520
reference

817
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,799
right any any model any theory that we

818
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:27,520
take

819
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,880
is not purely a reflection of

820
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,679
the world out there but will also be a

821
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,960
reflection of our kind of epistemic aims

822
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,520
will also be a reflection of of what we

823
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,720
want to get

824
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,440
out of out of that way of relating to

825
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,799
the world

826
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,840
and so there there you can see how

827
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,559
there's gonna be you know a kind of

828
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,600
infinity of

829
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,399
of possible ways of getting at the world

830
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,080
because they all reflect our

831
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,480
are kind of ultimately subjective aims

832
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,080
as researchers

833
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,640
yes very nice point about the

834
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,480
reductionism is misguided

835
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,000
just the fantasy we're going to keep on

836
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,919
reducing to smaller and smaller pieces

837
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,760
so let's think about the map if someone

838
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,919
says i want a map of california

839
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,679
and someone goes oh no no that's already

840
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,440
been solved it's made up of dirt

841
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,240
see no i don't want that i want to be on

842
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,919
a road trip or i want to be visiting my

843
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:20,559
friends

844
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,799
so when we reintroduce action and

845
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,960
pragmatism and utility

846
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,799
the argument against reductionism is

847
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,200
very obvious which is okay it may be

848
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,559
that as a substrate

849
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,880
but that's not actually how we're moving

850
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,760
forward

851
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,279
and then it's interesting that there's a

852
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,039
computer science algorithm called

853
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,159
map reduce now it's a different map in a

854
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,679
different reduce but it's almost like

855
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,760
action and inference we map we do sense

856
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,440
making and then we reduce

857
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,880
the scope so we map and we we sketch out

858
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,559
in very broad strokes and then we have

859
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,640
to go into that reductionist mode

860
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,559
to go into a little bit more detail

861
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,919
about what is actually

862
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,000
on the road or in the ocean ahead but

863
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,919
we're mapping and reducing or acting and

864
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,039
inferring

865
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,960
with an eye towards the direction that

866
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,480
we're already moving in

867
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,640
not just because we're gonna uh get to

868
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,519
the bottom

869
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,360
of action or the bottom of inference and

870
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,720
then just call it a day

871
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,240
like just like you said it's an infinite

872
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,840
game we're gonna keep on coming up with

873
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,399
questions

874
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,000
and keep on coming up with measurements

875
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,320
for the dialogue between scientists and

876
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,159
philosophers and ultimately just

877
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,799
participants in the knowledge enterprise

878
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:23,440
whatever

879
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,679
somebody's title or profession happens

880
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:26,720
to be so

881
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,080
marco than anyone else

882
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,919
thanks uh daniel that was very beautiful

883
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,919
it's it's the image evoked for me is

884
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:34,799
like uh

885
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,840
a directed cycles of contraction and

886
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,880
expansion

887
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,519
which uh i believe is also very active

888
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,000
in french

889
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,440
but anyways um so so um

890
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,440
about the uh question about the maths

891
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,799
and language and everything so

892
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,159
i my improvised pitch is

893
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,679
the maths or the mathematical model of

894
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,720
active influence effectively describes

895
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,000
how the terrain maps itself so if

896
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,200
terrain is the

897
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,440
thing itself or the actual reality of

898
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,360
the brain or any ecosystem

899
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,880
then active uniform is basically saying

900
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,519
well all the constituents of this

901
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,640
ecosystem or brain for example

902
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640
is constantly deferring each other it's

903
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,320
constantly engaging in mutual and

904
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,480
reflexive inference

905
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,679
and all these inferences will then lead

906
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,679
to models of each other and effectively

907
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:24,320
they all

908
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,880
do this kind of subjective mapping right

909
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,799
but all these subjective maps

910
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,720
over skills and levels then also need to

911
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,360
calibrate to each other and so

912
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,279
yeah if we have to play with words i

913
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,720
would say the maths describe how the

914
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,440
terrain maps itself which i think is

915
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,799
you know quite nice um also uh

916
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,360
it's very strongly echo uh what mel said

917
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:45,840
i was

918
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,600
very briefly worried that that she would

919
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,360
actually argue for reductionism

920
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,399
i should know better of course um yes so

921
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,360
so

922
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,840
if it's appreciated um i really like

923
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,960
thinking in terms of uh

924
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,600
trees so there's a book by uh

925
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,200
julio africa sorry but my favorite

926
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,320
phrase is um

927
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,199
trees of the brain roots of the mind uh

928
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,480
for someone some reason that always

929
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
stuck with me and and basically it's

930
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,960
because there's these generative trees

931
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,520
that

932
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,239
lead to roots at yet another level and

933
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:18,800
so

934
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,918
um again kind to a

935
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,040
uh the previous discussion uh so the

936
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,800
reduction in story is more about

937
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,960
you know sort of essentialism properties

938
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,719
and objects and kinds which are not a

939
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,760
phenomenon

940
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,560
um but complementing that kind of uh

941
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,119
view

942
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,520
is perceptualism and so i really again

943
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,359
think that this generative

944
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,918
perspective is is in spirit with

945
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,199
perceptualism

946
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,918
is how how do these processes actually

947
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,280
structuralize themselves

948
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,760
right how do these flows and dynamics

949
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,320
attain

950
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,839
some kind of regular structure and then

951
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,520
that regular structure will be in the

952
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,960
form of flows and

953
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,359
generative relations um so it's like

954
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,000
generative

955
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
scaffolds and i think that would be an

956
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,760
interesting angle to approach anthology

957
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,440
as well

958
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,200
cool oh oh sorry and one more one more

959
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,720
points if you can is

960
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,440
i also want to echo what mel said about

961
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,079
pluralism right so i think

962
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,160
looking at active infants in my opinion

963
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,839
uh i pray enough to talk about knowledge

964
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,200
because then you get the baggage of

965
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,480
correspondence uh notions of truth and i

966
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,200
i think that's distracting if you just

967
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,560
look at it from an active inferential

968
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,240
perspective actually all knowledge the

969
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,599
value of knowledge is going to be

970
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,200
contextual it's going to be contingent

971
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,800
upon the actual agents

972
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,320
right even though we can say oh it's

973
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,400
just the accuracy of the states in the

974
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,119
world as

975
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,560
as believer as mass but these states

976
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,400
don't have to conform to some

977
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,800
objective truth it's more about given

978
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,640
the states that it has models

979
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,760
if it acts based on these states how

980
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,160
accurate would it be and then there's a

981
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,240
bit of a i guess a pragmatist account

982
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,079
of truth maybe i don't know um

983
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,200
but i guess what i'm saying is that that

984
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,760
that

985
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,560
kind of implies also for epistemology

986
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,760
that it's about the normative

987
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,119
contextuality

988
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,119
and that we really should pursue um

989
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,839
pluralism in science

990
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:14,320
which yeah cool thanks marco we'll go

991
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,359
dave then mel

992
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,880
so i can't hear you dave but you're

993
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,599
unmuted so maybe try to reload or i'm

994
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,119
not sure what's going on there but

995
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,839
mel go ahead

996
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,560
or do you hear dave i don't hear him

997
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:32,880
yeah

998
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,200
i don't okay so yeah mel go for it but i

999
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,320
know that you can hear us steve but

1000
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,599
we're on a live stream so we can't

1001
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,200
figure it out at this moment so mel go

1002
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,560
for it

1003
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,680
um i uh yeah i just want to say

1004
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,799
something effective um

1005
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,599
i think that that what i guess we're all

1006
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:52,480
sort of

1007
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,520
converging to describe that um it

1008
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,040
fits in very very well with the kind of

1009
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,960
bayesian view

1010
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,160
at least at least uh the bayesian view

1011
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,280
of science in the future

1012
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,680
there are some kind of study old

1013
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,800
bayesian views of

1014
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,160
of scientific updating um of

1015
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,440
the late 20th century

1016
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,320
mid late 20th century that um i think

1017
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:16,720
we've

1018
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,920
we've surpassed but but i think

1019
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,839
if we view um

1020
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,920
scientists as kind of subjective

1021
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,480
bayesian agents coming up with like

1022
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:30,960
different

1023
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,760
kind of parallel models of the world and

1024
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,520
adding evidence to these and kind of

1025
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,240
retiring

1026
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,160
models that don't that don't um

1027
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,599
that aren't useful in a way um

1028
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,599
i think this is this is very much what

1029
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,200
we're describing there

1030
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,680
yep it's about these metaphors and we're

1031
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,960
talking about

1032
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,560
understanding the relationship of

1033
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,560
science and non-science that's the

1034
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,599
demarcation

1035
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,280
project and we've heard a couple of

1036
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,359
different metaphors in this introductory

1037
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,280
section maybe dave if you want to reload

1038
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,720
and try again but

1039
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,480
in this introductory section we talked

1040
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,720
about one was like a spectator model

1041
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,240
with the scientists doing the work and

1042
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,839
then there's the peanut gallery

1043
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,839
and the philosophers are either cleaning

1044
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,040
up behind them

1045
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,320
or are confusing in their trail and that

1046
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,599
was the following after

1047
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,400
science metaphor and we talked about how

1048
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,680
that was inadequate

1049
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,119
because there's actually a really

1050
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,960
fruitful bi-directional

1051
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,440
generative relationship and that reminds

1052
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,440
me a little bit of a live stream

1053
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,920
so it's almost like in the context of

1054
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,560
science

1055
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,800
uh on the live stream the people who are

1056
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,640
on the panel are the scientists

1057
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,800
the observable states being emitted

1058
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,320
being viewable to the world the

1059
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,920
empirical states are like the state of

1060
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,040
the live stream

1061
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,920
and then we have all of these curious

1062
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,800
philosophers

1063
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,119
whatever their title or position is in

1064
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,160
the live chat

1065
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,680
and they're commenting asking questions

1066
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,880
and by doing so engaging in this real

1067
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,160
time dialogue

1068
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,720
so we actually have this instantaneous

1069
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,520
system

1070
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,960
where we can talk about how the

1071
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,720
observable states are in feedback with

1072
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,240
what people are saying

1073
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,079
at that moment so it's sort of like

1074
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,839
again it's just a metaphor it's not that

1075
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,599
it carries every single dimension of the

1076
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,760
metaphor through but it's just really

1077
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,359
interesting that there's a

1078
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,280
discussion that can be held amongst many

1079
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,480
people in the live chat

1080
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,160
that's kind of like the philosophy

1081
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,680
literature and then

1082
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,040
the people who are in the live stream

1083
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,040
could just not be looking at the live

1084
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,520
chat

1085
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,800
and that would be like a scientist who

1086
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,880
just tunes out and chooses not to engage

1087
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,079
with that discourse

1088
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,079
or the people on the live stream might

1089
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,680
be obsessed with what is happening in

1090
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,880
the live chat and that could actually

1091
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,920
distract them and

1092
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,680
help them or prevent them from carrying

1093
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,359
out the aims of the stream

1094
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,000
so it's a pretty fun way that our new

1095
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,520
technological affordances

1096
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,920
and the rapidity of them are helping us

1097
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,640
understand

1098
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,720
the relationships and the bi-directional

1099
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,480
dialogue between those who have for

1100
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,200
example

1101
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,200
technical expertise and those who are

1102
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,800
just learning like we've seen on these

1103
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,400
streams and in the model streams

1104
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,880
so dave let's see if we can hear you and

1105
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,440
then

1106
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,280
uh yep how's that yep go for it and then

1107
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,560
sarah okay

1108
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,680
yeah i'm glad you uh mentioned a road

1109
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,319
trip

1110
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:11,839
that um reminds me of my puzzlement why

1111
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,839
people are talking about homeostasis

1112
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:14,599
rather than

1113
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:17,599
allostasis it seems we've got the you

1114
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,440
know and this is a puzzle going back to

1115
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,240
freud's

1116
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,800
uh proposal for a sign project for a

1117
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,480
scientific psychology

1118
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,960
we want to get to nirvana we want to

1119
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,880
stop everything we want to be

1120
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,000
perfectly happy in the eternal now but

1121
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,079
then something happens and it's horrible

1122
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,760
uh that's preposterous that's not how

1123
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,119
any organism ever acts

1124
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,520
organisms want to go through a series of

1125
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,040
states we want to be

1126
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,920
tired so that we can rest and we want to

1127
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,920
rest so we can run around and get tired

1128
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,839
and be a little hungry so that we can

1129
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,839
enjoy the food more we want to follow

1130
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,319
trajectories we want to take road trips

1131
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,359
um was the notion of allostasis

1132
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,240
proven to be useless or to just become

1133
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,920
unpopular because

1134
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,640
homeostasis seems to fit with somebody's

1135
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,400
mathematical formalisms

1136
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,160
i'll give a quick response on that and

1137
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,240
then we'll go sarah marco

1138
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,599
so homeostasis is like the first pass

1139
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,760
absolute value you say your temperature

1140
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,640
returns to

1141
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,520
a certain number so it's homeostatic

1142
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:17,839
it's

1143
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,200
thermostatic you know it's just like a

1144
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,599
thermostat and so at the first pass

1145
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:22,960
somebody who's looking at just the

1146
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,640
absolute value of temperature

1147
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,400
or a blood sugar might note that it

1148
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,480
returns to a certain point

1149
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,720
and then in a static conception of the

1150
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,800
universe rather than this process driven

1151
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,520
understanding

1152
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,040
it's like right if it's returning to

1153
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,640
this value of 10 then

1154
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,319
it's getting homeostatically attracted

1155
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,720
back to 10. but you're taking a look at

1156
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,599
the process

1157
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,680
and the derivatives the rates of change

1158
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,520
and you're like wait it never stops

1159
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,119
in fact it couldn't and it shouldn't

1160
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,040
stop so why don't we just

1161
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,119
focus on the fact that it's doing this

1162
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,880
uh iterate road trip

1163
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,800
that's yes it's returning to 10 a bunch

1164
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,720
of times but shouldn't we highlight the

1165
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,880
fact that it's on a circular road trip

1166
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,119
rather than just say yeah it's at 10. so

1167
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,440
it's really uh two sides the same coin

1168
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,520
whether one chooses to highlight the

1169
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,480
instantaneous

1170
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,119
empirical observation or highlight the

1171
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:09,920
process

1172
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,520
and the approach that the system is

1173
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,440
actually taking to result in those

1174
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,240
observations

1175
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,839
so just like many other things we're

1176
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,520
looking beyond the superficial

1177
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,440
to the generative and to the underlying

1178
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,880
models and that's what is

1179
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,560
revealing all of these patterns across

1180
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,079
systems

1181
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,839
so sarah and then marco

1182
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,560
um i'm i'm stuck on something math-wise

1183
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,400
uh but i think it you know you could

1184
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,680
describe it as conceptual

1185
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,880
as well um you know when i look at uh as

1186
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,160
far as i've gotten anyway with active

1187
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,839
instruments and fep

1188
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,200
you know it's all predicated on

1189
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,960
bayesianism and bayesianism seems to

1190
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,079
have a kind of

1191
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,920
helios in the sense that you do priors

1192
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,200
and you go forward

1193
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,520
but um uh i don't know i kind of bump up

1194
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,119
against like well wait a minute but what

1195
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:55,760
about

1196
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,640
like you know built into fvp there's

1197
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,599
like a feedback

1198
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,000
type mechanism but it's kind of built on

1199
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,240
a substrate that is going forward

1200
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,160
and i find that kind of interesting like

1201
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,920
i wonder about the limitations around

1202
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,319
that

1203
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,119
um and i'm not uh well enough diverse to

1204
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,560
like

1205
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,200
to like say anything more specific but

1206
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,400
another little

1207
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,359
side data point um which hopefully isn't

1208
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,119
a distraction from the question

1209
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,920
is you know you you see a lot now in in

1210
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,599
descriptions of complexity they'll talk

1211
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:26,560
about well

1212
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,160
you you need something that's of high

1213
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,599
dimensionality and that's

1214
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,680
that description is very much predicated

1215
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,119
on the methods that we use

1216
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,839
to to to get those dimensions you know

1217
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,440
it's predicated on the math

1218
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,720
um techniques and i i get uh

1219
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,920
even when i think about this high

1220
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,920
dimensionality thing i keep coming back

1221
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,599
to this like well yeah but you've got

1222
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:46,880
this like

1223
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,520
you know f as a function of x or x y z

1224
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,480
you know like it's not

1225
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,760
there's no feedback in the in the actual

1226
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,160
um

1227
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,839
heuristic well no there isn't a

1228
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,079
heuristic in in the end

1229
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,440
result or in the in the end um

1230
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,520
and you know like fep like let's say it

1231
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,800
converges it doesn't

1232
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,640
quite converge like markup blankets to

1233
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,160
or like the chain

1234
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,319
mcmc does but i don't know you get to

1235
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:11,760
something that's close by energy

1236
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,640
minimization

1237
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,400
but in the end you get to a thing where

1238
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,800
you're like where you like

1239
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,640
something is a function of da da da and

1240
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,319
it never goes back around

1241
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,640
it okay that's just i hope that's a

1242
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,839
useful question

1243
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,560
if anybody has any thoughts around it

1244
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,200
marco

1245
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,040
and then if anyone wants to raise their

1246
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,359
hand to speak to that

1247
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,160
yeah that was very interesting um uh

1248
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:34,560
wait

1249
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,440
oh yeah well daniel already did most of

1250
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:37,920
it but

1251
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,240
i also want to note that um it's also

1252
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,440
really what sarah's talking about so

1253
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,000
there's this

1254
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,720
issue of um having too much freedom in

1255
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,520
how you characterize the system right

1256
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,560
it's it's not really um well defined how

1257
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,760
you're going to define a state space

1258
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,119
especially when we're talking about

1259
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,200
a complex set of systems that model the

1260
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,040
environment so then we have to not talk

1261
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,280
about simply physical observables

1262
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,040
but but more the structures that they

1263
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,040
constitute so for example with

1264
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,480
homeostasis and alastairs it's like

1265
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,599
daniel said there's two sides of the

1266
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:06,720
same coin

1267
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,240
and it needs to be in reference to

1268
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,680
something else so you can say

1269
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,520
homeostasis in terms of

1270
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,920
one perfect temperature and just try to

1271
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,040
stay there

1272
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,480
and then add to that uh next to it

1273
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,720
the processes of anticipation which then

1274
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,920
gets you stasis

1275
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,839
but another way to also look at it is

1276
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,280
for example you can also say

1277
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,560
instead of having one perfect state or

1278
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,000
a value and also talk about viable sets

1279
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
for example the domain or boundary in

1280
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,240
which you in which the agents

1281
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,200
will survive or remain viable and so you

1282
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,119
can say okay then that is the state

1283
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:43,200
being in the boundary being in a viable

1284
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,160
sense then it reduces to one point again

1285
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,240
um which again relates to i think what

1286
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,440
what sarah's talking about

1287
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,760
i think um was a lot i think very

1288
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,800
interesting

1289
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,200
um so about the function thing right so

1290
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,200
so for example you can have

1291
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,400
a a a of blankets it's enacting certain

1292
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,040
functions

1293
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,319
and it's not built in the loop the loop

1294
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:05,920
is not built into the function but the

1295
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,920
function enacts a process right

1296
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,240
it generates perturbation activities

1297
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,280
flows whatever

1298
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,000
that expresses into the environment with

1299
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,760
the expectation that it expresses itself

1300
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,280
back to them

1301
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,839
and so that's left implicit i'm not sure

1302
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,200
if that makes sense also you said

1303
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,560
something about

1304
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,640
um things moving forward and i'm not

1305
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,319
sure what you meant about it but it did

1306
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:27,040
feel like it

1307
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,319
a very interesting angle you were

1308
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,400
pursuing so if you could elaborate it

1309
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:30,880
out i mean

1310
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,040
it was it was just really simply like it

1311
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,400
was just you know you have this idea of

1312
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,240
prior so there's a kind of a teleos

1313
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,160
you're like going forward in the way

1314
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,520
you minimize energy or whatever

1315
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,000
oh so well personally i feel like the

1316
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:44,960
forward

1317
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,359
metaphor that then is the problem right

1318
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,800
it's not necessarily forward

1319
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,560
it's it it's optimizing or

1320
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,040
calibrating or tuning um but i think

1321
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,720
maybe i'm just still an understanding

1322
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,680
um but but it's a constant yeah you're

1323
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,160
right

1324
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,839
that's just that wasn't the right i

1325
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,599
agree yeah the moving forward

1326
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,880
is um related to historiosity and to

1327
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,680
developmental thinking so understanding

1328
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,160
that

1329
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,760
although there might be attributes like

1330
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,599
body temperature that are returned to so

1331
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,920
that's the homeostasis side of the coin

1332
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,079
in another sense there is no state that

1333
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:19,920
the organism returns to

1334
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,480
so it's about how will we understand as

1335
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,079
you pointed the teleos the end well

1336
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,040
there's this local

1337
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,760
end directedness as the prior is updated

1338
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,800
but then

1339
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,040
we're almost using this short-ended

1340
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,160
telios because

1341
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,200
we don't know the ultimate end game and

1342
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,640
as you point out it doesn't necessarily

1343
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,240
have to converge it just has to be the

1344
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,400
most effective model in that ensemble in

1345
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,920
that niche at that time

1346
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,839
and that's who does well on that

1347
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:44,960
statistics test

1348
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,920
or in that you know ocean ecosystem so

1349
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,599
that's sort of this

1350
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,400
updating model and um yeah mel and then

1351
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,280
i'll say something about the

1352
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,000
dimensionality

1353
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,040
yeah and i think i think the

1354
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,839
active inference 300 principle kind of

1355
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:07,119
framework tends to emphasize

1356
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,119
i don't i don't know that this is

1357
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,400
speaking exactly

1358
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,400
to the questions that you're going

1359
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,319
through but um

1360
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:17,040
there's a there's a way in which it it

1361
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,960
kind of

1362
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,920
looks to to kind of hierarchical

1363
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,960
architecture at the exclusion of of

1364
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,720
parallel architecture um we don't

1365
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,079
we we don't often talk about like the

1366
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,280
jockeying of

1367
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,000
beliefs at the same level right is there

1368
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,520
any

1369
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,720
interaction between kind of like models

1370
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,359
that exist

1371
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:46,319
in in parallel that kind of thing um and

1372
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,720
i think that there are

1373
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,440
plenty of you know cognitive phenomena

1374
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,880
that get mixed that way

1375
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,559
or or um in in biology right

1376
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,440
in in organismal biology you know we

1377
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,160
miss stuff

1378
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,480
because um the fep doesn't

1379
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,480
um kind of readily accommodate that as

1380
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,880
i as i have come to understand it and

1381
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,520
use it

1382
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,280
um i don't think it's very good at

1383
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,200
handling that and so that's

1384
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,680
that's one way in which you're sort of

1385
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,280
constraining

1386
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,760
uh how highly conceived of kind of

1387
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,119
um epidemic agents engaging with the

1388
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:29,440
world

1389
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,800
um and and there seems to be a sort of

1390
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,359
like

1391
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:34,880
i guess i guess you could say that there

1392
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,559
seems to be a directionality

1393
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:40,800
to it that is um maybe misleading

1394
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,559
that's that's the time hypercube fep

1395
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,960
question with like the gradient descent

1396
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,880
and the moving forward through time

1397
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,680
what if it's kind of ironically circular

1398
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,160
and that

1399
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,400
we're experiencing it in the downhill

1400
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,800
direction but the hill is just there

1401
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,160
and we're moving through it

1402
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,400
experientially in a way that is

1403
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,599
prospective and it becomes pathological

1404
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,280
and not adaptive when it's not

1405
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,040
prospective that would be like

1406
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,920
prioritizing

1407
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,319
retrospection without an eye towards

1408
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:11,280
anticipation

1409
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,839
and those systems fail to exist so we

1410
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,200
end up having this like

1411
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,520
distilled and extracted understanding of

1412
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,400
our past

1413
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,880
only partial aspects of it with an

1414
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,400
action-oriented view

1415
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,720
towards an uncertain future so that's

1416
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,720
why fep is such an interesting

1417
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,319
framework and as mel just pointed out

1418
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,319
it's not like it's a lateral

1419
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,559
alternative to how the mitochondria

1420
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:34,720
works or how a protein folds

1421
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,359
it's not really a scientific idea at

1422
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:38,160
that level

1423
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,000
but again to take it to this initial

1424
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,599
claim of the paper

1425
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,079
the claim is that the fep can be taken

1426
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,760
to belong properly to the domain of

1427
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,640
science

1428
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,960
so then we're talking about what is in

1429
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,480
the domain of science if we're going to

1430
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,119
be in

1431
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,599
science landia is there only one kind of

1432
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:54,319
model

1433
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:55,920
are there multiple kinds of models are

1434
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,920
those models hierarchical are they

1435
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,040
hierarchical

1436
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,280
how do they depend on one another who is

1437
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,280
involved in producing and communicating

1438
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,480
about those models

1439
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,400
these are some of the very interesting

1440
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,400
questions that are almost within the

1441
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,480
demarcation problem once you're on one

1442
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,160
side the line or the other there's still

1443
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,760
more questions again highlighting the

1444
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,040
fact that it's going to be an infinite

1445
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:15,599
game

1446
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,599
with researchers and philosophers so

1447
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:20,480
marco and then anyone else

1448
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,720
yeah i apologize if not actually covered

1449
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,640
this i couldn't hear it properly

1450
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,960
but um i just wanted to add that at

1451
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,160
least in my view

1452
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,880
the idea of tails for me is at least i

1453
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,839
don't like it because

1454
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,160
i i have an allergy for everything that

1455
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,760
reeks of essentialism

1456
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,920
so telos kind of feels like something

1457
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,680
universal universalistic

1458
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,920
it's almost absolutely great it's like

1459
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,680
what is the kids of this thing

1460
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,599
right but that breaks down when we're

1461
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:48,160
talking about entities or systems

1462
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,440
that are exactly defined in terms of

1463
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,960
their context

1464
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,160
right so so

1465
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,880
each of these systems embedded in a big

1466
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,040
mutually inferring ecosystem

1467
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,000
they are at the mercy of their context

1468
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:04,640
right

1469
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,280
they don't see the world they only see

1470
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,319
the larger worlds

1471
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:11,280
through the directly adjacent systems

1472
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,720
with which they stand in an inferential

1473
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,079
relationship with

1474
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:16,240
right so for me the enormous principle

1475
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,920
of fep is the

1476
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,640
theological principle as in like like i

1477
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:20,960
think

1478
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,200
dan also notes this that the t loss kind

1479
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,960
of is constantly changing

1480
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,960
but there's nothing else to say nothing

1481
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,000
yeah it's not different

1482
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
than saying that there is a normative

1483
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,119
principle

1484
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:33,040
that is defined in terms of the relation

1485
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,880
of the system and its context

1486
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,720
and so that's what i find beautiful

1487
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,800
right so one of my

1488
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,000
key phrases is contextuality um

1489
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,760
because what's effectively happening

1490
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,520
with these systems is they they're

1491
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,520
they're they're enacting inferential

1492
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,200
context for me

1493
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,040
maybe nice parallel is because because

1494
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,160
daniel knows that the livestream

1495
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:52,960
parallel is

1496
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,800
a domain of discourse so what we're

1497
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,240
constantly doing in a live stream

1498
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,000
is we're cultivating or constructing and

1499
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,559
acting upon a domain of discourse we

1500
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,079
keep adding new elements to it

1501
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,440
new perspective new frames and then

1502
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,119
domain of discourse expands

1503
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,319
but it's the same thing for these

1504
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,319
inferential systems these marketing

1505
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:11,280
magnets

1506
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,440
right they are constantly changing their

1507
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,200
domain of discourse when they reconnect

1508
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,319
with other

1509
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:19,280
inferential adjacencies or let's say

1510
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,720
interlocutors

1511
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,079
they change their domain of discourse

1512
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:23,760
because that domain is defined by the

1513
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,119
adjacent systems

1514
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,800
at least in my opinion this is again a

1515
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,640
bit speculative

1516
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,040
away from the brown's truth but i'm

1517
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,400
curious to hear what you think

1518
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,200
the patterns of discourse define the

1519
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,160
interface

1520
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,440
so it's not just that there's the

1521
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,599
essentialist nodes that are then

1522
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,920
like bumper cars on a you know in a chat

1523
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,680
room who are engaging in this thing

1524
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,480
called discourse

1525
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,880
it's like it's a co-construction just

1526
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,480
like you pointed out with the relational

1527
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,800
and the contextual or the ecological

1528
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,720
teleology the purpose is multi-scale

1529
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,800
and it's it's relational and then also

1530
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,880
teleology is just one of the quadrants

1531
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,440
in the two by two with uh aristotle's

1532
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,160
four wise the tin bergens four wise

1533
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,480
so there's the teleological cause but

1534
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,160
also there are the other

1535
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,880
quadrants so there's other aspects of

1536
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,680
why

1537
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,680
that were might be interested in and at

1538
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,359
any given moment the why

1539
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:18,640
that's interesting or meaningful um is

1540
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,960
itself situational but there's also a

1541
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,839
pluralism

1542
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:24,240
there so it's kind of like we're weaving

1543
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,119
these similar

1544
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:28,000
ideas of relational thinking pluralistic

1545
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:28,559
thinking

1546
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,160
and then we're finding that we're kind

1547
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,920
of pluralistic across

1548
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,000
issues like we're okay with people

1549
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,680
having different perspectives in a live

1550
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,240
stream

1551
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,079
we want to have a plurality in the

1552
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,680
literature but then at the same time

1553
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,559
that's that

1554
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,520
expand cycle and then there has to be

1555
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,400
the reduce

1556
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,720
cycle because if we have pluralism that

1557
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,480
leads to somebody thinking that we

1558
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,400
should capsize our ship

1559
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,640
it's not that it's uh you have to do it

1560
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,640
on all possible universes this is like

1561
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,440
simply

1562
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,520
wrong it might be enough for someone

1563
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,119
just to say it's not my preference

1564
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,520
it's not my c vector that this ship get

1565
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,520
capsized so that's not a policy i want

1566
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,559
to engage in

1567
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,559
so it's kind of like this moderated

1568
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:07,760
pluralism

1569
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,640
and this uh pragmatically oriented

1570
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,440
dialogue with

1571
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,599
philosophy and science stephen and then

1572
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:16,079
anyone else

1573
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,599
and that's this pragmatism and being

1574
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:20,720
able to move between

1575
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,280
scales the the idea and it talks in the

1576
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,240
paper you know about

1577
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,640
thingness the idea of the something

1578
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,839
being a thing

1579
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:29,200
even if it's not a living thing you've

1580
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,200
got that and i'm curious it

1581
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,680
didn't actually quite doesn't actually

1582
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,640
quote the

1583
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,680
the markovian monism sort of

1584
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,400
tag in there as that so i'll be curious

1585
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,119
if that

1586
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:42,720
that was a particular choice they didn't

1587
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,240
get locked in by that

1588
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,520
um but um this this this

1589
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,559
idea of dimensionality is if the free

1590
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:51,280
energy

1591
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,839
principle or is based on entropic

1592
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:59,440
change and entropic is is dimensionless

1593
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,839
to some extent it's just a scalable

1594
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:05,760
eigenvector sort of

1595
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,240
um i don't know what you'd even call it

1596
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,280
quality

1597
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,040
and then it goes into thing this then it

1598
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,960
goes into

1599
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,119
some sort of process theory which

1600
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,440
has to have dimensions at some point you

1601
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,400
know so

1602
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,040
you know we want you to in some ways

1603
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,040
once you go into active inference and

1604
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,119
there has to be

1605
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,119
dynamics across things you start to have

1606
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,880
dimensions or maybe certainly once you

1607
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:31,280
have

1608
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,119
something that's nested inside something

1609
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:35,040
else and that's

1610
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,680
that um i just think that's really

1611
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,359
interesting i'll be curious what mel

1612
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:42,839
what male's thoughts are about how the

1613
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:44,720
dimensionality

1614
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,760
drops in and out between thingness and

1615
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,040
say pure entropy

1616
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,400
and um and and just maybe why she didn't

1617
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,240
put in markovian monism

1618
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,280
was that a choice for um

1619
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,599
sort of reasons of not getting caught up

1620
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,200
in it or does she not agree with it or

1621
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,559
something like that could you just

1622
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:05,359
briefly introduce what markovian

1623
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,760
modernism is or why is it exciting or

1624
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,200
relevant to you okay so

1625
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,720
well markovian monisms um is the kind of

1626
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:18,640
overarching overarching philosophical

1627
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,839
um uh

1628
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:25,440
sort of uh paradigm where

1629
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,040
the um the the the idea of

1630
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,680
something being in the world is because

1631
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,480
there's

1632
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,640
there is a differentiation between

1633
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,720
what's outside and what's inside

1634
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,440
and therefore there's a sense and and

1635
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,000
the nature

1636
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,559
of how that inside and outside dynamic

1637
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:43,760
is structured

1638
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,480
even be it a stone in terms of the

1639
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,720
stones stays as being the stones that

1640
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,119
somehow the forces inside balance

1641
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:52,640
its relationship to the environment

1642
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,040
outside and therefore

1643
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,160
there isn't um there isn't this dualism

1644
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:58,480
of

1645
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,160
the stone and purely outside the stone

1646
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,799
as a complete separation there's this

1647
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,839
somehow

1648
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:10,240
um emerging so everything is

1649
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,280
to my understanding this is is monism is

1650
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,000
there's

1651
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,440
kind of a an underlying kind of

1652
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,480
unifying kind of uh

1653
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,280
dynamic that we um which sort of builds

1654
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,599
on sort of ideas of david bone

1655
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:29,280
and the kind of um that those sort of

1656
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,559
principles that there's something in the

1657
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,000
background which is

1658
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,760
um more um implicit

1659
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,640
in our existence if i've said it right

1660
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,920
but that's my understanding

1661
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,920
okay it's definitely a uh you know big

1662
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,040
and deserving

1663
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,359
topic usually the monism would mean that

1664
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,680
there's basically one kind of thing

1665
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,599
dualism would be the idea that there's

1666
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:51,680
perhaps two kinds of things

1667
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,720
so the one type of thing in monism

1668
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,119
whether it's matter or whether it's mind

1669
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:58,960
is being manifested differentially

1670
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,040
these two views often converge because

1671
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,640
the monus will say yes but it looks like

1672
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,400
two things or the duels will say yes but

1673
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,599
they're interconvertible or they

1674
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,880
associate with each other

1675
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,240
so it's a little bit of a weedy area

1676
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,319
so if there's any thoughts on that where

1677
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:14,160
you can happily hear that

1678
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,720
otherwise let's um maybe slowly walk

1679
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,280
through

1680
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,440
some of these slides and just highlight

1681
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,799
some of the very

1682
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:23,680
nice points of the work itself and then

1683
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:24,880
just think about how that kind of

1684
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:25,839
springboards us

1685
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:29,119
into 2021 and beyond why not

1686
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:32,640
sound good yep all right cool yeah

1687
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,079
go first and then we'll continue on i

1688
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,319
could yeah i could respond quickly um

1689
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:39,599
so there there's a paper um

1690
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,280
a few years ago that presented um

1691
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,480
one view on consciousness that that carl

1692
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,680
christian was a uh an author on um

1693
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,079
and i think the the phrase that stuck

1694
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,520
was something about the cartesian

1695
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,319
theater

1696
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:58,240
so it was it was very much a um

1697
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,839
kind of classical duelist uh account

1698
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:06,000
um and uh this more recent

1699
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
one right this is this is just this past

1700
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,200
year right

1701
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,400
um the the markovian modernism one yeah

1702
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:12,799
so

1703
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:15,359
it's another it's an updated view on

1704
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:16,640
it's an updated take on

1705
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,400
on the consciousness problem on the one

1706
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,000
body problem um

1707
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,160
that question is also an author on um

1708
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,599
i think it's interesting it's an

1709
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:28,960
interesting um

1710
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,240
they're doing interesting stuff for the

1711
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,799
formalism with the information geology

1712
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:37,520
stuff um i used to be very

1713
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,960
um compelled by

1714
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,119
the the problem of consciousness but

1715
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,799
then my body problem i was very um

1716
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:48,720
i worked with that as my undergrad that

1717
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,400
was my uh so that was

1718
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,640
that was a big thing for me right now i

1719
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,400
was like interested in evolution and

1720
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,839
interested in consciousness

1721
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:05,760
a couple years away from the mind body

1722
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,760
problem before i come back to it so i'm

1723
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,559
trying to like

1724
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,400
i try to like keep my blinders on and

1725
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,920
focus on

1726
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,119
on like one or two problems at once

1727
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,000
yep philosophy has that feature of you

1728
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,520
pull on one question and then all of a

1729
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,119
sudden you're asking how do i know

1730
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:23,680
and who am i what are we it's because

1731
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,400
they're all

1732
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,680
very linked up and kind of like it could

1733
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,960
be the same with science you make a

1734
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,559
measurement about the gazelle and then

1735
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,000
you want to know about the cell

1736
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,839
but in philosophy it's almost hitting

1737
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:35,119
you all at once

1738
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:37,680
and there's less clarity about how to

1739
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,839
structure those questions

1740
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:41,760
and that's actually part of what i think

1741
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,839
these conversations help clarify because

1742
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:45,839
in the example of the animal we know

1743
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,599
that there's a certain nesting

1744
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:49,599
or interactions between different types

1745
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:50,960
of biological entities

1746
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,200
and so we can coarse grain and that

1747
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,319
allows us to make

1748
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:56,319
useful decisions like about wildlife

1749
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:57,599
management or something like that

1750
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:00,559
again with an end in mind and a team and

1751
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:01,440
a method in mind

1752
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,359
we can do useful science and so the

1753
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:05,119
question is with the method in the team

1754
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:06,000
and the question

1755
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,920
how could we do useful philosophy and

1756
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,760
then maybe even move beyond these

1757
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,599
titles overall and just have the group

1758
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:13,680
working on the project with the approach

1759
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,039
so marco then mel

1760
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:19,760
i just briefly wanted to uh uh joining

1761
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,039
the social unconsciousness

1762
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:22,480
because i'm not out of it yet i'm still

1763
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,319
obsessed by it um

1764
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:26,160
so so so i think the beauty of

1765
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,839
microphone is or

1766
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:31,280
or dual aspect mode uh is is

1767
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,200
because the most beautiful thing for me

1768
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,559
for active inference is

1769
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,960
the emphasis and the primacy of

1770
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,000
mutualism

1771
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,400
right that nothing is without context

1772
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,240
nothing is seen in context

1773
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,280
um and that all their so-called identity

1774
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,680
so-called properties so-called t-loss

1775
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,359
these are just heuristics we've

1776
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:51,200
accumulated over the years in

1777
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,160
ignorance of the relational nature of

1778
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,440
these systems

1779
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,359
and so the beauty is that these

1780
01:02:57,359 --> 01:02:58,880
relations

1781
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,799
of relations of relations these tangles

1782
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:02,000
of relations themselves

1783
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,799
become thing-like because they

1784
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:07,119
facilitate or allow for

1785
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:09,440
instantiation of a coherent activity i

1786
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,039
forgot what the papers i've been trying

1787
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:11,760
to find it's

1788
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,520
i privacy dig on twitter but there's a

1789
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,440
very nice paper about how some nerve

1790
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,960
populations that might for example

1791
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,240
hypothetically

1792
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:21,119
are about encoding cats this just put it

1793
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:22,000
very simply

1794
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,760
and they're just constantly chaotic

1795
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,920
until they get an input

1796
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,760
that is relevant or comes from sent data

1797
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:30,160
about

1798
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,400
cats and then that chaotic high

1799
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,200
dimensional

1800
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,839
noisy stuff collapses into a particular

1801
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:36,799
order

1802
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:38,480
um and i think it's also interesting for

1803
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,160
you stephen because you also think about

1804
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,039
spaces

1805
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:43,760
and and this relates to a lot of well

1806
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,280
some people think it's too hyped but the

1807
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,559
work on manifolds

1808
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,160
and computational manifolds in

1809
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,000
neuroscience so

1810
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
the weird thing is you have this really

1811
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,920
uh you know a lot of neurons and

1812
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:54,720
population

1813
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,039
and they're related to a relatively

1814
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:58,000
challenging

1815
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
imperative problem but then for some

1816
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
reason when you analyze the data

1817
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,160
um you can obtain a manifold you just

1818
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,839
say well the neural population

1819
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:07,359
is basically just traveling on this low

1820
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:08,960
dimensional manifold so that's very

1821
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,000
interesting

1822
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
the interpretation of that is another

1823
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,119
topic but but

1824
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:14,640
since you asked about the nationality

1825
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,960
i'll just add that

1826
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:20,799
yeah actually mel

1827
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,200
yeah it's what what you're saying just

1828
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,359
reminded me

1829
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:27,680
i had a thought yesterday i was i was

1830
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,039
trying to

1831
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:31,599
nail down one thing and of course you

1832
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:33,119
know there's this

1833
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,559
right you you pull at one thread and

1834
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:38,079
everything unravels um

1835
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:40,880
um i i see that there there can be a

1836
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,640
kind of systematic way of going but i

1837
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:42,960
think

1838
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,400
i think philosophy is good it's not so

1839
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,200
chaotic

1840
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,920
it's it's right it's it's using the same

1841
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:50,960
kinds of

1842
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,319
of of conceptual tools

1843
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:56,480
just not with the formal rigor of

1844
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,319
mathematics but but there's still kind

1845
01:04:58,319 --> 01:04:58,880
of a

1846
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,880
uh system it's just so it's sort of like

1847
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,079
you know a mean field approximation or

1848
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:09,359
um solving a system of of

1849
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:11,440
differential equations approximately

1850
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,400
right where you're

1851
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,280
you're um you're you're taking you've

1852
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,200
got you know these 11 moving pieces and

1853
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,720
you're taking 10 of them

1854
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:22,640
and your your either sampling over them

1855
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:23,119
to get an

1856
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,359
average value or you're you're

1857
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:26,720
approximating them and you're you're

1858
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,280
kind of like

1859
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,039
freezing you know you've got all these

1860
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:30,400
dynamic moving pieces but you're

1861
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,400
freezing the values

1862
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:37,680
you know so so to do this paper right um

1863
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,559
there's no one definition of what a

1864
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:41,680
model is

1865
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,160
right in philosophy of science there are

1866
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,440
you know

1867
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,520
50 people working on models and they

1868
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,359
have you know

1869
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:51,680
at least eight different like distinct

1870
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,760
conceptions of what a model is and

1871
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,400
and what a model is rests on what

1872
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,799
similarity is what representation is

1873
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:01,119
what analogy is right and when it and

1874
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:02,880
then you you know you dig into these and

1875
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,160
they're all these different conceptions

1876
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,359
of what similarity is and what

1877
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:07,119
representation is and what analogy is

1878
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:07,920
right

1879
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,119
um we don't know exactly what a theory

1880
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:12,720
is we don't know exactly what a

1881
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:17,280
uh the scientific method is right

1882
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:21,599
but to to drill down on one thing

1883
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:24,160
you've got to kind of stipulate you've

1884
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,760
got to kind of like average over the

1885
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:26,720
literature

1886
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,960
and find what it is that's that's a kind

1887
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,799
of commonality and what we think about a

1888
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:31,440
model

1889
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,280
and kind of stipulate well you know no

1890
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,160
one no one agrees on exactly what a

1891
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,880
model is but a model is approximately

1892
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,720
this thing and in order to figure out

1893
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,799
you know what this one model is doing we

1894
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:44,480
can sort of stipulate

1895
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:48,000
roughly what a model is um

1896
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,359
and it it connects

1897
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:52,880
quite similar i think to what we're

1898
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,720
doing in math and physics

1899
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:58,559
but um just using language

1900
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:01,760
yes um mel i think you've taught me more

1901
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,400
in that like whatever three minutes than

1902
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,480
i learned from all my professors so far

1903
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,240
so thanks yay that's fun stuff i agree

1904
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,039
that was really

1905
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:14,480
awesome and again it's like philosophy

1906
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,599
and science we're almost

1907
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:18,000
converging on this approach if not just

1908
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,760
converging on the conversation because

1909
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,520
when you were talking about how many

1910
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,280
definitions of models there were i

1911
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,119
thought about how many definitions of

1912
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:25,760
foraging

1913
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,240
there were for insects or definitions

1914
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,440
that go beyond insects

1915
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,880
and then i thought about well when we

1916
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,960
measured it in the field we said it has

1917
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:33,520
to be

1918
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,359
walking in a straight line with

1919
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:36,640
mandibles empty

1920
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,160
between this time of day and this time

1921
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,839
of day and there's no single point that

1922
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:41,599
we would draw the line in the sand is it

1923
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,200
one meter is it three meters

1924
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,119
it's always going to be like you said

1925
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:46,720
it's about looking at the distribution

1926
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:47,520
of the literature

1927
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,039
if it's outside of the bounds of

1928
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:50,720
literature you're going to have a lot of

1929
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,640
justifying to do to the reviewers that

1930
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,920
doesn't mean it's wrong

1931
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,280
it just means that you're going to be

1932
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,200
having to make special claims like

1933
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,160
you're going to have to write

1934
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,559
an extra subsection in your paper to

1935
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,240
justify why you did that

1936
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,839
um but then if you use exactly what the

1937
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:05,920
literature did again whether it's right

1938
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:06,640
or wrong

1939
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:09,200
it doesn't ask to be justified and so

1940
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,119
people who are operating within that

1941
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:13,440
center of that mean field approximation

1942
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,160
they kind of just

1943
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,158
point outside and they don't need to do

1944
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:18,000
an internal justification

1945
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,640
of their choices or of their approach

1946
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,158
and then you just said like you have to

1947
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:23,359
freeze other things

1948
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:25,600
so you did the scholarship to show there

1949
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,560
was this whole section on

1950
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,640
scientific modeling and then all you can

1951
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,238
really do is trace out

1952
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:32,960
the if then you said if you are feeling

1953
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,158
this way about models

1954
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:36,319
then you would be consistent in thinking

1955
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:38,560
this and it's not that it's better

1956
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,319
to be consistent versus have cognitive

1957
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:42,080
dissonance it's just that you can do the

1958
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,359
scholarship and trace out

1959
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:45,439
the if-thens of thought so it's just a

1960
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,560
fun way

1961
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,880
because there's probably people who are

1962
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,799
hopefully listening to this and curious

1963
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:52,238
about the conversation

1964
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:53,759
who are coming from the philosophical

1965
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:55,920
side or from a scientific or from an

1966
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:56,640
engineering

1967
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,560
background and so it's like there are

1968
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,679
similarities across

1969
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:01,839
all of our experiences like the need to

1970
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:04,158
iterate the need to freeze specific

1971
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:05,439
subparts of a model

1972
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:07,279
whether it's qualitative or quantitative

1973
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:08,960
and then work with teams and with

1974
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,000
literature

1975
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,719
corpuses that aren't just giving a

1976
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:14,560
single resounding answer for what is a

1977
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,238
model or what is a foraging trip

1978
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:19,120
so really just important nomadic ideas

1979
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:19,600
that we're

1980
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,198
broaching here so it's just good to take

1981
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:22,960
stock of that so marco and then we're

1982
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,319
gonna just walk through a few of these

1983
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:26,640
slides

1984
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,919
unmute marco

1985
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,880
um yeah i was saying you you've again

1986
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,479
relieved me of a lot of stuff i wanted

1987
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:36,960
to say

1988
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,399
um but but yeah i also echoed this um

1989
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:42,238
i think what we're seeing also in

1990
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:43,439
philosophy and

1991
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:46,640
science is moving away from or moving

1992
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,839
towards pluralism

1993
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:49,600
and i don't i don't think it's a problem

1994
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,000
that there's no consensus on the single

1995
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
model i mean the model is not a natural

1996
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,800
client it's a concept we we're using

1997
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:57,360
because

1998
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,640
our again non-natural or abstract

1999
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,440
processes of inquiry necessitated the

2000
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:04,239
phrase

2001
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:06,800
model and so a model itself is

2002
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:07,600
contextual

2003
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,679
or context dependent so it's kind of a

2004
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:10,960
fear relatedness

2005
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,040
or context lateness or normal bladeness

2006
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,239
i guess

2007
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:16,239
but i also like the the comments of now

2008
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:17,679
systematicity right so

2009
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:20,320
we've inevitably accumulated all these

2010
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:21,840
conceptual tools

2011
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,040
and inevitably people will try to find

2012
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,640
system testing between them

2013
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,960
and i'm kind of wondering uh in a weird

2014
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,199
reflective way if activision also can

2015
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:34,159
shed light or uh make interesting uh

2016
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:36,000
that phenomenon of

2017
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,960
of what we constantly said uh letting

2018
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:40,960
the fly out of the flyball

2019
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,880
we've surrounded ourselves with so many

2020
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,080
tools bonded together

2021
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,880
with systematicity without actual real

2022
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,320
justification

2023
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:49,679
uh and so we're kind of trapped in that

2024
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,840
fly bottle because we haven't had

2025
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,000
an alternative so you know who knows

2026
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,199
active instruments can

2027
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:57,440
fulfill we can stand stream so on the

2028
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,480
fly bottle

2029
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,400
um in undergrad i worked in a fruit fly

2030
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,560
genetics lab and the joke was you'd have

2031
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,239
to fly in the bottle and you'd say

2032
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:05,920
there's the fly in its natural

2033
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,080
environment because it couldn't live

2034
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,600
outside the lab it would get selected

2035
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,440
out so it's like no we're studying it in

2036
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,000
its natural

2037
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,239
environment now that was laboratory

2038
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:15,120
biologists

2039
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,719
who were just very aware of how

2040
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:18,719
selection works but it's such a deep

2041
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:20,560
insight into like yeah you are always

2042
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,239
studying it in its setting

2043
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:24,320
whatever it is and then you just

2044
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,760
broached upon this contextual and

2045
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:26,960
relational thinking

2046
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,480
and then also that modeling it's not

2047
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,320
just about the object or the essence or

2048
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,360
the natural kind

2049
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,440
model is a verb so it's like the

2050
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:34,480
dynamical

2051
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:37,840
and the relational approach is coming

2052
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,600
and imbuing all of the things that we're

2053
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,360
working on so steven's working on

2054
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,480
performance

2055
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,400
mel is working on the history of thought

2056
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,159
and about the discourse that's happening

2057
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:46,800
at a very

2058
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,320
high level we're all working on

2059
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,920
different attributes here

2060
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,760
and then there's something that we can

2061
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,760
align around like a strange attractor

2062
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:54,239
itself

2063
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:55,920
and that's that we should probably be

2064
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,080
thinking about context relationships

2065
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,560
dynamicism multi-scale models so that's

2066
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,320
what crosses systems and that's really

2067
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:02,719
the

2068
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:04,880
fun conversation that gets to emerge in

2069
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:05,760
these moments

2070
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,360
good i'm glad that people got riled up

2071
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,040
by that so let's go

2072
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:12,640
stephen then dave then mel

2073
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,960
one thing that also comes to mind i

2074
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,640
think that's quite pertinent maybe in

2075
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,239
the broader

2076
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:21,120
context which everyone the universities

2077
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,719
you see it this interdisciplinarity

2078
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:26,560
transdisciplinarity participation

2079
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,080
um mostly

2080
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,560
it's words that the universities are

2081
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,239
getting into because they

2082
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:36,960
they start but that it raises massive

2083
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,320
questions because

2084
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,760
um how do you start to not just try and

2085
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:42,480
contest

2086
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:45,520
an idea within a field or you need to

2087
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,440
work between fields across fields

2088
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,280
you need to bring in context and

2089
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,960
multiple contexts

2090
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:53,760
and i think this you know question about

2091
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:54,719
how we actually

2092
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:58,239
start to understand knowing and at fuzzy

2093
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,159
levels of knowing

2094
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,000
which actually opens up potential to

2095
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,199
bring in people who are more

2096
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:04,960
marginalized

2097
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:08,800
because they have other ways of knowing

2098
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,000
and experiencing you know and

2099
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,080
they are better adapted probably to

2100
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,520
survive in some very difficult

2101
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,480
conditions

2102
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,520
compared to the the research themselves

2103
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,000
you know

2104
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,640
so sort of without making the you know

2105
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:23,920
the genetic

2106
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,840
comparison but you know the the whole

2107
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,520
ecosystem and bringing it all together

2108
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:28,239
so i

2109
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:30,000
i just wanted to bring up that question

2110
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,679
of like how all of this

2111
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:34,800
does relate to transdisciplinarity um

2112
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,199
and the need to do that with the world

2113
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:40,239
in the state that it is

2114
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,000
okay chill dave and then mel and then

2115
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,320
we're gonna move through sight

2116
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,800
yuck panks up and made a comment along

2117
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,800
the lines of your fly bottle

2118
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:54,000
um he found he could not work with white

2119
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:54,960
rats these

2120
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,640
specially bred rats when he's

2121
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,320
researching the evolution

2122
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,960
and the socialization of emotion because

2123
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,719
these are completely artificial

2124
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:03,520
creatures

2125
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,800
with no normal rat emotions you can't do

2126
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,400
those things to a

2127
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,600
a real rat that

2128
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,920
rat runners do with white rats what he

2129
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:14,800
took was

2130
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,000
your regular old brown

2131
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,239
alley rats the nasty horrible rats that

2132
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:21,600
everybody's afraid of

2133
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,080
raised them around people for a couple

2134
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,320
of generations was really careful not to

2135
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:26,960
select

2136
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,679
out anything and they just got to loving

2137
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:31,679
people that could play with you and come

2138
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:33,760
over to be tickled and they'd giggle and

2139
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,199
have a wonderful time

2140
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:37,120
and he says you know these are real

2141
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,880
things these are actual animals that

2142
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,800
could that survive in the wild i could

2143
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,480
let them go and they'd go out and live

2144
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,280
the

2145
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,600
white rats would be just wiped out

2146
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,040
overnight

2147
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:50,480
okay fair to say that yes it's not about

2148
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,840
the exterior

2149
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,960
shades in any species mel on anything

2150
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,679
else you want to say there

2151
01:14:57,679 --> 01:14:59,360
i actually forget what what i was going

2152
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,040
to understand but

2153
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,679
yes chill it is very interesting and

2154
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:04,880
it's always the real

2155
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,199
environment and who's adaptive and who's

2156
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:09,040
not it's it's not something that can be

2157
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,440
speculated before the ecosystem emerges

2158
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,199
because most species go extinct and

2159
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:14,400
there's insects that

2160
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,080
had a strategy for 100 million years and

2161
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,080
then they went extinct and it was always

2162
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,440
situational and

2163
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,280
interesting questions though so we're

2164
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,719
gonna pass over the

2165
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:24,800
abstract and also there's about half an

2166
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:25,840
hour left

2167
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,000
in case people want to put any questions

2168
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,120
in the chat

2169
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,920
so in the roadmap i think it's a good

2170
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,080
place to pause on our road trip

2171
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,239
analogy we can start a we can see some

2172
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:37,360
of these terms

2173
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,000
that we've brought up in the discussion

2174
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:40,719
reflected

2175
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:43,600
by sections in the paper so um and by

2176
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:44,800
the way if anyone has to leave that's

2177
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,080
always chill um mel go ahead

2178
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,960
i have to leave yes thank you i saw i

2179
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,000
saw the time drawing

2180
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,920
near mel thanks so much for

2181
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:56,960
participating in 14.1 and two

2182
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,440
it was just obviously great discussions

2183
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:00,080
and you know

2184
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:01,760
apologies for bashing you after you

2185
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,120
leave no thanks for

2186
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,920
coming on oh please do yeah in any other

2187
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,760
future discussion you're always welcome

2188
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,280
to contribute your perspective so we'll

2189
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:10,800
hope to see you soon

2190
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,000
fantastic thank you cool

2191
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,120
so nice we can all you know continue to

2192
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,880
go around but really interesting stuff

2193
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,320
we did hear a lot of these

2194
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,920
things let's look at this table and

2195
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,400
maybe are there any terms that we

2196
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,960
haven't really brought up we've talked

2197
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:27,440
about

2198
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:30,480
for example i'll mention mean field

2199
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,000
i can see a few things already but maybe

2200
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,360
someone can raise their hand and pick a

2201
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,320
term that

2202
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:35,920
they don't see how it's fitting into the

2203
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,679
things we've already brought up because

2204
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:39,600
these discussions it's like it's not the

2205
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,280
end-all be-all it's just a couple of

2206
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:42,480
hours mel probably spent

2207
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,239
hundreds of hours writing the paper so

2208
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:46,080
we're just sharing our perspective

2209
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:48,560
seeing at the first pass how these ideas

2210
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,640
are associated and then there's a paper

2211
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,000
and a literature and a research

2212
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,840
community to delve into

2213
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,760
if some connection is interesting so

2214
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:56,800
someone's like well with the connection

2215
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:57,360
between

2216
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:00,400
6.1 and 4.3 was really exciting so

2217
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,400
dave what would be something cool to go

2218
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,679
into

2219
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:06,239
yeah um i first encountered the term

2220
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:08,480
free energy in economics where it means

2221
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,239
something just dramatically different

2222
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:12,480
it's a good thing in economics

2223
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,520
um but the closest that i've

2224
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:18,719
seen to a use with the connotation that

2225
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,000
that we've been using

2226
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,679
is as anxiety free floating anxiety

2227
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:25,600
paralyzing terror then i don't know

2228
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,800
what's wrong

2229
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,000
is that uh off the wall

2230
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,400
this is fun um it's definitely an

2231
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,600
unconventional

2232
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,840
economics interpretation of free energy

2233
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,040
but it just shows

2234
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,120
how when using terms it's always

2235
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,560
important that we understand

2236
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,040
where we're coming from because in a way

2237
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:43,840
that's what this

2238
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,159
paper and also several other people

2239
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:47,280
papers have um

2240
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:48,640
brushed upon which is there's a

2241
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,800
thermodynamic aspect

2242
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,840
to free energy gibbs free energy which

2243
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:54,400
is like

2244
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,800
after you ignore the activation energy

2245
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,400
so whether or not the kinetics of the

2246
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,080
reaction are such that it does

2247
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:03,280
go down after the reaction has occurred

2248
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:06,400
delta g change in free energy is like

2249
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,640
how exothermic the reaction was is what

2250
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,239
draws the reaction forward

2251
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:12,719
and so you have a candle it's like water

2252
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:13,520
in a dam

2253
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,520
it isn't spilling over and then the

2254
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,840
delta g is negative so it wants to burn

2255
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,120
and then when the activation energy

2256
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,560
occurs it does burn so that's the

2257
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,920
thermodynamics

2258
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,840
free energy there's more to say there

2259
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:24,960
and that is actually

2260
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,199
addressed in mel's section on

2261
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:29,199
statistical and thermodynamics

2262
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:31,520
the origins of this free energy term in

2263
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:32,960
this setting

2264
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,880
are from again statistical and

2265
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,159
thermodynamics

2266
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:38,480
but as that became more and more

2267
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,560
integrated with information theory

2268
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,880
what's called the epistemic turn there

2269
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,719
became more and more of a marriage

2270
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:47,199
between physical interpretations of free

2271
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:47,920
energy

2272
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,800
and more informational or statistical

2273
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:51,840
and even bayesian

2274
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,600
and computational understandings of free

2275
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,520
energy so then

2276
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:57,120
we were at this point where free energy

2277
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:59,199
was being used pretty fluidly as a

2278
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:01,199
metaphor in machine learning

2279
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:03,199
by analogy to those chemical reactions

2280
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:04,960
but now in the statistical setting

2281
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,640
and that set the stage for the

2282
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,320
innovations that fristen specifically

2283
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,760
made which we can go into

2284
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,760
but that i hope was a little recap it

2285
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,199
sounds like economy

2286
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:15,120
drew this free energy term and then just

2287
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,800
to close on that you said a generalized

2288
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:17,679
anxiety

2289
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:20,880
yes it's the differential between um

2290
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,800
you know being too anxious and having

2291
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,239
too much surprise

2292
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:27,440
and being too um rigid and fragile

2293
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,440
though converging to a perfect

2294
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:31,440
optimistic model is not a bad thing

2295
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,840
so it's sort of a gradient descent on

2296
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,440
expected free energy

2297
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,040
because just the reality of the

2298
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,280
situation is that we're not going to

2299
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:42,400
come to that perfect model really in any

2300
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,440
meaningful respect

2301
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:46,640
it's just not how but these are

2302
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,480
there's other you know little pitfalls

2303
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,840
and land landmines and things and these

2304
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:50,320
are all

2305
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,000
papers that are in a network like the

2306
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,040
paper that we're going to be reading in

2307
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,159
15 about

2308
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:57,199
is the fep realist or instrumentalist is

2309
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:58,239
it actually how things are

2310
01:19:58,239 --> 01:20:00,000
or is it just a scientific instrument so

2311
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,280
those debates are being

2312
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,440
skipped over in this section but that's

2313
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,280
a little bit how free energy got from

2314
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,840
statistics um and statistical thermo to

2315
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:08,800
information theory

2316
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,199
marco

2317
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:16,080
thanks um uh just fair warning i'm gonna

2318
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:16,960
be a bit expected

2319
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,199
here but but um i always like when

2320
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:20,000
people uh

2321
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,920
make nice metaphorical connections so so

2322
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:25,520
they've um yeah i i i would want to um

2323
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,639
um build upon your your intuition so

2324
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:30,880
so um like mentioned we have

2325
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,000
thermodynamic free energy

2326
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,400
and no matter what these thermodynamic

2327
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,239
free energy can be used for work

2328
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:38,159
right but then we can ask okay is the

2329
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:40,080
work that's going to be done

2330
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,159
is it going to be useful or not for the

2331
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:43,199
agent

2332
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:45,440
and so this ongoing process now we're

2333
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,719
just talking about thermodynamic energy

2334
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:48,800
this ongoing process of basically

2335
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:51,199
channeling or or allocating or

2336
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:53,040
distributing the thermodynamic free

2337
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,480
energy

2338
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:57,760
in a way maximally useful for the agents

2339
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:00,960
is a challenge so for example it can try

2340
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,239
to challenge somewhere

2341
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:03,840
which will evoke a certain inferential

2342
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:06,159
challenge but when it fails

2343
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:08,639
you'll get negative effect right so so

2344
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:10,159
so one part of you

2345
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:11,920
sends a challenge the other part can't

2346
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,440
resolve it and then you feel it so

2347
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:16,480
so yeah i i i kind of feel like it's not

2348
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,239
that wrong in my opinion

2349
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,320
to to see that because anxiety is very

2350
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,679
uh specific

2351
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:24,560
it's it's basically kind of like fear

2352
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,440
but it has no

2353
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:28,719
targets right it's generalized so you're

2354
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:30,400
afraid of spiders

2355
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,960
but you have social anxiety because the

2356
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,800
whole domain of social interaction is

2357
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,800
just fraught with uncertainty

2358
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,880
but without the availability of a

2359
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,480
specific reason why

2360
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:43,760
uh your you're negatively uncertain

2361
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,600
or in an uncertain negative way that

2362
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,800
makes sense

2363
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,080
marco i'm going to build on that because

2364
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:50,000
it was really helpful so

2365
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,159
you mentioned how the fep has to be

2366
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:53,040
deflated

2367
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,040
because it's like generalized bad it's

2368
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,639
not the same is bad but it's

2369
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:59,040
something that is being optimized

2370
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,480
whether you think of it as minimizing or

2371
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,840
maximizing depending on whether there's

2372
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,520
a negative sign so it's the kind of

2373
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:04,880
thing that we're working on

2374
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,760
that's the key point and it's inference

2375
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,440
what we saw here is that we're going to

2376
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,199
draw a physical analogy

2377
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:13,120
from the way that chemical reactions

2378
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,800
indubitably go downhill

2379
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:17,199
the candle doesn't unburn so we want to

2380
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:18,080
design

2381
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,920
governance structures information

2382
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,480
schemes economies that are like a candle

2383
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:25,040
and they just irreversibly according to

2384
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,800
our experience they just play out you

2385
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,320
don't have to specify the micro level

2386
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:28,800
detail

2387
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,560
just as an analogy so we want something

2388
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:31,920
that's going to go quote

2389
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,280
downhill in governance space the thing

2390
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,199
is we don't just want to simply do

2391
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:39,520
inference on it so in the machine

2392
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,199
learning area it'd be like okay what's

2393
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:43,440
the data set let's fit the estimator

2394
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,199
let's reduce free energy so that we can

2395
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:47,440
fit the estimator on the descriptive

2396
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,000
model

2397
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,080
like on a big k-means model how many

2398
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,760
clusters are there then that will be

2399
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:52,000
like

2400
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,639
an inference model we're actually doing

2401
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:57,120
free energy gradient descent on what

2402
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,679
policy selection that's where control

2403
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:02,159
theory and cybernetics comes in

2404
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:04,560
because we're not just doing descriptive

2405
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,239
analysis of parameters

2406
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:08,960
of large data sets we're actually doing

2407
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:09,920
prospective or

2408
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,560
anticipatory policy selection in light

2409
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,400
of a deep knowledge

2410
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:17,840
reflected by embodied priors in a niche

2411
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:20,880
so that is the oriented turn where we go

2412
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,800
from again just pure

2413
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,679
free energy minimization to do inference

2414
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:26,480
via

2415
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,560
tricks and heuristics like variational

2416
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,480
base and fristen

2417
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:32,480
takes it to the next level by doing a

2418
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,159
few things not the least of which

2419
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:37,199
are incorporating action conceptually

2420
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:39,120
doing inference on policy selection

2421
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,440
which we've seen embodied in the models

2422
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,560
where like the pi

2423
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,880
is influencing the b so the way that the

2424
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,239
state estimate is changing through time

2425
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:47,199
the way that s

2426
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:49,600
and the b matrix are related is being

2427
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,120
modified by policy

2428
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,120
so policy is what free energy is

2429
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,040
plugging into so we're doing free energy

2430
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:55,600
descent

2431
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,760
on not just descriptive attributes of

2432
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:00,080
the world or any smaller large data set

2433
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:02,080
but we're doing a prospective free

2434
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,840
energy grading descent on policy

2435
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,000
because that's about our world model and

2436
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,600
how the states the world change

2437
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,040
for some people i know i was a little

2438
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,800
repetitive but that's really

2439
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,040
some of the key history and that helps

2440
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:14,000
understand how

2441
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,840
statistics and thermodynamics and

2442
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,600
bayesian inference which already is a

2443
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:18,159
big

2444
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:20,960
synthesis to make how all those areas in

2445
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,800
information theory and computation and

2446
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,159
everything that's kind of quantitative

2447
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:25,280
that we're talking about

2448
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:26,880
how did that get involved with

2449
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,719
ecological psychology

2450
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:31,199
control theory cybernetics and then even

2451
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:32,960
into this deeper relational way of

2452
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:33,760
thinking

2453
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,600
so that's a little bit of that and it's

2454
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,199
an intersection that will you know

2455
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:39,600
embroider over many times but it's

2456
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:40,880
really a great story

2457
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,880
and it's awesome that mel wrote it up in

2458
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,000
a way that isn't

2459
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,560
just backroom lore but it's something we

2460
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:47,880
can be like yeah it's in

2461
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:50,880
3.1.1 in mel's paper so that's what's

2462
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,159
great about literature

2463
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:54,559
stephen

2464
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,440
yeah thanks daniel just got to take a

2465
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,040
breath because you that was really uh

2466
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,239
that was quite a lot of

2467
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:01,920
useful information i agree with what

2468
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,760
you're saying there and i i suppose one

2469
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:04,400
thing that

2470
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,080
is good to bring it back to that gibbs

2471
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,600
free energy is

2472
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,880
you know you know there are times when

2473
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:14,719
for instance ice when ice freezes

2474
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:18,080
and the um the actual

2475
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:21,120
um free energy um

2476
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:23,840
is such that it gives it acts as a force

2477
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,880
it acts as a force so that um

2478
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:31,520
the the the the lower energy molecules

2479
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:34,800
um are not necessarily

2480
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,120
purely favored and it takes a slightly

2481
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:38,320
different structure

2482
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:41,360
and you you know you end up forming ice

2483
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:45,120
of which um you know it goes

2484
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:48,480
to a state which is um not necessarily

2485
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,080
energetically favorable

2486
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:53,199
you know so but that has that that

2487
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:54,480
dynamic

2488
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,480
is still something that can happen over

2489
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,239
time with equilibrium

2490
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:00,320
so you've got this ability as you

2491
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,280
mentioned to

2492
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:05,040
to sort of um to select policies

2493
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:09,360
um outside of equilibrium to to um

2494
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:12,639
to to keep going and to work with that

2495
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:16,159
um but i think that what the

2496
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:18,159
free energy does and what this talks

2497
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:19,760
about that's a bit different to how a

2498
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,679
lot of people talk about

2499
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:23,760
and stuff is they normally work with

2500
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,360
these phase shifts

2501
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,760
and this kind of like if you put enough

2502
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,679
molecules in a box and get them to be

2503
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:31,600
constrained in this way

2504
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,880
and that it will emerge that you'll get

2505
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:35,600
the ice

2506
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,880
or emerge that the ice becomes water

2507
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,880
um and that seems to be like the

2508
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,800
prevalent way of thinking about

2509
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,280
emergence sometimes in kind of economics

2510
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:46,719
and some other cases it's just the

2511
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:48,080
interactions

2512
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:50,880
under the the the temperature and

2513
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,840
pressure

2514
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,960
but what this gives away to think about

2515
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,880
how it can be

2516
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:00,800
um innovated upon and thought about in

2517
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:01,440
terms of

2518
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:04,400
um policy selections happening at

2519
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:05,840
multiple scales

2520
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,800
and uh the the challenge is it depends

2521
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,719
which scale you go at and you're talking

2522
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:11,120
to

2523
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,960
to try and explain it to someone you

2524
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,159
know so the cell

2525
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:17,840
versus the organ versus the organism but

2526
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:21,280
i think that um that that's something

2527
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:21,920
that this

2528
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:25,600
um really helps to unpack um because you

2529
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:26,639
can't deny that

2530
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:29,600
this is not just emergence as you put

2531
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,800
everything together and

2532
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,679
they'll interact and it is it involves

2533
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:34,560
some sort

2534
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:39,120
of um sentient uh or some sort of way of

2535
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:42,159
building up but starting from

2536
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:45,280
a non-intentional base so you and it's

2537
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:46,000
got both

2538
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
which i think is really cool thanks

2539
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,520
steven i want to

2540
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,040
mention two points so you talked about a

2541
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,760
phase change and so that's a reversible

2542
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:55,199
phase change with like melting and

2543
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:57,199
thawing so it's a little bit different

2544
01:27:57,199 --> 01:27:59,040
than the candle you know melt thaw

2545
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,480
resolve itself into a dew

2546
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:01,920
that kind of stuff so slightly different

2547
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,679
with a chemical reaction versus freezing

2548
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:05,280
just from the chemical side

2549
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,960
but you mentioned it was not favorable

2550
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,639
for the water molecule to

2551
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:10,719
freeze from the liquid into the solid

2552
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:12,480
face so go from freeze from

2553
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,560
liquid water into solid water but

2554
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,320
actually it is

2555
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,960
it's that as the thermal energy reduces

2556
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,520
all of a sudden it clicks into a new

2557
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,679
differentially configured arrangement

2558
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:25,120
and so that's what the phase

2559
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,520
is is like when you're at absolute zero

2560
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:28,400
i assume

2561
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,639
most substances are solid like they're

2562
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:32,000
in whatever their ground state

2563
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,120
configuration is

2564
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,960
which is like a close packing it's a

2565
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:37,199
crystal of some kind it's a solid

2566
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:40,000
and then there's some temperature t

2567
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:40,560
where

2568
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,880
that crystal melts where all of a sudden

2569
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:44,400
it's like the iron is vibrating it's a

2570
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,760
crystal it's a crystal it's a thousand

2571
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,360
degrees it's 2000 degrees i don't know

2572
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,719
what the melting temperature is but at

2573
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:49,600
some point

2574
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,400
the iron is breaking out of its crystal

2575
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,239
and goes into the liquid phase

2576
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:55,679
and then there's still the

2577
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:56,960
inter-attraction of the different

2578
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,960
molecules in the liquid even the iron

2579
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,560
and then at some point it vaporizes when

2580
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,000
you're even hotter than that and plasma

2581
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:02,719
and so on

2582
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:04,639
so these phase changes are actually

2583
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,080
they're about the temperature and then

2584
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,520
if you want to go to that fallacy you're

2585
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:08,480
kind of mentioning

2586
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:09,679
it's like people think that you're gonna

2587
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:12,320
get a quote phase change by adding more

2588
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,719
into a box or by stabilizing it but it's

2589
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:15,679
like no if you're at the wrong

2590
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:16,320
temperature

2591
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:19,040
you're never gonna get ice you need to

2592
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,719
do an enormous amount of pressure

2593
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:23,440
to get solid above zero you have to

2594
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,040
crush with like millions of pounds of

2595
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,480
pressure but you can make

2596
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:28,800
water into ice at like five degrees

2597
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:29,520
celsius

2598
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,040
you just have to put a massive amount of

2599
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,800
pressure and so the question is

2600
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:35,760
how do you do it with zero pressure

2601
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,520
that's by changing the temperature

2602
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,760
and that's where this multi-scale yvonne

2603
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:42,080
in the chat 2282 fahrenheit for iron

2604
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:42,800
thanks for that

2605
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,280
super clutch then the second point just

2606
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,280
quickly and anyone else then sarah is

2607
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,199
which scale and you said the cell or the

2608
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:50,639
person in the society

2609
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:53,040
and to me that's making me think of

2610
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,239
helen longino's

2611
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:58,159
book on pluralism because she discusses

2612
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:00,080
how the different fields like the

2613
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:02,320
sociology the geneticists the molecular

2614
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:03,280
biologists

2615
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:05,280
they have stories about aggression and

2616
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:06,560
sexuality in

2617
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:09,199
the case of her book and depending on

2618
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:10,800
which method you're familiar with which

2619
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,480
affordances you have at hand

2620
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:13,920
which aspects of the world you're

2621
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,679
sensitized to you're going to tell a

2622
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:16,560
different story

2623
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,560
a molecular biologist is going to have a

2624
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:19,760
protein binding

2625
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,800
answer to for example a pandemic

2626
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,960
a sociologist is going to know about

2627
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,719
some social intervention

2628
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:28,159
and so there's all these different

2629
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:29,600
people and it's not just that one

2630
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,040
person's worldview is like

2631
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,639
the right model and someone else's is

2632
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:34,080
the right one that's kind of this

2633
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,600
question is which scale

2634
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,080
it's not for any one person per se to

2635
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:38,960
say

2636
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,719
but those are the questions that we need

2637
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:42,400
to gravitate around

2638
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,719
to make action that isn't unduly biased

2639
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:45,920
towards the molecular

2640
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,920
towards the social etc but rather

2641
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:49,679
something that works across those levels

2642
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:51,679
so really interesting stuff steven

2643
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:53,199
thanks for like always

2644
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:55,840
highlighting how it comes back to bigger

2645
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:56,960
questions like that

2646
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:00,400
sarah and then marco

2647
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,080
yeah i mean maybe just to throw some

2648
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:03,520
more monkey wrench into this

2649
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:06,080
um something about what you said really

2650
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,480
really um reminded me of

2651
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,639
um the phenomena of hysteresis and i

2652
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:12,239
never really thought about hysteresis

2653
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:14,080
this way before but i was like oh

2654
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:16,719
jesus i mean it is true i think that

2655
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:18,719
hysteresis is an expression of

2656
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:22,080
of hysterosis historicity um you know of

2657
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:22,800
history

2658
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:26,000
and and so um you know

2659
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,120
with with fep i'm not sure with active

2660
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:29,760
inference

2661
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:32,480
maybe but like i often ask myself how

2662
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,159
these various you know like you have an

2663
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:35,120
entity as

2664
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:37,280
you know by way of your model or natural

2665
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:38,880
kinds or whatever it is but

2666
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,199
you know when you hook in these enti

2667
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:42,960
you're kind of you know weaving or

2668
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:44,000
whatever these entities

2669
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,199
together um by way of something

2670
01:31:47,199 --> 01:31:49,600
and and hysteresis is always been

2671
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,360
interesting to me because it's like

2672
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:53,520
that extra bit of dimensionality that

2673
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:55,199
phase if you want to call it

2674
01:31:55,199 --> 01:31:57,920
um that can hook into something one of

2675
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:58,880
its neighbors

2676
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:02,159
and so i often think about the um

2677
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:04,159
like let's say with fep or active

2678
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:06,000
inference you know like

2679
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,400
if there's only like one interface that

2680
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,000
can be used to hook to a neighbor

2681
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,360
you know maybe it's phase change or

2682
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,360
whatever that that moves out to an

2683
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:16,400
adjacency um so like how many different

2684
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,800
degrees can be used to connect as an

2685
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,960
interface to various neighboring

2686
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:24,080
agents type thinking and i know that's

2687
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:24,639
like

2688
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:26,719
left field i don't but daniel if anybody

2689
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:27,679
can take it somewhere

2690
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:30,800
you can or marco i don't know marco

2691
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,080
definitely take the first

2692
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,840
swing at it or anything else you want to

2693
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,679
talk about

2694
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:39,679
thanks i'll do my best um so

2695
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:42,080
let me just grab my thoughts before i

2696
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:43,360
lose

2697
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:47,040
oh yeah yeah uh sarah but what you just

2698
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:48,400
said i'm not sure if you find it

2699
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,480
relevant but one of my favorite papers

2700
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:54,880
is from um avena konigsberger

2701
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:57,679
and all of spawns and other people about

2702
01:32:57,679 --> 01:32:59,360
um

2703
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,760
routing strategy so so i i personally am

2704
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,040
very fond of

2705
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:06,239
the conceptual set of flows and paths

2706
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:07,040
and routes

2707
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,120
right because you know quite selection

2708
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:10,719
can also be seen as navigating

2709
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:13,679
a certain policy space so this paper

2710
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:15,280
spectrum of writing strategies

2711
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:16,000
effectively

2712
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,880
is tackling an interesting question of

2713
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:20,880
when you have a given system

2714
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:23,600
how much non-local how much uh

2715
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:24,639
information

2716
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:26,239
in its adjacency its context doesn't

2717
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:27,600
need to incorporate right so as it

2718
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:28,320
expands

2719
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:30,239
let's say its domain of discourse or its

2720
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:31,600
inferential context

2721
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:34,400
as it expands there will be a non-linear

2722
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,080
growth in let's say the dimensionality

2723
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:38,719
or the rank with the involved elements

2724
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:39,679
as it were

2725
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:41,920
and that's a cost at the same time if

2726
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,040
you don't expand

2727
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,440
maybe you're just not able to resolve a

2728
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:47,040
certain differential challenge

2729
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:49,679
and so this trade-off of of how local

2730
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:51,679
and how global or how expansive

2731
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:52,880
you want to go for a certain

2732
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,960
differential context um

2733
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,400
is i think related what you're saying

2734
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,239
right so how many degrees

2735
01:33:58,239 --> 01:34:02,480
can you afford uh when it comes to uh

2736
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,320
selecting how you go about selecting a

2737
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:05,760
policy um

2738
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,040
if i answered your question i'm not sure

2739
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,639
it's right but i linked it in the um

2740
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:09,760
youtube comments

2741
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:12,960
thank you um and the other thing what

2742
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,719
we're talking before is thermodynamics

2743
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:15,520
oh yeah

2744
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:18,560
i am still not mathematically

2745
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,280
um competent enough but for those who

2746
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:21,679
are

2747
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:24,800
i linked also uh in the youtube chats

2748
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:28,719
to um a article by uh john carlos baze

2749
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:29,440
who is

2750
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:32,880
a huge figure in mathematics moments

2751
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,719
and he wrote something about entropic

2752
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:36,239
forces and when i

2753
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:39,040
discovered this it was just mind-blowing

2754
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,560
and amazing because basically what he's

2755
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,800
doing is he's licensing

2756
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:45,199
talking about forces as governed by

2757
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:46,239
entropy so

2758
01:34:46,239 --> 01:34:49,360
so it's basically about

2759
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:52,159
whether the temperature is static or

2760
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:53,040
whether it

2761
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:55,760
is either thermostatic or or motion

2762
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:56,960
centered was it

2763
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:00,000
anyways um but when the thermal

2764
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,639
the temperature is static then the

2765
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:03,679
forces

2766
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:06,400
are better described in terms of entropy

2767
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,040
um

2768
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:08,480
which i wanted to emphasize because we

2769
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:10,320
had this discussion a bit with uh

2770
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,719
steven's point earlier and i i often

2771
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:14,159
like saying to people when they don't

2772
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:14,639
like

2773
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:17,360
normative principles there's always at

2774
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:18,880
the very least the ultimate normative

2775
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:19,600
principle

2776
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,600
which is the principle of least action

2777
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,719
you do physics

2778
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:24,400
the cycle of thermodynamics there's

2779
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:26,320
always that no matter what every system

2780
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,159
has to be governed by that

2781
01:35:28,159 --> 01:35:30,639
so given that we won't deviate from that

2782
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:33,199
law we can say the brain is governed by

2783
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:36,560
a principle of this action but clearly

2784
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:39,360
it also is governed by uh imperative to

2785
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:40,639
systematicity

2786
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:43,280
uh or mutual inference this constant

2787
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,320
co-regulation

2788
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,239
and so the question that i wanted to

2789
01:35:46,239 --> 01:35:47,920
explore is kind of how does that link

2790
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:48,960
together

2791
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,800
what how i like to what if you phrase it

2792
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:52,880
is basically

2793
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,800
these kinds of systems are effectively

2794
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,800
cultivating nature to do the work for

2795
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:57,520
them

2796
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:00,719
so how do you transform the dynamics

2797
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:03,119
governed by the uh by the ultimate

2798
01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:04,000
principle of

2799
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,639
fiscal peace action how do you nudge

2800
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:07,679
that into

2801
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:09,360
also being systematically conforming not

2802
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:11,360
just physics but also

2803
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:14,239
your inferential imperatives if that

2804
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:16,718
makes sense

2805
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:20,000
so this is a very subtle and really

2806
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,119
interesting point

2807
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:23,199
marco thanks a lot let me try to trace a

2808
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:24,320
little of that

2809
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:28,239
so you were pointing out how bases work

2810
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:30,639
on entropy and some other aspects of

2811
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:32,400
information theory and the fundamentals

2812
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:33,280
of physics

2813
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,360
it's almost like integrating statics and

2814
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,199
dynamics into one

2815
01:36:37,199 --> 01:36:40,639
more unified field and

2816
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:42,800
you or or you're muted but is that

2817
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:44,000
correct or where

2818
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,480
where did that and i i i'm trying to

2819
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:47,440
trace how this

2820
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:49,760
comes into the thermodynamics side

2821
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:50,960
because

2822
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:52,560
continue though i'd like to understand

2823
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,159
that a little better

2824
01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:55,920
yeah i mean honestly i think we should

2825
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,199
have discussion maybe uh

2826
01:36:57,199 --> 01:36:59,360
yeah later because it's actually brief

2827
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:01,119
post i'm not sure if he has a formal

2828
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:01,600
paper

2829
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,080
about it okay um but in general base has

2830
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:05,440
a lot of interesting work about

2831
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:08,000
entry and biological system again you

2832
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
know way out of the element there

2833
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,239
to be for me but i would really be

2834
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:13,199
curious to see

2835
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:16,080
what what more formally uh competent

2836
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:16,639
people

2837
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:18,639
think about these terms but the thing

2838
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:20,000
about entry force is just

2839
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,679
a very simple blog post and it's it's

2840
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:23,520
it's it's not that complicated

2841
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:26,560
okay we'll read it discuss it and maybe

2842
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:28,800
invite him or anyone else to be on a

2843
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:29,600
conversation

2844
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,679
so we have about you know 10 20 a little

2845
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:33,280
bit of time left so let's think about

2846
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:35,280
some thoughts questions we're

2847
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,600
taking forward with us but then we can

2848
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:40,080
kind of flip through a few more ideas

2849
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:43,239
sarah to your idea of hysteresis and

2850
01:37:43,239 --> 01:37:45,760
historiosity which are both two kind of

2851
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:46,560
like

2852
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:48,960
similar sounding words but hysteresis is

2853
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,320
just the system where like

2854
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:52,080
when something happens it doesn't return

2855
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:54,000
to exactly the same state

2856
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,760
and historiosity is just the idea that

2857
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:57,520
things have a developmental history

2858
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:59,760
like even if you reelect the same person

2859
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:01,600
they're older it's a different world

2860
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,560
etc so then you also mentioned the

2861
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:05,600
connectivity

2862
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,760
of agents and then that made me think

2863
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:08,719
about social

2864
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:11,760
agents and how the social

2865
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:14,880
networks have a hysteresis element to

2866
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,560
them like if there's a fracture it's not

2867
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:17,040
like you just

2868
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:19,600
zip it back up like a sweater it's like

2869
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,440
gonna be something that has to be

2870
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:24,000
um recovered if it's recovered exactly

2871
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,159
or not exactly it has to be recovered

2872
01:38:26,159 --> 01:38:29,119
in a different way so i kind of see

2873
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:30,000
where you're coming from

2874
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,520
with the hysteresis and the

2875
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,119
connectedness of agents now

2876
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:35,520
where does active inference play into

2877
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:36,639
this

2878
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:39,119
if it if it is related i think it i

2879
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:39,920
think there's some

2880
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,440
elements because we're using a lot of

2881
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:43,440
these words so it's kind of like these

2882
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,560
networks of

2883
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:47,679
thinking about these topics i'm not sure

2884
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:48,880
where one would take that

2885
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:50,480
going from the idea that it's the

2886
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:52,800
networks and the relational insight

2887
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,119
that defined function of the system and

2888
01:38:55,119 --> 01:38:57,360
then hysteresis and thermo i'm

2889
01:38:57,360 --> 01:39:00,719
thinking of a few things though marco

2890
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:02,480
yeah well i mean i would love to hear

2891
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:03,679
your thoughts about it so i think i

2892
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:04,080
think

2893
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,639
there's a bit of a tension because often

2894
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:08,400
the formless is described

2895
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:10,159
in relation to mark of change which is

2896
01:39:10,159 --> 01:39:11,679
explicitly about just

2897
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:13,199
being dependent on only the last state

2898
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:15,679
right but i i i think what sarah was

2899
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:17,440
kind of alluding to quite rightly so

2900
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:20,000
is is when you have these uh not just

2901
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,440
one system but your interconnected

2902
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:22,560
systems

2903
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:26,159
um then the a

2904
01:39:26,159 --> 01:39:28,880
a past it of a particular system might

2905
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:29,840
effectively

2906
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,719
come back with a detour support and and

2907
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:33,840
i think that's kind of what she's

2908
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:34,719
pointing at

2909
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:36,880
even though you could of course define

2910
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,560
the mark of chain for every point

2911
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,440
etc um on a different level you can say

2912
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:41,840
that

2913
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:44,320
the past states for example that system

2914
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:45,840
expressed an influence

2915
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:48,400
into its larger context and then later

2916
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:49,840
another system that received that

2917
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:50,800
influence

2918
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:54,080
uh responded with again a return signal

2919
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:54,960
influence

2920
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:58,480
to that initial system that makes sense

2921
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:00,400
yeah this is actually what i'm always

2922
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:01,600
obsessing about

2923
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:04,239
um is and you can analogize it to

2924
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:06,000
complex numbers as well you know like

2925
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,239
the hysteresis adds that it pops out an

2926
01:40:08,239 --> 01:40:09,840
extra dimension that something else can

2927
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:10,960
hook on to

2928
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:13,040
um and that's what i'm i'm i'm always

2929
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:15,119
thinking about with respect to

2930
01:40:15,119 --> 01:40:18,159
you know um i don't know if not even

2931
01:40:18,159 --> 01:40:20,000
well-versed enough to even say fep but

2932
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,600
what i understand about active inference

2933
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:22,719
you know like

2934
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:26,000
that the model seems to just creep in a

2935
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,840
forward direction but there's no side

2936
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,280
chains like there's no

2937
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,920
there's no side hooks um and so i'm

2938
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:33,520
always i'm always like yeah but how does

2939
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:34,320
that how do you

2940
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:37,440
do i don't know like i'm it's

2941
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:38,639
and it may just be my limited

2942
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:40,719
understanding but but i come from a

2943
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:42,719
place of thinking a lot about hysteresis

2944
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:44,719
and memorisers and stuff in it

2945
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:47,199
and i can't quite get those the math to

2946
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:49,119
answer my question

2947
01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:51,040
did she elaborate on side hooks i think

2948
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:52,400
that would help

2949
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,560
agree what would a side hook look like

2950
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:55,920
not a sky hook

2951
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:57,760
for those dennit fans out there well

2952
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,520
what i mean by like let's just say you

2953
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,880
know like you have real numbers and then

2954
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,480
you have complex numbers and i think of

2955
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:04,800
the complex plane as like a side hook

2956
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:07,760
um where you you add an extra dimension

2957
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,199
basically where other things can

2958
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:09,840
interact

2959
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:12,080
with that number space by way of the the

2960
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:13,600
complex side hook but

2961
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:17,119
it might be a too limited paradigm for

2962
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:18,560
me like i'm throwing out these

2963
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:21,600
random ideas that may or may not um

2964
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:24,800
work together but that i don't know it's

2965
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,400
it's

2966
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,560
let's say uh this is like totally

2967
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:30,159
sci-fi um

2968
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:32,159
you know like you have memorisers and

2969
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:33,280
they're in that but they're going in

2970
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:35,199
like voltage amplitude one direction but

2971
01:41:35,199 --> 01:41:35,920
then they have

2972
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:38,560
different paths um as they go forward

2973
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,000
versus reversed

2974
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,520
and and so that that phase that kind of

2975
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:44,000
phase

2976
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,119
relationship um might

2977
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:50,320
offer a relationship with something else

2978
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:53,199
that's related to phase or related to um

2979
01:41:53,199 --> 01:41:54,719
you know whatever the physical dynamics

2980
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:56,000
might be around that

2981
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,840
so i don't know like when i think about

2982
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:01,040
um active inference

2983
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:02,480
you know like they they're just like

2984
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:04,000
well what's the happened in the past and

2985
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:04,880
what's going in the future

2986
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:06,239
what are my prayers but there's nothing

2987
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:08,960
on the side that

2988
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:12,000
um sorry it's as good as i can do

2989
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,840
i don't know if that's helpful you know

2990
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,600
you rile you riled everyone else

2991
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:17,679
else up so it's great so we're gonna

2992
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:19,600
just slowly we don't need to end exactly

2993
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:20,639
on the hour if anyone

2994
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:22,560
is gonna um leave on the hour that's

2995
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,800
fine just um maybe speak your piece as

2996
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,159
your closing piece but we'll stay on a

2997
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:27,280
few minutes after

2998
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:29,520
because yes this is a really nice topic

2999
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:30,960
so marco

3000
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:34,320
dave stephen yeah thanks

3001
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:35,440
i think i understand what you mean with

3002
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:37,360
side hoods and i think

3003
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:39,920
maybe what you're what you're um bumping

3004
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:40,960
against

3005
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:43,920
is is what i also find uh problematic so

3006
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:45,840
it's good that you raise this so

3007
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,080
so the the the the equations the

3008
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:49,600
formalism for free energy

3009
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:52,480
and uh for fep and active infants

3010
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:54,159
they're standalone they're like the most

3011
01:42:54,159 --> 01:42:56,000
naive equations you can have

3012
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,840
right but the whole point is that when

3013
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,600
we apply then we have to fill in the

3014
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:00,320
things that

3015
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:02,800
were previously naive we have to for

3016
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:04,560
example only now only very recently

3017
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:06,159
we're going to multi-agent systems with

3018
01:43:06,159 --> 01:43:07,440
active influence

3019
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:10,080
but that was always implicit in the

3020
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:10,800
research

3021
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:13,840
as in from the first paper in 2009

3022
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:16,400
2010 it was already implicit because it

3023
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:17,840
explicitly talked about

3024
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,760
how it would be multi-scale how it would

3025
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,119
be um

3026
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:23,360
multi like nested right it's all these

3027
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:24,560
different systems all doing

3028
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:27,600
frenzy minimization in relation to each

3029
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:28,400
other

3030
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:30,880
and so that that codependency right

3031
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:33,119
these mutualistic relations those are

3032
01:43:33,119 --> 01:43:33,920
the scientifics

3033
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:37,280
i believe so for example uh if i'm not

3034
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:39,360
abusing maths here you know the decide

3035
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:40,960
for complex numbers is

3036
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:44,159
it's imaginary until you square it right

3037
01:43:44,159 --> 01:43:46,480
so it's a potentiality until a certain

3038
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:48,080
operation occurs

3039
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:50,239
so in the same way when a particular

3040
01:43:50,239 --> 01:43:52,000
system expresses an influence into its

3041
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,440
context

3042
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:55,679
it isn't affecting that system anymore

3043
01:43:55,679 --> 01:43:57,119
until something happens

3044
01:43:57,119 --> 01:44:00,560
when it returns right so so the fact

3045
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:02,480
that it's always situated in an extended

3046
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:03,520
environment

3047
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:05,679
um that a particular system is very

3048
01:44:05,679 --> 01:44:06,719
naive about

3049
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:09,040
actually that it can't know everything

3050
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:10,800
exactly that it has to kind of trust or

3051
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,239
upload certain

3052
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:15,760
um influences to its uh context

3053
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:19,600
is kind of that side i would say um

3054
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:22,480
does that make sense

3055
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:24,880
interesting i think that once i look at

3056
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:26,480
the math i'll keep that in mind and it

3057
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:27,679
might start to it's

3058
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:29,119
that's really helpful don't don't look

3059
01:44:29,119 --> 01:44:31,920
at the math don't look that's the point

3060
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:34,960
right you'll hear v maps

3061
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:38,400
describe a general uh

3062
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:41,520
general principle for how they are by

3063
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:43,520
what they are governed

3064
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:46,320
but they are governed in terms of states

3065
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,639
and relations to other systems

3066
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:50,800
right so i i kind of confused because

3067
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,320
you've alluded to it many times before

3068
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:54,960
how they're all connected to each other

3069
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:57,119
right so i think that's not in the math

3070
01:44:57,119 --> 01:44:58,320
oh wait i'm just going to continue with

3071
01:44:58,320 --> 01:44:58,960
it

3072
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:00,800
i think i think it's a little bit in the

3073
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:02,639
math though i think if i keep your

3074
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:04,560
this is how i think or how i learn is i

3075
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:06,080
keep these kinds of phrases and

3076
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,159
statements in mind and i look for them

3077
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:10,239
in the math and then it becomes clearer

3078
01:45:10,239 --> 01:45:12,400
so i i think

3079
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:14,239
yeah and you know and you've talked also

3080
01:45:14,239 --> 01:45:15,760
your metaphors are great you know like

3081
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:16,320
you've talked

3082
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:19,040
also about context and shifts in context

3083
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:20,080
and and

3084
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:21,760
you didn't say this but my brain did

3085
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:24,000
this like collapsing or like something

3086
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,880
becomes um so i'm gonna it's really

3087
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:28,480
helpful to keep these things in mind as

3088
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:28,880
i'm

3089
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:31,280
as i'm battling my way through you know

3090
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:32,480
these formalisms

3091
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:35,280
um so yeah i'm just gonna ask daniel

3092
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:37,040
because danny was way smarter than me

3093
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:38,880
i know there's a mathematical relevance

3094
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:40,080
here because of matrices

3095
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:42,239
you have a marginal the diagonal and

3096
01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:43,760
then the other entries are for the

3097
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:45,520
conditional

3098
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:47,840
conditioned situations and that also

3099
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,199
reminded me of the scientists if that

3100
01:45:49,199 --> 01:45:50,320
makes sense oh yeah

3101
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:52,000
we're gonna we're gonna return to side

3102
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,600
hooks but let's go with dave

3103
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:58,880
then stephen okay um

3104
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:02,000
hysteresis and side hooks uh the first

3105
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,320
the most elaborate discussion i've gone

3106
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:06,880
through on hysteresis is in renee

3107
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:10,320
tom and chris ziemann on morphogenesis

3108
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:13,040
structural stability and catastrophes

3109
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:17,600
in there um the

3110
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:21,199
hysteresis are refer to hidden states or

3111
01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:22,080
relatively

3112
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:25,360
inaccessible states so these these

3113
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:27,679
amazing things like the the financial

3114
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:28,719
collapse

3115
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:32,159
in 2007 and 2008 where you just

3116
01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:33,840
absolutely fell off a cliff and none of

3117
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:36,080
the models said that would be possible

3118
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:40,239
or in uh say a psychic a psychotic break

3119
01:46:40,239 --> 01:46:41,840
the most stable guy in the community

3120
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,440
just goes totally wild

3121
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:47,920
or good things too uh you know

3122
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:50,400
a religious conversion that turns the

3123
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:51,119
slaver

3124
01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:53,920
into the guy who wrote amazing grace

3125
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:56,000
well now

3126
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,199
more recently um gerald edelman

3127
01:46:59,199 --> 01:47:01,840
emphasizes relatively inaccessible

3128
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:03,600
states a tremendous amount

3129
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:07,119
both in his work on immunology and

3130
01:47:07,119 --> 01:47:11,280
in neuroscience the term he uses

3131
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:13,519
is

3132
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:16,880
degeneracy which he borrows i believe

3133
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:17,520
from

3134
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:21,440
analysis numerical analysis to mean

3135
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:23,440
uh something roughly like a function

3136
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:25,600
whose inverse is not a function

3137
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:28,719
of multiple ways of coming up

3138
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:31,920
with an activity which from the outside

3139
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:34,159
looks exactly like another activity but

3140
01:47:34,159 --> 01:47:36,080
it's implemented in a completely

3141
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:39,840
different way and then in a

3142
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:43,119
professor fristen's paper uh that was

3143
01:47:43,119 --> 01:47:45,360
uh suggested reading a couple of weeks

3144
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:46,239
ago

3145
01:47:46,239 --> 01:47:50,800
uh on where he's talking about uh

3146
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:54,000
as uh ascent uh climbing gradient

3147
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:54,960
descent

3148
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:58,480
um he says it seems

3149
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:01,760
as though what's going on inside the

3150
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,920
markovian blanket is it's learning about

3151
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:04,800
its environment

3152
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:07,600
but it can't observe the environment how

3153
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:09,520
can it be learning about something that

3154
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:10,239
it can never

3155
01:48:10,239 --> 01:48:12,080
observe so i don't know where to go with

3156
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:14,000
that but it all sounds like it kind of

3157
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,719
would fit together and make a nice paper

3158
01:48:16,719 --> 01:48:17,440
thank you

3159
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:20,239
dave for mentioning that and lots of

3160
01:48:20,239 --> 01:48:20,960
great points

3161
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:23,520
stephen and then i'll also go with the

3162
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:27,360
side hook and histories this discussion

3163
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:30,159
yeah i think this one thing this

3164
01:48:30,159 --> 01:48:32,400
discussion really talks about is the

3165
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:36,000
the relativity between what the organism

3166
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,679
in the markov blanket the generative

3167
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:39,040
model and

3168
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:41,280
the niche and the environment so the

3169
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:43,360
world out there can follow all the rules

3170
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:44,080
of

3171
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:46,800
physics and it could have a lot of side

3172
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:48,000
branches and

3173
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,639
it can go and behave in all these sorts

3174
01:48:50,639 --> 01:48:51,360
of ways

3175
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:54,000
and which we don't know about some we

3176
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,520
can track through the entropy

3177
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:58,320
some we will know because the niche will

3178
01:48:58,320 --> 01:48:59,119
hold it i

3179
01:48:59,119 --> 01:49:02,239
my cup will still be on the table so

3180
01:49:02,239 --> 01:49:02,960
some of the

3181
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:06,080
the kind of the stuff about least action

3182
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:08,719
has a benefit of maintaining a trace

3183
01:49:08,719 --> 01:49:10,080
more clearly

3184
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:11,760
in the environment so that there's an

3185
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:12,960
inch i think this is where it's quite

3186
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:14,719
interesting is how much

3187
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:16,960
the the the the way of coming in it from

3188
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:18,320
both directions i'm

3189
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:20,159
starting to see what karl frisco meant

3190
01:49:20,159 --> 01:49:21,440
there in some ways is

3191
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:22,800
sometimes it's about the model of the

3192
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:25,040
outside and sometimes it's what's out

3193
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:25,679
there

3194
01:49:25,679 --> 01:49:28,000
it's been shaped and humans we're doing

3195
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,119
a lot of that

3196
01:49:29,119 --> 01:49:32,080
so when we shape something out there

3197
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:33,920
what what is available because they talk

3198
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:35,599
about the adjacent possible

3199
01:49:35,599 --> 01:49:37,040
a lot when they're doing work with

3200
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:39,520
people so is it is it that maybe

3201
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:42,320
you know as an animal you know you can

3202
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:43,520
infer

3203
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:47,599
much more diffuse abductive kind of

3204
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:49,679
things if it's within your sensory range

3205
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:51,599
however it needs to be within the

3206
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:53,199
adjacent possible

3207
01:49:53,199 --> 01:49:55,199
whereas in the niche you can do things

3208
01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:57,040
at distance you know

3209
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:59,520
um you can fire something over the hill

3210
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:01,199
and then you go around next week and you

3211
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:02,480
see where it landed

3212
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:06,000
you know um which is kind of

3213
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,599
so anyway i thought that's quite

3214
01:50:07,599 --> 01:50:09,119
interesting i think that

3215
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:12,880
um really does speak to this two-way

3216
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:15,599
movement and the fact that some pieces

3217
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:16,880
are more

3218
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:19,599
about you know it changes the name of

3219
01:50:19,599 --> 01:50:21,920
the game for emergence for sure

3220
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:24,599
beyond pure physics into this

3221
01:50:24,599 --> 01:50:26,480
non-equilibrium

3222
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:28,159
and i'll put a paper because i found a

3223
01:50:28,159 --> 01:50:30,000
paper that talked about non-equilibrium

3224
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:30,719
chemistry

3225
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:32,000
when i was looking and it was

3226
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
interesting it said that there's almost

3227
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,239
been no non-equilibrium chemistry

3228
01:50:36,239 --> 01:50:37,679
until like they only started doing it in

3229
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:39,280
the 80s and 90s

3230
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:41,679
and it's like then you do it's all this

3231
01:50:41,679 --> 01:50:43,199
at equilibrium

3232
01:50:43,199 --> 01:50:44,800
type work where you go from one to the

3233
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:46,960
other and then of course all life is a

3234
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:49,840
non-equilibrium so it's kind of um

3235
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:52,159
interesting because you've still got

3236
01:50:52,159 --> 01:50:53,920
both going on it's just happening

3237
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:57,360
in the in the niche stephen excellent

3238
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:57,760
point

3239
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:00,080
let me go on just about in reverse order

3240
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:01,679
there's a few excellent things you said

3241
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:03,599
long-range action through niche

3242
01:51:03,599 --> 01:51:06,320
modification that's stigmergy the ant

3243
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:07,520
can't do long-range

3244
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:09,599
instant communication but it can

3245
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:11,760
instantly put its abdomen on the ground

3246
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:12,400
and then

3247
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:14,560
three months later another nest could

3248
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:15,520
instantly detect it

3249
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:18,560
so it's at an instant with a behavioral

3250
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:20,880
focus but it's actually long range with

3251
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:22,719
respect to action of that one nest mate

3252
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:23,679
on another

3253
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:25,440
so then there was a discussion by dave

3254
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:28,080
about how fristen was mentioning how

3255
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:29,599
how does the organism learn or how does

3256
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:32,159
the system learn when it can't directly

3257
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:34,000
infer directly you know measure the

3258
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,840
states and that's everything we've been

3259
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:37,760
talking about with the observables

3260
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:40,400
the organism is actually observe getting

3261
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:42,080
the observables and using those to do

3262
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:43,760
state estimation on the hidden states of

3263
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:44,719
the world

3264
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:46,560
and then it turns out that the

3265
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:47,760
observables don't have enough

3266
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:49,360
instantaneous information

3267
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:51,520
to reliably identify what you care about

3268
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:53,520
which is the latent causes of the world

3269
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:56,000
so you have this imaginative generative

3270
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:56,560
model

3271
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:58,239
which includes that space of the

3272
01:51:58,239 --> 01:52:00,639
adjacency you know the adjacent possible

3273
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:03,280
that's weighted by how likely it is and

3274
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:04,400
a bunch of other stuff

3275
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:06,719
that makes it more like a candle burning

3276
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:07,599
than just

3277
01:52:07,599 --> 01:52:10,159
a marble on a hill so it's a little bit

3278
01:52:10,159 --> 01:52:11,840
more nuanced because we're talking about

3279
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:13,520
something that's like a bayesian

3280
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:16,239
computation at least as the scientist

3281
01:52:16,239 --> 01:52:17,119
uses it

3282
01:52:17,119 --> 01:52:19,760
and again that distinction between is

3283
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:20,159
this

3284
01:52:20,159 --> 01:52:22,719
quote what's happening realism versus is

3285
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:24,719
this just a instrument that scientists

3286
01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:26,159
are using in the world

3287
01:52:26,159 --> 01:52:29,280
that's going to come up next week in 15

3288
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:30,000
and so that's like

3289
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,480
really interesting all right so the side

3290
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:33,599
hook

3291
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:35,679
i thought if there's a idea with many

3292
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:37,360
sides then maybe it has many

3293
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:39,760
side hooks because like it's clearly by

3294
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:41,520
analogy to the complex number so i like

3295
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:42,880
this idea though of jumping out a

3296
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:43,679
dimension

3297
01:52:43,679 --> 01:52:44,880
and that seemed like it was related to

3298
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:46,400
what stephen said with the adjacent

3299
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:47,199
possible

3300
01:52:47,199 --> 01:52:49,840
and with policy imagine imagination it's

3301
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:51,760
like if there's a wall in front of you

3302
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,280
and then you're only on the number line

3303
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:55,199
you're gonna hit into the wall but then

3304
01:52:55,199 --> 01:52:55,840
if you

3305
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:58,159
are logistically in a different

3306
01:52:58,159 --> 01:53:00,320
dimension then you can go around it or

3307
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:02,400
you can figure out whatever policy it is

3308
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:04,880
so policy and imagination is like

3309
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:06,719
popping out to a different dimension

3310
01:53:06,719 --> 01:53:08,320
where then you can enact

3311
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:09,840
a policy but if your imagination isn't

3312
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:12,400
connected to the manifold of reality

3313
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:14,159
your action selection would it's like a

3314
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:15,760
fantasy it's like if i could fly i could

3315
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:17,040
just leave this building

3316
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:19,599
it's like yeah but the e matrix is not

3317
01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:21,119
that way so it can't happen

3318
01:53:21,119 --> 01:53:23,360
so it has to be imagination with the

3319
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:24,639
affordances

3320
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:27,119
and then also just one last point on the

3321
01:53:27,119 --> 01:53:28,159
statistics

3322
01:53:28,159 --> 01:53:30,880
so the markov chain that marco um i

3323
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:31,599
believe

3324
01:53:31,599 --> 01:53:34,239
mentioned so like a markov chain with a

3325
01:53:34,239 --> 01:53:35,440
memory of one

3326
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:37,599
would mean a statistical process that's

3327
01:53:37,599 --> 01:53:39,440
only dependent it only has a memory of

3328
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:41,440
one whatever the previous state was that

3329
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:42,960
is what influences it

3330
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:45,520
and then it's almost like as a statistic

3331
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:46,639
statistical model

3332
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:48,159
so again whether we think of this as a

3333
01:53:48,159 --> 01:53:50,400
scientist instrumentally with a model

3334
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:52,639
or the organism actually embodying this

3335
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:54,159
model let's just say that

3336
01:53:54,159 --> 01:53:56,080
most things have an influence of one

3337
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:57,760
time scale but then once in a hundred

3338
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:59,199
times it has like a

3339
01:53:59,199 --> 01:54:01,119
range of a thousand so there's two

3340
01:54:01,119 --> 01:54:02,400
models you could make

3341
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:04,400
you could have a model with a markov

3342
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:05,679
chain of a thousand

3343
01:54:05,679 --> 01:54:07,520
so the different action sequences of

3344
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:09,360
like every single possible

3345
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:12,159
last thousand days and that model is

3346
01:54:12,159 --> 01:54:13,920
very computationally complicated

3347
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:15,679
but if you've had enough observations

3348
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:17,520
it's unrealistic you'd be able to fit

3349
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:18,000
that like

3350
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,040
to a t versus the more simple model

3351
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:23,760
which is just give me the memory of one

3352
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:26,000
so i can have just one bit of memory

3353
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,159
and then i'll be surprised when the

3354
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:29,679
other thing happens

3355
01:54:29,679 --> 01:54:32,000
and so that is the compromise of the

3356
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:32,880
modeler

3357
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:35,760
of model accuracy minus model complexity

3358
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:36,320
is

3359
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:38,800
do you make this markov blanket like

3360
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:41,520
simple like a heuristic or a bias

3361
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:44,400
and then be surprised by particulars or

3362
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:45,360
do you try to fit

3363
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:48,320
this ridiculous particularized model for

3364
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:49,440
every single case

3365
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:52,400
but then that loses all efficacy because

3366
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:54,239
then you're tied up so specifically with

3367
01:54:54,239 --> 01:54:55,840
the very specifics of the model that you

3368
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:56,320
learned

3369
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:58,320
that's like overfitting so i know that's

3370
01:54:58,320 --> 01:54:59,920
a ton of points

3371
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:02,080
but those were all like really awesome

3372
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:03,199
comments

3373
01:55:03,199 --> 01:55:05,520
and i think we're getting to a lot of

3374
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:08,000
the stops on this little road trip

3375
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,440
but let's just head to the last

3376
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:14,000
section but anyone if you have any final

3377
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:14,880
thoughts or questions

3378
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:16,800
that was yeah basically the only other

3379
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:18,400
slide was this previous one with a

3380
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:20,320
little bit of

3381
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:23,119
and then just the usual questions but

3382
01:55:23,119 --> 01:55:24,080
i'll just say

3383
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:26,800
thanks for participating and stay in

3384
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:28,560
communication with everyone

3385
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:30,800
and then let's pull back to uh the road

3386
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:32,239
map or to here and then

3387
01:55:32,239 --> 01:55:33,920
each of the four of you thanks so much

3388
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:35,679
for these like just amazing

3389
01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:36,800
conversations

3390
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:38,960
so each of you if you would like to just

3391
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:41,199
take a you know we'll go one last round

3392
01:55:41,199 --> 01:55:41,760
of people

3393
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:44,880
want to so whoever wants to raise their

3394
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:45,199
hand

3395
01:55:45,199 --> 01:55:48,799
otherwise we can go to this one i guess

3396
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:54,159
so this slide was kind of starting with

3397
01:55:54,159 --> 01:55:55,679
the physics on the bottom

3398
01:55:55,679 --> 01:55:58,480
with a focker plank and a flow so that

3399
01:55:58,480 --> 01:55:59,199
was what

3400
01:55:59,199 --> 01:56:02,400
dave brought up and the way that this

3401
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:04,880
conceptualizes a flow like on a hill you

3402
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:06,880
can have like two orthogonal

3403
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:09,199
curls two orthogonal factors one is kind

3404
01:56:09,199 --> 01:56:10,639
of curling around the hill

3405
01:56:10,639 --> 01:56:12,560
at the same elevation that's like what

3406
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:13,679
you see on a

3407
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:16,639
camping map like the iso contours and

3408
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:18,080
then the other one is like a ruler

3409
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:18,480
that's

3410
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:20,480
right on the hill like straight up and

3411
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:22,719
down and so

3412
01:56:22,719 --> 01:56:25,520
not to go too much into physics but the

3413
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:26,080
ruler

3414
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:28,000
is like the delta g it's like the

3415
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,920
gradient descent is the candle burning

3416
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:31,840
or is are we in a flat spot

3417
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:33,920
so that's the ruler is like are you

3418
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:35,840
skiing fast downhill or are you not

3419
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:37,599
skiing fast downhill

3420
01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:40,400
and then the iso contour is like is a

3421
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:41,679
steady state

3422
01:56:41,679 --> 01:56:44,080
that's like when you're um when you're

3423
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:45,520
doing a chemical reaction

3424
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:47,040
there's always a forward and a backwards

3425
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:49,760
reaction now the keq

3426
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:52,080
the equilibrium coefficient for the

3427
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:54,560
reaction's completion might be 99.999

3428
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:56,639
percent like a candle but actually the

3429
01:56:56,639 --> 01:56:58,400
completion is really high because it's

3430
01:56:58,400 --> 01:56:59,599
so exothermic

3431
01:56:59,599 --> 01:57:01,840
but stephen from chemical manufacturing

3432
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:03,440
you know that reactions that are barely

3433
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:04,159
favorable

3434
01:57:04,159 --> 01:57:05,599
you're going to end up with like 52

3435
01:57:05,599 --> 01:57:07,760
percent of the product that you want and

3436
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:09,440
48 that you don't want or something like

3437
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:10,239
that

3438
01:57:10,239 --> 01:57:12,560
so those are that's that decomposition

3439
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:14,000
right here with a helmholtz

3440
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,440
decomposition

3441
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:17,040
that there's the solenoidal curl and

3442
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:19,760
irrotational or divergence components

3443
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:22,159
so that's kind of a thermo info

3444
01:57:22,159 --> 01:57:22,880
connection

3445
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:23,920
so when people are talking about

3446
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:26,480
gradient descent in machine learning

3447
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:27,920
they're talking about like just like

3448
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:30,719
chemicals are allegedly physically

3449
01:57:30,719 --> 01:57:33,599
skiing up and down these slopes also in

3450
01:57:33,599 --> 01:57:34,560
machine learning

3451
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:36,560
you're doing informational skiing on

3452
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:38,000
these slopes

3453
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,719
and then that's where you get these

3454
01:57:40,719 --> 01:57:42,639
bayesian statistics and thermodynamic

3455
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:44,960
ideas

3456
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:47,199
the key insight in the the integration

3457
01:57:47,199 --> 01:57:49,280
with control theory happens here

3458
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:50,239
basically if you're going to be

3459
01:57:50,239 --> 01:57:52,159
maintaining that far from equilibrium

3460
01:57:52,159 --> 01:57:53,440
steady state

3461
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:55,119
better than all the other models like

3462
01:57:55,119 --> 01:57:56,560
you in the niche

3463
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:58,960
then you need to have a generative model

3464
01:57:58,960 --> 01:57:59,599
not just

3465
01:57:59,599 --> 01:58:02,080
of state estimation because that's sort

3466
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:02,719
of like

3467
01:58:02,719 --> 01:58:06,159
the low hanging not really fruit even if

3468
01:58:06,159 --> 01:58:07,679
it is low hanging or not it's just not

3469
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:08,560
really fruit

3470
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:11,119
because action is what the agent needs

3471
01:58:11,119 --> 01:58:12,239
to do

3472
01:58:12,239 --> 01:58:14,880
to stay far from equilibrium whereas a

3473
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:16,480
machine learning model on our computer

3474
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:18,320
it doesn't need to behave well to

3475
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:19,920
survive because it's like under not

3476
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:21,199
really the kind of selection pressures

3477
01:58:21,199 --> 01:58:22,239
that we are

3478
01:58:22,239 --> 01:58:25,199
but we need the action element so then

3479
01:58:25,199 --> 01:58:27,280
this imperative to be self-evidencing

3480
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:29,840
as an information forager means that you

3481
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:31,440
get all of these cybernetic

3482
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:32,719
characteristics

3483
01:58:32,719 --> 01:58:36,159
and that you see systems that act as if

3484
01:58:36,159 --> 01:58:37,360
they're doing the optimal

3485
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:40,480
experimentation given their priors

3486
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:42,320
reflected in the generative model in

3487
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:43,920
their niche so

3488
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:46,000
that's where you get this sort of like

3489
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,599
forager information

3490
01:58:47,599 --> 01:58:50,080
optimal information gain principle

3491
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:50,639
because

3492
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:52,560
that's what's needed to keep the action

3493
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:54,480
selection effective

3494
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:56,159
because they're far from equilibrium

3495
01:58:56,159 --> 01:58:58,480
steady state that has to be

3496
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:01,440
subsiding despite these things that's

3497
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:02,320
what gets

3498
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:05,440
subsumed in free energy principle as

3499
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:07,840
discussed in mel's paper and then on the

3500
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:08,719
top

3501
01:59:08,719 --> 01:59:11,840
are corollary process theories so it's

3502
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:12,800
like okay

3503
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:14,719
whoa i guess that would have to be true

3504
01:59:14,719 --> 01:59:16,000
for any candles i saw

3505
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,080
out there how did that energy get so

3506
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:19,119
organized

3507
01:59:19,119 --> 01:59:21,599
so it had to be an active candle or it

3508
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:23,199
has to be part of the extended niche of

3509
01:59:23,199 --> 01:59:23,679
us

3510
01:59:23,679 --> 01:59:25,040
right there's no candles that's like the

3511
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:27,520
watchmaker analogy and then

3512
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:30,320
how does that happen and these are

3513
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:31,520
falsifiable

3514
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:33,280
process theories because theory

3515
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:35,280
falsifiable empirical

3516
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:36,719
unique explanati explanations and

3517
01:59:36,719 --> 01:59:38,800
predictions um

3518
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:41,199
this is where we see the falsification

3519
01:59:41,199 --> 01:59:41,920
happening

3520
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:43,840
and so we discussed in this paper like

3521
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:45,760
some of the already kind of i guess

3522
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:48,159
less in favor process theories like the

3523
01:59:48,159 --> 01:59:50,239
gibbs filtering or gibbs sampling

3524
01:59:50,239 --> 01:59:52,560
which is done on computers but is not

3525
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:54,480
apparently tractable on biological

3526
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:55,440
architectures

3527
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:58,960
in the way that these um more

3528
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:01,920
established or i don't know uh

3529
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:03,119
productive

3530
02:00:03,119 --> 02:00:06,159
not falsified yet there's some good

3531
02:00:06,159 --> 02:00:07,599
critiques of bayesian brain

3532
02:00:07,599 --> 02:00:11,360
in the paper in 15 as well as in um

3533
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:14,560
the 2018 interview in alias with fristen

3534
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:16,960
but um yeah and then what else because

3535
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:17,599
the whole

3536
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:19,119
idea is that like as free energy

3537
02:00:19,119 --> 02:00:20,800
principle gets shored up and connected

3538
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:22,880
laterally to a bunch of other things

3539
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:24,159
there's going to be other process

3540
02:00:24,159 --> 02:00:25,040
theories

3541
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:26,560
active inference is about some kinds of

3542
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:28,400
systems but who knows there's other ways

3543
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:30,000
we could think about it and

3544
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,840
so i don't know what does anyone think

3545
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:33,520
about that other than that we'll head

3546
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:34,159
into our

3547
02:00:34,159 --> 02:00:37,440
final section marco

3548
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:41,199
yeah um i guess i can add a hopefully

3549
02:00:41,199 --> 02:00:42,560
pleasant perturbation

3550
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:45,920
so one interesting um thing to

3551
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:48,960
to raise here for this slide is

3552
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:50,960
um it's conceivable that active infants

3553
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:52,000
might actually be

3554
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:55,440
more solid in its conceptual framework

3555
02:00:55,440 --> 02:00:56,159
or structure

3556
02:00:56,159 --> 02:00:58,320
than actually the formalism for example

3557
02:00:58,320 --> 02:00:59,920
you could maybe for example

3558
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:02,320
not use kl divergence as a distance

3559
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:03,199
metric

3560
02:01:03,199 --> 02:01:06,800
but other distance metrics um because

3561
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:10,080
the kl divergence is i think also in the

3562
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:11,679
self idealization

3563
02:01:11,679 --> 02:01:13,520
right in the end you're going to have

3564
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:15,840
very a lot of messy stuff

3565
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:18,560
in in real systems such that even if

3566
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:20,000
you're going to model certain

3567
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:21,679
belief distributions in the action

3568
02:01:21,679 --> 02:01:23,119
implementation it's going to be

3569
02:01:23,119 --> 02:01:24,320
extremely unlikely

3570
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:27,520
that it perfectly follows this um

3571
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:31,199
a particular conception of distance to

3572
02:01:31,199 --> 02:01:32,719
be minimized

3573
02:01:32,719 --> 02:01:36,480
um and so i guess i'm just urging

3574
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:38,880
for this expression of what can come out

3575
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:39,520
for me

3576
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:42,639
that that that um

3577
02:01:42,639 --> 02:01:44,639
oh okay i personally just like to

3578
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:45,679
encourage people to

3579
02:01:45,679 --> 02:01:48,719
do to be playfully exploring different

3580
02:01:48,719 --> 02:01:49,360
variants

3581
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:51,280
of the free energy principle because

3582
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:53,360
personally i believe conceptual

3583
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:56,239
uh model uh taking it as a conceptual

3584
02:01:56,239 --> 02:01:57,040
model is better

3585
02:01:57,040 --> 02:01:59,920
than as purely a formal but that's

3586
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:00,719
personal

3587
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:03,599
yes well thanks for expressing your

3588
02:02:03,599 --> 02:02:04,000
thoughts

3589
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,880
as an action suggestion stephen and then

3590
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:09,199
sarah

3591
02:02:09,199 --> 02:02:11,119
yeah thanks for that description daniel

3592
02:02:11,119 --> 02:02:12,239
actually i'm going to go back and be

3593
02:02:12,239 --> 02:02:12,880
able to

3594
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:14,560
use that as a really nice reference

3595
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:16,320
point for lots of

3596
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:18,800
information i like this top piece and i

3597
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:19,599
think yeah the

3598
02:02:19,599 --> 02:02:22,000
bayesian brain was there as this kind of

3599
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,520
integrated idea and then they thought

3600
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:24,639
well let's have this

3601
02:02:24,639 --> 02:02:28,880
predictive processing process and um

3602
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:31,840
i think marco was saying like some of

3603
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:33,360
the assumptions then for it to go to

3604
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:34,880
active inference

3605
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:38,000
you know we the math is there to make it

3606
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:38,880
solid but we

3607
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:40,400
you know we can think beyond that

3608
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:42,400
because then they say active inference

3609
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:43,199
is really an

3610
02:02:43,199 --> 02:02:45,280
active inference which goes another

3611
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:47,679
level and the math that's not a math

3612
02:02:47,679 --> 02:02:49,520
thing that's like okay so if it's n

3613
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:51,520
active inference and then does there

3614
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:52,639
need to be

3615
02:02:52,639 --> 02:02:54,000
like you say what else is there i'm

3616
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,360
actually quite interested in potentially

3617
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:56,719
been looking at some ideas of some

3618
02:02:56,719 --> 02:02:58,320
spatial

3619
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:00,400
layers like we talked to had that thing

3620
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:02,560
about projective consciousness and some

3621
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:04,239
other layers like

3622
02:03:04,239 --> 02:03:08,080
what are the what's the layers beyond

3623
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:11,599
inactive that i need to be there for

3624
02:03:11,599 --> 02:03:14,400
these processes to be plausible and

3625
02:03:14,400 --> 02:03:15,760
who knows that that would be something

3626
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:17,599
that we'll talk about in later date but

3627
02:03:17,599 --> 02:03:18,080
i like

3628
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:20,159
this this slide could actually be

3629
02:03:20,159 --> 02:03:21,520
something that could be played with in

3630
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:22,400
the future

3631
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:23,760
as a learning tool because i think it's

3632
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:25,440
quite helpful

3633
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:29,199
great thanks so much steven sarah

3634
02:03:29,199 --> 02:03:31,679
oh the trail might be kind of cold now

3635
02:03:31,679 --> 02:03:33,760
but you super had my attention

3636
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:36,800
um on on yours you know you had your

3637
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:37,920
arrow moving around

3638
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:39,440
and you said you know this is the place

3639
02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:41,119
where there's like a connection between

3640
02:03:41,119 --> 02:03:44,560
thermal uh energy and free energy and i

3641
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:45,360
was like

3642
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:48,000
where because i mean you know math wise

3643
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:49,040
because i've

3644
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:50,719
that's always just been this super

3645
02:03:50,719 --> 02:03:53,040
separate world that's annoying and i

3646
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:54,480
can't really put it together

3647
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:56,960
so i want to find where that is and then

3648
02:03:56,960 --> 02:03:57,599
go

3649
02:03:57,599 --> 02:03:59,920
find it in the math you know that the

3650
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:01,440
word description in this really

3651
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:03,280
nice slide and then the math and try to

3652
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:04,880
figure that out

3653
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:08,480
great call great call um i agree

3654
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:10,560
it's why one of our projects just to

3655
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:12,000
sort of like talk a little bit about the

3656
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,440
lab since everybody here is basically a

3657
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:14,639
participant in it

3658
02:04:14,639 --> 02:04:16,400
it's one of the reasons why having the

3659
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:18,880
ontology and the structure of knowledge

3660
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:20,719
for the equations is really important

3661
02:04:20,719 --> 02:04:22,639
because we want to be able to say this

3662
02:04:22,639 --> 02:04:24,639
equation in this paper

3663
02:04:24,639 --> 02:04:27,440
is where the variables in the you know

3664
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:27,679
the

3665
02:04:27,679 --> 02:04:30,400
f from this paper in this other math

3666
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:31,679
area actually we're going to call it

3667
02:04:31,679 --> 02:04:32,639
this letter

3668
02:04:32,639 --> 02:04:34,239
and here's this and that's where there's

3669
02:04:34,239 --> 02:04:35,679
a point of contact with this

3670
02:04:35,679 --> 02:04:37,520
and then is this one following from that

3671
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:39,280
one is that one following from this one

3672
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:41,360
those are the kinds of things that truly

3673
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:42,480
are

3674
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:44,480
in the frontier of what we can

3675
02:04:44,480 --> 02:04:45,520
understand

3676
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:47,199
and then understanding how to bring

3677
02:04:47,199 --> 02:04:49,599
directly from these analytical

3678
02:04:49,599 --> 02:04:52,560
mathematical phrasings to the control

3679
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:54,800
theoretic in the policy selection

3680
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:56,960
that's a non-trivia it's not a velcro

3681
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:58,079
interface that's a

3682
02:04:58,079 --> 02:05:00,960
serious maneuver that involves also

3683
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:03,040
moving through

3684
02:05:03,040 --> 02:05:05,360
as pointed out equilibrium and steady

3685
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:06,800
state and far from equilibrium

3686
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:08,159
non-equilibrium all these different

3687
02:05:08,159 --> 02:05:09,199
things

3688
02:05:09,199 --> 02:05:12,800
in this metaphor or is it not realm of

3689
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:16,000
info thermo so lots of exciting

3690
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:19,199
work to be done and traced good points

3691
02:05:19,199 --> 02:05:20,800
and then also yes steven just you

3692
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:22,800
pointed out it's um active inference

3693
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:24,079
imagine if someone said in

3694
02:05:24,079 --> 02:05:26,400
2010 well active inference is simply one

3695
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:28,560
time step and it's xyz it's like

3696
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:31,360
it was and then now it's something else

3697
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:32,400
we've talked about

3698
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:34,400
and activism we've talked about

3699
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:35,679
affective inference

3700
02:05:35,679 --> 02:05:38,000
now is the variable in affective

3701
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:38,719
inference

3702
02:05:38,719 --> 02:05:40,560
equivalent to answering philosophical

3703
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:42,400
questions about affect no

3704
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:44,719
but neither was the variable affect in

3705
02:05:44,719 --> 02:05:46,320
any other modeling framework

3706
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:49,360
which again makes us pull back and just

3707
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:51,119
look at that instrumentalism versus

3708
02:05:51,119 --> 02:05:52,560
realism debate

3709
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:54,719
so just the realism would be this is

3710
02:05:54,719 --> 02:05:55,679
actually telling us

3711
02:05:55,679 --> 02:05:57,599
how the world is arranged and what it's

3712
02:05:57,599 --> 02:05:59,679
doing versus just

3713
02:05:59,679 --> 02:06:02,960
this is a framework that is being

3714
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:05,520
just like mel's paper this is one of the

3715
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:06,800
main points is

3716
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:08,880
with respect to science it's in the

3717
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:10,159
realm of science

3718
02:06:10,159 --> 02:06:12,719
but what is it in the realm of science

3719
02:06:12,719 --> 02:06:13,280
well

3720
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:15,760
it's not one of these falsifiable

3721
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:17,040
theories up here

3722
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:19,360
it's something that's more like natural

3723
02:06:19,360 --> 02:06:20,239
selection

3724
02:06:20,239 --> 02:06:22,639
at that type of tier but it's like a

3725
02:06:22,639 --> 02:06:24,639
theory generator and and that's why if

3726
02:06:24,639 --> 02:06:26,239
we look at the road map

3727
02:06:26,239 --> 02:06:30,000
there's um 14 sections

3728
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:34,000
on kinds of models because this is like

3729
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:37,440
the system that this is being slotted

3730
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:38,480
into

3731
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:40,560
mel could have or anyone potentially

3732
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:42,000
could go the other and say no it's not

3733
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:43,679
part of science it's part it's okay so

3734
02:06:43,679 --> 02:06:45,280
you can debate about where it is with

3735
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:46,960
respect to the demarcation problem

3736
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:48,560
but since this is the paper we're in the

3737
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:50,800
journal club on we're saying

3738
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:52,079
given that that's the view being

3739
02:06:52,079 --> 02:06:53,920
defended the literature

3740
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:56,639
has to be integrated in is not theology

3741
02:06:56,639 --> 02:06:57,840
it's not poetry

3742
02:06:57,840 --> 02:07:00,400
it's actually scientific modeling

3743
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:01,520
philosophy of science

3744
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:04,079
literature so then that will help us

3745
02:07:04,079 --> 02:07:05,280
connect it to like

3746
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:06,960
okay but what does the variable in a

3747
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:08,639
linear regression mean

3748
02:07:08,639 --> 02:07:10,480
is that realist versus instrumentalist

3749
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:12,000
interpretation nobody would

3750
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,360
say it's realist it's not there's not

3751
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:15,679
like a line in nature it's making

3752
02:07:15,679 --> 02:07:19,040
one you know group of plants a different

3753
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:20,800
shade than another group of plants

3754
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:22,880
so that's sort of the process that this

3755
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:24,800
paper is engaged in

3756
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:27,119
is interfacing better so that we can

3757
02:07:27,119 --> 02:07:28,079
understand what

3758
02:07:28,079 --> 02:07:30,960
kind of thing the fep is and uh there's

3759
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:31,599
a few

3760
02:07:31,599 --> 02:07:35,199
uh exhortations like this is it true

3761
02:07:35,199 --> 02:07:36,400
what is it true of

3762
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:37,760
how do we empirically know that it's

3763
02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:39,440
true and mel

3764
02:07:39,440 --> 02:07:42,320
argues that that's a category mistake so

3765
02:07:42,320 --> 02:07:43,599
it's like saying

3766
02:07:43,599 --> 02:07:45,760
any other category mistake now think

3767
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:47,679
about these questions in relationship to

3768
02:07:47,679 --> 02:07:48,320
the fep

3769
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:51,679
being like that so again great

3770
02:07:51,679 --> 02:07:54,480
paper we'll just go to the closing

3771
02:07:54,480 --> 02:07:55,040
thoughts

3772
02:07:55,040 --> 02:07:58,719
now but just thanks everyone for

3773
02:07:58,719 --> 02:08:01,199
being a part of 14.2 and all the other

3774
02:08:01,199 --> 02:08:02,880
sections because this was really like

3775
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:05,920
two great discussions

3776
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:08,079
i'm looking forward to that people can

3777
02:08:08,079 --> 02:08:09,280
raise their hand if they want to make

3778
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:10,400
final comments but

3779
02:08:10,400 --> 02:08:13,199
i'm really looking forward to the

3780
02:08:13,199 --> 02:08:14,000
discussion

3781
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:18,159
with the authors um hippolyto and van

3782
02:08:18,159 --> 02:08:21,920
s on 15 for both weeks and that will be

3783
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:22,880
interesting and

3784
02:08:22,880 --> 02:08:24,320
we'll confront this realism

3785
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:26,719
instrumentalism discussion

3786
02:08:26,719 --> 02:08:31,040
and then also um the zero videos will be

3787
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:33,840
a dialogue so hopefully more and more

3788
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:34,639
people will

3789
02:08:34,639 --> 02:08:37,119
get involved with making the summaries

3790
02:08:37,119 --> 02:08:38,480
of the videos

3791
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:40,239
and introducing them from different

3792
02:08:40,239 --> 02:08:42,400
perspectives different lengths

3793
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:44,480
and each paper is unique instead of

3794
02:08:44,480 --> 02:08:45,840
authors and set of people who are

3795
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:47,040
approaching it so i just

3796
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:48,880
it's been really awesome to see people

3797
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:50,719
engaging with some of these

3798
02:08:50,719 --> 02:08:52,639
truly long-standing and fundamental

3799
02:08:52,639 --> 02:08:53,760
questions

3800
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:56,960
in a new light and then also

3801
02:08:56,960 --> 02:09:00,159
just co-creating with

3802
02:09:00,159 --> 02:09:03,679
first just participation in live streams

3803
02:09:03,679 --> 02:09:05,840
maybe even just by watching but then

3804
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:07,199
anybody who's watching

3805
02:09:07,199 --> 02:09:08,880
live earned replay is always welcome to

3806
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:11,199
join or find out what we're doing in the

3807
02:09:11,199 --> 02:09:11,840
lab

3808
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:14,719
so it's just been a really good you know

3809
02:09:14,719 --> 02:09:16,719
we grew a lot during 14

3810
02:09:16,719 --> 02:09:19,840
and so is good times so any other final

3811
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:20,719
comments that

3812
02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:24,719
the panel wants to make yeah i'm gonna

3813
02:09:24,719 --> 02:09:26,639
i'm gonna grow some neurons now this was

3814
02:09:26,639 --> 02:09:29,360
awesome peace

3815
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:32,400
marco go for it yeah i just wanted to

3816
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:32,719
say

3817
02:09:32,719 --> 02:09:35,520
um ever since i first joined i can't

3818
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:35,920
find

3819
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:38,159
the survey you keep mentioning i have no

3820
02:09:38,159 --> 02:09:39,599
idea where the survey is so maybe

3821
02:09:39,599 --> 02:09:42,719
get to tell us and the viewers

3822
02:09:42,719 --> 02:09:45,840
where to provide feedback sure well the

3823
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:46,400
survey

3824
02:09:46,400 --> 02:09:49,360
for live participants is in the event

3825
02:09:49,360 --> 02:09:50,159
calendar

3826
02:09:50,159 --> 02:09:52,639
so it's in the calendar invite and so

3827
02:09:52,639 --> 02:09:54,079
yeah for those who are listening to the

3828
02:09:54,079 --> 02:09:56,480
very bitter end the drags of the active

3829
02:09:56,480 --> 02:09:57,280
stream

3830
02:09:57,280 --> 02:09:59,520
basically the single source of truth is

3831
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:00,719
the calendar invite

3832
02:10:00,719 --> 02:10:03,679
it has the slides that are accommodable

3833
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:04,560
the paper

3834
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:07,199
the video url and the feedback form and

3835
02:10:07,199 --> 02:10:08,480
then the feedback form

3836
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:09,679
you know it'd be awesome if everybody

3837
02:10:09,679 --> 02:10:12,079
fills it out but then the feedback form

3838
02:10:12,079 --> 02:10:13,679
for everyone else is just

3839
02:10:13,679 --> 02:10:16,400
email comment threads youtube comments

3840
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:16,800
just

3841
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:19,520
leave feedback publicly or privately

3842
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:20,719
we'll always respect

3843
02:10:20,719 --> 02:10:23,360
both public and private feedback and let

3844
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:24,880
you know how it influenced our

3845
02:10:24,880 --> 02:10:27,760
trajectory so but for live participants

3846
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:29,599
we have a special structured form

3847
02:10:29,599 --> 02:10:31,599
that we can always modify and evolve as

3848
02:10:31,599 --> 02:10:32,639
well so

3849
02:10:32,639 --> 02:10:34,800
that's a little insider baseball but

3850
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:36,639
always happy to talk about that because

3851
02:10:36,639 --> 02:10:37,280
that's

3852
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:40,719
what it is we do is it not steven

3853
02:10:40,719 --> 02:10:42,880
and sarah on the discord and all the

3854
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:43,840
decision making

3855
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:46,480
maybe it is maybe decent but it's been

3856
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:46,960
fun

3857
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:50,079
so no it's great a very good explanation

3858
02:10:50,079 --> 02:10:50,719
and uh

3859
02:10:50,719 --> 02:10:52,719
i enjoy it today right like so i've got

3860
02:10:52,719 --> 02:10:54,719
to grow i think i'll grow a spare brain

3861
02:10:54,719 --> 02:10:56,239
and then i'll fill it up and put it back

3862
02:10:56,239 --> 02:10:57,040
in my head

3863
02:10:57,040 --> 02:10:59,280
just force it off source it put it in

3864
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:00,079
the papes

3865
02:11:00,079 --> 02:11:02,800
