lab the active inference live stream

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,640
this is

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,560
active inference live stream number 14.0

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,560
and i'm looking forward to today's

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,038
discussion

learning and practice related to active

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,120

username active inference

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,760
this is a recorded and an archived live

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,280
stream so please provide us with

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,239
feedback so that we can improve our work

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,079
all backgrounds and perspectives are

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,360
welcome here

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,359
and as far as video etiquette for live

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,280
streams please mute if there's noise in

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,320
the background

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,840
raise your hands so we can hear from

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,519
everybody who wants to speak

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,439
and we will use respectful speech

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,360
behavior

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,680
for the regularly scheduled active

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,320
inference streams during 2021

33
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,880
all group discussions are going to be on

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,680
tuesdays

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,960
from 7 to 9 00 a.m pacific time and that

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,439
will be a regular weekly time slot

37
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,240
and we also do special sessions if you

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,119
go to this

39
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,759
link with the red text you can see some

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,840
information about participating in

41
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,079
future streams and definitely get in

42
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,880
touch with us

43
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,240
if you want to participate in 2021 or if

44
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,159
you have an idea for an event

45
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,240
or somebody we could invite for a live

46
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,399
stream

47
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,479
if you go to that spreadsheet you will

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,520
see these

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,720
um columns that cover the date of each

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,000
active inference live stream that's

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,240
scheduled and what we'll be reading and

52
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,560
anything else about it we just finished

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,920
up

54
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,280
13.1 and 13.2 which were really fun and

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,079
this dot zero video is heading into

56
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,280
active infrared stream 14.1 and 14.2

57
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,679
reading the math is not the territory by

58
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,280
mel andrews

59
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,040
and mel will be joining us for these

60
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,640
discussions so we're really

61
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,000
looking forward to that today

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,280
in active inference stream 14.0 the goal

63
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,000
is to set

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,440
the context for 14.1 and 14.2 which will

65
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,879
be group discussions

66
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,360
and the paper under consideration in all

67
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,800
three of these live streams

68
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,280
is the math is not the territory

69
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,519
navigating the free energy principle

70
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,800
by mel andrews 20 20. the video

71
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,200
is just an introduction to some of the

72
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,440
ideas and some of the context it's not a

73
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,080
review

74
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,920
or a final word and a punchline

75
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,599
for this paper is all models are wrong

76
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,519
but some are useful and some are the

77
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,879
free energy principle

78
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,480
which ones are which that's what we're

79
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,800
here to talk about

80
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,840
in the sections of 14.0 today

81
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,920
first we'll go through the aims and

82
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,519
claims of the paper

83
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,440
talk about a little background

84
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,760
represented by the keywords

85
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,599
go through the abstract and look over

86
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,040
the roadmap

87
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,080
then we'll pass through a few key topics

88
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,560
and key quotations from the paper

89
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,879
and end up with a couple questions that

90
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,319
are remaining

91
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,440
in 14.1 and in 14.2 we're going to be

92
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,680
discussing this very same paper

93
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,599
so save your questions post them as a

94
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,040
comment on this video

95
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
and definitely get in touch if you want

96
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,560
to participate live

97
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,599
in this conversation or in a future or

98
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,239
different conversation

99
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,280
okay here we are in the paper which is

100
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,360
the math is not the territory

101
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,000
navigating the free energy principle by

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,200
mel andrews

103
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,200
which was put up on a philsai archive

104
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,799
pre-print server on october 8th 2020

105
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,959
and the aims and the claims of the paper

106
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,400
are as follows

107
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,200
quoting mel with respect to the

108
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,640
demarcation problem

109
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,120
i defend the position that the fep free

110
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,080
energy principle

111
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,239
can be taken to belong properly to the

112
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,840
domain of science

113
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,280
and we're going to talk more about the

114
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,760
demarcation problem in a few minutes but

115
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,519
that's the question of what is science

116
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,000
and what is not science

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,800
mel writes the fep is certainly not

118
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,160
anything like a theory

119
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,520
a law a hypothesis or a research program

120
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,880
as these have been classically

121
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,880
understood in the history and philosophy

122
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,000
of science

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,360
so this is a claim that what the fep is

124
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,440
or what it does how it's enacted in the

125
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,360
world is different than some of these

126
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,320
classical

127
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,639
history and philosophy of science terms

128
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,560
like theory law hypothesis

129
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,320
or program in order to see how the

130
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,560
literature on scientific models this is

131
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,120
a claim

132
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,840
accords with the fep however we will

133
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,199
first need to establish

134
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,919
a firm sense of what the fep is and what

135
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,360
it is not

136
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,520
this will require dispelling a number of

137
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,039
false assumptions that have been made

138
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,560
about the framework

139
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,479
i accomplished this first by tracing out

140
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,880
the historical buildup to the fep

141
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,800
illustrating where the formalism has

142
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,960
been derived from and from what it has

143
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,639
come to signify

144
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,800
and continuing on that quote this serves

145
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,320
the purpose primarily of showing how

146
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,400
much of the mechanics of the fep

147
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,560
had physical meanings in its initial

148
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,199
form but has since come into a strictly

149
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,639
formal use

150
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,280
forma following this i will demonstrate

151
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,360
that the formalism is empty of any sort

152
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,199
of facts or assertions

153
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,720
about the state of nature that would

154
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,400
allow it to draw taxonomical

155
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,360
distinctions

156
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,199
to differentiate classes of natural

157
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,199
systems to explain their behavior in

158
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,280
terms of underlying mechanisms or

159
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,240
to bring forth testable hypotheses

160
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,960
strong

161
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,280
claims and that's what's going to be fun

162
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,560
about this paper

163
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,280
and this discussion is it's uh hopefully

164
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,800
going to be

165
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,960
highlighting many different perspectives

166
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,160
on what the fep

167
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,039
is or is not so if you're watching live

168
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,560
if you're watching afterwards if you

169
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,319
want to participate in some way

170
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,560
and you're curious about these questions

171
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,000
these are the kinds of questions that

172
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,199
are being actively

173
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,199
researched and debated so you're in the

174
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,680
right place

175
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,720
let's see how we're going to set up the

176
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,440
background

177
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,520
to address these aims and claims of the

178
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,639
paper

179
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,280
the keywords of the paper are as follows

180
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,720
free energy principle

181
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,080
bayesian brain life mind continuity

182
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,000
scientific models modeling and

183
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,319
simulations scientific theories

184
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,280
epistemic virtues falsification and the

185
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,120
demarcation problem

186
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,360
now as always for these keywords there's

187
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,600
really so much to be said about each one

188
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,919
you could study for your whole life

189
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,919
going down just one detail of one of

190
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,080
these keywords so it's not a review

191
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,199
it's not a final word my target with

192
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,720
these keyword summaries

193
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,440
is the construction of a bi-directional

194
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,160
on-ramp

195
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,680
it's a it's not an off-ramp it's

196
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,599
actually an on-ramp for everyone

197
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,680
and the on-ramp is going between this

198
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,080
paper and broader communities

199
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,759
so if you're in the active inference

200
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,759
community i hope that this paper

201
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,720
is an introduction or a reminder of some

202
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,360
of the bigger

203
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,840
philosophical and historical trends that

204
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,639
the fep

205
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,080
and active inference research is

206
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,000
happening inside of

207
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,919
and if you're outside of the active

208
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,520
inference research community

209
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,280
then hopefully you're going to find a

210
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,199
few points of contact with how you

211
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,400
currently view the world

212
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,319
but also start to get excited and

213
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,000
curious about this little thing

214
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,720
called free energy principle what is the

215
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
free energy principle

216
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,599
well on this slide i put up a couple of

217
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,319
terms

218
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,080
and these terms are all going to come

219
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,319
together in the free energy principle

220
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,720
and i'll read a couple quotes on that

221
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,080
but the terms up here

222
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,160
are multi-scale systems from the left to

223
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,440
the right so that means

224
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,840
systems that exist across multiple

225
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,759
spatial and temporal scales

226
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,199
so something that exists over

227
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,520
milliseconds and seconds and minutes

228
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,680
that's temporal scales and something

229
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,759
that is exist

230
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,120
existing or displaying orderliness over

231
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,000
spatial scales that are small to big so

232
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,440
cells that are part of a

233
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,039
organized tissue that are part of an

234
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,680
organism part of a

235
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,879
ecosystem that's multi-scale

236
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,720
another key aspect of the free energy

237
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,919
principle is a focus

238
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,319
on ensembles which is akin to talking

239
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,080
about collective behavior

240
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,919
so we're not going to be behavioral

241
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,280
reductionists or

242
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,599
essentialists we're not going to go to

243
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,680
the smallest possible unit of motion

244
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,760
and say that that's the most meaningful

245
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,599
nor are we going to simply go to the

246
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,240
largest

247
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
scale of phenotype and say that that's

248
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,519
the most meaningful

249
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,839
we're going to be using this multi-scale

250
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:42,958
perspective

251
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,120
and thinking about ensembles of

252
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,399
collective systems

253
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,640
and using that to move beyond

254
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,560
internalism and externalism

255
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,600
to integrate holism and reductionism

256
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,680
we're also going to be taking a strong

257
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,240
informational thermodynamic perspective

258
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,519
and some of the history of this we're

259
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,440
going to trace in this video and was so

260
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,959
excellently traced by mel

261
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,240
during the paper and info thermodynamics

262
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,120
is basically

263
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,360
starting with thermodynamics so about

264
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,519
the vibrations of molecules and about

265
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,880
heat and entropy

266
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,360
and then considering how since

267
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,120
information is something that has to be

268
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,680
embodied or manifest in the real world

269
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,920
for example on a hard drive or passing

270
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,360
through a wire

271
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,800
we can actually think about

272
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,040
thermodynamics and signal processing

273
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,120
within a broader informational capacity

274
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,200
and then this last point here action

275
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,320
policy selection

276
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,560
as so this first part is saying it's

277
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,240
going to be a control theory or a

278
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,360
cybernetic

279
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,240
focused framework and the way that those

280
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,839
policies are going to be obtained

281
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,080
is going to be through a type of

282
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,560
variational multi-scale bayesian

283
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,720
inference so we're not going to be using

284
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,640
uh linear regression or we're not going

285
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,440
to be using

286
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,279
some other type of machine learning

287
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,959
algorithm we're going to be using

288
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,279
derivatives on this variational bayesian

289
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,800
inference approach

290
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,279
how about this bug on the left side of

291
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,000
this slide

292
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,720
why is there a little bug well that

293
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,839
comes from

294
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,480
the title of an interview that i carried

295
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,079
out with my colleague martin

296
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,440
and carl firsten in 2018 that was

297
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
entitled of woodlice and men

298
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,839
a bayesian account of cognition life and

299
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,360
consciousness at the url

300
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,079
here and we asked him early in the

301
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,040
interview we said

302
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,680
what is the free energy principle and

303
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,560
how did you

304
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,640
get to the place where you are at with

305
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,600
it now

306
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,040
and carl wrote he was watching

307
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,120
wood lice which are these little bugs

308
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,720
watching them scurry around

309
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,680
on the ground and he wrote after half an

310
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,000
hour of observation and innocent

311
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,640
child-like contemplation i realized that

312
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,399
their scurrying had no purpose

313
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,880
or intent they were simply moving faster

314
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,040
in the sun and slower in the shade

315
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
which meant that they were spending most

316
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,399
of their time in the shade from the

317
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,000
population or ensemble

318
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,839
perspective because they would go

319
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,680
rapidly through the sun and then dwell

320
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,519
in the shade so even if it was 50 50

321
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,800
you'd end up enriching them in the shade

322
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,040
the simplicity of this explanation for

323
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,640
what one could artfully call

324
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,959
biotic self-organization appeal to me

325
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,720
then and appeals to me now

326
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,399
it is exactly the same principle that

327
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,240
underwrites the ensemble density

328
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,160
dynamics of the free energy principle

329
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,320
and all of its corollaries so that's a

330
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,200
key piece

331
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,880
there's going to be ensemble density

332
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,720
dynamics so it's going to change through

333
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,120
time

334
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,880
and it's going to be collective behavior

335
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,320
and it's going to be

336
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,000
related to not just the free energy

337
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,079
principle but some of its corollaries or

338
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:36,959
some things that are

339
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,720
adjacent to it and we'll talk about what

340
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,720
those are

341
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,200
he then continued over the subsequent 20

342
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,959
years i learned enough mathematics to

343
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,560
think about the shapes

344
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,200
of wood lice in terms of density

345
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,320
dynamics

346
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,560
namely the evolution of probability

347
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,880
density distributions over ensembles of

348
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,440
states

349
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,320
for example swarms of wood lice happily

350
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,760
people had been using this

351
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,600
exact sort of framework both to model

352
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,320
the world and analyze their data

353
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,880
i came to know this as ensemble learning

354
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,000
and in particular

355
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,560
variational base this is how the free

356
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,440
energy principle

357
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,519
developed into the current framework in

358
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,839
brief i was very lucky to meet the right

359
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:16,399
people

360
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,720
and work in an era when these ideas were

361
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,240
in the air

362
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,440
so as always humble and insightful

363
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,880
carl what is the bayesian brain

364
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,360
let's draw from one of the questions

365
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,399
that martin and i

366
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,639
asked in our interview because we tried

367
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,800
to be very clear about what the bayesian

368
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,760
brain was

369
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,440
so that we could be very clear in

370
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,200
distinguishing it what the free energy

371
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,160
principle was

372
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,399
and also just so that we don't end up

373
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,240
confounding our uncertainty

374
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,480
as we try to contrast different ideas

375
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,079
because it's really important to have a

376
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,360
solid understanding

377
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,639
of these terms that we're going to be

378
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,160
talking about so that we don't

379
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,200
accidentally

380
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,079
make errors or misattributions or false

381
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,760
positives or false negatives in our

382
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,600
understanding

383
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,200
we wrote the bayesian brain hypothesis

384
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,959
and the free energy prince oh the basin

385
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,120
brain hypothesis predictive coding

386
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,959
and the free energy principle are often

387
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,040
equated with one another

388
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,040
you have yourself suggested that these

389
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,800
three frameworks are variation

390
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,399
of the same basic mechanisms to be clear

391
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,920
what we call the bayesian brain

392
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,839
hypothesis is the idea that the brain

393
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,600
performs inference according to bayes

394
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,320
theorem

395
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,079
integrating new information in light of

396
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,079
existing models of the world

397
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,079
a perceptual or cognitive state can be

398
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,279
modeled as being a posterior probability

399
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,639
so p of h given d where p

400
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,279
stands for probability h hypothesis

401
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:39,839
cause

402
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,240
and d observed or available data so the

403
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,120
probability

404
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,360
of the hypothesis being the case given

405
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,480
the data

406
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,639
the posterior probability is the product

407
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,600
of the likelihood

408
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,240
p d given h the probability of the data

409
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,839
given the hypothesis

410
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,079
and the prior probability which is p of

411
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,760
h or just the probability of a

412
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,519
hypothesis being true

413
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,360
in other words the probability of the

414
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,720
model h being true

415
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,639
is the likelihood of the model h given

416
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,240
the observation d

417
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,959
multiplied by the likelihood of a model

418
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,480
h relative to other models under

419
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,320
consideration

420
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,519
to make these equations a bit more

421
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,120
concrete let us take the following

422
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,519
example the brain is receiving scarce

423
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,000
data

424
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,160
d from the retina and must form a model

425
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,240
h of how the world is has caused this

426
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,839
pattern on the retina

427
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,680
in bayesian terms the problem to be

428
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,880
solved is the following

429
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,160
p of h given d no not p h d p

430
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,199
of h given d the bayesian brain

431
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,000
hypothesis

432
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,240
implies that the posterior probability

433
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,000
at time one or t one

434
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,079
provides the prior probability at time

435
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,399
two t two

436
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,480
so this was our characterization of the

437
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,519
bayesian brain

438
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,880
and we're going through it because it's

439
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,880
a key word in this paper because it's

440
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,600
very

441
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,519
important to understand what exactly the

442
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,720
bayesian brain is

443
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,399
or isn't so we can understand what the

444
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,160
fep is or isn't

445
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,480
so that's the bayesian brain hypothesis

446
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
it's the idea that we're going to use

447
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,279
bayesian approaches bayesian equations

448
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,240
formalisms

449
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,720
to model the way that the brain as a

450
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,000
statistical instrument

451
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,079
in the world yes an evolved one but

452
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,839
we're going to focus on the process of

453
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,600
inference for now

454
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,839
it's going to be generating hypotheses

455
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,600
about latent causes of the world or

456
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,800
about things in the world

457
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,519
given observations and updating its

458
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,440
prior understandings or beliefs about

459
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,040
the world

460
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,120
we then asked if carl agreed with that

461
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,880
characterization of the bayesian brain

462
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,079
hypothesis

463
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,240
and he wrote even though he also

464
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,279
improved the question

465
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,199
as we had asked it he wrote in his

466
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,120
response do i agree

467
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,480
with this characterization of the

468
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,560
bayesian brain hypothesis yes i do

469
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,480
with a couple caveats i think it is

470
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,160
useful to make a fundamental distinction

471
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,600
at this point that we can appeal to

472
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,399
later

473
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,399
the distinction is between a state and a

474
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,600
process theory

475
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
i.e the difference between a normative

476
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,680
principle that things may or may not

477
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,720
conform to

478
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,440
and a process theory or hypothesis about

479
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,920
how that principle is realized

480
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,000
under this distinction the free energy

481
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,360
principle ergo

482
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,839
it's a normative principle stands in

483
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,120
stark distinction to things like

484
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
predictive coding and the bayesian brain

485
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,560
hypothesis so critical point principles

486
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,600
are contrasted with hypotheses

487
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,040
this is because the free energy

488
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,600
principle is what it is a principle

489
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,680
like hamilton's principle of stationary

490
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,480
action it cannot be falsified

491
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,639
key point and this has resulted in a lot

492
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,560
of discussion

493
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,800
it cannot be disproven in fact there's

494
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,560
not much you can do with a free energy

495
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,279
principle

496
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,959
unless you ask whether measurable

497
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,040
systems conform to the principle

498
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,440
on the other hand hypotheses that the

499
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,600
brain performs some type of bayesian

500
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,519
inference or predictive coding

501
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,240
are what they are hypotheses these

502
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,519
hypotheses

503
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,839
may or may not be supported by empirical

504
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,519
evidence so in other words

505
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,160
those hypotheses can be falsifiable they

506
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,839
can be tested and rejected

507
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,680
you can say if it's the case that the

508
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,759
brain is doing bayesian inference it

509
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,639
should have this

510
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,800
observation in this brain region okay we

511
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,799
measured it's consistent or it's not

512
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,880
we rejected it so it's funny because

513
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,959
even though we're talking

514
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,880
about bayesian brain which is a

515
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,839
post-falsificationist idea

516
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,319
in the terms in the sense of statistics

517
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,679
we're actually going to use

518
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,039
the poparian idea of falsification from

519
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,400
the philosophy of science

520
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,240
perspective to ask whether we could

521
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,559
falsify the bayesian brain idea

522
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,079
so what does it look like to have

523
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,039
hypotheses that are beyond

524
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:31,440
falsificationism

525
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,679
does bayesian statistics or the bayesian

526
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,960
turn actually

527
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,840
move us away from simple falsification

528
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,200
because it's not the case that there's

529
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,880
just going to be some experiment in most

530
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,600
situations that slam dunk disproves

531
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,919
usually most evidence is actually

532
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:46,880
ambiguous

533
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,960
depending on how you weight the

534
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,160
different possibilities

535
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,960
for example a tree to an evolutionary

536
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,679
biologist

537
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,760
is an example of natural selection but

538
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,760
to a creationist the very same tree is

539
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,360
an example of creation

540
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,840
so that's how evidence is related to the

541
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,799
generative model that someone has

542
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,120
in this view the relationship between

543
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,400
the free energy principle

544
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,799
and predictive coding or the bayesian

545
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,480
brain or active inference

546
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,559
is the relationship between a principle

547
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,559
and a process theory

548
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,160
crucially there are lots of process

549
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,080
theories that conform to the free energy

550
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,880
principle

551
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,960
predictive coding is arguably the

552
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,880
predominant process theory in cognitive

553
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,760
neuroscience

554
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,240
however there are other contenders for

555
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,320
example based upon discrete as opposed

556
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,480
to continuous state space models

557
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,919
these would include things like belief

558
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,840
propagation and variational message

559
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,640
passing

560
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,400
these schemes or processes serve as

561
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,000
plausible metaphors

562
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,679
for neuronal message passing that may or

563
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,200
may not have the look and feel of

564
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,640
predictive coding

565
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,080
it is important to note that there have

566
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,600
been other process theories that have

567
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
not fared so well in light of empirical

568
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,320
evidence

569
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,559
for example probabilistic population

570
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,640
codes and attempts to understand

571
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,720
ensemble dynamics in terms of sampling

572
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,080
from the posterior

573
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,240
e.g gibbs sampling and particle

574
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,919
filtering so in other words

575
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,559
free energy principle is beyond or

576
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,200
before

577
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,240
empirical data however it lends itself

578
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:08,640
to

579
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,360
corollary hypotheses process theories

580
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,559
that make specific

581
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,520
testable predictions about how the fep

582
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,799
is getting done

583
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,799
and so you could predict that little

584
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,799
tiny unicorns are doing it and then you

585
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,120
can go and measure and falsify that idea

586
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,280
so again we're using the paparian idea

587
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,400
of falsification

588
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,280
of theories to discuss whether this

589
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,080
bayesian

590
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,600
perspective on the brain is adequate

591
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,240
the bayesian understanding of the brain

592
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,760
if we pull back a step

593
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,480
is related to what is called and what is

594
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,919
keyworded as

595
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,360
life mind continuity and this is what

596
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,760
the definition of the inactive life mind

597
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,039
continuity thesis

598
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,559
is it's written as any living system

599
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,760
is ipso facto a cognitive system or in

600
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,400
other words

601
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
life is sufficient for mind so that's

602
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,640
the claim that living systems are

603
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,919
mindful systems what makes a system

604
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,000
living and therefore cognitive

605
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,919
is its autonomy now this often

606
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,520
ties me up because i think okay

607
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,039
autonomous systems does that mean they

608
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,720
must be cognitive so now we're working

609
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,080
backwards from what appears to be

610
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,960
cognitive

611
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,480
but isn't that hubris because we're

612
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,240
putting our understanding of another

613
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,960
system

614
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,880
in front of its actual way of being in

615
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,960
the world i don't know

616
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,799
and the last point here is understanding

617
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,000
cognition requires

618
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,600
understanding the principles of

619
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,200
biological atta

620
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,240
autonomy and this uh is

621
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,320
just the simplest phrasing of that

622
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,840
thesis so that's kind of like

623
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,480
that claim which is living systems are

624
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,600
those with mind

625
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
now where does awareness come into play

626
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,960
free will agency

627
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,679
autonomy great questions if anyone knows

628
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,600
if anyone has suggestions let's

629
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
hear them in the live chat or come on

630
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,039
and let's discuss it

631
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,360
on a stream um but this was something

632
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,240
that i was just

633
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,080
learning about when i was preparing for

634
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,360
this talk

635
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,960
and another thing that i found that was

636
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,840
pretty cool was a paper from 2017

637
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,919
in progress in biophysics and molecular

638
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,600
biology which sounds like it would be

639
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,280
just about molecular biology

640
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,880
of a journal but actually it's an

641
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,280
awesome journal with a lot

642
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,840
other ideas happening and it's a paper

643
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,400
by

644
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,440
um uh hippolyto and martins

645
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,240
and ines hippolyto is also a free energy

646
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,679
principle researcher so i thought it'd

647
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:24,720
be cool to

648
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,880
highlight this paper and this

649
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,400
perspective because

650
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,120
the inactive life-mind continuity thesis

651
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,159
is not

652
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,919
written about with the fep in mind

653
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,080
whereas this paper may have been written

654
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,880
at least

655
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,640
a little bit more directly with fep in

656
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,480
mind and it's called

657
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,640
mind life continuity a qualitative study

658
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,080
of conscious experience

659
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,799
and the authors wrote according to the

660
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,720
mind life continuity thesis there are

661
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,400
three levels

662
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,960
on the weak continuity view whatever has

663
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,679
mind

664
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,000
will have life although not all things

665
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,360
that have life have mind

666
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,039
so this is the weakest version of the

667
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,120
claim which is it isn't the case that

668
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,799
just being life

669
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,120
makes you mindful however if you have

670
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,799
mind you do have life so that's the

671
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,720
weakest version of the claim

672
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,960
on the strong continuity view life and

673
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,200
mind have a common abstract model or set

674
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,280
of basic organizational properties or

675
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:15,840
things that

676
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,679
lead to them so in this view the

677
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,960
one-to-one overlap

678
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,120
is strong there's a total venn diagram

679
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,200
overlap living systems are mindful

680
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,799
systems and that's one-to-one

681
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,400
so you're either both or you're neither

682
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,120
on the methodology continuity view the

683
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,720
understanding of mind

684
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,559
requires further understanding the role

685
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,159
that it plays within the whole living

686
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:36,880
system

687
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,120
so that's a little bit more like a meta

688
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,440
or a holist or an ecological perspective

689
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,120
because it's like saying

690
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,039
we need to understand autonomy and

691
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,400
agency which is the embeddedness

692
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,440
of the agent in the niche we can't just

693
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,000
look at the head and ask whether mind is

694
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,200
inside of it

695
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,440
it's actually some a view that suggests

696
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,679
that life and mind are relational so

697
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,200
that's pretty cool

698
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,360
each of these views within the life-mind

699
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,720
continuity thesis

700
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,480
share the perspective that cognition

701
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,080
should be studied in the context of the

702
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,360
whole organism

703
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,080
so an activism holism ecological

704
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,880
psychology

705
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,559
a lot of these terms are coming into

706
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,960
play with this life-mind continuity

707
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,480
idea let's talk about scientific

708
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,360
models so scientific models it's a

709
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:23,919
pretty

710
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,919
big field there's a lot of different

711
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,840
types of models and science means a lot

712
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,039
of different things we're going to talk

713
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,640
more about what science is

714
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,520
or isn't in a couple of minutes but it's

715
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,559
times like these

716
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,080
when we can just go to the simple

717
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,600
english wikipedia page

718
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,960
and try to find the truth and on simple

719
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,000
english wiki

720
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,960
it was written a scientific model is a

721
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,120
simplified abstract view of a complex

722
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,480
reality

723
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,919
go to reality keyword if you want to

724
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,240
find out what reality is i guess

725
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,480
scientific models are used as a basis

726
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,159
for scientific work

727
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,799
they can be used to explain predict and

728
00:23:58,799 --> 00:23:59,440
test

729
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,440
or to develop computer programs or

730
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,200
mathematical equations

731
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,000
or as i always think about it model

732
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,600
explain predict design

733
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,880
perturb control a scientific model

734
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,159
represents complex

735
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,880
objects events and physical processes in

736
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,240
a logical way

737
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,320
they are an image of an original which

738
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,919
can be a model itself

739
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,039
so this is kind of like simulacra theory

740
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,600
uh or the work of umberto echo

741
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,799
scientific models

742
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,360
only have those details of the object or

743
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:29,840
image

744
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,840
modeled that are relevant i'd take a

745
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,120
slight contention there

746
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,360
it's not that they are only capturing

747
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,200
the details of the object or the image

748
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,799
that are relevant it's that they capture

749
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:39,919
what they capture

750
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,559
and whether what is captured is relevant

751
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,799
or irrelevant that's perspectival

752
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,520
or whether it's useful or not it's also

753
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,240
up to the

754
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,360
um the eye of the model viewer let's say

755
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,760
and there is no strict mapping between a

756
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,400
model

757
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,039
and the original object it models models

758
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,720
may only be valid for a given time

759
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,159
interval for a given object

760
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,320
or a given purpose for example there

761
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
isn't necessarily going to be the one

762
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:04,720
true

763
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,960
bitcoin price model there might be

764
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,880
different time scales of analysis

765
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,640
or different kinds of trading systems

766
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,400
that lend themselves to different kinds

767
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,080
of models being utilized

768
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,159
and a model trained on year one through

769
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,120
five might

770
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,480
might not be as good or might not even

771
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,400
be adequate for a different time period

772
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,600
so models are situational and that's

773
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,159
also

774
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,039
where we get this idea of science as

775
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,720
something that's doing relevant and

776
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,600
useful work utilitarian pragmatic work

777
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,559
yet also is a social construct because

778
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,120
it's enacted in a social setting

779
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,000
here's a couple um flow charts that are

780
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,440
just showing different aspects of the

781
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,039
scientific

782
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,440
process and the role that models play in

783
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,279
the scientific process

784
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,080
basically starting from a real system

785
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,360
models are made

786
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,600
and experiments can be carried out

787
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,039
models lead to

788
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,919
models of the system now model system

789
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,760
gets used a little bit confusingly for

790
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,520
example to refer to fruit flies as a

791
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,559
model system

792
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,559
as in their system that people study but

793
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:07,760
fruit flies are a real

794
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,720
system and a model system would be like

795
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,480
a simulation of a fruit fly

796
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,000
but of course you get into these

797
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,600
questions like what if i'm really

798
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,600
actually interested in studying the

799
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,360
model of a fruit fly

800
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,039
but whether you're doing experiments in

801
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,799
a so-called real system

802
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,520
or simulations in a so-called model

803
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,400
system

804
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,720
you're going to end up with observations

805
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,559
and then even more abstract than

806
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,159
simulation is actually

807
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,520
doing analytical work or um

808
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,159
or theory above the level of the model

809
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:38,720
system

810
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,120
to obtain theoretical predictions like

811
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,559
for all temperatures

812
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,000
this variable is going to be greater

813
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,400
than this variable and then

814
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,480
by comparing and contrasting the

815
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,480
empirical experimental results

816
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,000
the simulations and results that we

817
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,559
observe and theoretical predictions

818
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,960
that we might get from a more a priori

819
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,600
source

820
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,679
we're able to compare and improve our

821
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,600
model and theory overall

822
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,600
so this is not quite the scientific

823
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,200
process that's on the wall of the

824
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,000
elementary school

825
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,919
but it does capture how scientific

826
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,279
modeling is about

827
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,039
iterated improvements and about

828
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,799
integrating across different kinds of

829
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,679
experiments

830
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,559
different kinds of simulations and just

831
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,720
to give a point on the falsification

832
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,440
because falsification means in some

833
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,559
situations to

834
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,600
um to confabulate

835
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,640
or maybe fabulate to to make up to um

836
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,520
generate data that's false like to

837
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
basically commit scientific fraud is

838
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,600
often called falsification of data

839
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,520
so if someone says those documents were

840
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,440
falsified they don't mean that it was a

841
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,279
hypothesis that got tested

842
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,600
usually they mean somebody deep faked or

843
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,840
disenforced those documents

844
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,480
but here is falsifiability from this

845
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,799
paparian perspective

846
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,480
in the philosophy of science

847
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,279
falsifiability false

848
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:56,799
falsifiability or refutability is the

849
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,559
capacity for a statement theory or

850
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,240
hypothesis to be contradicted by

851
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,039
evidence

852
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,840
for example the statement all swans are

853
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,480
white

854
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,960
is falsifiable because one could observe

855
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,120
that black swans exist

856
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,960
falsifiability was introduced by the

857
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,960
philosopher of science karl popper

858
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,960
in his book logic der forchung 1934

859
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,799
revised and translated into english in

860
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,039
1959 as the logic of scientific

861
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,240
discovery

862
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,480
he proposed it as the cornerstone this

863
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,000
idea of falsification

864
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,320
to both the problem of induction and the

865
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,080
problem of demarcation

866
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,559
so induction is about generalizing from

867
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,080
the specifics to the generals

868
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,399
but what is this problem of demarcation

869
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,919
we knew it's one of the key words

870
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,200
so what is it another wikipedia coming

871
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,240
in to save the day

872
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,919
for these last minute presents and

873
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,320
presentation makers like myself

874
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,200
the demarcation problem in the

875
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,520
philosophy of science and epistemology

876
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,760
which is the philosophical field about

877
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,200
knowledge stem

878
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,520
knowledge not just science technology

879
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,240
engineering

880
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,720
and mathematics but stem means knowledge

881
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,440
and epi

882
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,000
means above so the philosophical field

883
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,960
that's above

884
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,760
the question of knowledge in the

885
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,840
philosophy of science in epistemology

886
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,159
the demarcation problem is the question

887
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,919
of how to distinguish between science

888
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,279
and non-science

889
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,279
it is it examines the lines between

890
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,960
science pseudoscience

891
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,039
and other products of human activity

892
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,840
like art literature and beliefs

893
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,919
the debate continues after over two

894
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,520
millennia of dialogue

895
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,279
among philosophers of science and

896
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,200
scientists in various fields

897
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,039
the debate has consequences for what can

898
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,120
be called scientific in fields such as

899
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,080
education

900
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,720
and public policy so at the social level

901
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,159
this is why it's important

902
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,320
because it will often be the case that

903
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,159
somebody will say well we need a science

904
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,399
driven policy or a science informed

905
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,880
policy or that's unscientific policy

906
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,919
related to public health or education

907
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,720
and so who exactly gets to speak for

908
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,679
science

909
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,480
and who gets to demarcate or delineate

910
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,279
or define

911
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,440
science and who gets to say whether

912
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,440
science is all good and if people mess

913
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,120
up then they're not doing it right or is

914
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,120
science all bad and all the good stuff

915
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,159
comes from some other

916
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,640
question of activity that humans do so

917
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,520
it's actually quite

918
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,840
a big issue about this demarcation

919
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,559
problem

920
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,039
and that is resonant with the fact that

921
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,559
people have been debating for a long

922
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,320
long time and not come to any

923
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,760
simple distinctions now

924
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,039
with this paper in mind we can look at

925
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,799
the first lines of the introduction of

926
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:29,600
the paper

927
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,919
which is a bold start by mel gotta love

928
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,159
it with respect to the demarcation

929
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:34,880
problem

930
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,799
i defend the position that the free

931
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:37,919
energy principle

932
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,919
can be taken to belong properly to the

933
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,360
domain of science

934
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,559
so that's big and unique claim one which

935
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:44,960
is

936
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,080
fep is within the domain of science now

937
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,880
it might not be

938
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,399
exactly like some of these things that

939
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,320
we've seen before but

940
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,000
it's going to be taken to be within the

941
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,360
domain of science

942
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,600
so if you're listening to this and you

943
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,159
think well i disagree i don't think that

944
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,039
fep is within the realm of science or

945
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,799
maybe you have a yes and

946
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,640
well yes i think it's in the domain of

947
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,799
science and i think it's also in the

948
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,559
domain of something else

949
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,640
great so if you have a yes and or a

950
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,720
disagreement or a question

951
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,200
put it in the live chat or come onto

952
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,279
these group discussions and talk it out

953
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,120
because mel will probably be really

954
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,960
happy to hear about it

955
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,360
and we'll all learn so much by bringing

956
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,799
out these different perspectives on

957
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:27,919
science because we're

958
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,279
going to some of the fundamental

959
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,919
questions in philosophy and in science

960
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,760
with these papers

961
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,240
let's talk about one way that this

962
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,120
demarcation

963
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,600
problem has been resolved or addressed

964
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,480
in the past

965
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,080
and that's this noma idea or

966
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,240
non-overlapping

967
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,200
magisteria which is the name of a paper

968
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,240
by stephen j

969
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,039
gould who is a evolutionary biologist i

970
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,480
guess we could call him

971
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,080
and gould wrote the net or magisterium

972
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,799
it's kind of like

973
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,080
the the reign of science covers the

974
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,840
empirical realm

975
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,399
what is the universe made of fact and

976
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,840
why does it work that way

977
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,399
theory the magisterium of religion

978
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,159
extends over questions of ultimate

979
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,720
ultimate meaning and moral value these

980
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,200
two magisteria do not overlap

981
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,600
nor do they encompass all inquiry

982
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,840
consider for example the magisterium of

983
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,760
art and the meaning of beauty

984
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,480
now as always when quoting somebody or

985
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,159
reading someone's paper we can

986
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,200
really respect the author's view their

987
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,799
perspective they set it out there how

988
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,559
they wanted it to be said

989
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,480
stephen jay gould chose his words

990
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,399
carefully when he wrote this

991
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,519
but also we can ask whether we agree or

992
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,399
disagree

993
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,080
so here's this non-overlapping

994
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,000
magisteria as a venn diagram

995
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,640
they're so non-overlapping that they're

996
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,000
just separate

997
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,440
circles so on the science side we get

998
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,679
what is the universe made of that's what

999
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:54,720
that's fact in

1000
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,840
gould's mind and why it works that way

1001
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,039
which is how or theory or potentially

1002
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,519
a scientist might call that mechanism

1003
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,600
and then under the noma model

1004
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,840
religion is what deals with morality and

1005
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,720
metaphysics

1006
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,799
now interestingly when some people think

1007
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,720
about non-overlapping magisteria

1008
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,480
they'll say something like well science

1009
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,760
says um

1010
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,640
what the world is and and um implicitly

1011
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,320
they mean how as well like what the

1012
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,919
world is it's also mechanism and

1013
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,600
religion says why

1014
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,480
and so that's a what how versus why

1015
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,200
distinction

1016
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,279
for the demarcation so these are

1017
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,320
questions that

1018
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,840
everyone can think of whether you're

1019
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,919
just learning about these topics or

1020
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:34,880
whether you've been

1021
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,039
practicing in one field or another for a

1022
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,000
long time

1023
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,360
it's an interesting thing to wonder

1024
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,519
about what is science

1025
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,880
what isn't science who decides and why

1026
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,080
does it matter

1027
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,279
is science one-to-one with technology or

1028
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,799
are there technologies that aren't

1029
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,799
science or are those two

1030
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,039
bound together more often than not and

1031
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,559
when we really explore

1032
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,799
these maps of meaning that we have for

1033
00:33:58,799 --> 00:33:59,919
these different fields

1034
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,320
we start to get a better perspective on

1035
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,919
oh yeah so when somebody says that it's

1036
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,399
a science-informed policy

1037
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,560
they want me to think it's good right

1038
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,000
they they don't they don't want me to

1039
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,639
think that it's

1040
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,280
faith-based policy because faith-based

1041
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:13,760
then

1042
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,520
dot dot dot dot so it's always a

1043
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,800
cultural context

1044
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,719
that these terms are understood within

1045
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,560
and it's sort of like a battlefield of

1046
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,040
meaning

1047
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,639
for who gets to control these different

1048
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,239
terms but anyways i just

1049
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,879
really like that mel led so clearly and

1050
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:27,760
strongly

1051
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,520
as a philosopher of science who's so

1052
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,599
embedded within our

1053
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,359
communities as well and it just

1054
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,320
it it uh rides the line with scientific

1055
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,960
understanding and philosophical depth

1056
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,918
so speaking of philosophical depth and

1057
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,280
scientific understanding

1058
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,000
let's talk about epistemic virtues and

1059
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,800
yet another

1060
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,119
wiki um selection i believe it's our

1061
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,960
last one

1062
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,119
being an epistemically virtuous person

1063
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,800
is often equated with being a critical

1064
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,520
thinker

1065
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,599
and focuses on the human agent and the

1066
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,440
kind of practices that make it possible

1067
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,079
to arrive

1068
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,400
at the best accessible approximation of

1069
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,280
the truth

1070
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,520
so i wasn't too familiar with this term

1071
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,280
epistemic virtues

1072
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,680
but it's a little bit like saying what

1073
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,640
are the

1074
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,119
good attributes or the adjectives that

1075
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,000
are good

1076
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,680
ver you know not the ones that aren't

1077
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,040
good the ones that are

1078
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,359
good are the ones that are the epistemic

1079
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,079
virtues

1080
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,079
virtues and so a couple of them are

1081
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,160
written down conscientiousness which is

1082
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,000
funny in light of our discussion on the

1083
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,720
big five

1084
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,640
personality traits in um active 13

1085
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,400
as well as a couple of these other ones

1086
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,160
that you see here such as

1087
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,160
creativity curiosity humility

1088
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,520
people can go into debates about what

1089
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,599
each of these terms mean or which ones

1090
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,880
are or aren't virtues

1091
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,960
but the question i would leave us with

1092
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,320
at least in this introduction

1093
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,480
section is how do we facilitate

1094
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,000
epistemic virtue so

1095
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,560
given our own understanding how do we

1096
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,079
not just develop it

1097
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,480
in ourselves but make communities where

1098
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,560
epistemic virtue can thrive in an

1099
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,520
accessible

1100
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,720
fashion all right let's get to the

1101
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,200
abstract of the paper

1102
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,240
mel wrote the free energy principle or

1103
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,800
fep has seen extensive philosophical

1104
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,599
engagement

1105
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,280
both from a general philosophy of

1106
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,720
science perspective and from the

1107
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,040
perspective of philosophies of specific

1108
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,839
sciences

1109
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,839
cognitive science neuroscience and

1110
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,520
biology so

1111
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,599
people are talking about it the

1112
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,599
literature on the fep has attempted to

1113
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,800
draw out specific

1114
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,240
philosophical commitments and

1115
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,839
entailments of the framework

1116
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,839
so what are the commitments that's

1117
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:36,880
leading up to

1118
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,480
this the ceremony right what's the

1119
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,839
commitment that you make leading up to

1120
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,040
the ceremony

1121
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,040
and then the entailment what follows

1122
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,160
from the ceremony

1123
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,520
so what leads one to be committed to fep

1124
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,440
and what is entailed by committing to

1125
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,200
the fep

1126
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
but the most fundamental questions from

1127
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,359
the perspective of philosophy of science

1128
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,240
in general

1129
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,119
remain open so this is a list of awesome

1130
00:36:59,119 --> 00:36:59,680
questions

1131
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,200
so each one of these questions we could

1132
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,280
probably have a whole group conversation

1133
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:03,599
on

1134
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,000
and they're such wonderful questions so

1135
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,640
i really

1136
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,520
like how this paper was phrased to what

1137
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,320
disciplines

1138
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,800
does the fep belong does it make

1139
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,560
falsifiable claims

1140
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,440
what sort of scientific object is it is

1141
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,359
it to be taken as a representation of

1142
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,000
contingent states of affairs in nature

1143
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,320
does it constitute knowledge what role

1144
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,160
is it intended to play in relation to

1145
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,440
empirical research

1146
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,160
and does the fep even properly belong to

1147
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,520
the domain of science

1148
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,599
but it seems like from the introduction

1149
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,440
that mel's answer is yes

1150
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,440
i'm uh maybe going to put it in my five

1151
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,800
cents at the end of this talk

1152
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,640
but it seems like it's good if it's in

1153
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,880
science but i'm not too attached

1154
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,440
abstract to the extent that it has

1155
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,960
engaged with these questions

1156
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,920
at all the extant literature has begged

1157
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,640
dodged

1158
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,720
dismissed and skirted around these

1159
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,000
questions without ever

1160
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,560
addressing them head on look at these

1161
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,160
spatial metaphors

1162
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,800
and social metaphors begging dodging

1163
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,079
skirting

1164
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,520
head-on just wonderful these questions

1165
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,720
must i urge be answered satisfactorily

1166
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,599
before we can make

1167
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,200
any headway on the philosophical

1168
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,200
consequences of the fep

1169
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,280
so in other words if we don't understand

1170
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,680
how we got here and where we're at

1171
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,160
we won't be able to make headway as we

1172
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,240
move forward with the fep

1173
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,160
so if we don't know the past and if we

1174
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,599
don't know the present we're not going

1175
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,720
to be able to design

1176
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,119
effective policy sounds like active

1177
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,440
inference

1178
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,280
i take preliminary steps towards

1179
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,960
answering these questions in this

1180
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,320
paper first by examining closely

1181
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,880
close first by examining closely key

1182
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,720
formal elements of the framework and the

1183
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,720
implications they hold for its utility

1184
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,440
and

1185
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,440
second by highlighting potential modes

1186
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,119
of interpreting the fep

1187
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,119
in light of an abundant philosophical

1188
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,640
literature on scientific

1189
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,839
modeling so quite the um

1190
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,560
perspectives for the paper and let's see

1191
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,000
how we're going to get from a

1192
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,560
to z so here's the roadmap and i had to

1193
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,880
even reformat the roadmap slide because

1194
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,760
there were so many

1195
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,200
subsections but it really helped because

1196
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,520
it's a paper that doesn't have figures

1197
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,760
and appropriate enough for a paper

1198
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,599
called the math is not the territory

1199
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,000
there isn't any math equations in the

1200
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,280
paper but it references

1201
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,920
a lot of quite technical areas so it's

1202
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,800
kind of like this

1203
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,040
fractal overview because you could dive

1204
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,040
into the thermodynamics or dive into the

1205
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,240
bayesian mechanics

1206
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,079
but this is the overview and it's

1207
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,520
generalizing

1208
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,280
so it starts with an abstract and

1209
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,119
introduction and then

1210
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,680
begins with the sort of topic du jour

1211
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,240
which is the free energy principle

1212
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,160
this being a philosophy in history of

1213
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,680
science paper

1214
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,359
it's um framing the free energy

1215
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,200
principle in terms of its history and

1216
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,400
we're going to walk through the history

1217
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,000
in a couple of minutes

1218
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,920
the history of the formalism of the free

1219
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,680
energy principle itself

1220
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,920
leads one to a consideration of markov

1221
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,599
blankets free energy and generative

1222
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:58,240
models

1223
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,560
which um are things that specifically

1224
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,440
come into play

1225
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,839
when talking about the fep as it's used

1226
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,400
and understood today

1227
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,040
reinterpreting the fep is sort of what

1228
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,160
we're here for today

1229
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,520
is to interpret and reinterpret i think

1230
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,720
and then the second or the last part of

1231
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,760
the paper

1232
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,680
ties many of the topics that were

1233
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,599
addressed in the first half of the paper

1234
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,920
on the left side of the roadmap to more

1235
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,920
general questions in the scientific

1236
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,720
modeling literature so for example the

1237
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,640
difference between normative and process

1238
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,200
models the ideas that came out of

1239
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,560
mathematical

1240
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,280
mathematical psychology related to

1241
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,079
neuroscience

1242
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,800
and other fields and then ideas about

1243
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,800
models that have targets or don't

1244
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,800
so a lot of different cool generative

1245
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,160
things that are happening with this

1246
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:46,960
paper

1247
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,839
and uh it's a lot to cover so let's just

1248
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:50,240
jump

1249
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,839
right in so the only hint fristen

1250
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,760
himself has given us to go on with

1251
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,839
respect to the meta theory or philosophy

1252
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,280
of science of the fep

1253
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,280
which is what we're here for today is

1254
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,280
that he labels it a normative theory or

1255
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,480
normative model

1256
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,319
contrasting that with what he terms

1257
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,000
process models

1258
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,640
and then it continues three fundamental

1259
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,839
facts follow

1260
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,760
three fundamental facts about the fep

1261
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,680
follow from its status as a normative

1262
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,400
model

1263
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,040
so again we have sort of two extremes

1264
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,800
types of things in the philosophy of

1265
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,359
science

1266
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,599
we have the hypotheses those are the

1267
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,680
theories they're empirically falsifiable

1268
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,440
and then we have these principles

1269
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,760
they're the more normative

1270
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,440
non-falsifiable almost axiomatic aspects

1271
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,720
of science

1272
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,359
so three things are going to follow from

1273
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,560
the fact that the fep

1274
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,000
is a normative model and not a

1275
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,880
hypothesis one of them is that the fep

1276
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,640
is not falsifiable and does not lend

1277
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,319
itself to the direct generation of

1278
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,160
predictions or hypotheses

1279
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,599
so it's not a hypothesis two

1280
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,839
the fep does not cut at the joints of

1281
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,000
nature which is to say that it does not

1282
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,520
illuminate the boundaries between

1283
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,800
natural kinds

1284
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,920
and three the fep does not deliver

1285
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,200
mechanisms so interesting claims

1286
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,680
the general questions that this brings

1287
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,119
me to wonder about is

1288
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,359
how do we categorize these kinds of

1289
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,880
scientific ideas

1290
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,560
so for example if someone says well

1291
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,240
that's a theory gravity is a theory

1292
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,079
evolution is a theory that means

1293
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,280
dot dot dot dot so how do we classify

1294
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,880
what type of scientific thing ideas

1295
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,839
are whether it's a framework hypothesis

1296
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:26,800
uh

1297
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,599
idea more broadly just leaving it vague

1298
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,280
or whether it's a principle

1299
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,920
how do we map out the implications of

1300
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,520
different kinds of ideas

1301
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,040
and then very importantly how do our

1302
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,800
pre-existing assumptions

1303
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,760
influence how we judge ideas so we're

1304
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,079
not the neutral arbiter of truth

1305
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,000
it's more like we have this culturally

1306
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,280
prepared field

1307
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,520
and then the idea is like the stimulus

1308
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,400
or a seed

1309
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,280
that flowers or doesn't in a field so

1310
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,680
how does the status of our field

1311
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,720
influence how we judge ideas and as far

1312
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,560
as the cutting at the joints of nature

1313
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,640
that's something that really fascinated

1314
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,079
me and we're going to go into the joints

1315
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:04,640
of nature

1316
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,760
in a couple of minutes so free energy

1317
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,599
principle part three in this

1318
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,839
paper and remember that these dot zero

1319
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,680
videos are kind of overviews

1320
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,680
they're just the notes that i take as i

1321
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,280
go through reading the paper

1322
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,520
i try to make that exoteric for those

1323
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,359
who might appreciate a scaffold

1324
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,599
but really there's so many fun details

1325
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,200
and so many nice points inside of the

1326
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,640
paper so if you're curious

1327
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,640
or you want to learn more the paper is

1328
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,279
the place to go

1329
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,079
section 3.1 the history of the formalism

1330
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,839
so this is quite different a scientist

1331
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,119
might not start by saying

1332
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,240
well the thing you need to know about

1333
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,960
this theory is here's the history of it

1334
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,240
they might say is the thing you need to

1335
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,920
know about this theory is this

1336
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,640
scientific

1337
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,720
attribute abc but this is a more

1338
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,880
historical perspective

1339
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,640
the questions most frequently and

1340
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,400
fervently asked about the free energy

1341
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,520
principle are

1342
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,800
is it true what is it true of how

1343
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,280
do we empirically know that it is true

1344
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,079
these questions

1345
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,599
i argue rest on a category mistake so

1346
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,000
wrong kind of thing you know you ask how

1347
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,440
many miles per gallon does this thing

1348
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,960
get and someone's like hey this isn't a

1349
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,359
car

1350
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:13,119
that's a pizza they presume that the fep

1351
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,480
is the sort of thing that makes

1352
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,319
assertions about how things are

1353
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,760
cuts at natural joints and can be

1354
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,000
empirically verified or falsified

1355
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,319
so it's the inverse of these things it

1356
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,000
turns out that people are interpreting

1357
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,200
the fep

1358
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,839
as if it's a falsifiable hypothesis that

1359
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,520
makes assertions about how things are

1360
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,119
and cuts at natural joints

1361
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,079
and it turns out that is not the case in

1362
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:34,640
fact

1363
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,040
all of those are the opposite why

1364
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,079
because the fep

1365
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,240
is more like a principle than it is a

1366
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,359
hypothesis

1367
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,400
pretty cool so again

1368
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,960
what are these three points it's the

1369
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,440
idea that a hypothesis

1370
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,119
does make assertions about how things

1371
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,280
are does cut at natural joints

1372
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,200
and can be empirically verified or

1373
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,119
falsified and it turns out that

1374
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,400
mel argues the fep is not that way

1375
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,640
let's talk a little bit about nature and

1376
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,520
its joints

1377
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,800
specifically carving them so just to

1378
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,240
quote from the abstract of a 1993 paper

1379
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,240
by ali khalidi carving nature at the

1380
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,359
joints

1381
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,440
descriptive title it's quite an

1382
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,800
interesting point which is

1383
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,800
this paper discusses a philosophical

1384
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,319
issue in taxonomy

1385
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,400
at least one philosopher has suggested

1386
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,160
that the taxonomic principle

1387
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,880
that scientific kinds are disjoint so in

1388
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,079
other words

1389
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,560
when we're doing taxonomy classification

1390
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,160
organizing of scientific

1391
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,359
kinds are they disjoint or might they be

1392
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,319
overlapping

1393
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,240
for example when we're doing a taxonomy

1394
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,520
of insects

1395
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,079
there's some groups that are disjoint

1396
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,280
like ants

1397
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,920
and cockroaches are a disjoint group but

1398
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,280
ants and insects

1399
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,200
are a non-disjoint those are not

1400
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,880
disjoint groups because ants are nested

1401
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,359
within sight of insects

1402
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,200
and an opposing position is defended

1403
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,800
here by marshalling examples of

1404
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,119
non-disjoint categories which belong to

1405
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,119
different coexisting classification

1406
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,400
schemes

1407
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,400
this denial of the disjointedness

1408
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,319
principle can be recast as the claim

1409
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,240
that scientific classification is

1410
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,079
interest relative

1411
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,760
but why would anyone have held that

1412
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,680
scientific categories are disjoint in

1413
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,040
the first place

1414
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,640
it is argued that this assumption is

1415
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,480
needed in one attempt to derive

1416
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,760
essentialism

1417
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,280
this shows why the essentialist and

1418
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,720
interest relative approaches to

1419
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,480
classification are in conflict

1420
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,079
so in other words if we have an

1421
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,680
essentialist perspective

1422
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,800
on scientific kinds then we can

1423
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,960
probably make them disjoint because if

1424
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,280
like you know the red cube is red

1425
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,680
and the green cube is green then we can

1426
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,119
separate them at the joint and the red

1427
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,960
will be red and the green will be green

1428
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,560
but if the red and the green are like

1429
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,560
ink molecules that are swirling around

1430
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,839
in solution

1431
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,280
then it's more like it's relative to

1432
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,520
its interest relative we could say and

1433
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,160
in that case there's a

1434
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,280
non-disjointness between the redness and

1435
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,640
the greenness which makes it a little

1436
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,599
bit more difficult

1437
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,920
to be reductionist or essentialist and

1438
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,040
demands a relativist point of view

1439
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,359
and that sounds a little complicated it

1440
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:06,880
is a little interesting

1441
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,359
and in 2011 there was a book called

1442
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,079
carving nature

1443
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,560
at its joints they just uh go with the

1444
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,359
same title

1445
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,079
because it's the same ideas and in a

1446
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,920
review by pd magnus

1447
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,680
i thought there was a couple of points

1448
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,240
that were just really crisply brought up

1449
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,440
so petey magnus wrote to be fair part of

1450
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,480
the problem

1451
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,960
with this book i believe is with natural

1452
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,400
kinds themself

1453
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,880
the phrase natural kind is too often

1454
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,960
used as a term of philosophical jargon

1455
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,720
with a presumption it has a precise

1456
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,440
meaning

1457
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,640
even though there are a number of

1458
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,040
separate precise meanings it can have

1459
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,040
first natural kinds may refer to

1460
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,400
categories which will support

1461
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,440
inductive inference second natural kinds

1462
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,119
may refer to whichever categories ought

1463
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,800
to appear in scientific accounts of the

1464
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,680
world

1465
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,839
third natural kinds may refer to

1466
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,839
metaphysically robust categories which

1467
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,599
are written in the fundament

1468
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,079
of being or which structure the space of

1469
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,520
possible worlds

1470
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,599
fourth natural kinds may refer to

1471
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,520
categories which appear as predicates in

1472
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,559
the laws of nature

1473
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,400
fifth natural kind may refer to

1474
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,480
categories which anchor a special type

1475
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,599
of reference

1476
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,680
although these five aspects do overlap

1477
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,520
somewhat there are difficulties with

1478
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,440
each and tensions in between

1479
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,280
essays in this volume document some of

1480
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,480
these difficulties

1481
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,200
so when we're trying to understand this

1482
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,000
topic this area reduce our uncertainty

1483
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,520
and we want to know about separating

1484
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,079
natural kinds it's not quite so clear

1485
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,240
what these natural kinds are or what

1486
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,480
joints do or don't separate them but

1487
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,000
that's what we want to pursue

1488
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,720
and so that's why it's fun how could we

1489
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,040
go

1490
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,800
even deeper down this natural kind

1491
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,079
rabbit hole well

1492
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,160
we could go to the original text it's

1493
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,599
what we're going to do

1494
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:50,480
this is from plato's ephedras in 265.

1495
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,920
so socrates writes we can think about

1496
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,839
dividing things by classes

1497
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,000
where the natural joints are and not

1498
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,680
trying to break any part

1499
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,000
after the manner of a bad carver so

1500
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,520
that's this idea of carving at the

1501
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,000
joints

1502
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,280
if there are two things and you're not

1503
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,040
making a clean separation

1504
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,880
then you're going to make this violent

1505
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,559
cut but if it's a perfect separation

1506
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,000
then it's going to be a clean cut

1507
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,280
at the joint as our two discourses just

1508
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,079
now assumed

1509
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,119
one common principle unreason so in

1510
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:19,920
other words

1511
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,839
is it that reason is a principle and

1512
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,000
unreason is something disjoint or

1513
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,400
are reason and unreason in a continuum

1514
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,680
just like the red and the green from the

1515
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,599
previous example

1516
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,359
so in other words natural join on the

1517
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,520
right side can we separate class a and

1518
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,160
class b

1519
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,599
perfectly or are they going to be a

1520
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,839
little bit more intercalated

1521
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:40,000
just as the body which is one is

1522
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,680
naturally divisible into two

1523
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,520
right and left with parts called by the

1524
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,720
same name

1525
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,559
so are two discourses conceived of

1526
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,480
madness as naturally one principle

1527
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,280
within us

1528
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,839
and one discourse cutting off the left

1529
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:52,960
hand part

1530
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,040
continued to divide this until it found

1531
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,960
among its parts a sort of left-handed

1532
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:57,680
love

1533
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,240
which it very justly reviled but other

1534
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,200
discourse

1535
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,800
leading us to the right-hand part of

1536
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,280
madness found a love having the same

1537
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,640
name as the first

1538
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,520
quite interesting but divine which it

1539
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,359
held up to view and praised as the

1540
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,280
author of our greatest blessings

1541
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,359
so are the left and the right two

1542
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,119
different natural kinds that we can just

1543
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:18,960
cut down the middle or are they a

1544
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,839
continuum on a type of thing

1545
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,559
phaedra says very true and then this

1546
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,000
last little quote from socrates

1547
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,440
even though i know we're quite far

1548
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,920
afield now i myself phaedris

1549
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,839
am a lover of these processes of

1550
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,359
division and bringing together

1551
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,359
as aids to speech and thought so in

1552
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:36,559
other words sometimes

1553
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,559
just separating things into natural

1554
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,559
kinds or continuums is useful for

1555
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:41,680
thought

1556
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,680
and if i think any other man is able to

1557
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,960
see things that naturally can be

1558
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,760
collected into one and divided into many

1559
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,599
him i follow after and walk in his

1560
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:51,280
footsteps as if he were a god

1561
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,200
and i like this also because it's from

1562
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,599
tufts which is the institution of mel

1563
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,559
so i just loved grabbing the phaedrus

1564
00:50:58,559 --> 00:50:59,440
text

1565
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,599
from mel's institution for this

1566
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:04,319
extremely interesting historical dive

1567
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,200
let's go back to the paper in order to

1568
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,319
understand the fep

1569
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,240
however and why it's closer to a

1570
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,359
statistical technique

1571
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,520
than it is to a falsifiable theory of

1572
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,520
biological self-organization it is

1573
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,119
important to see that there is a clear

1574
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,760
precedent

1575
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,920
for leveraging the maths of statistical

1576
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,440
mechanics as a method

1577
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,319
for bayesian inference so it's like whoa

1578
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,000
some people know about philosophy

1579
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
some about statistical mechanics other

1580
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,520
about bayesian inference

1581
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,720
but we're going to bring them all

1582
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,319
together which means that we're all

1583
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:33,440
going to be learners

1584
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,040
here and that's why it's great to

1585
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,200
include everyone in the learning journey

1586
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,480
because no one is going to read a

1587
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,400
paragraph like this and just dust off

1588
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,359
their hands and go

1589
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,200
yeah i already finished learning about

1590
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,800
those topics i'm done learning about

1591
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,760
statistics or

1592
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,079
i'm done thinking about philosophy those

1593
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:48,800
who are

1594
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,680
awake and want to learn and want to find

1595
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:51,920
out

1596
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,040
other people's thoughts on these

1597
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,319
questions just come right ahead

1598
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:59,920
section 3.1.1 is called the epistemic

1599
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,599
turn or the knowledge or the

1600
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,680
informational term in statistical

1601
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,880
mechanics

1602
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,880
so just a couple of key points because

1603
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,720
this history section really is quite

1604
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,359
critical

1605
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,280
so this is just in the order of these

1606
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,559
sections a couple of

1607
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:15,920
memes or key themes that i pulled out

1608
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,160
so what was happening in the 1900s in

1609
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,079
statistical physics and statistical

1610
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:21,119
mechanics

1611
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,599
is that information was getting

1612
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:24,640
physicalized

1613
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,440
and physics was getting informational so

1614
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,400
all of a sudden

1615
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,240
there was a little bit more of a

1616
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,440
recognition

1617
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,720
that physical things could be equated

1618
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,880
with information for example if you're

1619
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,720
talking about the surprise of reaching

1620
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,440
into an urn

1621
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,440
and pulling out different kinds of balls

1622
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,720
that could be equated

1623
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,880
to the surprise that you might have of

1624
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,160
different temperature

1625
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,880
air molecules swirling around in a room

1626
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:49,280
so if

1627
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,200
all of the hot molecules went on one

1628
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,359
side it would be something that would be

1629
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:54,880
quite surprising just like if all the

1630
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,800
blue balls went to one side of the urn

1631
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,160
and all the green balls went to the

1632
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,280
other side of the urn

1633
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,319
so that would be something that you

1634
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:02,400
wouldn't expect and it's through

1635
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,640
analogies like that that people started

1636
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,079
to bring equivalency

1637
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,760
to the informational and the physical

1638
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,319
side of physics

1639
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:13,280
the maximum entropy principle emerges as

1640
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,000
something like

1641
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,040
an occam's razor for info thermodynamics

1642
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,640
so again if we're thinking about an urn

1643
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,480
with a different colored balls or

1644
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,119
a room with a bunch of molecules of air

1645
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:24,960
this maximum entropy

1646
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,280
theory is going to basically say well

1647
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,640
the air molecules are going to be

1648
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,160
maximally spread out

1649
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,240
and the distribution of their speeds is

1650
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,359
going to have such and such

1651
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:34,720
characteristics

1652
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,119
and it's almost like an occam's razor

1653
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:37,839
principle

1654
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,480
because it's like saying yes it could be

1655
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,680
another way

1656
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,319
but this way with the air molecules

1657
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,440
equally spread out

1658
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,599
it turns out that's the most likely one

1659
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:48,960
because there's an increasing

1660
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,480
infinite number of ways that it could be

1661
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,480
an increasingly less likely ways

1662
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,160
of organizing around the room all in

1663
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,079
this corner all in that corner

1664
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:58,000
half in this corner half in that corner

1665
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,839
but the maximum entropy way

1666
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:02,400
is spread out and that there's more

1667
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,000
details in the paper and of course

1668
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,040
there's more to learn about here

1669
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,559
um but the 3.1.1 is just to say that

1670
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,760
during the 1900s maximum entropy and

1671
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,599
this info physical nexus

1672
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,800
starts becoming a more important

1673
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,839
threat 3.1.2 the mean

1674
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:25,119
field approximation so the mean field we

1675
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:25,760
can think of

1676
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,119
is like as you get a field of vectors

1677
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,000
you can start to kind of blur your eyes

1678
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,800
and look at the mean field approximation

1679
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,480
and so one way to think about that is

1680
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,160
like the central limit theorem

1681
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,160
so if we have a distribution and we're

1682
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,359
just pulling out

1683
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:43,440
um with a gaussian error out of this

1684
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,000
distribution we're going to approximate

1685
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,200
um a draw around the mean value

1686
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,119
of that distribution so that's the

1687
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:52,640
central limit theorem

1688
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,000
just from 30 000 feet and the mean field

1689
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,119
approximation

1690
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,799
is kind of like the central limit

1691
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:00,559
theorem because it's basically like

1692
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:01,280
saying

1693
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,359
in the mean limit there's going to be

1694
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,839
this asymptotic approximation

1695
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:08,240
to collective behavior that might be

1696
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,280
comprehensible

1697
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,119
so as we get to more and more and more

1698
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:13,280
cars we can start to model them like

1699
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,079
they're a flow

1700
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,839
of a fluid even though we know that

1701
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,520
they're discrete and so you can't do a

1702
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,520
flow model with three cars but maybe

1703
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,599
with three million cars you could

1704
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,079
and this is getting us to this point of

1705
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,559
idealized multi-agent systems

1706
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:29,359
so not just draws from a distribution

1707
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:30,400
but potentially

1708
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,200
there could be multi-agent systems like

1709
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,040
lattices of electrons

1710
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,520
or chemical solutions that also have

1711
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,880
these mean field approximations

1712
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,720
there's then this introduction of the

1713
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,079
variational methods

1714
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,720
and the variational free energy it's

1715
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,079
brought up as a trick

1716
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:50,400
but who's tricking who are the

1717
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,640
mathematicians tricking everyone else

1718
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,319
are the scientists in on the trick are

1719
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:56,720
the engineers also tricking everyone

1720
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,200
um it's a joke but the variational

1721
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,520
methods and the variational free energy

1722
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,839
are definitely a heuristic and an

1723
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,440
extremely useful tool

1724
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,040
that help us take something that might

1725
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,480
be intractable

1726
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,640
and then perform computation on it in a

1727
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,759
way that's good enough

1728
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,240
free energy which is a concept that

1729
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,000
again just like a lot of things in this

1730
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,799
paper

1731
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:21,760
have a physical um analog or a physical

1732
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,799
tether

1733
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,240
earlier in their history like

1734
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,319
temperature is related to

1735
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:28,480
the distribution of the air molecule

1736
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,520
speed in the room but then temperature

1737
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,680
in a machine learning model is something

1738
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,960
like how fast

1739
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,640
it's trained like a high temperature

1740
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,720
model it sort of never settles down it's

1741
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,160
always just jumping around

1742
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,240
whereas a low temperature model is going

1743
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,240
to be trapped in a local region

1744
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,960
but it might come to a higher sampling

1745
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,599
uh

1746
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,880
intervals in that local region

1747
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,200
mel in the live chat mathematician eyes

1748
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,079
gober

1749
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,720
so true and the free energy in machine

1750
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,599
learning

1751
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,599
came in when machine learning

1752
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,520
researchers were asking themselves

1753
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,000
how are we going to model multi-scale

1754
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,160
systems at the appropriate gain

1755
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,640
or bias so we don't have an outrageous

1756
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,960
false positive or false negative rate

1757
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,280
we also don't have the ability to go and

1758
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,200
do an atom level simulation

1759
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,359
even if we wanted to we couldn't do

1760
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,280
these atom level simulations so how are

1761
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,960
we going to coarse grain

1762
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,040
and make models that are useful but

1763
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,839
don't go into every single possible

1764
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:26,079
detail

1765
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,359
and one question or thought i had is

1766
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:32,000
is this variational free energy physical

1767
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,520
for molecules so when we talk about

1768
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,960
gibbs free energy

1769
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,319
and in about in a given reaction a given

1770
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,559
chemical reaction the free energy

1771
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,799
of that reaction is that a physical

1772
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,559
thing or is it energetic or is it

1773
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,640
conceptual and then when we're talking

1774
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,160
about the free energy of a neural

1775
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,280
network is it

1776
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,200
physical or not but in this 3.1.3

1777
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,599
we get a sort of grand connection

1778
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,240
between

1779
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,640
ensembl densities so the wood lice on

1780
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,160
the pavement you know the ants in the

1781
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,040
colony

1782
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,000
that density of the ensemble is the

1783
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,160
bayesian posterior density so the

1784
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,280
updated prior

1785
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,359
is the posterior and the posterior is

1786
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:13,359
going to be the prior for the next time

1787
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:13,920
point but

1788
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,880
the updated prior is the posterior and

1789
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:17,599
that

1790
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:19,040
is going to be a mean field

1791
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,040
approximation and that's going to be

1792
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,400
governed by this expected free energy

1793
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,000
in section 3.1.4 the variational bayes

1794
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,319
or

1795
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:31,200
vb method is brought up and here's where

1796
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,040
vb comes into play

1797
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,960
analytical bayesian methods are

1798
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,720
basically intractable

1799
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,720
and can be implausible to calculate

1800
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,720
exactly for example if you're doing

1801
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,480
bayesian phylogenetics

1802
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,559
and you have a bunch of insect genomes

1803
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:45,839
and you're trying to infer

1804
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,839
the tree that is the most likely

1805
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:49,200
hypothesis about

1806
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,480
common ancestry amongst these insects

1807
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,480
to make an exact analytical bayesian

1808
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,680
model for every base in the genome

1809
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,599
you're going to be calculating a while

1810
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:00,720
however

1811
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,480
we can empirically explore probabilistic

1812
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,440
graphical models in order to simplify

1813
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:07,839
that

1814
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:10,480
situation and so graphical models are

1815
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,520
just relational

1816
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,680
models nodes and edges that means a

1817
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,079
graph that's graphical so a network is a

1818
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:16,559
graph

1819
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,960
doesn't always mean like x y axis you

1820
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,720
know quadratic line

1821
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,040
graphical just means relational and

1822
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,960
we're talking about the relationships

1823
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,520
between observations and hidden causes

1824
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,200
or two hidden causes

1825
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,839
and those are probabilistic

1826
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:32,799
relationships whether it's

1827
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:35,200
probabilistic emission of an observation

1828
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,640
given a hidden state

1829
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,880
or a probabilistic relationship between

1830
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,319
two different hidden states they're both

1831
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:41,920
graphical models

1832
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,680
and the idea is that we as investigators

1833
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:49,359
want to fit our model using monte carlo

1834
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:51,680
sampling and or metrics of

1835
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,200
distributional divergence

1836
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,000
so monte carlo sampling it comes from

1837
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,640
gambling

1838
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,079
because monte carlo is where a lot of

1839
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,480
gambling occurred i believe and

1840
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,319
the idea is if you want to ask a

1841
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:04,960
question like how likely am i to get a

1842
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,520
deck

1843
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,240
uh draw from this deck of cards that has

1844
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,400
such and such characteristic

1845
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,839
there might be some that are really easy

1846
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:13,520
to calculate like okay the chance of

1847
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,200
getting a two well there's four out of

1848
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,880
52 cards are two so there's the

1849
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:17,920
probability

1850
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,920
but there might be another type of

1851
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,680
question you want to ask about that deck

1852
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,280
that's a little bit more nuanced

1853
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,520
like what's the chance it's this card or

1854
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,359
that card but not this one and it's

1855
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:28,240
followed by this

1856
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,559
and it has to do with this what you can

1857
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,040
do is instead of even trying to specify

1858
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,319
out the formal or analytical probability

1859
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:38,799
what you can do is just simulate

1860
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:40,799
thousands or millions of draws

1861
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:43,200
from a simulated deck and then you can

1862
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,079
look and say okay

1863
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:46,160
10 out of a million had this

1864
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,240
characteristic ergo that's my

1865
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,400
empirically derived probability so

1866
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,000
that's using monte carlo

1867
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,480
or metropolis hasting coupled sampling

1868
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,680
to

1869
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,799
figure out um the tractable way to do

1870
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:00,319
these bayesian approaches

1871
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:02,400
another way that you can actually

1872
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,240
trackably deal with these bayesian

1873
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:04,799
approaches

1874
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:07,200
is this variational bayesian approach

1875
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,480
which we're not going to go into too

1876
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,520
many details

1877
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,319
here but basically unlike the sampling

1878
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,440
based

1879
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,520
monte carlo bayesian methods the

1880
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,440
variational bayes uses

1881
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,319
the distributional divergence and it

1882
01:01:21,319 --> 01:01:23,920
co-optimizes the accuracy minus the

1883
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:24,960
complexity

1884
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,280
just again first pass so that it tries

1885
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,079
to hone

1886
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:30,720
into the tightest distribution that

1887
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,400
actually covers the density

1888
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,839
of what you really want to estimate but

1889
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:35,920
doesn't get too tight it doesn't over

1890
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,520
fit and then lastly there's this section

1891
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,440
on the innovation in kristen's free

1892
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,280
energy minimization so if you're curious

1893
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,000
about

1894
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,079
what carl has done and the google

1895
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:47,680
scholar is stretching on a little bit

1896
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:48,400
too long

1897
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,200
that's a great section to check out so

1898
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,640
let's um

1899
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,520
pull together and just ask where are we

1900
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:55,839
at

1901
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,400
with the free energy principle so what

1902
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,599
did fristen do

1903
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:01,920
what is the free energy principle and

1904
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,359
how was it discussed

1905
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:07,359
in mel's paper so the first

1906
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:10,960
is the focker planck and mel writes

1907
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,400
in the context of the free energy

1908
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,240
principle the focker planck equation

1909
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,599
describes the evolution of the

1910
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,359
probability density function of the

1911
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:18,480
state of a system

1912
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,000
as such it can be thought of as a

1913
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,920
trajectory through one

1914
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,839
abstract state space which is a

1915
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:25,680
probabilistic representation of some

1916
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,680
lower order abstract state space

1917
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,839
representing what state a given system

1918
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:30,319
is in

1919
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:33,359
over some definite time window so it's

1920
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:34,000
like

1921
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,280
it's a um density evolution function

1922
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,720
that's a trajectory

1923
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:42,160
in an abstract probabilistic space

1924
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,359
very chill to the faulker plank

1925
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:47,440
we can supplement the helmholtz

1926
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,799
decomposition

1927
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:51,359
so let's think about that definite time

1928
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:52,000
window

1929
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,760
from the focker plankin pickup here

1930
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,440
a three-dimensional vector field that

1931
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,760
satisfies the appropriate conditions for

1932
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,760
smoothness and decay so smoothness

1933
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,520
means that it's not a rough path in

1934
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,119
other words you can take a ruler

1935
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,880
and just lay it on the hill and get a

1936
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,640
derivative and you can

1937
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,960
kind of take that ruler and move it over

1938
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,240
the hill and get

1939
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,520
continuous derivatives everywhere

1940
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,200
um if the appropriate conditions for

1941
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,119
smoothness and decay are met

1942
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:20,880
then this vector field can be broken

1943
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,799
down into solenoidal

1944
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:26,000
which is a curl and ear rotational which

1945
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,240
is a divergence component

1946
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,760
this is known as the helmholtz

1947
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,839
decomposition the fact that we can

1948
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:34,079
perform the helmholtz decomposition is

1949
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:35,760
then known as the fundamental theorem of

1950
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,119
vector calculus

1951
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:39,359
so in order to have fields of

1952
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:40,720
well-behaved vectors

1953
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,280
you need to have this ability to kind of

1954
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,319
separate out

1955
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:46,400
and take the partial derivatives in a

1956
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,520
few different ways that's the

1957
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,039
decomposition

1958
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:52,079
so we're going to be thinking about the

1959
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,280
time evolution

1960
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,280
of a trajectory in the abstract state

1961
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,319
space that's

1962
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:59,680
factor what is that state space going to

1963
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:00,960
be decomposed into

1964
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,359
well it's going to be decomposed using

1965
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:05,440
the helmholtz decomposition

1966
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,240
into a few different vectors some of

1967
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,400
those vectors are going to be solenoidal

1968
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,079
they're going to be like curling around

1969
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:14,319
the mountain at the exact same elevation

1970
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:16,160
that's like an iso contour

1971
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,760
and then there's also going to be a

1972
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,599
non-rotational divergent

1973
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:21,920
component one which goes uphill and one

1974
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,440
which goes downhill

1975
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,119
now we're going to be doing that on

1976
01:04:26,119 --> 01:04:28,960
non-equilibrium steady-state densities

1977
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,039
this is related to this idea of the

1978
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:32,079
markov or

1979
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:34,400
post-markov blanket i don't even know

1980
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,440
what to call it

1981
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,559
um mel and anyone else let's clarify

1982
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:40,160
this when we're talking in our group

1983
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,720
discussion a fristen blanket or a yellow

1984
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,960
blanket what are we going to call them

1985
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,720
but when it comes down to it

1986
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,440
when we want to be maintaining this info

1987
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,599
thermodynamic non-equilibrium steady

1988
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:53,119
state

1989
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:55,920
it's required to have a relatively

1990
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,119
better because you don't need to have

1991
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:58,559
the perfect one you just need to have a

1992
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,000
relatively better model

1993
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,880
than other agents like you you need to

1994
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,079
have a relatively better

1995
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:07,200
generative model of what of action

1996
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,599
not necessarily just of accurate state

1997
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:10,720
estimation

1998
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,400
so the bacteria isn't just doing

1999
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,319
estimate oh oh boy we're running out of

2000
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:14,799
sugar

2001
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:16,720
i wonder if there's uh sugar somewhere

2002
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,480
else it's actually doing

2003
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,440
inference on its behavior on policy its

2004
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:22,400
actions

2005
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,880
so that it can maintain that info

2006
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:25,920
thermodynamic

2007
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,480
barrier mel writes markov membrane

2008
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,000
that's my contribution

2009
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
if only we could all make such a great

2010
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,640
contribution

2011
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:36,880
this need for a maintenance of an info

2012
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,359
thermo non-equilibrium steady state and

2013
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:41,359
therefore a generative model of hidden

2014
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:43,440
causes the world entailing policy

2015
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,799
selection paths

2016
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:47,319
leads to this imperative to be

2017
01:05:47,319 --> 01:05:49,119
self-evidencing

2018
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:51,760
or an information forager that takes

2019
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,760
this multi-scale cybernetic

2020
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,559
goal seeking good regulator requisite

2021
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:58,319
diversity characteristics

2022
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:00,400
so in other words if you want to be

2023
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,240
staying alive maintaining that

2024
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,079
asymmetry where you have more

2025
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:06,079
organization or more information that's

2026
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:07,280
that info thermo

2027
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,880
if you want to be maintaining that

2028
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,359
competitive strategic asymmetry

2029
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:13,839
then you're going to be needing to have

2030
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:15,599
the ability to engage in effective

2031
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:16,400
policy

2032
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,400
effective policy is only going to be

2033
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,839
happening if you have an effective

2034
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:21,760
generative model of the latent causes in

2035
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:22,720
the world

2036
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,720
and that means that if you're going to

2037
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,079
be a cybernetic agent

2038
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:27,920
that's able to have a generative model

2039
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,520
about the latent causes of the world and

2040
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,960
respond appropriately

2041
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,720
you're going to be needing to be an

2042
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,000
information forager

2043
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,079
that has these good regulator and

2044
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,280
requisite diversity

2045
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,640
characteristics that is what's subsumed

2046
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,720
under the free energy principle

2047
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:45,839
now what are the corollaries so the

2048
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:47,520
corollary hypotheses

2049
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,839
or theories are those that are going to

2050
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,200
be making specific

2051
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,400
testable hypotheses or multiple and a

2052
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,839
couple of them that we've brought up

2053
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:57,760
today we didn't write the ones that

2054
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,359
according to the alias interview didn't

2055
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:01,440
fare so well like gibbs

2056
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,480
particle filtering or gibb sampling but

2057
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,400
we can write up here active inference

2058
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,599
predictive processing

2059
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:10,000
bayesian brain and what else so if you

2060
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,799
have any

2061
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:13,359
other ideas for what is a corollary to

2062
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:14,880
the free energy principle let's

2063
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,359
hear about it that'd be fun and each of

2064
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:18,400
these three

2065
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,599
make specific predictions about kinds of

2066
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:23,599
observable things you might observe or

2067
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:25,280
the implications of different kinds of

2068
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,359
perturbations into the system

2069
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:30,079
so these are a lot more axiomatic and

2070
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,839
background more foundational

2071
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:33,520
whereas up to the top we see in the

2072
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:34,960
corollaries these are

2073
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,640
more like theories that make specific

2074
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,079
testable hypotheses

2075
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:40,160
for example active inference could be

2076
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,240
falsified if somebody shows that

2077
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,000
external states are able to alter

2078
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,440
internal states without

2079
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,880
going through sensory states for example

2080
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:53,039
so that's the free energy principle

2081
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:55,440
in this next section which is 4.1 we

2082
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,119
will turn to the implementational

2083
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:58,960
details of the fep

2084
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,559
which is where it will be demonstrated

2085
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,480
that the formalism does not latch onto

2086
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,640
any features of the real world systems

2087
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:05,599
of interest

2088
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:08,960
so we sort of built up how the fep

2089
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,559
draws in historical context from

2090
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:15,839
info and thermodynamics and then draws

2091
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:17,600
in this cybernetic thread

2092
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,799
to result in a panoply of these testable

2093
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:21,839
hypotheses

2094
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:25,120
so let's talk about section 4.1

2095
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,439
but before we jump in just general

2096
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:28,960
questions and this is because

2097
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,640
it's easier for me to come up with

2098
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,799
questions than answers is

2099
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:35,359
what kinds of models do latch on to

2100
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:36,799
features of real world

2101
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:39,839
system of interest and what is

2102
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:43,040
of interest what is of interest and how

2103
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,120
is it related to what is useful

2104
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,040
for basic and applied researcher or for

2105
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,719
the philosopher of science

2106
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:51,359
so for example if your friend says hey

2107
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:53,040
you might be interested in this

2108
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:56,158
well for the applied researcher or for

2109
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:56,960
the engineer

2110
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,799
maybe of interest would be this is

2111
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:00,319
useful hey you might want to learn about

2112
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:02,080
this software package it might be of

2113
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,679
interest to you because you might use it

2114
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:04,960
effectively

2115
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,279
to a basic researcher somebody who's

2116
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:09,040
working more in the theoretical or the

2117
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,399
abstract areas

2118
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:12,319
of interest might be like you'll find

2119
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,759
some pattern in here

2120
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:16,399
that's very interesting you might have

2121
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:19,120
some thought cascades that are exciting

2122
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,520
and um so it's a different interest and

2123
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:23,040
the philosopher of science

2124
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,279
what is of interest for them i don't

2125
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:26,479
know

2126
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:28,399
let's trace a little bit about this

2127
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:29,920
markov blanket

2128
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,520
question and um the uh

2129
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,520
markov blanket we're gonna return to it

2130
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:36,880
a lot more in

2131
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,158
later on in the year when we are

2132
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:44,080
in april on this uh emperor's new markov

2133
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:44,719
blankets

2134
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:46,399
and in a few other cases we're gonna be

2135
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:48,399
talking about marco blankets

2136
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:50,319
but again we're always learning about

2137
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:52,319
these topics so not too surprising we're

2138
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:53,359
going to come back to them

2139
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:56,400
multiple times so this is what

2140
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,520
mel wrote i i love in the live chat

2141
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,800
people are coming up with all kinds of

2142
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:01,360
funny

2143
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:04,239
markov related terms markov train chains

2144
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:05,040
by marco

2145
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,840
just yes chains of metaphors metaphors

2146
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:08,480
for chains

2147
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,520
why not we come to the conclusion that

2148
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,000
within any non-trivial network any node

2149
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,840
ought to have a multitude of markov

2150
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:16,719
blankets

2151
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:18,400
fristen's employment of the markov

2152
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,400
blanket construct differs from pearl's

2153
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,159
original 1988

2154
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:24,000
construction in the subdivision of the

2155
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,920
blanket into sensory states

2156
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,600
nodes whose influence is directed

2157
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,440
towards the blanket of nodes acts

2158
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,159
and active states nodes influenced by x

2159
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:32,640
okay

2160
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:35,520
so here's 1988's book by judea pearl

2161
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,280
probabilistic reasoning in intelligent

2162
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:37,760
systems

2163
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,880
network of plausible inference now this

2164
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,880
idea of bayesian computation on

2165
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,120
graphical models or bayes nets

2166
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,080
is discussed in this book and elsewhere

2167
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,760
the markov property

2168
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,520
though there's a couple things that have

2169
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,920
markov's name attached to it and i wish

2170
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,920
there was often a clearer way than just

2171
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:56,560
invoking

2172
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,040
some person's name but we'll just use it

2173
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,320
the markov property

2174
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,800
in probability theory and statistics

2175
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,440
refers

2176
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,280
to the memory list property of a

2177
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,360
stochastic process

2178
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,120
the term strong markov property is

2179
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,880
similar to the markup property except

2180
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,000
that the meaning of present

2181
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
is the firm defined in terms of a random

2182
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,400
variable known as the stopping time

2183
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,400
and so the term markov assumption is

2184
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,920
used to describe a model where the

2185
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,000
markov property is assumed to hold such

2186
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,920
a hidden markov systems

2187
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,560
hidden markup model so for markovian

2188
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,520
systems

2189
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,600
we can think about a blanket that is

2190
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,040
insulating a node

2191
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:34,400
x now as mel pointed out in pearl's

2192
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,760
original construction

2193
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,719
it was in a graphical general abstract

2194
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:39,520
context

2195
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:42,960
and the node x was insulated from

2196
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,320
the broader network by a blanket set of

2197
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,360
nodes

2198
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,679
fristen was going to do something a

2199
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:50,560
little different

2200
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,960
which is the nodes that are incoming

2201
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:53,840
into the node of

2202
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,080
interest so here mu is the internal

2203
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,360
state that's like the x

2204
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:01,040
node from the bayesian notation

2205
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:04,480
the nodes that influence the node

2206
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:07,120
of interest are the sensory states

2207
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,400
that's like the incoming

2208
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,320
states but again it's it's whichever

2209
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,000
perspective is inside or outside so

2210
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,679
we're speaking from the point of view

2211
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:16,320
relationally of this internal state the

2212
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,840
sensory states are coming in

2213
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,159
and the action states are the ones that

2214
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:21,440
are downstream

2215
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,080
and so notice that the sensory states

2216
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,840
actually include

2217
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,560
states that don't directly impinge upon

2218
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,320
internal states of interest

2219
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,239
but actually relate just directly to

2220
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:34,239
active states and so that's this diagram

2221
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:36,000
we've seen as the the fristen markov

2222
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,239
blanket as a statistical boundary with

2223
01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:40,480
the parents children and the parents of

2224
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,920
the children so it's kind of like

2225
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,719
your family for the person of interest

2226
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:45,440
includes

2227
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,360
this person who maybe they're not

2228
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,120
directly related because it could have

2229
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,560
it doesn't have to be every arrow on

2230
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:50,960
here

2231
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,560
but they're apparent of their child so

2232
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,560
it's important now

2233
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:57,600
again it would be awesome to have people

2234
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,000
who

2235
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,600
know better and have thought about it

2236
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,280
more to

2237
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,199
give their perspective but i just tried

2238
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:05,280
to make a little bit like a continuum

2239
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:09,199
of markov blanket ideas

2240
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:11,920
so on the left side we have the actual

2241
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,120
markov

2242
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:16,400
our colleague from russia over here

2243
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:19,760
and maybe i'm kind of straw-personing

2244
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:20,960
these arguments i'm just trying to

2245
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,080
throwing them up there trying to

2246
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:22,719
understand

2247
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:24,159
where we're coming from and where we're

2248
01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:26,480
going so markov

2249
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,280
stated it using mathematics pencil and

2250
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,159
paper

2251
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:33,040
and this side of the spectrum is held

2252
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:33,920
down by

2253
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:37,199
the abstract the general and no need to

2254
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:37,760
appeal

2255
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:41,280
to computational bases pearl

2256
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,600
is somebody who had a computer not

2257
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,600
computers like we have today but

2258
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,560
good ones nonetheless i believe pearl's

2259
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,600
framework

2260
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,239
is based upon wanting to integrate

2261
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:54,480
empirical data in a way that mathematics

2262
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,000
isn't so that's one of the distinctions

2263
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,880
between statistics and mathematics

2264
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,120
because it's dealing with statistics and

2265
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,080
um

2266
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:05,040
uh real data sets potentially weaker

2267
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:05,679
assumptions

2268
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:08,640
might be in play so this is sort of

2269
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,239
somewhere in the midpoint

2270
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:12,000
and fristen is way on the other side of

2271
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,159
the overton markov window

2272
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:15,760
and this is where we're getting the

2273
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,920
integration of ideas like

2274
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,480
the node consists of sense and action

2275
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:21,440
states it's not just

2276
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,120
insulating states it's actually there's

2277
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,199
this temporal nature

2278
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:28,320
where things that happen before

2279
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,080
are like sense states coming in and

2280
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,440
things that happen afterwards are like

2281
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,560
actions heading out

2282
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,000
and that's like a bayesian directed

2283
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,080
graph that has a temporal component

2284
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,840
we also bring in these attributes like

2285
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,360
this cybernetic imperative

2286
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,199
to maintain the non-equilibrium steady

2287
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:44,480
state the idea of a generative model

2288
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,199
of non-local dependencies or latent

2289
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:49,040
causes in the world

2290
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,880
cybernetic model of the environment the

2291
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,480
good regulator or the requisite

2292
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,840
diversity ideas

2293
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,920
and also some of these other threads

2294
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:56,960
that might not be

2295
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:00,560
downstream of some qed proof from markov

2296
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,320
but nonetheless are important for

2297
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,800
understanding of markov blankets in the

2298
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,080
free energy principle

2299
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,800
like the inactive embodied and cultured

2300
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:09,360
embedded

2301
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,559
perspective so

2302
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,880
can the markov blanket idea have

2303
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,920
interpretable parameters so do

2304
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,080
any kind of blanket capture what we

2305
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,080
think they're capturing or what

2306
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,239
should we think they're capturing is

2307
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:28,320
this implementation tractable

2308
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,560
will it be useful for different kinds of

2309
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,239
systems

2310
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:34,400
is there clear philosophical commitments

2311
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,360
or not

2312
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:38,159
and is narrative thermocybernetic a

2313
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:39,760
metaphor or not just you know i'm

2314
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,280
curious about that

2315
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,880
um a few more quotes from the paper and

2316
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,480
thanks everybody who's watching and

2317
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,320
posting in the live chat it's pretty

2318
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,239
fun and a little hard to be responding

2319
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:51,600
to everything but it's fun

2320
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,960
times mel writes

2321
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,520
this is how the markov blanket construct

2322
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,800
is operationalized

2323
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,800
the upshot is that the power to select

2324
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,640
systematic boundaries rests at least in

2325
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,960
part on the researcher's intuition which

2326
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,040
i would also say is true for regression

2327
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,080
coefficients

2328
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,560
principal component analyses t-sne

2329
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,080
dimensions okay that's just

2330
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,080
what it's like being a scientist we

2331
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,600
didn't sign up for this because we

2332
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,320
wanted

2333
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,320
objective non-personalized

2334
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,000
recommendations we wanted to be part

2335
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,800
of that process if the markov blanket

2336
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:23,679
formalism

2337
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,600
were to independently track natural

2338
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,360
joints we would need to equip it at

2339
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,239
least

2340
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:30,560
at the outset with some threshold value

2341
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,000
which would determine precisely the

2342
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,679
degree of conditional independencies

2343
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:34,000
that would

2344
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,600
count across the board for the

2345
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,440
possession of a markov blanket

2346
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,960
so that's like when you do principal

2347
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,520
component analysis on a real matrix of

2348
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:42,320
data

2349
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,159
let's say principal component 1 explains

2350
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,760
40 percent of the variance and then the

2351
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,600
next one's 30 and the next one's 10

2352
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,360
and you get this long tail of hundreds

2353
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,719
and hundreds of principal components

2354
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:51,360
that explain

2355
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,840
less and less and less variation there's

2356
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,040
no clean line

2357
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,640
you can't just say well if it's less

2358
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,159
than one percent of the variance

2359
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:00,159
then it's not an important principle

2360
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:02,480
component there isn't

2361
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,400
a measure or a value like that the

2362
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,719
threshold is always going to be

2363
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:08,560
in the details it's always going to be

2364
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,760
how it's enacted by the scientist

2365
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,159
if such a threshold existed ask yourself

2366
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:15,440
if it could

2367
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:18,159
and were baked into the markov blanket

2368
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:19,040
formalism

2369
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,800
then we could consider markov blankets

2370
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,560
to be in some sense real features of

2371
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,080
real world systems

2372
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,480
so again like p values you can say i

2373
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:27,280
mean come on

2374
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:31,840
p value of 0.00

2375
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,520
come on let's just say that they're

2376
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,840
different but no you you can't do that

2377
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:36,719
because there's no

2378
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:38,880
natural kind with p values it's just a

2379
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,159
continuum

2380
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:42,239
we might discover them measure them and

2381
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:44,080
count them

2382
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,159
we might meaningfully ask whether some

2383
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:47,920
existing system does or does not possess

2384
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,280
a markov blanket

2385
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:50,960
so again let's just say there's two tree

2386
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,040
species and one is ten plus or minus one

2387
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,400
foot and the other one is three plus or

2388
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,480
minus one foot there's no overlap

2389
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,800
and you do the t-test and the p-value is

2390
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,320
just ridiculously low

2391
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,080
and you say come on can't i just say

2392
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,440
it's a natural kind that they're

2393
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,719
naturally different

2394
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:07,600
and so the answer is no so this is a

2395
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,520
similar realization in the context of

2396
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,760
the empirical detection of markov

2397
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,360
blankets potentially from empirical

2398
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,880
systems

2399
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,800
if we can conceive of something as a

2400
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,040
discrete thing as a coherent system

2401
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,640
then it is possible to formally

2402
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,560
represent it as possessing a markov

2403
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,520
blanket

2404
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,120
there are no markov blankets to be

2405
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,120
discovered in nature and they are not in

2406
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,960
the business of illuminating natural

2407
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:29,520
joints

2408
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,280
so it's like there's no p-values in

2409
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,520
nature there's no structural equations

2410
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:34,719
out there in nature

2411
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:36,239
we're not discovering the structural

2412
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:38,480
equation model we generate it

2413
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,360
in response to observables so that's why

2414
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:42,400
the ftp

2415
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,640
is not in the business of illuminating

2416
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:47,040
natural joints

2417
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,199
finally the thermodynamic entropy and

2418
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:50,560
the shannon entropy

2419
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,239
are only equivalent under the

2420
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:54,320
generalized boltzmann distribution

2421
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:57,040
which it has been argued applies only at

2422
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,960
thermal equilibrium

2423
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,600
thus in general information entropy and

2424
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,840
physical entropy are distinct

2425
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:06,000
living systems are by definition far

2426
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,760
from equilibrium systems

2427
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,440
thus information entropy and

2428
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:10,960
thermodynamic entropy

2429
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,880
do not converge in the regimes of

2430
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,960
interest to us

2431
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,640
so just a couple general questions on

2432
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,320
this part

2433
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,960
what are the formal axioms and the logic

2434
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,760
or ontology of the free energy principle

2435
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,560
this is what mel has taken such an

2436
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:27,600
awesome

2437
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,880
effort and a stab at with this paper is

2438
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,800
what are the commitments and entailments

2439
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,159
of fep

2440
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:36,880
what did we have to do to get here where

2441
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:37,360
are we

2442
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,880
and where are we going to go

2443
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,560
philosophically

2444
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,960
which of the model assumptions of active

2445
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:43,600
inference or

2446
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,800
fap are flexible so where would we find

2447
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:47,520
that the model

2448
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,000
is still performant on data sets that

2449
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,920
might violate some expectation of the

2450
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:52,800
model

2451
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,239
so for example a t-test might have

2452
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:58,080
the assumption that there's equal

2453
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,320
variances between the two groups

2454
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,239
you could do an inequal variances t-test

2455
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:03,760
it's a different kind of test but for an

2456
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,600
equal variances t-test it assumes that

2457
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:06,960
the variances are equal

2458
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,840
but they don't have to be equal to the

2459
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,360
highest possible degree

2460
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,960
it turns out you can kind of fudge that

2461
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,800
one a little bit or it might still give

2462
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,880
you directionally accurate findings

2463
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,040
but with potentially a reduced or an

2464
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,159
inflated p-value

2465
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:22,560
so in other words what assumptions are

2466
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,239
we bringing to the table

2467
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:26,239
and what are the entailments and then

2468
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:27,920
which one of these things bringing to

2469
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,960
the table are a little bit flexible

2470
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,440
what are living systems doing and how do

2471
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,280
we think about living systems this is

2472
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,560
related to that life

2473
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,880
mind continuity it's related to

2474
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,159
schrodinger's question

2475
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:43,760
what is life from 1944 it's related to

2476
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,920
complexity theory it's related to so

2477
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:47,679
many discussions that we're having about

2478
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:50,880
agency autonomy individuality

2479
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,280
personality multi-scale systems there's

2480
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,000
so much

2481
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,120
happening here and what other

2482
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,520
questions do you have because the

2483
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,480
questions that

2484
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,159
all of the participants bring to the

2485
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:04,480
table are often the most exciting

2486
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:08,080
ones it might seem then

2487
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:10,000
that the fep could perhaps be thrown at

2488
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,840
real world systems and the degree of

2489
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,080
biological or cognitive complexity

2490
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,679
can be read off of features of the

2491
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:17,520
system's generative model

2492
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,760
the fep however does not dictate what we

2493
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:20,880
should write down

2494
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,280
for a given systems generative model and

2495
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,960
once we have written down the generative

2496
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,199
model of the system under investigation

2497
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:28,880
we have switched from the purview of the

2498
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,120
fep to that of a process theory

2499
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,400
so again let's think about it with a

2500
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,800
t-test the t-test

2501
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,159
by itself doesn't dictate which exact

2502
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:39,840
statistical test we should do for a

2503
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,120
given system

2504
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,000
so the t-test framework doesn't say yeah

2505
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,360
this is what you measure

2506
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,639
about ant colonies the t-test says given

2507
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:49,679
what you give it

2508
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:52,719
it's going to give you a p-value and so

2509
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:54,480
that's something that the fep is

2510
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,639
analysis analogously going to be

2511
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:59,199
providing us with so as soon as we start

2512
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:01,440
asking about specific deployments of the

2513
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,159
fep

2514
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:05,520
in situ in an actual case then

2515
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,760
we're talking about falsifiable process

2516
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:08,560
theories

2517
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,800
so it's almost like linear regression

2518
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:11,600
theory

2519
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,920
is in the background that's abstract and

2520
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,600
then you can ask

2521
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,000
in specific situations whether you're

2522
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:18,800
using

2523
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,920
um a falsifiable model using a linear

2524
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,920
regression on a real data set but that's

2525
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,120
not at the level of

2526
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,120
talking about what linear aggression is

2527
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,400
which might be an in principle

2528
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,560
discussion

2529
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:32,080
this i thought was an interesting part

2530
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,719
as well a single hydrogen atom at rest

2531
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:36,320
in a vacuum

2532
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:37,920
is not meaningfully interpreted as

2533
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,440
performing approximate bayesian

2534
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,920
inference over its environmental states

2535
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,000
a time series of mere abiotic

2536
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,520
self-organizing systems

2537
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,000
say a whirlpool or a candle flame would

2538
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,920
show it throwing off its markov blanket

2539
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,600
and establishing a new one

2540
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,880
at every time step critically this does

2541
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,239
not entail the fep

2542
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:58,080
cannot in principle apply to such

2543
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,440
systems it means

2544
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:01,440
only that we have no reason to apply it

2545
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:02,560
to such systems

2546
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,400
we have nothing to gain epistemically

2547
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:05,600
from applying it to such

2548
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,199
systems so that would be quite

2549
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:08,719
interesting to

2550
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:10,719
hear mel's perspective on and everyone

2551
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:11,920
else as well

2552
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,239
what is different about systems that

2553
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:15,520
seem to just kind of

2554
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,520
dissipate and don't have this

2555
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,199
autopilesis characteristic

2556
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:21,840
like a candle burning or a landslide or

2557
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:22,960
a lightning strike

2558
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,320
they're energy dissipating events but

2559
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,159
they're a little different than living

2560
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:30,480
systems and so it makes me think of

2561
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:33,520
le vocier working with oxygen and

2562
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:34,719
thinking about how well

2563
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:36,560
humans are taking in oxygen and

2564
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,000
breathing out co2

2565
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,560
candles are taking in oxygen so to speak

2566
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:41,520
releasing heat

2567
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:44,320
breathing out co2 kind of the reverse

2568
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:44,800
plant

2569
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,520
reaction so are they similar are they

2570
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:50,639
different what's what's happening there

2571
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:53,120
just a couple more quotes this is really

2572
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,400
fun though

2573
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,400
we found that the framework accommodated

2574
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,760
certain things very well

2575
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:00,800
this is mel in review at the latter part

2576
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,960
of the paper the markov blanket

2577
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,880
does a very nice job of representing

2578
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,400
systemic boundaries

2579
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,400
the temporal depth of the trajectories

2580
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,000
being solved by the latent generative

2581
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,080
models postulated under the fep

2582
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,600
is a very elegant and informative

2583
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,360
representation of something like

2584
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:18,159
cognitive complexity and the free energy

2585
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:19,199
parameter itself

2586
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:21,679
maps onto a system's attunement with its

2587
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:23,120
environmental context

2588
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:26,000
its cohesion and internal consistency

2589
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:26,480
among

2590
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:29,440
other things we also found however that

2591
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,920
the fep does not pick out or discover

2592
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:34,480
these aspects of natural systems even in

2593
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:35,280
silico

2594
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:38,560
but only provides a useful model of them

2595
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:40,960
so this is really awesome because it

2596
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,520
just is such a positive example of the

2597
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:44,000
yes

2598
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,960
and mindset that we want to be fostering

2599
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:47,280
with

2600
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,920
active inference and fep we're drawing

2601
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,600
from all these different areas

2602
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,960
areas where we know we're going to be

2603
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:54,480
learning for our whole life about

2604
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,920
information theory and

2605
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:57,760
cognitive complexity and machine

2606
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:58,960
learning we're

2607
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,920
drawing hopefully together different

2608
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:02,480
ideas

2609
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,080
leaving the door open for those who can

2610
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,760
contribute in ways that we don't even

2611
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:06,320
know or

2612
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:09,040
expect building together and then also

2613
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,040
just clarifying the fep is not

2614
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,679
doing everything it's not picking out or

2615
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:16,080
discovering aspects of natural systems

2616
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:19,840
even in a simulation however it may yet

2617
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,600
be something quite useful for us to

2618
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,840
deploy

2619
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,400
and this is just a few more points from

2620
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,480
the modeling section on this paper

2621
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,199
yep it's just it's a saturday it's a fun

2622
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:32,000
paper

2623
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,280
we're looking forward to 14 and so mel

2624
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:36,080
writes

2625
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,480
this comes in two forms first the

2626
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,159
literature on scientific modeling

2627
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:42,080
has increasingly come to acknowledge the

2628
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:44,239
status of non-representational

2629
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,800
and non-target directed models and

2630
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:47,440
second

2631
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:49,360
even at the presumption that all models

2632
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,040
represent target systems

2633
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:53,120
the utility of a model is generally

2634
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,360
understood to stem from idealizing

2635
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:58,000
black boxing or core screening away from

2636
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:58,560
essential

2637
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,480
inessential or distracting details of a

2638
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,080
target system

2639
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,360
in other words deliberate deliberate

2640
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:05,679
misrepresentations

2641
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:08,400
or omissions make a good model not

2642
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,280
fidelity

2643
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:12,400
so very interesting it's a semantic

2644
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:15,040
compression and this question of lossy

2645
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,960
or leaky compression

2646
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,880
and in the context of scientific

2647
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,080
modeling

2648
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,239
it's related to whether we're talking

2649
01:26:22,239 --> 01:26:24,880
about representational models or non

2650
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,440
or target directed or non-target

2651
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:28,800
directed

2652
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,840
so first point here how are models

2653
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:33,440
scientific models or other kinds of

2654
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,600
models that's the demarcation problem

2655
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,480
related to semantic in compression how

2656
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:39,440
can we think about

2657
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:42,480
semantic compression as encryption

2658
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:43,679
and it could be encryption that's

2659
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:45,600
reversible or not

2660
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,600
how is semantic compression related to

2661
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,600
narrative how are narratives

2662
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,560
semantic compression events how are

2663
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,880
narratives the stories that we tell

2664
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:58,320
able to compress vast swaths of syntax

2665
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:01,440
or even other semantics how is

2666
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:04,639
coarse graining or removing the

2667
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:07,199
inessential or distracting details of a

2668
01:27:07,199 --> 01:27:08,080
target system

2669
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:10,080
discarding irrelevancies as bucky would

2670
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:13,120
say how is this coarse graining

2671
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,120
related to the causal entropy of a

2672
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,600
system or maybe even its slow

2673
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:21,360
synergetic modes of operation

2674
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,440
good models live on this complexity

2675
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,880
accuracy trade-off

2676
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:27,360
in the philosophy of science space so

2677
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,280
you want your model to be something more

2678
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,000
than nothing

2679
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,280
if it's not reducing people's

2680
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,600
uncertainty at all if it's not helping

2681
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,360
them get more accurate about something

2682
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:38,480
it's nothing but then there are model

2683
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,880
complexities that can outweigh

2684
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:44,239
how accurate um or how much it assists

2685
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:45,760
in agents accuracy

2686
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,360
so if you have to carry around a hundred

2687
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,040
things in your head and then it only

2688
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,560
helps you a little bit

2689
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:51,840
maybe you could have had another thing

2690
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,040
in your head that would have reduced

2691
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,960
your uncertainty in a better way

2692
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,880
so it's just so cool that we see this

2693
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,199
complexity accuracy trade-off

2694
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:02,159
manifested in the actual formalisms of

2695
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:03,280
the fep

2696
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:06,080
but at the same time qualitatively it's

2697
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,920
long been understood in the philosophy

2698
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:08,800
of science

2699
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:11,440
that models have to ride this edge

2700
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,120
between being too complex

2701
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:16,639
and being accurate can we separate

2702
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:19,600
these boxes at the joints for use and

2703
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,440
truth and so i forget which discussion

2704
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:22,880
it was on or who said it

2705
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,840
but it was um maybe an in eight with uh

2706
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,199
blue or with alec

2707
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:29,199
how when we want transparent machine

2708
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:30,400
learning models

2709
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:31,920
this idea we're going to look inside the

2710
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:34,239
black box potentially might be a little

2711
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:35,360
bit misleading because you're going to

2712
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:36,639
look inside and there's going to be

2713
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:38,320
millions of parameters

2714
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:41,280
so just looking inside of the box may

2715
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,159
not get

2716
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:44,320
semantically somebody to where they want

2717
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,000
to be however

2718
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,440
could we cut up that box into specific

2719
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:52,480
structures of smaller boxes

2720
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,239
and then we could look at how variables

2721
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:56,159
or information is passed

2722
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:58,320
between different boxes to be able to

2723
01:28:58,320 --> 01:28:59,360
have a sense

2724
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:02,080
of what is almost like accountability or

2725
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:04,159
transparency in machine learning models

2726
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:06,960
so just to give one example there let's

2727
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:07,760
just say

2728
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,760
somebody has a data set with movement

2729
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,120
data and

2730
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,440
pictures of people and there's a neural

2731
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,120
network that's predicting whether

2732
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:16,800
they're going to be committing a crime

2733
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,560
and somebody says hey i think this is

2734
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:20,960
being used in a non-equitable way i want

2735
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,800
to have increased transparency

2736
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,400
i want to be able to see inside of the

2737
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,000
model and someone goes sure

2738
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,360
here it is look at all the parameters

2739
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,040
yourself but again they're not

2740
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:29,840
interpretable

2741
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,520
they're parameters inside of some neural

2742
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,199
network model so

2743
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:35,520
would there be a way where we could

2744
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,639
separate the model

2745
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:39,040
into these specifically related boxes

2746
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:41,120
that are doing message passing

2747
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,760
passing information back and forth in a

2748
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,040
way where we can see

2749
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,880
oh yeah you know you told me that

2750
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:48,480
socioeconomic factors

2751
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,480
don't play into this part of the model

2752
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:51,679
and now i can actually

2753
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:54,320
look at that and see yes these variables

2754
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:55,120
are getting

2755
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,280
concluded into a summary variable and

2756
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:58,239
that's getting combined with

2757
01:29:58,239 --> 01:29:59,199
socioeconomic

2758
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:02,000
status in this way so it's not playing a

2759
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,840
role at this stage of the model

2760
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,199
it could be confounded because it's

2761
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:07,360
confounded in the real world but

2762
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,280
by breaking up the black box into

2763
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,040
smaller boxes that are a little bit more

2764
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,320
graspable a little bit more

2765
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:13,520
comprehensible

2766
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:17,440
we actually get a level of understanding

2767
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:19,600
that isn't just peering inside of the

2768
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,880
model because again

2769
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,400
do we really understand a linear

2770
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:23,760
aggression do we really understand

2771
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:24,560
addition

2772
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,239
i mean you can really go down the rabbit

2773
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:30,080
hole do we understand a sign or a cosine

2774
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:32,080
lots of fun stuff happening today all

2775
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,480
right we got a couple more slides

2776
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,880
another quote from mel in the latter

2777
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,639
half of the paper

2778
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:40,560
the organization and dynamics of the

2779
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:41,760
living organism

2780
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,679
the functional architecture of the brain

2781
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:44,800
and the structure of

2782
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,960
human social systems these are the most

2783
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,800
complex systems known to exist

2784
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:51,280
and they're nested inside of each other

2785
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,120
the systems that study these systems

2786
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:54,880
oh sorry the sciences that study these

2787
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:57,120
systems are comparatively very young

2788
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,960
and may never reach the maturity of the

2789
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,880
sciences oriented towards

2790
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:03,760
far more simple systems the life

2791
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:04,400
cognitive

2792
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,480
neuro and formal social sciences are

2793
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,400
still in many respects at the stage of

2794
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,320
trying to get a methodological foot in

2795
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,760
the door

2796
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,600
highly idealized models such as

2797
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,440
normative or optimality

2798
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:18,000
optimality models assist us in getting

2799
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,440
traction on otherwise

2800
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:22,159
intractable phenomena so we saw that a

2801
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:24,159
little bit with the scripts paper

2802
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:27,280
and the variational approach to scripts

2803
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:29,760
because that was a social science that

2804
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:32,000
was methodologically getting its foot in

2805
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:32,719
the door

2806
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:34,800
by borrowing from the legacy of the

2807
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,159
kinds of approaches we're discussing

2808
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:38,000
here

2809
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,120
loose 1995 introduces four distinctions

2810
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:42,719
to the mathematical modeling

2811
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:45,280
of cognitive processes so this is about

2812
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,600
the cognitive psychology mathematical

2813
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:48,560
psychology

2814
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:51,760
science modeling literature process

2815
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:52,960
models are contrasted to

2816
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,280
phenomenological models

2817
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:56,960
normative models differentiated from

2818
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,480
descriptive models

2819
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,800
dynamic models compared to static models

2820
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:03,120
and a distinction is drawn between noise

2821
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:04,320
and structure

2822
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:07,280
so that's another breakdown of models of

2823
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:08,960
kinds of scientific ideas

2824
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,120
not fristen's breakdown but loose's

2825
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,719
breakdown and that also

2826
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:15,920
helps us understand a few more

2827
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,679
spectrums that exist in the space of the

2828
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:20,480
possible models

2829
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:23,679
another quote from the modeling section

2830
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:25,199
under a normative model

2831
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:27,040
which is again the kind that we are

2832
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,239
suspecting fep

2833
01:32:28,239 --> 01:32:31,120
is it is presumed that reasoning should

2834
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:32,480
accord with formal logic

2835
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:35,760
induction and beliefs with eg bayesian

2836
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,080
dictates for inference and credence

2837
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:40,400
belief or decision making with the

2838
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:43,199
results of optimizing a utility function

2839
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:45,440
a descriptive model or phenomenological

2840
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,800
model in contrast

2841
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,639
represents the cognitive process of

2842
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:49,920
making choices

2843
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:51,679
reasoning through sub-problems and

2844
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:53,520
drawing inference as it is observed to

2845
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:54,239
happen

2846
01:32:54,239 --> 01:32:56,480
messy sub-optimal and irrational though

2847
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:57,920
it may be

2848
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:00,000
what then is the significance of taking

2849
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
the fep to be a normative model in

2850
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,600
loose's sense

2851
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,360
fristen and colleagues stress that the

2852
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,760
fep as a process theory is not

2853
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:09,040
falsifiable

2854
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:12,080
i'm not sure if this is intended

2855
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:14,400
it will not be possible to articulate a

2856
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,480
version of the fep that can be held up

2857
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,400
against some real world process in such

2858
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:20,400
a way as to undermine or legitimate the

2859
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,120
model

2860
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:23,280
because the fep is the principle that

2861
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:24,960
specific process theories

2862
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,920
are drawn from the fep will not directly

2863
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:29,120
generate predictions

2864
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:31,760
tests or hypotheses well i would wonder

2865
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:32,960
what if it brings the group

2866
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:35,280
together and then they come up with

2867
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,440
predictions tests and hypotheses could

2868
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:38,400
you say that the

2869
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:41,280
idea was the difference making cause

2870
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:43,120
just a thought

2871
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:46,639
another idea on this is the normativity

2872
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:49,760
here is presumed to be a logical

2873
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:52,000
normativity in other words that the

2874
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,840
reasoning should accord with formal

2875
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,600
logic induction and belief

2876
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,120
but what if the normativity were

2877
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,120
cybernetic for example what if the

2878
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:00,080
normative claim

2879
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:03,120
were not that a can't equal not a

2880
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:05,040
so that's sort of one of the claims of

2881
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:06,159
let's just say

2882
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:08,320
normal boolean logic but one of the

2883
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:09,679
claims is

2884
01:34:09,679 --> 01:34:13,199
the normative claim is uh might is right

2885
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:15,760
for example so this describes cybernetic

2886
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:16,480
systems

2887
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:18,560
which might not be following formal

2888
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,040
logic or pianos axioms or

2889
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:23,199
any other inductive strategy that's

2890
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:24,560
consistent with truth

2891
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:27,520
they might be following normatively a

2892
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:28,880
power centric approach

2893
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:31,120
now if that diverges too strong from

2894
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:32,239
what's actually there

2895
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:33,520
they're not going to exist in the niche

2896
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:34,800
but still that doesn't mean that the

2897
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:35,760
normativity

2898
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:38,639
has to be derivative from this reality

2899
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:40,639
it means that it could be a normativity

2900
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:44,080
that arises from natural selection

2901
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:47,280
and also marco thanks for that comment

2902
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,600
wrote i want to flag this part in my

2903
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,639
opinion fep

2904
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:52,480
is a unique normative principle that

2905
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,159
doesn't prematurely assume

2906
01:34:54,159 --> 01:34:56,639
sound reasoning so that will be great to

2907
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:57,440
unpack

2908
01:34:57,440 --> 01:35:01,520
your understanding there and um

2909
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:03,600
just a few more quotes in the section

2910
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:04,880
that follows

2911
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:07,040
the philosophical literature on adjacent

2912
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:09,040
sorts of models will be reviewed in the

2913
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,880
hopes that this will lend a sense of how

2914
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,639
it is that a highly abstracted

2915
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:14,880
unfalsifiable formal model such as the

2916
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,600
fep can have scientific utility

2917
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:19,920
ultimately of course whether the fep

2918
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:21,679
turns out to be useful in this way will

2919
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:22,880
be an empirical matter

2920
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:26,320
in both senses great puns here it's like

2921
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,400
if it's really true that the fep is

2922
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,800
useful then we'll find out because it

2923
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,159
will be useful

2924
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:34,719
and how could it be that a highly

2925
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:35,719
abstracted

2926
01:35:35,719 --> 01:35:38,880
non-falsifiable formal model could be

2927
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:39,760
useful

2928
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,119
that's what we're finding out we're

2929
01:35:41,119 --> 01:35:42,880
learning by doing that's what we're

2930
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:44,560
enacting

2931
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:47,040
the fep is thus an umbrella framework

2932
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,560
out of which predictive processing

2933
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:49,760
predictive coding

2934
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,600
and aversion of active inference its

2935
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:52,800
process models

2936
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:55,119
fall with decreasing abstraction and

2937
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:56,639
increasing granularity

2938
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:59,360
awesome sentence as a normative model

2939
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:00,800
the fep is intended

2940
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,719
to aid in the generation of process

2941
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:04,880
models and to furnish constraints on

2942
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:06,639
viable process models

2943
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:09,840
the fep itself is however not beholden

2944
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,199
to empirical data

2945
01:36:11,199 --> 01:36:13,679
its virtues are not in its very

2946
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:16,000
semi-limited

2947
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,840
very similitude reminds me of the

2948
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,520
silmarillion but maybe there's a better

2949
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:20,800
way to say that word it means

2950
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,000
truthfulness though

2951
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,080
so this is just really awesome it's kind

2952
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:25,119
of like by

2953
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:27,840
allowing reward learning to evolve into

2954
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:28,880
active inference

2955
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:31,360
we saw how preference becomes baked into

2956
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,119
the model so we don't separate from our

2957
01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:34,960
values and preferences by focusing on

2958
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:35,840
policy

2959
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:38,000
actually focusing on policy is what

2960
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,520
allows us to be clear

2961
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:42,400
and define our values and so similarly

2962
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:42,800
by

2963
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:45,040
going to this highly abstracted

2964
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:47,199
unfalsifiable formal model such as the

2965
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:48,560
fep

2966
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:51,520
we're able to clarify where scientific

2967
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:52,159
utility

2968
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:54,719
is going to enter the picture where in

2969
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:56,480
specific situations

2970
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:58,560
task specific modeling or setting

2971
01:36:58,560 --> 01:36:59,920
specific modeling

2972
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:01,360
and it's going to be developing

2973
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,040
falsifiable hypotheses

2974
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:05,600
but the fep itself there's no data set

2975
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,679
that comes along and knocks out the fep

2976
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:09,040
so it's kind of at the level of

2977
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:11,600
evolution rather than at the level of

2978
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:14,080
these process theories all right just

2979
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:15,760
the last couple few i feel like i said

2980
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:16,800
that a few times

2981
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,880
this is the field site where i did my

2982
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,520
ant research in grad school in arizona

2983
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:24,560
but i like this because uh we'll see

2984
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:27,679
in a in a little bit weisberg

2985
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:29,760
has likewise laid out a useful taxonomy

2986
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:30,960
for scientific models

2987
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:33,040
he differentiates concrete mathematical

2988
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:34,639
and computational models

2989
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:36,239
cutting across this tripartite

2990
01:37:36,239 --> 01:37:38,159
distinction is a division between what

2991
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:38,639
he calls

2992
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:40,800
target directed modeling and modeling

2993
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,960
without a specific target

2994
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:45,119
in this latter category of target list

2995
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:47,600
modeling we find generalized modeling

2996
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,920
minimal modeling hypothetical modeling

2997
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:51,760
and target list modeling

2998
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:53,679
a target directed model is one built for

2999
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:55,280
the purpose of predicting controlling

3000
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:56,719
and explaining the behavior of a

3001
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:58,480
specific system under specific

3002
01:37:58,480 --> 01:37:59,520
conditions

3003
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:02,320
for example just what an example we

3004
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:03,600
might have data pertaining to the

3005
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:04,719
foraging behavior

3006
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:08,080
of a particular species of ants across

3007
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:09,679
a number of colonies observed in the

3008
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:12,000
amazon rainforest and we might construct

3009
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,679
a model for the purpose of discovering

3010
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:14,719
something about the

3011
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:17,040
ethology and ecology of this particular

3012
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:18,400
ant species

3013
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:20,719
then again we might want to think about

3014
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:22,560
foraging behavior much more broadly and

3015
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:23,520
abstractly

3016
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:26,320
divorced from the minutia of particular

3017
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,600
minute particulars

3018
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,920
william blake populations of particular

3019
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:31,840
species in particular ecological

3020
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,280
settings

3021
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:34,880
considering the problems posed by

3022
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,280
foraging in apache habitat as faced by

3023
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:39,199
organisms in abstract terms

3024
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:40,960
we might perceive a resonance between

3025
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:43,119
foraging and economic models that deal

3026
01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:45,360
with optimizing decisions in scenarios

3027
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:47,600
in which we face diminishing returns we

3028
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,440
might come up with a heavily idealized

3029
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:50,880
organism and context

3030
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:53,119
generic model of foraging the latter

3031
01:38:53,119 --> 01:38:53,920
model

3032
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,440
the latter approach is what weisberg

3033
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:58,080
dubs modeling a generalized target

3034
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:01,520
so at this field site for over 30 years

3035
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:04,080
my phd advisor professor deborah gordon

3036
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:04,960
was observing

3037
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:07,199
exactly the specifics here the minute

3038
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:08,080
particulars

3039
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:10,080
the very specific behavior of ant

3040
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:12,000
colonies at this field site

3041
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,080
now there was other ants other species

3042
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:15,040
at the field site

3043
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:16,800
there was the same species in the next

3044
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,600
valley over but we were really specific

3045
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:22,000
about this specific field site these

3046
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,080
exact colonies we'd have stones next to

3047
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:25,119
the colony oh

3048
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:28,159
here's colony 6 10 and so

3049
01:39:28,159 --> 01:39:31,280
that's specific at the same time it was

3050
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:33,440
through observing the specifics

3051
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:35,280
that one is able to abstract and

3052
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:37,360
generalize for example

3053
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:40,639
um professor gordon's papers in 2014

3054
01:39:40,639 --> 01:39:42,719
on the ecology of collective behavior

3055
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:44,639
which draws links between the algorithms

3056
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:46,080
from computer science

3057
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,480
and behavior across ants as well as

3058
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,560
swarm behavior in other systems

3059
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,880
so it's like by going into the specifics

3060
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:54,719
we can go into the abstraction

3061
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:56,880
and we can make it even more clear it's

3062
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:58,639
kind of like an electrical charge

3063
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:00,960
separation that we're polarizing it

3064
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:02,239
because it's

3065
01:40:02,239 --> 01:40:05,840
clarifying and distilling the hypothesis

3066
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:08,000
and the specific ants on the ground as

3067
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:08,880
it were

3068
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:12,080
from these more general ideas about

3069
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:15,280
ants foraging the live chat goes wild

3070
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:17,679
with the foraging behavior in ants

3071
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:20,239
models of this sort can also serve as an

3072
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:22,239
abstract or analogical touchstone

3073
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:25,280
or entry point into an unexplored domain

3074
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:27,679
so this is really exciting models as

3075
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:29,119
exploration

3076
01:40:29,119 --> 01:40:31,119
this will serve as the basis for more

3077
01:40:31,119 --> 01:40:33,679
targeted more fine-grained modeling work

3078
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:36,480
or empirical investigation later on

3079
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,199
models in this

3080
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:39,520
genre also aid in the process of theory

3081
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:40,400
construction

3082
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,560
by allowing exploration of the nature

3083
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:43,520
and interrelation

3084
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:45,840
of conceptual objects and by inspiring

3085
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,280
theorists to draw connections and

3086
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:48,800
ask questions that would otherwise have

3087
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:51,360
gone undrawn or unasked

3088
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:53,280
such models offer leverage where other

3089
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:55,199
scientific methods stop short

3090
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:57,520
systems and dynamics far too complex or

3091
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:59,199
too new to be treated under standard

3092
01:40:59,199 --> 01:41:00,000
approaches

3093
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
so with the ant example you're out there

3094
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,520
in the field you're watching the ants

3095
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:04,080
forage

3096
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:06,239
and you start to abstract and generalize

3097
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:07,199
and think about

3098
01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:09,600
optimal foraging or think about general

3099
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:11,199
foraging processes

3100
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:13,360
but now we're stepping out even a level

3101
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:14,239
beyond

3102
01:41:14,239 --> 01:41:17,199
the idealized process in nature are

3103
01:41:17,199 --> 01:41:18,639
these abstract

3104
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:21,440
entry points into unexplored domains for

3105
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:22,560
example

3106
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,800
the game of life which is a cellular

3107
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,400
automata game

3108
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:29,679
it was like put out there as a toy as a

3109
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:30,639
game

3110
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:32,960
yes everyone is losing their mind in the

3111
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:33,760
chat mel

3112
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:35,760
i hope that you can recover by the time

3113
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:38,000
we have this chat next tuesday

3114
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
the game of life was just like saying

3115
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,600
hey what would happen if we had a grid

3116
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:43,360
with a certain rule set

3117
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:47,280
and that ended up going so much

3118
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:49,520
in detail people making gliders and

3119
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:50,480
turing complete

3120
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:53,040
games of life and stephen wolfram and

3121
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,719
all the research downstream of this

3122
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:57,679
so these models it's just really nicely

3123
01:41:57,679 --> 01:41:58,320
placed

3124
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,400
you have the targeted versus the target

3125
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:01,520
list models

3126
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,280
so the target models you know ants on

3127
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:05,440
the ground in arizona we're doing linear

3128
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:06,320
aggressions

3129
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,560
specific falsifiable predictions and

3130
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:09,360
hypotheses

3131
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:11,840
about this ant species on the ground

3132
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:12,880
we're using that

3133
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:14,960
to abstract more general questions about

3134
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:15,920
foraging like

3135
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:18,080
hey i wonder if there's a patchy

3136
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:18,960
resource

3137
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:20,719
then the ant species will probably try

3138
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:23,040
to recruit its nest mates to take

3139
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:24,080
advantage of a

3140
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:25,920
patchy resource that might not be around

3141
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:27,360
but if it's a distributed resource

3142
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:28,560
that's not patchy

3143
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,639
then maybe the ants will forage without

3144
01:42:30,639 --> 01:42:31,679
pheromone trails

3145
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:33,840
we're going a level even above that to

3146
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:34,960
this idea of like

3147
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:39,520
generators for ideas

3148
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,639
last quote from the paper

3149
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:45,840
figuring out what the fep is and what

3150
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,520
use it holds for scientists

3151
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:50,960
is a worthwhile project in and of itself

3152
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:52,880
how we come down on the matter and what

3153
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:54,480
route we take in getting there

3154
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:56,159
and who we include and how we

3155
01:42:56,159 --> 01:42:58,080
communicate about it all these things

3156
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:59,119
and more

3157
01:42:59,119 --> 01:43:00,880
will have important implications for the

3158
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,480
philosophy of biology

3159
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,080
philosophy of cognitive science and the

3160
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:06,000
philosophy of science in general

3161
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,840
the dialogue unfolding in the literature

3162
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:10,000
on fvp raises important questions

3163
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,920
about the relationship between science

3164
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:13,440
and philosophy of science

3165
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:15,920
between theory model and data and about

3166
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:16,880
the scientific

3167
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:19,440
method and the aims of science even

3168
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,119
perhaps most especially

3169
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:23,040
about what counts a science in the first

3170
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:25,199
place taking us back to that first

3171
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:26,000
sentence

3172
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,320
in the introduction that with respect to

3173
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:29,679
the demarcation

3174
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:31,600
uh problem mel is going to defend the

3175
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:32,880
claim that the fep

3176
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:36,000
is scientific and just by reading this

3177
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:36,560
paper

3178
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:38,080
and thinking through some of these

3179
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:39,679
topics i feel like i

3180
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:41,679
learned a lot about science and about

3181
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:43,520
scientific modeling

3182
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:46,560
so closing notes this is a

3183
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:49,280
project in progress that will include

3184
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:51,600
many backgrounds and perspectives

3185
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:54,800
so let's have a participatory and an

3186
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:55,520
accessible

3187
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:57,760
conversation about active inference

3188
01:43:57,760 --> 01:43:59,679
sounds like it'd be a ton of fun

3189
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:02,560
because fep and active inference is

3190
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,920
bringing us all

3191
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:06,080
to fundamental conversations from the

3192
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:07,760
philosophy of science

3193
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:10,000
within philosophy of science but also

3194
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,080
about how science is related

3195
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:15,199
to the philosophy of science it's also

3196
01:44:15,199 --> 01:44:17,040
bringing up debates that are related to

3197
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:18,719
other fields of philosophy

3198
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:20,400
in activism consciousness

3199
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:21,760
computationalism

3200
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:25,119
semiotics autopoesis communication

3201
01:44:25,119 --> 01:44:28,880
meaning evolution time space

3202
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:31,360
all of these fun general topics are

3203
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:32,239
being brought up

3204
01:44:32,239 --> 01:44:34,239
through the work that hopefully we're

3205
01:44:34,239 --> 01:44:35,280
all participating

3206
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:38,800
in so this was an awesome paper and

3207
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:40,400
i'm really looking forward to the next

3208
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:42,159
two weeks of discussion

3209
01:44:42,159 --> 01:44:44,239
we can just throw up our general

3210
01:44:44,239 --> 01:44:45,440
questions

3211
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:48,800
what would we enable for ourself

3212
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:50,719
or for our teams if we had a good

3213
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:52,960
understanding if we understood

3214
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:56,000
what the fep was if we understood that

3215
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,119
the as marco just put in chat the math

3216
01:44:59,119 --> 01:45:01,199
is not the territory but the philosophy

3217
01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:02,719
is the landmark

3218
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:04,960
if we come to understand that what will

3219
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,560
we enable

3220
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,400
what are the unique predictions and

3221
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:10,960
implications of different understandings

3222
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:12,639
that we could have

3223
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:14,560
what are the next steps for free energy

3224
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:16,560
principle and active inference as

3225
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,320
research communities

3226
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:20,800
what are the goals of this research what

3227
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:21,520
is the goal

3228
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,920
of a philosopher of science who might be

3229
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:25,760
curious about this topic

3230
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,320
and perhaps most importantly what are

3231
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:28,880
you still

3232
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:30,480
