00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,120
welcome to the active inference live

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,040
stream it is active inference live

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,400
welcome to the active inference lab

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,800
everyone we are an experiment in

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,119
online team communication learning and

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,560
practice related to

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,800
active inference i'm going to share my

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,479
screen for

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,120

live streams

27
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,079
we'll mute if there's noise in our

28
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,159
background raise our hands so that we

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,519
can hear from everybody who wants to

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,000
share

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,640
and use respectful speech behavior so

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,760
for the active inference

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,080
live streams in 2021 we're going to be

34
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,200
having these regular

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,400
tuesday 7 a.m pacific times and then

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,840
we're also going to be having these

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,080
special sessions like the model stream

38
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,680
and several other kinds of events that

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,360
we're really excited to be planning

40
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,640
and go to this big red link and you'll

41
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,759
find a spreadsheet

42
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,520
and in that spreadsheet you'll find the

43
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,119
details on past

44
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,119
and present and upcoming active

45
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,400
inference live streams

46
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,600
here we are in 14.1 discussing the math

47
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,439
is not the territory with author mel

48
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,320
andrews

49
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,920
next week we're going to be discussing

50
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,920
the same paper for a follow-up paper

51
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,360
and then we're moving on to a different

52
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,600
paper but for this week and for next

53
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,880
week we're going to be in

54
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,880
this awesome paper and this awesome

55
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,560
group of discussions

56
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,280
today in active stream 14 we're going to

57
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,680
have

58
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,320
introductions and warm-ups then in the

59
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,840
sections of 14.1

60
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,960
we're going to be going through the

61
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,119
paper the math is not the territory

62
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,280
navigating the free energy principle by

63
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,840
mel andrews in october

64
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,000
and we have some slides with aims and

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,878
claims

66
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,920
abstract roadmap etc but this is pretty

67
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,680
much going to be whatever people want to

68
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,879
discuss today

69
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,239
and whatever questions we want to

70
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,959
address in next week as well

71
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,360
so if you have any questions just save

72
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
them and submit them

73
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,959
however you can and get in touch if you

74
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:27,840
want to join

75
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,360
live okay awesome so

76
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,680
let's start with the introductions and

77
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,840
we'll just give a short introduction or

78
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,840
check in and then pass to somebody who

79
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,120
hasn't spoken yet

80
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,959
and especially if it's your first time

81
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,239
we would love to hear

82
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,280
what your background or interest in

83
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,319
active inference is so i'm daniel

84
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,239
i'm a postdoctoral researcher in

85
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,519
california

86
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,160
and i will pass first to mel

87
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,000
hi there i'm mel andrews and

88
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,720
uh i think for better for worse my uh

89
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,319
doctoral work is going to end up being

90
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,000
largely about the free energy principle

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,319
and

92
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,519
active inference so

93
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,280
that's why i'm here cool pass it to

94
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,319
somebody who

95
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,839
can then introduce them

96
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,239
hi there thank you mel um hi my name is

97
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,400
marco uh i'm from holland

98
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,560
my background's in psychology and

99
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,760
concrete neuroscience

100
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,280
and german masters also worked a bit on

101
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,040
its independence

102
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,120
and my interest in active inference is

103
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,480
um

104
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,239
well a multitude of things i just i just

105
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,480
believe that it really has a potential

106
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,120
uh as alluded to and written about by

107
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,599
male

108
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,560
uh in the paper which doesn't today uh

109
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,000
in general just a lot of potential to

110
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,760
understand a lot of aspects of the world

111
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,040
in society that

112
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,480
we sovereign haven't been able to really

113
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,480
grasp with alternative minds

114
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,439
so happy to be here

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,120

russia

118
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,840
i'm a researcher in system

119
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,599
school i'm

120
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,799

121
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,360
pass it to

122
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,600
hey guys i'm shannon

123
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,680
and i'm working in

124
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,919
i do brain stimulation and i'm also

125
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,280
interested in

126
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,600
social cognition and how we interact um

127
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,000
like in a musical ensemble

128
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,680
and how the free energy principle

129
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,360
applies to

130
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,639
both scales of those questions

131
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,440
and um pass it to alex

132
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,120

133
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,960
um but you don't appear muted let's go

134
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,160
to alex oh

135
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,639
now we hear you go ahead yeah hi

136
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,360

i'm alex and i'm in moscow russia

138
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,600
and i'm a researcher in systems

139
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,120
management school

140
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,400
and trying to find a way to find

141
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,600
integration between

142
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,840
active inference and system engineering

143
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,280
approaches

144
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,919
and i bless it to alex

145
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,600
okay thanks um thanks alex i'm alex

146
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,039
um i'm interested in uh i'm a

147
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,320
philosopher i guess

148
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,280
uh interested in free energy principle

149
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,960
and active inference and

150
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,960
sort of fundamental questions about

151
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,080
mental representation

152
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,280
and lately i've been more interested in

153
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,400
applied work and

154
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,080
sort of um combining eventually maybe

155
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,280
combining

156
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,720
these approaches with other approaches

157
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,080
to machine learning and so active

158
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,680
inferences like a technology

159
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,039
but um i will pass it on to um

160
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,159
let's see uh dave

161
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,440
dave you muted so we have dave and then

162
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,840
we have also then the last remaining

163
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,759
tim stephen i'm retired from information

164
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,520
technology live in the philippines

165
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,360
my background is in cybernetics and uh

166
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,800
machine translation i'm teaching myself

167
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,960
neuropsychoanalysis

168
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,240
and i was so pleased to come to mel's

169
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,280
paper because

170
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,280
i've been trying to figure out what is

171
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,120
this thing after all it's like a

172
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,880
a metaphor among metaphors among

173
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,039
metaphors and maybe

174
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,280
uh you can tell us toward the end of the

175
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,039
presentation whether that has anything

176
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,160
to do with what you've

177
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,360
what you're saying in your paper and i

178
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,440
can't even see who else is not spoken

179
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,960
uh philippe philippe there we go

180
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,639
hi i'm philip uh i'm studying

181
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,919
hero tickle biology in prague and i'm

182
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:50,960
interested in

183
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,080
computational neuroscience and i

184
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,840
joined because i only read mel's paper

185
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840
and i found it interesting but i don't

186
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,560
know anything about it

187
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,280
perfect um let's go to tim

188
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,400
i'm tim i'm in toronto canada it's my

189
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,440
first time

190
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,720
joining in the sessions

191
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,560
really eager to learn about this stuff

192
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,039
was really fascinating and my background

193
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,319
is in

194
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,800
science and engineering uh specifically

195
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,280
i guess electronic systems and software

196
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,800
and uh that kind of thing and i'll pass

197
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,840
to stephen

198
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,319
go for it stephen or fellow jitzer

199
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,680
okay and sarah have you gone

200
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,599
hi i'm uh sarah davis i'm um in berlin

201
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,400
and um right now i'm a master's student

202
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,240
in philosophy of science but before that

203
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,639
i was an artist and the through line i

204
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,280
guess that's interesting to me is um

205
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,720
the relationship between information

206
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,360
and materials and media so i'm

207
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,919
interested in like reservoir computing

208
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,479
and how how and when you can separate

209
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,680
those things and

210
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,599
you know what is life like all these

211
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,879
funny things that are circling around

212
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,720
that so active inference is just yet

213
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,479
another

214
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,800
useful thing that um i want to

215
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,160
understand better because it seems to

216
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,360
connect to a lot of other

217
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,000
disciplines

218
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,479
cool it'll be interesting to hear about

219
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,839
that soon and then i see

220
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,719
blue or yes

221
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,120
hi good morning i'm blue knight i'm an

222
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,959
independent research consultant based

223
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,200
out of new mexico

224
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,360
nice is there anyone who has not

225
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,560
introduced himself

226
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,760
otherwise we're just going to keep

227
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,760
rolling all right great so

228
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,880
let's go to our warm up questions and

229
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,440
i'll just put up the first two which are

230
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,040
what is something you're excited about

231
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,920
today

232
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,160
and what is something that you liked or

233
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,760
remembered about the paper

234
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,440
and so people can just raise their hands

235
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,600
and we'll go in order

236
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,160
and until i see a hand i think something

237
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,920
i liked or remembered about the paper

238
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,680
was that there was no figures

239
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,839
so from the point of view of usually

240
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,279
reading papers with figures that was

241
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,959
very notable but then also that there

242
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:23,760
was clarity

243
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,839
and structure despite figures which are

244
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:26,880
often used

245
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,560
as a uh not quite an aid to structure a

246
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,040
paper

247
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,640
but it's how we often think about in

248
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,240
empirical research like oh what is

249
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,360
figure one gonna show

250
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,360
but there was clarity in this article

251
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,519
without the usage of figures so marco

252
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,040
and then anyone else who wants to

253
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,200
continue

254
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,920
yeah i fully agree that that is um

255
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,040
uniquely clear

256
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,360
so um i've been kind of lacking behind

257
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,600
on on the literature but

258
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,839
for me mel's paper is the best paper so

259
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,040
far when it comes to

260
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,959
contextualizing french principle and

261
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,560
like the title implies

262
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,760
really mapping it out right

263
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,000
contextualizing in the big complicated

264
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,880
epistemic

265
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,440
landscapes that this all connects to um

266
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,360
so it's a huge props to know for that um

267
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,800
i think the only other critical piece

268
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,120
i've

269
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,959
read is from colombo which is more

270
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,160
unwieldy

271
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,519
um and i think uh the the kind of

272
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,320
importance of

273
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,240
mapping really shows in this paper

274
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,160
because it it opens up a lot of

275
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,959
directions

276
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,680
to think about the fdp which stands in

277
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,279
stark contrast to a lot of other

278
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,079
papers are read which kind of uh take it

279
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,279
as authoritative and then just

280
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,959
move on instead of uh actually

281
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,040
trying to interpret it and so mel does a

282
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,880
great job at guiding the reader

283
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,720
and understanding the nuances and the

284
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,320
questions that would arise on

285
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,959
when you see those nuances so excited to

286
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:43,600
hear about

287
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,240
people's thoughts today cool very nice

288
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:46,720
uh

289
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,079
tim and then anyone else who raises

290
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,760
their hand

291
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,720
i thought that i was i i noted to myself

292
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,079
just you know

293
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,760
as i was reading how clear the writing

294
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,279
was i thought the writing was really

295
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,959
clear

296
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,519
and and expressive and explication

297
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,880
really well ordered

298
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,600
and um and there was kind of like a i

299
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,480
guess uh

300
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,640
a humility i remember somewhere in this

301
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,160
content i saw the idea of the list of

302
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,600
epistemic values i think

303
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,680
it was you call them and humility was

304
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,120
one in the list and that kind of comes

305
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,600
through

306
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,920
in that paper the way that uh there's no

307
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,760
sort of diving for like a

308
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,440
discovery or a conclusion it's really

309
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,800
just laying it out and

310
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,839
and and giving it to you to to

311
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,360
leaving the questions open which was

312
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,040
really nice

313
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,880
yep and also lots of nice philosophy

314
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,720
type things like the idea of defending

315
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,480
an idea and so

316
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
it's not common to see in an empirical

317
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,640
paper like we're going to defend this

318
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,640
it's it's a lot more like a battlefield

319
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,240
of ideas in philosophy

320
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,839
and in science it's a little bit of a

321
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,000
different structure so sarah and then

322
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,480
anyone else

323
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,480
to like lather on the praise of like

324
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,800
uh to mel's paper but yeah the writing

325
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,000
was really good and actually when i

326
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,399
first

327
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,680
read it um i i feel like i understand a

328
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,399
lot more

329
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,160
than when i first read it and so now i

330
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,519
kind of feel like i'm happy to be here

331
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,120
because i need to read a second time

332
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,720
i've learned a lot more

333
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,560
um but yeah the x the exploration of

334
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,320
kind of the beginning of the exploration

335
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,079
of all these different models

336
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,240
it was um uh saw a lot of potential

337
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,160
cool and that's kind of part of the idea

338
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,079
with a dot one and a dot two

339
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,760
is sometimes you read the paper and you

340
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,440
don't talk to someone about it you have

341
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,279
thoughts one two three and then you have

342
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,959
a first conversation about it or you

343
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,560
listen to one video and all of a sudden

344
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:32,959
you have

345
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,560
thoughts one through ten and then you

346
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,240
have the discussion and all of a sudden

347
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,560
you're

348
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,800
you know up to 20. so that's part of the

349
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,480
idea of taking the time

350
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,519
to really read through these papers um

351
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,959
does anyone else want to add anything

352
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,639
i'll throw up the third

353
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,240
warm-up question which is what is

354
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,160
something you're wondering about

355
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,920
or would like to have resolved by the

356
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,680
end of today's discussion

357
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,200
so alex kiefer then anyone else

358
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,959
yeah so i think having this resolve by

359
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,880
the end of today is probably a tall

360
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,600
order but

361
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
i'm i'm interested in the question that

362
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,639
sort of

363
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,560
um explicitly raised it toward the end

364
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,560
of the paper about whether the fep

365
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,920
is a very abstract sort of

366
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,639
uh model of or in some sense maybe

367
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,000
representation of

368
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,040
nature or a pure formalism and like

369
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,800
that's an interesting line

370
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,680
so i think it's an interesting question

371
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,720
great question

372
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,839
sarah then marco

373
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,240
yeah i was i to me it all just seems

374
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,560
like mel fix it by the end of the hour

375
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,760
but um but i yeah i was curious to know

376
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,639
like if

377
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,560
if you have any insight into ways that

378
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,240
the model could never be applied you

379
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,440
know like just

380
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
trying to situate the model in all these

381
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,639
worlds that it

382
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,480
has potential for

383
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,680
cool any other intro thoughts there

384
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,439
uh marco and then or anyone else

385
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,399
yeah um a lot of questions for mel i

386
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,120
think but but i think what maybe

387
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,279
i hope so uh possible to to resolve by

388
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,360
the end of this stream is

389
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,199
um there's only a very brief note about

390
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,720
it but but you also said that it's also

391
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,399
compatible with processionism something

392
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,680
about possessions i mean they

393
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,000
i didn't see anything else about it so

394
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,680
i'm not a philosopher so natural kinds

395
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,639
for me always

396
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,079
was a bit a weird iffy concept for me um

397
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,000
but i was wondering if you could resolve

398
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,519
maybe um

399
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,440
the problems of mapping it to natural

400
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,720
kinds of stuff but

401
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,480
for professionalism because it seems

402
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,240
that activation is much more

403
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,639
sexualist kind of framework not really

404
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,160
compatible with the

405
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,800
essentials objects properties framework

406
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,760
of

407
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,279
ontology um so yeah i'll leave it at

408
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:41,920
that

409
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,920
cool let's definitely return to that and

410
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,519
define it and

411
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,680
get clarity on it shannon than anyone

412
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,279
else

413
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,040
hey yeah so i'm really interested in

414
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,279
what role the free energy principle or

415
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,560
active inference

416
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,600
plays in empirical

417
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,800
hypothesis testing um and

418
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,240
i think this paper did a really good job

419
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,680
of explaining that the mathematical

420
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,720
models can be

421
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,480
very useful to generate

422
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,839
questions to generate hypotheses or

423
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,680
just to further investigate some

424
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,000
empirical phenomenon

425
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,199
and i think it would be good this week

426
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,440
and next week to just sort of talk about

427
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,360
what it means when you say i have a free

428
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,839
energy principle characterization of

429
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,959
system very nice

430
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,320
agreed and um yes we have several

431
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,199
fun hours of discussion ahead so i'm

432
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,320
just going to

433
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,360
flip to this summary slide and ask

434
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,800
mel when you're conveying this work to

435
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,720
different audiences how do you

436
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,000
communicate it or what would you like to

437
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,720
start with just how do you give your 30

438
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,680
000 foot

439
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,320
overview perhaps to different audiences

440
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,040
or perspective

441
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,480
yourself in the past yourself in the

442
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,759
future however you want to do it

443
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,160
yeah i guess i saw a lot of um

444
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,560
confusion about what the fep was and

445
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,639
what it was doing um and it was

446
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,560
my before i could really uh

447
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,360
play with it i had to um i had to get

448
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,320
clear

449
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,560
on what it was and and make everyone

450
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,320
else clear on what it was

451
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,519
um and and so i

452
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,959
i tried to tackle kind of like the most

453
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,759
fundamental questions in this paper

454
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,360
about what it is that the ftp is and

455
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,480
what it's doing

456
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,680
um and in some ways

457
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,320
in some ways i think a lot of those

458
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:48,959
remain

459
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,560
kind of unanswered by this paper

460
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,639
but but no longer unexplored like i i i

461
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,519
i put it all out on paper so you know so

462
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,600
we can talk about it now whereas before

463
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,199
there are these things you know like is

464
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,760
the fep

465
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,359
science science like is this a

466
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,839
scientific model or scientific theory

467
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,640
or is it you know that the demarcus like

468
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,480
does it does it not belong to the demand

469
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,520
of science

470
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,919
um that that was a big one and no one

471
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:18,640
had asked that

472
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,360
um and then uh

473
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,000
well alex's question that's what you

474
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,359
know and and i didn't come

475
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,919
i i i sort of write the first sentence

476
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:30,400
right

477
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,480
is saying i think it's the main explains

478
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,760
but then i'm gonna i'm i'm

479
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,760
i'm writing a paper with an as a photo

480
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,200
um

481
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,840
where we're gonna come down kind of

482
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,960
differently on that

483
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,320
on the i mean you know it's not written

484
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,160
it's not 100 written yet we're not true

485
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,760
but but we come

486
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,720
down a little differently on the

487
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,600
demonstration problem and then um

488
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,120
uh in terms of alex's question

489
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,360
that was that was one of my main driving

490
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,320
questions the notion of

491
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,120
as if is the fpp like a really abstract

492
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,559
representation of natural systems

493
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,000
central processes

494
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,200
or is it not a representation of

495
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,120
anything in nature at all

496
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,919
and that to me is like totally not

497
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:12,960
answered yet

498
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,600
um and there's some there's almost like

499
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,000
a queen

500
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,160
like that that's almost to me it's like

501
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,679
getting to the heart of like

502
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,679
naturalism as a as an approach in

503
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,280
philosophy like

504
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,600
like uh carl's carl friston's line

505
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,039
this whole time has been well there's a

506
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,960
dissolving line

507
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,080
between just math and

508
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,240
and physics proper um

509
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,120
and that drives me crazy but uh

510
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,039
but i'm coming around to a little bit

511
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,559
that wasn't a good summary of my paper

512
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,160
that was a good summary of

513
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,640
of what i'm excited about exploring

514
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,400
further

515
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,039
fun yep well just a few things in there

516
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:01,760
that

517
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,480
might fly above or below those who have

518
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,039
different

519
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,280
um you know listening regimes of

520
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,160
attention

521
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
you said before i could play with it i

522
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,480
had to be clear on it and also help

523
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,600
other people be clear

524
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,520
so that just captured this learn by

525
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,200
doing learn by playing

526
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,520
and also learn by serving and teaching

527
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,960
because those are some of the key

528
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,520
pieces and without being playful and

529
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,039
understanding that it's a deep well

530
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,039
to dive into and then also that there's

531
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,120
a community that is also curious those

532
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,919
are some of the key

533
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,640
aspects and then also it almost goes

534
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,240
without saying that this is a really

535
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,400
exciting philosophy paper and it's an

536
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,320
ongoing philosophical question

537
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
so people are maybe familiar with a

538
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,080
measurement is made on a protein or a

539
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,320
new species is found in some forest

540
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,240
and it gets nature science and people

541
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,919
are really excited about a measurement

542
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,520
that's made about nature

543
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,679
and then the philosophical questions

544
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,520
potentially because they're fundamental

545
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,480
or there's no simple sound bite answer

546
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,919
or there's no figure there's no

547
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,440
graphical abstract you got to read the

548
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,520
prose or got to think through it

549
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,360
the philosophical questions are often

550
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,280
seen as not contemporary

551
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,159
or not exciting or not cutting edge but

552
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,360
we're seeing

553
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,600
in real time with free energy principle

554
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,799
and active inference

555
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,720
the way that maybe we could even call

556
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,880
them top-down philosophical priors

557
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,159
on what the fep is are shaping

558
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,159
the realization of what emerges from the

559
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,280
bottom up

560
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,000
for example if it's really from on high

561
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,919
and fep is part of science and it's part

562
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:28,960
of a scientific

563
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,720
program that's going to be very

564
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
different several years down the line

565
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,480
than if people said this should be

566
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,320
thrown over there with the fiction books

567
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:36,559
and

568
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,400
you know with the biography of somebody

569
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,559
else so it's pretty interesting just how

570
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:40,880
these

571
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,440
top-down and bottom-up ideas are playing

572
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,080
out

573
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,200
in the discussion about what this

574
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,559
framework is

575
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,679
so pretty interesting and anyone can

576
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,000
raise their hand or give a thought or a

577
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,200
question the other

578
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,120
piece i just wrote down until anyone

579
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,760
raises their hand was this

580
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,679
unanswered but not unexplored which is

581
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,320
taking us back to the map metaphor and

582
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,080
it's the math is not the territory of

583
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,480
course

584
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,559
a little bit of a pun on the map is not

585
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,159
the territory

586
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,240
and what is the map what is the

587
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,520
territory

588
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,919
and where are their dragons where do we

589
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,760
have just the coastline but not know

590
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,440
what's on the interior

591
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,960
or where are the underlying features of

592
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,919
the world

593
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,840
stable or changing and then where's our

594
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,360
map stable or changing

595
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,080
in an attempt to understand and just

596
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,760
like the navigation there's probably

597
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,520
pure navigators out there but also

598
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,480
there's those who want to

599
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,720
move cargo so how are we going to get it

600
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,080
done with this map

601
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,640
and this territory so we'll go to alex

602
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,200
kiefer

603
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,240
sarah then mel

604
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,960
um yeah so i guess i'm just following up

605
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,440
from some of what mel just said um

606
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,760
um so so i don't want to take this too

607
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,960
far in the direction i'm thinking about

608
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,320
because it's it's pretty

609
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,720
general so so i to me this this paper

610
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,559
raises questions that are

611
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,880
uh fundamental like whether or not

612
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,320
you're interested in the fep

613
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,600
and then it's it's partly a matter of

614
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,039
seeing how these two things fit together

615
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:07,760
but like

616
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,159
so mel mentioned quine so one problem

617
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,440
that i've always had with the

618
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,960
with the line that the fep is not

619
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,039
falsifiable or that it's like

620
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,720
distinct and kind from active inference

621
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,960
as a process theory is just

622
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,240
like i guess confirmation holism so

623
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,600
uh so i just assume that um if this fep

624
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,960
thing is informing our empirical

625
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,840
theories at all

626
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,320
then there must be some semantic logical

627
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,000
connections of some kind between

628
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,880
the empirical theories and the fep so um

629
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,440
and if

630
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,039
you're if you're a confirmation holist

631
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,880
do you think that you know

632
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,080
sensory evidence uh what we observe kind

633
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,320
of

634
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,400
back propagates if you will to like all

635
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,840
of the beliefs in our network

636
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,200
then i think the fep should be

637
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,799
vulnerable to that but again that's not

638
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:49,919
really about the fep

639
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,760
so um i just want to sort of raise that

640
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,520
issue more explicitly and

641
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,559
um i don't know cool well just before we

642
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,000
go to sarah could you just define a

643
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,799
little bit

644
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,200
better what is the confirmation holism

645
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,400
oh yeah

646
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,760
who who would think differently on this

647
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,280
issue and what would be the implications

648
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,559
for active inference

649
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,080
well so i don't i don't know what people

650
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,000
think about this issue these days um

651
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,240
actually i'm just this is sort of like a

652
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,080
i guess it's attributed to quine and

653
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,280
do do him i'm sorry if i'm

654
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,600
mispronouncing his name um but the idea

655
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,640
is just that you

656
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,919
that sort of scientific theory um does

657
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,760
it like it meets sensory evidence as a

658
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,200
corporate body so like

659
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,640
the idea is that if you observe

660
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,960
something that's in conflict with your

661
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,159
total theory

662
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,760
there's no uh

663
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,919
i don't know way a priori of telling

664
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,760
which of the claims in your theory you

665
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,679
need to revise

666
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,400
right so like if there's i mean you

667
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:42,960
could

668
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,400
you could for example you could say well

669
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,320
there must have been an error there must

670
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,679
have been a malfunction in the measuring

671
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:48,240
device

672
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,600
and so you could you could revise that

673
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,679
part of your theory or you could say no

674
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:52,400
this really does

675
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,279
falsify my more fundamental assumptions

676
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,640
and so

677
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,159
that's kind of what i'm getting at and

678
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,640
i'm not sure uh if people hold

679
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,240
of the alternative view these days that

680
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,080
like no there are certain

681
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,360
statements that are meaningful but

682
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,440
immune to falsification

683
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,640
but that's the kind of question i'm

684
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,559
raising excellent uh

685
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,760
sarah mel marco

686
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,760
i think actually just to not overwhelm

687
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,120
mel my

688
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,400
question could fit in anywhere i'd

689
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,240
rather just give mel a chance to

690
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,080
yep let's let's go back to mel then

691
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,480
sarah

692
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,559
yeah the the web of belief thing yeah

693
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,480
the the do him applying hypothesis is

694
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,919
this idea that that we've got an

695
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,559
integrated web of beliefs and you can't

696
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,559
test any atomic proposition in isolation

697
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,400
from you can't you can't protect

698
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,320
anything in your web of beliefs

699
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,360
from from revision with by by new

700
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:43,840
evidence

701
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,559
which i think it's almost like very uh

702
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,600
compatible with

703
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,159
with this kind of asian frame view right

704
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:50,640
there

705
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,159
you get this you get this spreading its

706
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,120
propagation

707
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,679
of of evidence through the network all

708
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:58,880
the way up and down

709
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,000
um i like that idea

710
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,120
but um what did i want to

711
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,559
respond to oh yeah someone said

712
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,840
someone said active interest is a

713
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,760
process theory and i just want to like

714
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,520
set the record straight on that um uh

715
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,880
the the reviewer one on my magazine i

716
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,480
just i just got reviews back on this

717
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,799
um it's not published yet i just got

718
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:23,600
reviews back

719
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,640
and they pointed out that um it it's

720
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,320
probably misleading to refer to accident

721
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,919
prince of the process theory

722
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,679
there have been process theories

723
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,159
on the basis of active inference and

724
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,000
variational message passing

725
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,039
developed so when you see the like the

726
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,039
there's a paper fristen schwab uh

727
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,120
rivoli joe

728
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,000
sulo is on their um 2017 it's called

729
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,360
active influence across the street

730
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,840
that's that is a process theory that is

731
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,679
made from active inference that's

732
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,120
that's set in um variational message

733
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,919
passing

734
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,559
but active inference itself is not a

735
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,000
process through so much as the corollary

736
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,799
of the fep

737
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,520
applies to to to activity in an

738
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,159
environment

739
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,320
and then processes of that have been

740
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,360
made so i

741
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,679
i should probably i'm going to go back

742
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:16,880
in and like be more

743
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,559
careful with the words i use

744
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,840
cool marco then i'll go ahead

745
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
yeah um i'm not sure if you met me with

746
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,480
their process theory but but i i i

747
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,799
intentionally also avoided the phrase

748
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,159
process theory because i think it's

749
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,679
what i was trying to say with that

750
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,679
comment earlier is

751
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,360
a lot of the treatments of natural kinds

752
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,279
and mapping to real states or affairs of

753
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:41,919
the world

754
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,679
seems to me more grounded in a more

755
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,760
object property oriented

756
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,120
philosophy pathology right but for me

757
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,200
it sounds more that's the the

758
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,240
ontological

759
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,919
uh assumptions or commitments in

760
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,679
processionalism are far more

761
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,240
compatible with active inference which i

762
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,080
wanted to address it later i'm not sure

763
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,120
now it's very time but but um

764
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,559
uh there's this issue of not demarcation

765
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:06,960
for

766
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,159
is fap ai scientific but also

767
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,320
demarcation of markov blankets right so

768
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,679
as you pointed out rightly

769
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,520
there's this dilemma of you know where

770
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,120
do you put the threshold for

771
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,960
where the boundary of the marked blanket

772
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,720
is but for me that fuzziness

773
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,640
is not an issue if you would be more

774
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,399
professionalist because then the claim

775
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,480
with the necessity would be more there

776
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,679
is a boundary

777
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,919
but that we cannot affirm or confirm

778
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,120
where it exactly is

779
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,039
what the you know perfect absolute

780
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,200
stressful is it's not an issue itself

781
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,360
simply that there is heterogeneity there

782
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,200
is certain

783
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,440
boundarying of states would be

784
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,720
sufficient i think

785
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,960
because the procession or dynamic nature

786
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,399
of these systems

787
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,399
uh would mean that you can't say there's

788
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,159
a static on simply that there are

789
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,279
boundaries between

790
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,679
subsystems but but that was not my

791
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:54,640
question my

792
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,120
comments um for now was basically one

793
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,480
thing i i

794
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,960
think is also interesting is um seeing

795
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,799
fpai as simply a language

796
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,720
so there's the canonical kind of typical

797
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,799
notion of math is a language a physics

798
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,480
it's a discipline in which

799
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,360
that's written in in maths and i i kind

800
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:11,679
of

801
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,159
feel that this is the same here so

802
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,840
daniel gives very beautiful metaphors of

803
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,520
navigation and mapping

804
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,480
and to me it seems that uh this whole

805
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,520
project

806
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,480
and not just theory but the whole

807
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,960
project of p and active inference

808
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,960
is more of a vehicle of toolkits of

809
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,720
languages and allows you to translate

810
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,399
back and forth in disciplines

811
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,559
translate into mathematical abstraction

812
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,480
and as you explore in the mathematical

813
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,279
abstract world

814
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,240
you can translate back so it's like if

815
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,760
you can't see the patterns in empirical

816
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,480
data

817
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,399
translate back to abstraction find

818
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,520
patterns there

819
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,200
um see if you can translate them back

820
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,480
and then you can test them and so it's

821
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,440
like the

822
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,520
scientific narrative with a detour but

823
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,360
um yeah i don't know if you find it

824
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,880
interesting would love to discuss that

825
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,440
more later

826
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,840
but yeah yeah that it is interesting and

827
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,159
uh also the navigation brings us back to

828
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,120
cybernetics and the the word cybernetics

829
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,840
comes from

830
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,720
navigation and so it's almost like if

831
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,720
you can't navigate on the water

832
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,120
surface and then you go you abstract

833
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,760
beyond

834
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,600
some sort of limitation and so it's kind

835
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,120
of funny because the mapping metaphor

836
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,440
again

837
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,200
it is a physical one it's related to

838
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,880
cybernetics but then also there's this

839
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,760
idea of a map

840
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,520
in mathematics and a mapping is a

841
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,919
function and so there's this abstraction

842
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,279
abstraction mapping and then there's

843
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:23,919
also

844
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,159
that as a map onto the physical world

845
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,240
because we're embodied agents

846
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,679
so if mel or anyone else wants to

847
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:32,880
raise their hand otherwise i think

848
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,200
there's a few other threads to highlight

849
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,039
there go ahead mel

850
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,760
yeah i just want to flag something marco

851
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,039
said quickly um

852
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,720
the markup blanket isn't actually all

853
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,559
that it's not actually

854
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,480
as a boundary the markup link is not

855
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,640
actually all that diffuse and dynamical

856
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,360
it's actually

857
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,679
it's actually harnessed to like

858
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,279
particular

859
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:57,520
particles and you know in a sim so

860
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,600
we think when we think about you know

861
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,760
the boundaries of an organism

862
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,320
or the boundaries of a cell wall or

863
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,440
something right

864
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,559
you're constantly you are dispersing the

865
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,000
cell is dispersing right

866
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,440
the material of which the

867
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,559
cell the organ the tissue the human

868
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:17,039
being

869
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,600
the society is made up right these are

870
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,320
these are

871
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,360
these are diffuse and they are

872
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,840
dissipating they're the material there's

873
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,360
a constant turnover in

874
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,880
like the material composition of these

875
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,559
things right

876
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,480
um and and the markov blanket doesn't

877
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,240
handle that right now right the markov

878
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,320
blanket is ropes to particular

879
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,600
particles so to speak in

880
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,880
in your system so it's um

881
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,520
there there's a there's a a kind of a

882
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,080
desire

883
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,440
in um in the original like burkhoff

884
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,520
stuff on dynamical systems um you get

885
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,559
you get uh 1927 first off 1927 you get

886
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,760
um

887
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,200
he kind of proposes a notion of

888
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,880
wandering sets

889
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,120
and um there's kind of a desire

890
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,919
carl has a desire to extend the markup

891
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,440
blanket

892
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,080
so as it so to be able to accommodate

893
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,000
wandering sets

894
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,159
where where there is a turn right that

895
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,200
where the

896
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,000
the material makeup goes away and yet

897
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,360
the boundary persists

898
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,559
right you get turnover but um it doesn't

899
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,840
do that yet so it's actually

900
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,200
it's actually it's not nearly as like

901
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,440
dynamical as as you'd want it to be i

902
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,559
think

903
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,000
the the wandering sets and the

904
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,840
attracting sets it kind of reminds me

905
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,600
again with a navigation metaphor

906
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,519
the attracting set could be like there's

907
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,360
like a whirlpool and all the boats

908
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,960
around it are kind of being drawn into

909
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,840
this attracting

910
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,760
set if they move away then they're drawn

911
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,360
back in and then

912
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,159
the wandering set is like a flotilla of

913
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,279
ships maybe some are

914
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,720
joining and some are leaving but they're

915
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,320
maintaining a coherence

916
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,799
as they dynamically are moving through

917
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:57,440
the ocean

918
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,679
or as their subunits are changing

919
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,200
because there's this dissipation

920
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,200
that was brought up and then the living

921
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,519
systems that are far from equilibrium

922
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,519
are the ones that are apparently

923
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,559
successfully

924
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,519
resisting that dissolution and so what

925
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:12,159
is it

926
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,240
that those living systems are doing and

927
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,519
that's the what is life

928
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,799
question that's schrodinger 1944

929
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,159
to maxwell 2018 that pipeline so it's

930
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,120
it's really

931
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,360
interesting questions marco then any

932
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,080
other raised hands

933
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,679
thanks uh and um thanks for the

934
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,679
clarification um maybe i'm

935
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,360
misunderstanding something but

936
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,320
um so so i guess for me maybe it's my my

937
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:36,960
personal

938
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,880
interpretation of it all but for me the

939
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,640
primacy is actually less about

940
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,519
the formalism as for example the pro and

941
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,480
originally uh

942
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,799
formulated as but what for me is

943
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:47,600
interesting is more

944
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,279
the conceptual interpretation of there's

945
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,880
an intermediating

946
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,480
kind of interface right there's a

947
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,000
unidirectional flow

948
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,120
um that's that's in its dynamics

949
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,399
allow for this protection of states that

950
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:01,200
shouldn't

951
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,360
go beyond certain uh boundary for

952
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,480
example

953
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,279
um and in that sense it oh wait and one

954
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,240
more thing is that

955
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,720
maybe that which is to be bounded or

956
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,679
protected

957
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,279
doesn't have to be a particular state as

958
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,039
such maybe it's like a relation

959
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,880
for example you're protecting the

960
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,200
property of certain nodes of certain

961
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,880
states or certain densities

962
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,880
that they are adaptively viable for

963
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,240
other systems that they might be in

964
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,440
relation with

965
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,279
um but but i think in general i think

966
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,960
what this all shows is that

967
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,720
there's a lot of freedom at least in my

968
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,039
opinion to interpret the picture that

969
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,120
follows from ffp ai

970
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,679
i'm still kind of unclear why it's not

971
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:38,320
dynamic

972
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,039
because the mathematical nodes can be

973
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,159
variably mapped

974
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,760
to physical nodes in my opinion because

975
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,559
i'm not sure what you mean with

976
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,679
particles right so

977
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,679
it's something like we we do the

978
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,200
boundary centers of particles but more

979
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,640
in terms of

980
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,120
sensory states or or or that through

981
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,080
which

982
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,360
um the activation inference is mediated

983
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,200
um but yeah that's my but i would love

984
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,559
to hear more about

985
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,480
you brothers cool if anyone else

986
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,399
raises their hand i would just kind of

987
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,480
almost take stock there's a few

988
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,639
threads happening here there's some

989
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,000
philosophy of science

990
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,239
questions what is a principle what is a

991
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,879
theory what is falsification

992
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,960
all these types of questions were um

993
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,719
brought up from the more philosophical

994
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,280
side of the literature and then there's

995
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,480
this

996
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,599
a little bit related discussion about

997
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,239
markov blankets dynamical systems the

998
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,199
definition

999
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,879
of empirical measurements and how

1000
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,480
cleanly we sort them into

1001
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,199
these different types of uh natural

1002
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,239
kinds if we want to use the

1003
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,280
philosophical

1004
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,320
word or maybe just a functional whole to

1005
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,280
be less

1006
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,599
essentialist about it there's a few

1007
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,639
different threads

1008
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,719
happening here so it's just good to keep

1009
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,679
track of these

1010
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,800
pieces and uh yeah if uh steven i saw

1011
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,520
your

1012
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,239
hand raised or anyone else yeah hi

1013
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:56,639
thanks

1014
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,960
um i suppose one thing that i've been

1015
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,480
quite interested in

1016
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,920
is dimensionality in the sense that

1017
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,960
entropy is a dimensionless sort of

1018
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,599
property

1019
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,280
so you get this interesting question

1020
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,160
that so the free energy principle

1021
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,000
in a way is mostly dimensionless or

1022
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,480
it's like some sort of trend and then

1023
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,440
when

1024
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,359
that comes into active inference it

1025
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,839
doesn't get fully dimensionalized

1026
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,640
well it doesn't it's like lots of

1027
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,119
different active influence processes

1028
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,440
each one can contribute to

1029
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,119
dimensionalities like multi sort of

1030
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,720
threads

1031
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,400
the actual signal unlike when you

1032
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,960
mention like say in cybernetics where

1033
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,160
you have something that is guiding you

1034
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,520
the signal itself doesn't have

1035
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,880
you know as we say the signal doesn't

1036
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,599
contain per se the data

1037
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,480
particularly the entropic noise it's

1038
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,760
through inference

1039
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,119
of the dynamics within

1040
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,160
the noise that the generative model can

1041
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,760
sort of

1042
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,880
then process that and so it sort of

1043
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,240
raises this question about

1044
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,079
you know when things go from one level

1045
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,720
to another

1046
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,520
blankets in these states um

1047
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,800
is that transference between states also

1048
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,079
dimensionless

1049
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,040
in that sense or you know where did

1050
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,880
dimensions start to come in as we go up

1051
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,160
the blankets or

1052
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,839
maybe as things get aggregated

1053
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,800
interesting question and that reminds me

1054
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,400
of some other questions that have been

1055
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,160
raised about the dimensionality

1056
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,359
of active inference like is each sensory

1057
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,040
modality

1058
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,280
enshrouded in its own blanket or is it

1059
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,680
sort of a tuple that gets passed across

1060
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,480
a single

1061
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,400
organismal blanket that represents

1062
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
multiple sensory

1063
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,079
possibilities so interesting

1064
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,920
questions anyone else want to raise

1065
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,200
their hand or we can just

1066
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,920
start to slowly walk through the paper

1067
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,960
and just

1068
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,119
any thoughts that people have will raise

1069
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,599
them

1070
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,640
so we checked out the abstract

1071
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,359
in the dot zero video here's the road

1072
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:15,920
map

1073
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,560
so this is a pretty thorough road map

1074
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,680
because we can see

1075
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,440
a lot of the sections and a lot of the

1076
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,520
terms that come into play

1077
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,960
so mel i have a question what

1078
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,960
was your intention with writing it you

1079
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,480
said that you wanted to clarify it and

1080
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,920
learn as well

1081
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,480
how did that translate into this

1082
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,359
structure

1083
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,160
and then maybe where are you headed you

1084
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:38,560
know

1085
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,800
off this road map this was one journey

1086
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,000
what is your next

1087
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,040
journey yeah

1088
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,560
so a friend brought my attention to um

1089
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,400
to the free energy principle and i think

1090
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,280
fall of

1091
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,760
2017 which would have been like my

1092
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,560
penultimate

1093
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,680
semester in undergrad and i was taking a

1094
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,400
course on like mathematical psychology

1095
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:02,839
so

1096
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,400
um uh if if you

1097
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,000
one of my references is right so the

1098
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,079
reference to this normative model

1099
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,079
this normative versus descriptive

1100
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,320
process versus

1101
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,400
right that that that reference is argon

1102
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,440
can

1103
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,920
minus 95 which is um he's he's one of

1104
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,320
the primary figures in in maths like

1105
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,560
so a lot of cognitive science you know

1106
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,400
has had subsumed

1107
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,960
math like but but the idea of like

1108
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,560
having these formal mathematical models

1109
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,320
of um

1110
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,000
of cognition so that's that's what i was

1111
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,839
immersed in so so i

1112
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,599
i was uh that's what i was thinking

1113
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,240
about most at that time so like oh a new

1114
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:40,880
you know

1115
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,560
a new mathematical model of psychology

1116
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,400
perfect um

1117
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,720
and i i i was very skeptical at first

1118
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,680
and i dove in

1119
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,720
and i um it

1120
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,960
it brought me under it was really

1121
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,480
there's a lot there

1122
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,520
and um and i really struggled

1123
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,599
so at first i really wanted to do that

1124
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,200
too like you know it was immediately

1125
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,640
apparent to me that there's this big

1126
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,920
complicated thing that

1127
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,599
that very few people understand and

1128
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,440
there's a lot of widespread

1129
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,880
misunderstanding of what it is and what

1130
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,800
it's doing so i tried to do that at

1131
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,560
first and i came up with like a little

1132
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,680
uh a little like dossier on on like the

1133
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,960
basics of the ftp

1134
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,040
in like some of its early formulations

1135
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,160
as an undergrad

1136
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,200
um and i put that up and

1137
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,160
but it it didn't solve kind of a lot of

1138
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,000
the bigger

1139
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,880
uh i guess like philosophy of science

1140
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,400
questions about what it is and what it's

1141
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,200
doing

1142
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,400
um so i this is like a second stab

1143
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,920
at that and and from here

1144
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,320
um i i so i was thinking of the fpp

1145
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,160
one one way it's helped me to think

1146
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
about it is is as a model

1147
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,200
and i don't i

1148
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,598
i guess i don't view um

1149
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,319
models as strict

1150
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,240
natural kinds or like strips the

1151
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,440
scientific kinds

1152
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,880
i don't i don't think that there's like

1153
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,119
a a list of necessarily sufficient

1154
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,119
conditions for being a model or like an

1155
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:13,680
essence

1156
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,400
to being a model and the fep is either

1157
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:16,800
you know

1158
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,720
definitively a model or not i think i

1159
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,960
think it's helped me quite a lot

1160
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,520
to think of the ftp as a model it's it's

1161
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,480
uh

1162
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,319
reduced my prediction error if you will

1163
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,400
so think of it as a as a very abstract

1164
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,240
formal generic target list model um

1165
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,560
but but you know and i think in a lot of

1166
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,319
ways thinking of it as a modeling

1167
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,880
language or a modeling framework

1168
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,880
is also really fruitful i think that's

1169
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,480
important there's not

1170
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,319
there's not a philosophy of science

1171
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,839
literature on modeling frameworks or

1172
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,440
modeling languages right

1173
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,400
um but but i think that's it it's

1174
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,480
probably more of a modeling framework or

1175
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,000
modeling language than it is

1176
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,160
a model per se um and and next so i i'm

1177
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,480
i'm next i'm going to try to work on a

1178
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,640
paper with um

1179
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,480
within us kind of exploring what it is

1180
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,680
to be a principal

1181
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,599
right like what's the principle because

1182
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,359
there there isn't a philosophy

1183
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,680
to run on principles really right what

1184
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,800
is the principle

1185
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,920
um that's next i also

1186
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,119
um there's been a lot of comparison of

1187
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:21,920
the fpp

1188
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,319
to to natural selection to darwin's

1189
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:25,920
theory of natural selection

1190
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,520
and um when you ask people about that

1191
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,079
and this is this is sort of the the the

1192
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:32,560
core

1193
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,760
like pro fep the core like

1194
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,599
we're working on the fpp camp um

1195
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,400
often draws that comparison and i think

1196
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,599
that this

1197
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,280
so so what they mean to be doing there

1198
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,440
is saying well it's not directly

1199
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,640
falsifiable

1200
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,800
to alex's point i think i think

1201
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,800
everything is sort of falsifiable every

1202
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,720
everything in science is falsifiable in

1203
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,000
so much as it's

1204
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
if it if it doesn't get traction it

1205
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,520
falls out of use if it's not useful

1206
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,319
then we don't use it right and then it

1207
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:04,960
it

1208
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,640
ceases to be kind of part of our

1209
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,000
collective consciousness as

1210
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,720
as researchers and i think that if if

1211
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,319
the fep fails to be useful

1212
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,400
you know it falls by the wayside that's

1213
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,440
that's

1214
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,359
gets confined to dustbins of history um

1215
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,280
so so there is that in that sense i

1216
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,560
think there definitely is that kind of

1217
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,440
like

1218
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,480
confirmation holism there right um

1219
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,599
if it fails to produce useful lower

1220
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,200
order theories than it

1221
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,440
it it's all that of use um

1222
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,680
so so i think that that in in trying to

1223
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,119
draw a comparison between

1224
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,400
natural selection and free energy

1225
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,160
principle people want to say

1226
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,000
well the fep like natural selection is

1227
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,400
not

1228
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,680
directly falsifiable

1229
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,200
um in the way that natural selection

1230
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,359
isn't directly falsifiable

1231
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:57,040
and it's um it's also

1232
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,560
supremely useful um it has this

1233
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,520
widespread kind of both empirical use

1234
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:03,920
and

1235
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,400
and you know grand explanatory power

1236
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,760
and i think that this is sort of

1237
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,000
ultimately conflating multiple

1238
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,960
notions of natural segments so multiple

1239
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,880
kind of discrete formulations of natural

1240
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,680
selection

1241
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,599
one of these due to popper and one of

1242
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:20,720
these

1243
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,920
one of them sort of due to to darwin and

1244
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,000
then it gets formulated in like lewinton

1245
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,680
and got christmas and stuff like that um

1246
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,960
and one of them that safely do the

1247
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,440
proper

1248
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,440
which popular later kind of recounts as

1249
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,440
a as a mistake it's an error news i'm

1250
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,160
thinking

1251
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,880
um so i want to do that and i i also

1252
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,720
think there's kind of a metamark

1253
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,040
because i've been working on models and

1254
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,880
um

1255
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,280
reification in models so so when we

1256
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,800
what's happening with the ftp we can

1257
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,480
think of as reification conceptual

1258
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,079
reflication or pernicious relocation

1259
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,440
where

1260
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,720
you get uh confusing the map

1261
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,839
for the territory basically perfect

1262
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,359
thanks for that response and also

1263
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,440
welcome uh scott

1264
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,319
we will go to alex kiefer then marco

1265
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,800
then tim

1266
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,160
okay um so i guess

1267
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,079
there are a number of things that i want

1268
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,000
to say um so

1269
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,040
as far as okay right so i think what mel

1270
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,319
just brought up

1271
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,920
um reminded me that there's a

1272
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,280
there's a um one way of of i guess i've

1273
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,640
discussed this with mel and others so

1274
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,119
i'm

1275
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,079
um apologies if this isn't in the paper

1276
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,000
i'm not quite sure i need to look at it

1277
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,599
again but basically one way in which

1278
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:40,640
this thing

1279
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,960
could fail to be falsifiable is if it's

1280
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,040
not so much a claim as like a

1281
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,079
an approach or like a a sort of

1282
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,599
stance that leads you to make certain

1283
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,200
claims so like

1284
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,599
um so to put that in a if you wanted to

1285
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:54,880
put a negative light on that you could

1286
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,319
say it's a moving target but i

1287
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,160
i don't mean to disparage the fep at all

1288
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,920
i think i think

1289
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,000
um you know one thing that's going on

1290
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,839
here is that carl fristin is a fairly

1291
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:04,400
creative

1292
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,000
scientist obviously he's sort of trying

1293
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,160
to do something new and so he's

1294
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,880
you know this this is a framework uh mel

1295
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,520
mentioned

1296
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,359
thinking of this as a modeling language

1297
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:14,960
um it's a framework that's still under

1298
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,000
construction to some extent and um uh so

1299
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,680
you could say it's well

1300
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,440
it's not falsifiable because it's not a

1301
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,280
particular you know mathematical

1302
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,880
description it's a

1303
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,520
uh generator of descriptions like that

1304
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,640
um

1305
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,119
so i'll stop there for now yep and just

1306
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:32,160
to draw one

1307
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,000
quick thought there it's the principle

1308
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,760
as being metaphor

1309
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,280
uh the metaphor is between the principle

1310
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,200
and the language so could anyone

1311
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,000
falsify english could anyone falsify the

1312
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,839
idea of english grammar

1313
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,240
or is english a moving target is it

1314
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,760
something that can't be falsified

1315
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,079
but you can make claims under the

1316
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,000
umbrella or using the english grammar

1317
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:52,720
approach

1318
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,720
that the claim could be useful or not or

1319
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,319
it could be useful for one person or not

1320
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:57,359
for another person

1321
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,200
so once you get into the specific

1322
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,680
process theories the specific claims

1323
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,520
then you're talking empirical data or

1324
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,119
you're talking about the perspective of

1325
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,560
individual researchers

1326
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,920
but then when you pull back to the

1327
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,000
principal level and mel it sounds really

1328
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
interesting about the work on fleshing

1329
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,440
out what a principle is

1330
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,200
it's a little bit more like you can't

1331
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,359
falsify python but there's programs that

1332
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:18,319
don't work

1333
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:22,560
okay so marco tim and then dave

1334
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,720
thanks um so first of all apologies in

1335
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,000
the fans with philosophers because i'm

1336
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,520
gonna consciously tread into

1337
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,400
pragmatism um so so again i'm not a

1338
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,440
philosopher but but i'm

1339
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,960
kind of interested in in the angle of

1340
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,440
pragmatism on these matters

1341
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,359
so um reiterating again the theme of of

1342
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,079
seeing

1343
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,359
the fringe principle and active

1344
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,359
ingredients as more of a language

1345
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:46,400
and a framework um we

1346
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,800
also i think obtain an interesting maybe

1347
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,400
mode of falsification that actually mel

1348
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:50,880
just

1349
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,000
gave us which is um if certain approach

1350
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,520
or framework or

1351
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,520
a system of doing science um is selected

1352
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,880
by the niche that is a scientific

1353
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,640
enterprise then that is maybe an

1354
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,920
interesting form

1355
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,000
uh well the opposite of falsification

1356
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,200
right so if it doesn't

1357
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,839
get adopted then that maybe is some kind

1358
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:10,960
of classification

1359
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,280
but then an interesting uh implication

1360
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,319
here is

1361
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,720
following the popularity and the strange

1362
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,480
like popularity you must have

1363
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,520
uh of sap in so many different circles

1364
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,640
um is i think a sign that

1365
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,400
that the scientists or the researchers

1366
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,000
who have utilized it have

1367
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,480
experienced an embodied signal of

1368
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,520
usefulness

1369
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,359
and then following that comes a question

1370
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,200
of okay then where does it come from

1371
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,559
right and then for me what's really

1372
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,720
really interesting is then then the fap

1373
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,400
is the perfect kind of approach to

1374
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,480
answering or approaching that question

1375
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,319
right so so upon adopting or upon being

1376
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,640
exposed internalizing the ftp and active

1377
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,359
influence

1378
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,240
what changes within so now we get also

1379
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,920
two kinds of approaches to language not

1380
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,079
just you can communicate to other people

1381
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,880
but also how do the different models you

1382
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,280
you

1383
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,839
you embody communicate with each other

1384
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,359
so the unifying

1385
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,880
uh capacity of free energy principle

1386
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,440
is not just uh in the abstraction in the

1387
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,319
papers

1388
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,319
but also for people themselves at least

1389
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,960
for me and anecdotally also others

1390
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,200
that is i think one of the more unique

1391
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,119
aspects of active influence it really

1392
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:21,440
evokes the sense of unification

1393
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,839
it allows you to use a single framework

1394
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:24,640
and lens

1395
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,520
for a variety of phenomena and theories

1396
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,680
and to me that is maybe the biggest

1397
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,079
argument for it being scientific for the

1398
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:34,319
merits it evokes are genders

1399
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,400
in scientific enterprises including

1400
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,839
their constituents such as people and

1401
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:38,960
resurgence

1402
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,000
um so uh yeah so

1403
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,920
i would love to hear more from you uh

1404
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,319
especially philosophers on pragmatist

1405
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,880
perspectives sorry i've been binging a

1406
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,599
bit of hasso

1407
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,200
chan recently so maybe that's why i'm

1408
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,040
asking thank you

1409
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,760
marco tim then dave than anyone else who

1410
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,000
raises their hand

1411
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,119
uh did you say pragmatist just now

1412
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,520
yes that was pragmatism yeah a good

1413
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,640
segue to what i

1414
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,720
wanted to mention i guess because i was

1415
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,800
when you mentioned rarification

1416
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,119
that resonated with thoughts as i read

1417
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,160
the paper

1418
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,880
about um whitehead's fallacy of

1419
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,160
misplaced concreteness

1420
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,880
you know the idea that this this this

1421
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:19,440
knot

1422
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,599
in the processes that exists that's

1423
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,119
being revealed

1424
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,920
um is actually a process and the things

1425
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,240
that we see in the objects of the world

1426
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,960
are really just um uh sort of a

1427
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,839
rarification of the processes

1428
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,200
and you mentioned natural selection that

1429
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,400
was another thing that came up but not

1430
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,520
in the way i don't think you were

1431
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,559
mentioning it now

1432
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,079
the way i thought of it in the reading

1433
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,160
the paper was uh basically the

1434
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,200
objects as we call them are simply

1435
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,880
uh processes that we can take a

1436
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,040
perspective on that survived

1437
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,720
you know they're there because they

1438
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,480
survived they stayed they became

1439
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,640
they sustained themselves as you like to

1440
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,160
call it you know self-organized and all

1441
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,200
that right

1442
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,160
um yeah so anyway interesting thanks

1443
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,040
yeah thanks for

1444
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,640
tying that dave and then alex kiefer

1445
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,119
yeah mel uh you don't seem to give the

1446
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:07,680
exact

1447
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,839
title of the 1995 loose

1448
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:15,040
paper what was that i've got his 95

1449
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,960
book but he doesn't seem to ha is it

1450
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,640
just the introduction to that

1451
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:23,040
uh um the tarot window

1452
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,200
collection oh mel you're muted but

1453
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,119
look it up and then post it in the

1454
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:31,680
youtube chat or comments not the jitsie

1455
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,599
chat because it will make a noise so

1456
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,200
post it on the youtube and then anybody

1457
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,000
who wants to post

1458
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,680
any of these papers they're mentioning

1459
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,680
really the place to do it is the youtube

1460
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,559
comments

1461
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,240
or send it to me and i'll put it in the

1462
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,839
youtube video description

1463
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,000
so that everybody can access it alex

1464
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,760
kiefer then anyone else who raises their

1465
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,960
hand

1466
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,440
uh yeah i guess i was just gonna create

1467
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,800
some more problems for

1468
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,000
the simple discussion here um

1469
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,160
and well in that okay so so pragmatism's

1470
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,680
on the table and ratification

1471
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,440
um so um i guess for similar quantum

1472
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,960
type reasons i'm not sure how to think

1473
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,000
about these things

1474
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,920
i think what tim brought up about um

1475
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,440
perception

1476
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,640
forgive me if i could get it wrong but

1477
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,760
perception being something like a

1478
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,839
ratification of an ongoing process

1479
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:15,839
i think is a really good point so like

1480
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,119
um

1481
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,640
i mean there's a sense in which i'm a

1482
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,400
fan of ratification because it's like

1483
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,160
yeah maybe that's just what we're doing

1484
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,559
when we you know we take some we have a

1485
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:25,520
language

1486
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,280
uh maybe it's an internal neural

1487
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,880
language or something or maybe it's an

1488
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,200
external one and we and we take it to be

1489
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,040
about the world and that's our lens on

1490
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,559
the world so without rarification in

1491
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:35,440
some sense

1492
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,720
i don't know um how we we would have

1493
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,040
any any kind of perception of things but

1494
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:41,839
i'm sure that there's a way to

1495
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,520
distinguish bad kinds of ratification

1496
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,880
for good kinds

1497
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,280
um and i was going to say something else

1498
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,839
but it's i completely forget so

1499
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:51,520
yeah good point it's kind of like

1500
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,280
stability and plasticity

1501
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,680
remember those two top level descriptors

1502
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,440
of the cybernetic paper that we heard

1503
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,960
from in the last couple of weeks

1504
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,400
and it's kind of like they're not

1505
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,319
intrinsically good or bad because you

1506
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,079
could be too plastic or too stable

1507
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,440
and succeed or not and then beyond

1508
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,440
whether something exists or not humans

1509
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,720
have this kind of second layer where

1510
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,000
it's like oh yeah that exists but i

1511
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:12,720
don't like it

1512
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,720
so it's perpetuating itself but then we

1513
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,920
just don't prefer it

1514
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,680
and so that's just our agent's level

1515
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,760
perspective and so it's not just enough

1516
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,160
to be

1517
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,079
reified there's something else happening

1518
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,599
there so marco then sarah

1519
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,720
yeah oh to build on uh alex's great

1520
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,599
point

1521
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:32,240
so one of my favorite notions is

1522
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,000
reconstantine ladders

1523
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,079
or in buddhism they also call uh talk

1524
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:38,000
about the simile of the rounds

1525
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,680
um and i think this is really what it's

1526
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,520
about right so we're kind of like i

1527
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,800
like i said we're kind of stuck with

1528
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,280
reification that's just part and parcel

1529
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,280
how we engage with the world because the

1530
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,440
alternative was believing in nothing and

1531
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,079
then

1532
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:51,599
if you literally believe nothing then

1533
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:52,880
how the hell are you going to engage

1534
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,000
with the world right

1535
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
so all you can do is have good re as

1536
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,920
good as possible reification or

1537
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,040
at least worse reifications um

1538
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,559
and again for me this is this

1539
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,640
perceptually this kind of approach

1540
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,440
or at least perspective that we are just

1541
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,839
engaging in finding better

1542
00:53:08,839 --> 00:53:10,559
reunifications

1543
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,440
such that that particular reification or

1544
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,040
such that that particular

1545
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,280
um embodiment or incorporation of a

1546
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,319
model leads to better genetic dynamics

1547
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:23,119
and then to better active inference um

1548
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:24,800
due to use active infrastructure

1549
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,760
framework here um yeah sorry yeah

1550
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,280
cool sarah then mel

1551
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,720
um i don't know i is this possibly gonna

1552
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,319
be an embarrassing moment for me but i

1553
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:39,520
feel like that's my job

1554
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,119
um i don't really understand

1555
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,520
like as i was kind of stepping through

1556
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,119
fep the math of it

1557
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:49,119
there's a there's a point where i'm like

1558
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,920
eh it seems like bayesianism has

1559
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,559
got some like it doesn't seem like even

1560
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:54,960
it

1561
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,680
the foundations of what feps are a lot

1562
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,280
of things are based on

1563
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,280
i mean this idea of of belief and priors

1564
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:03,599
and

1565
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,359
and and that something you know

1566
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,119
something is absolutely true

1567
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,000
i guess i just wonder mel if you you

1568
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,200
know if you

1569
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,359
ran up against that or like if there's a

1570
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:14,800
deeper background that i'm

1571
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,559
probably not aware of in philosophy

1572
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,640
about the limits of bayesianism

1573
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,359
um or these kinds of models so that's i

1574
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:22,000
don't it's

1575
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,920
really a vague question but it's the

1576
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,440
best i could do

1577
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,200
no that's an excellent question oh sorry

1578
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,800
yeah i'm nice it is it is a great

1579
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,920
question go ahead

1580
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,119
yeah it's an excellent question so

1581
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,440
there's a um

1582
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,040
yeah i think i think when i was first

1583
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,520
grappling with veganism

1584
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,720
there's a way in which um

1585
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,119
there's sort of like a laplacian demon

1586
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:44,319
smuggled in

1587
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,079
like there's a there's a view from

1588
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:47,599
nowhere smuggled in

1589
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:51,599
there's a a a perfect knower

1590
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:56,240
smuggled him and

1591
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:01,359
that would be the case for the fep

1592
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:06,240
but we've we've

1593
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,359
we worked out a way

1594
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:14,079
for it to be just a

1595
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:17,799
a cognizer that's like

1596
00:55:17,799 --> 00:55:19,839
self-supervising right it's it's

1597
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:21,760
knowledge is limited

1598
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,040
it's access to to the true world out

1599
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:25,599
there is

1600
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,839
is intrinsically limited and yet it's

1601
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:30,079
able to self-correct and self-supervise

1602
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:33,040
and if you want um i think sort of the

1603
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,119
best recent explanation of like

1604
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:36,880
why this is the case and and how it's

1605
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,799
able to do that is um

1606
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:42,799
yuck hoey's paper and i want to say

1607
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,200
synthesizer and i want to say

1608
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,640
something self-supervision and the fish

1609
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,079
i guess i have to i get i guess i have

1610
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,000
to drop this link as well let me go do

1611
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:52,799
that

1612
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,880
cool yeah that's what's so fun is the

1613
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,400
discussion yeah i would love it thank

1614
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:56,720
you

1615
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,040
yeah the discussion we raised so many

1616
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,359
fun links and so many connections and

1617
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:02,000
then we just

1618
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,079
make sure to post them so that everybody

1619
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,640
can asynchronously or synchronously be

1620
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,200
in the game so marco then anyone else

1621
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,799
oh no raised hand yeah oh go ahead uh

1622
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:17,119
oh yeah sorry um what i'm gonna say oh

1623
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:18,559
yeah and i really love that but i

1624
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,599
i i wanna propose saying instead instead

1625
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,599
of a perfect knower because laplacian

1626
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,119
indeed knows everything but for me

1627
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,040
bajanism is really more about

1628
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,200
if we would have to make an analogy it's

1629
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,440
a perfect pragmatic learner

1630
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,319
so in essence what it it the nordic

1631
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:36,720
principle kind of

1632
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,640
by design says this is the perfect way

1633
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,000
of knowing

1634
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,839
if you also add on a lot of assumptions

1635
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:43,280
for a particular age

1636
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,839
but but uh yeah i guess a bit half

1637
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:47,200
jokingly you could say it's a fristen

1638
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,240
steaming

1639
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,960
you know the perfect dramatic learner um

1640
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:51,680
yeah i just

1641
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,480
i just ran up against this just in my

1642
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,280
everyday life

1643
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,839
i contradict myself in so many ways i

1644
00:56:57,839 --> 00:56:59,839
can't even keep track you know like

1645
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:01,680
one one part of me thinks this the other

1646
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,799
part of things that and they're

1647
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,079
literally

1648
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:06,559
and so i yeah i just i just started

1649
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,440
realizing

1650
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,760
my my own limitations with respect to

1651
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,200
knowledge and how knowledge would even

1652
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,640
be modeled

1653
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,480
but that's part of the design i think

1654
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,920
that's something i often like to point

1655
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:16,240
out

1656
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,680
is it's not about having no conflict

1657
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,240
it's more about given that conflicts

1658
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,440
will arise

1659
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,200
how to best cope with them so the

1660
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,280
adaptive engagement with the world is

1661
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,960
also reflexive

1662
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,359
so your own struggles your own

1663
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:33,200
challenges your own

1664
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,680
seeming contradictions are also

1665
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,920
opportunities to grow and that's again

1666
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,839
only possible with this

1667
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:43,119
demon that that is pragmatically

1668
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:44,559
learning all the time

1669
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:46,160
i'm curious but hopefully that's a bit

1670
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,599
more optimistic yeah i'm curious about

1671
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:48,640
this perfect demon

1672
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,720
because i would say that a bayesian

1673
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,000
updating agent

1674
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,559
could make a update that helps it

1675
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,319
survive in its niche or not

1676
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:58,559
it could over learn or underlearn and

1677
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,960
just simply fail to exist in the future

1678
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,559
and so natural selection again is the

1679
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,559
hand that just sweeps off the table

1680
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:05,680
the bayesian learners that aren't

1681
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,280
existing and i would challenge you know

1682
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,960
there's many thoughts on bayesianism

1683
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,040
and a lot of debates but alternative

1684
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,799
being what frequentism

1685
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:15,040
or some other vaguely unspecified

1686
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,799
mathematical framework that somebody

1687
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:18,960
doesn't want to put a name on to

1688
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,040
and so i think it's an interesting

1689
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,000
question how does

1690
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,400
mathematics and how do formalisms come

1691
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,200
into play

1692
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,760
with philosophy at all what would any

1693
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,920
equation have to say about philosophy

1694
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,920
but then once you're in that world of

1695
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,359
trying to make models that have some

1696
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:34,880
element of formalism

1697
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,480
whether it's natural language or whether

1698
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,640
it's another language then

1699
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,559
i think you start wandering over towards

1700
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:42,799
the idea of a learning or updating agent

1701
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:44,559
and not needing to take the baggage that

1702
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:46,319
it's a perfect learning agent just that

1703
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:46,960
it is

1704
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,520
an adaptive agent of some kind sarah and

1705
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,000
then anyone else who raises their hand

1706
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,119
yeah this gets for me though um this

1707
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:57,200
gets into a kind of a i don't know the

1708
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,200
the clever philosophy word but

1709
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,280
um you know this is also why i asked a

1710
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,799
question in a prior week about the

1711
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:05,680
markov blanket because it's like

1712
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,319
i i picture like a monster truck rally

1713
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:08,960
where two

1714
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,960
two fep models are battling it out

1715
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,160
basically in my own

1716
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,960
brain or whatever and so it's like where

1717
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,000
is the

1718
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,760
so so in that paradigm where you have

1719
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,160
these kinds of objectifications you know

1720
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,319
of one fep with another fep like where

1721
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:23,200
the

1722
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,119
um then you have questions around like

1723
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:26,640
the boundary between the two

1724
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,480
and there's this kind of a there's a

1725
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,480
there's a thickness about all of this

1726
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,200
that

1727
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,359
um kind of gets me in like an infinite

1728
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:34,400
regress

1729
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,079
so that's yeah fun alex keefer than

1730
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:40,319
anyone else

1731
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:43,599
yeah so i mean i think this this issue

1732
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:44,480
we're talking about now is really

1733
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,200
interesting i

1734
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,040
uh yeah i was wondering recently whether

1735
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,680
bayesianism is a is a prior

1736
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,119
and what that does when you start

1737
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:52,480
thinking about it i think this is

1738
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,119
totally

1739
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:54,960
relevant to the the theme of overall

1740
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,240
theme of the paper because

1741
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,440
well of course it is but i mean it's

1742
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,599
directly relevant because um

1743
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:01,680
like it we're talking about things that

1744
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,280
get to be so general theories

1745
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,720
theories or frameworks or whatever that

1746
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,799
are so general that they start to raise

1747
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,400
really weird questions but one thing i

1748
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,920
was going to say is just that like

1749
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,920
i think maybe this is implicit or

1750
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,440
explicit what people said already but

1751
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,319
like

1752
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,200
the fact that we're dealing with

1753
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,440
variational inference well for okay

1754
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,319
first of all bayesianism even if it's

1755
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:22,079
bayes theorem itself is supposed to like

1756
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:23,920
descend from god or whatever it's like

1757
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,160
actually building subjectivity into

1758
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,040
into science more right explicitly than

1759
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,880
the alternatives i think people mention

1760
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,040
contrasting into frequentism but then

1761
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,880
we're taking a further step

1762
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,640
away from objectivity and saying yeah

1763
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,400
and each each creature sort of

1764
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,119
learns its own approximation to that um

1765
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:42,400
so i think

1766
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,760
um i don't think you can eliminate uh

1767
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,920
claims to objectivity entirely um i

1768
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:48,799
don't i

1769
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:51,040
and so this may be maybe this is the the

1770
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,079
best we can do

1771
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:55,359
um or at least a step in the right

1772
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:56,880
direction

1773
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,920
very interesting point marco then anyone

1774
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:00,960
else

1775
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,480
marco then mel yeah i fully agree um so

1776
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,160
obviously can't be eradicated and i

1777
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,480
think that's kind of the beauty of how

1778
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,640
like alex said uh this act of infant

1779
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,799
stuff is taking the

1780
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:14,880
the rejection of projectivity even

1781
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,400
further it's really

1782
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,280
approaching or making at least the the

1783
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:19,760
the

1784
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,599
building the foundations for an

1785
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:24,160
objective science of subjectivity

1786
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,799
right and and to to add uh to touch back

1787
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:28,160
on the

1788
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:32,559
uh of jokey idea of the bistonian demon

1789
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:35,520
um like alex said right they create

1790
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,160
their own particular approximations um

1791
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,400
they have to have first instantiated

1792
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,599
particular priorities

1793
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:44,000
but more importantly you also noted on

1794
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,839
i'm sorry also noted on

1795
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,599
infinite regress so so that's another

1796
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:49,440
beauty for me um

1797
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,280
there's no problem of if need regress

1798
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,599
because traditionally with homunculi and

1799
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:56,000
stuff and controllers or agents or will

1800
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,680
theirs is yeah but what is controlling

1801
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,599
that and there's this movement

1802
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:01,920
towards smaller and smaller but that's

1803
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,039
not the case with

1804
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:06,160
the scenario because the dependency

1805
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,640
is not like a vehicle dependent on the

1806
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:09,520
driver

1807
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,039
but it's more assistant dependent on

1808
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:12,559
each other and i think that's kind of

1809
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:13,599
the beauty

1810
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:16,079
um where the agents in the perfect demon

1811
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:17,200
scenario

1812
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,520
it would be more like um minimal

1813
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,520
dependence on the agent's faultiness and

1814
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,280
more about how well the niche of the

1815
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,160
context

1816
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,880
prepares that agent uh for the niches to

1817
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:27,359
be

1818
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:29,920
encountered in their life uh and for

1819
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:30,400
those

1820
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,640
you know with attention for buddhism

1821
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,640
it's also very beautiful how it relates

1822
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,880
to this idea of the mutually arising

1823
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,960
or co-origination um it it's just

1824
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,599
in essence like alex said it's about

1825
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:44,480
subjectivity

1826
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,119
the the the co-dependency of how

1827
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:48,799
densities or how

1828
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:51,440
states or yeah and identities house

1829
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,480
densities kind of

1830
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,839
adapt each other anyways awesome awesome

1831
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:59,680
mel then tim than anyone else

1832
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:03,280
yeah so i sort of wanna i guess i want

1833
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,720
to

1834
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:08,319
push marco maybe to to bring up

1835
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:10,640
a question he raised when you were

1836
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:11,680
giving us the

1837
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,760
this sort of like breakdown of this

1838
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:14,880
paper

1839
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,720
which i i thought

1840
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,240
when he raised i was like wow that's

1841
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,000
that's a really difficult question that

1842
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:22,799
i can answer

1843
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:26,960
so um i think that would

1844
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,559
push a very interesting discussion

1845
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,319
if only because it's a question that i

1846
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:34,000
don't know how to answer and it's a

1847
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,200
question of

1848
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:38,480
um it was something about

1849
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,720
well aren't aren't physical descriptions

1850
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,720
just kind of formal descriptions

1851
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:49,760
at some level anyways so you were you

1852
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:50,880
monica you raised the quest do you

1853
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,240
remember do you know what i'm talking

1854
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,240
about

1855
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:58,000
no well you raised you raised a question

1856
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,359
about about um

1857
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,880
about this line that i drew between

1858
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:08,160
a mere you know mathematical formal

1859
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,160
statistical description

1860
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,520
of something at a a physical description

1861
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,119
proper and you sort of

1862
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:17,520
challenge that that such a line exist

1863
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,119
which is which is tristan's line

1864
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:22,400
but somehow uh

1865
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:26,559
i i love carl but but um somehow the way

1866
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:29,760
he has always raised that

1867
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,720
it feels to me like a cop-out it feels

1868
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,160
to me like

1869
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,200
some sort of evasion but when you

1870
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,400
pushed me on that i was like you know

1871
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,440
yeah you're right maybe there isn't

1872
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,039
maybe there isn't a hard line

1873
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:47,839
between and and this this sees into

1874
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:48,960
alex's

1875
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,010
question as well um

1876
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:53,200
[Music]

1877
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,039
it's it's it's all this it's all

1878
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,119
continuous this this question of like

1879
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:57,760
well

1880
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,440
you know uh

1881
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,200
is math natural like is is math an

1882
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,160
arbitrary

1883
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,520
formal system um

1884
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,039
where we've invented all the rules and

1885
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:13,280
it it just has nothing to do with you

1886
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:13,839
know

1887
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:16,480
contingent nature or or is it continuous

1888
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,200
you know is it

1889
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,839
is it just descriptions of nature at a

1890
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:23,200
very abstract level um

1891
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,640
is there a is there a hard line between

1892
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,280
information seriously well you know

1893
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,640
going full change

1894
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,280
is is there uh is there a disappearing

1895
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:33,760
line

1896
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,920
between um between

1897
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,799
inference techniques between techniques

1898
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:42,079
for bayesian infants

1899
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:45,280
um as a you know just

1900
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,559
as a statistical technique and

1901
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:50,160
thermodynamics right you know

1902
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,599
statistical mechanics

1903
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:56,240
uh those are the questions that i'm like

1904
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:59,280
oh man i can't i can't that's

1905
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,680
that seems to me to be the most pressing

1906
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,520
question behind all of this

1907
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,720
to me yes math invented or discovered

1908
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,880
thermodynamics invented or discovered

1909
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,520
fep invented or discovered inference

1910
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,240
overall

1911
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,720
statistics all these kinds of awesome

1912
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,079
interrelated questions

1913
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,799
philosophy invented or discovered tim

1914
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:19,680
alex kiefer

1915
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,280
then anyone else i was just uh

1916
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,839
just kind of the homunculus infinite

1917
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:26,400
regress

1918
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,119
thing versus the dependent arising sort

1919
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:30,160
of co-emergence

1920
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:34,079
of the of the i think that contrast is

1921
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:34,720
really

1922
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,760
something neat that i don't know how to

1923
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,680
explore it but they seem like opposite

1924
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:40,799
ends of

1925
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:43,039
you know two poles of the same kind of

1926
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:44,240
consideration

1927
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,880
and i feel uh like i'm repping whitehead

1928
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,000
here today but

1929
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,720
it also touches on what he talks about

1930
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,319
when he talks about the bifurcation of

1931
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:54,640
nature that he decries right so

1932
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:58,400
i mean um uh so when we talk about

1933
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,920
taking a perspective and saying that

1934
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,799
object

1935
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:03,680
emerges to my perception first of all

1936
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,240
because it survived as a self-recreating

1937
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:06,720
thing

1938
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,839
over time you know that it uh

1939
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:12,960
you know um and and i did too

1940
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,640
we're we're both in the same we're both

1941
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,160
the same thing you know what i mean like

1942
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,280
it's not like

1943
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,680
i'm apart from the world the reason it's

1944
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,599
in my world is because i'm in its world

1945
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:24,640
and and the nature's not bifurcated into

1946
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,440
the

1947
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,480
mind and the physical anyway

1948
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,720
awesome point tim because we often say

1949
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,640
in active inference that the organism

1950
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,160
comes to embody the statistical

1951
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,480
regularities of its ecological niche

1952
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,160
and so people look out there at the

1953
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,839
ecology around them and they can say

1954
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:40,720
okay that's

1955
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,720
natural but then the organism is also

1956
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,240
natural and wouldn't the generative

1957
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:44,799
model

1958
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:47,200
of its niche be just like its hand be

1959
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,039
just another phenotype that's generative

1960
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:51,520
and therefore natural as well so alex

1961
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,079
kiefer

1962
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:55,359
then blue then marco

1963
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:58,160
um i i might just i might actually ask

1964
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,760
for now i just wanted to drill down more

1965
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:00,960
on this idea of like

1966
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:04,319
mathematics uh what what you know pure

1967
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:05,839
mathematical formalisms and how they

1968
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:07,039
might represent but i think there's a

1969
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,079
lot of interesting

1970
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:09,599
stuff on the table right now i'd rather

1971
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,680
hear about it at the moment perfect

1972
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,799
blue then marco

1973
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:17,040
so maybe it'll i'll wrap it back for

1974
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,719
alex because i kind of want to

1975
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:21,359
just touch on this dependent arising

1976
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,439
right or like the mutual arising

1977
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:25,679
you know the world exists because it

1978
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:27,198
exists in my mind

1979
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:30,000
um and also the idea of whether or not

1980
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,319
mathematics is natural right like is is

1981
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:33,439
this like something that we

1982
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:35,520
invented or something that we discovered

1983
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,439
but i would like to make the argument

1984
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:39,359
that that really like

1985
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:42,158
as humans we are also natural right so

1986
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:42,479
so

1987
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:44,479
if it can be discovered in more than one

1988
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:46,319
place at more than one time by more than

1989
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:47,839
one human as many

1990
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:49,679
strong theories in science are they

1991
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:51,439
bubble up together i think that

1992
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:54,719
there is some kind of natural arising or

1993
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:55,679
naturalness

1994
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:58,799
to these kinds of studies

1995
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:02,799
thanks blue marco then anyone else

1996
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:05,839
thanks um so

1997
01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:08,399
so uh i think i know what you meant uh

1998
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:09,439
with my comments uh

1999
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:12,158
no i think but but let me allow uh to

2000
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:14,080
push back on myself

2001
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:17,279
um so so i think if we're we we only

2002
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:17,679
have

2003
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:20,560
just descriptions um and the only kind

2004
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:21,920
of extra

2005
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,000
qualifiers or properties of these

2006
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,198
descriptions as such

2007
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:28,319
that's relevant and grounded is their

2008
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,238
etiology or their genealogy where do

2009
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:31,198
they come from

2010
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:32,799
right so if we already talk about

2011
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,158
descriptions we already have to be

2012
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:35,279
talking about

2013
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:37,920
systems that can generate descriptions

2014
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:38,799
and so

2015
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:41,759
i don't think there's a hard line uh in

2016
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,399
terms of

2017
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:44,319
an essence right that's intrinsic

2018
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,319
property but i think the hard line is

2019
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:47,198
more about

2020
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:50,719
their path their genealogy how did that

2021
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,839
description came

2022
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:54,480
come to be um and then i think we go

2023
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,199
back to

2024
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:57,679
uh language again and i think this is

2025
01:09:57,679 --> 01:09:58,640
thanks to um

2026
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,880
liam bright shout out to him who

2027
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,480
introduced me to karna

2028
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,280
and he currently talked about valid

2029
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,719
physical languages

2030
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:08,960
um and i think that's kind of the beauty

2031
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:09,840
that the fep

2032
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,159
is maybe not perfect for every state of

2033
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:13,920
affair or space of affairs

2034
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,080
um but i do think it's true that that

2035
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,000
you can transfer a lot of

2036
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,600
what we now at least see as valid

2037
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,440
physical descriptions to the language

2038
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,239
ftp

2039
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:25,360
but more importantly to me the beauty is

2040
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,880
the generative aspect so if you

2041
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,080
transfer something into um translate

2042
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,280
something into active

2043
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,280
language of active inference then you

2044
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,600
also transfer the generative aspects to

2045
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,320
it

2046
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,840
so if you transfer them to active

2047
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,520
influence and then you explore in the

2048
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,520
space that's generated there

2049
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,120
and you see a pattern or something then

2050
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,719
that hypothesis

2051
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:47,199
obtained or derived in an abstract space

2052
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:48,719
can be also translated back

2053
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:51,120
and so it's the validity of that back

2054
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:51,760
and forth

2055
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,719
translational path that i think is more

2056
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,280
important

2057
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,640
to the question of is it a physical

2058
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,120
description right is it is it physically

2059
01:10:59,120 --> 01:10:59,600
rooted

2060
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,760
rootable if you have these valid

2061
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,920
languages i don't know if it makes sense

2062
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,960
yeah so small point uh very small points

2063
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:07,440
is

2064
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,360
um i've always also taken issue with

2065
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,440
carl saying that we embody

2066
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,280
statistical regularities about the world

2067
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,040
not that it's not true but i think

2068
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,080
it's it's it's uh only a partial view

2069
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,159
for me what's more relevant is that

2070
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:21,840
there are statistical regularities due

2071
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,400
to the fact that the world is systematic

2072
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,560
um and these regularities allow this

2073
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,760
kind of tethering

2074
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,000
right so it's for me it's more about

2075
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,400
embodying a bridge with the world

2076
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,239
and what you then get at least my

2077
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:36,480
motivation is then that leaves

2078
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:39,840
a more openness to also give room for

2079
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:40,960
the unique

2080
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,440
aspect to humanity as in humans are

2081
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,000
weird

2082
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,840
we're like really weird i don't know why

2083
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,440
we're so weird exactly but we're really

2084
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,239
weird

2085
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:50,159
and that weirdness has less to do with

2086
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:51,600
cisco regularities and

2087
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,600
more about what is evoked or generated

2088
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,800
or cultivated

2089
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,719
upon embodying this statistical

2090
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:58,719
regulators and upon being faced

2091
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,640
with the challenges of dealing with the

2092
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,320
world um

2093
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,560
and so i guess we have some physical

2094
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,920
regulators of the world

2095
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,640
and kind of weird irregularities of

2096
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,280
ourselves

2097
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:12,560
uh if that makes sense yes yeah we we

2098
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:13,120
swim

2099
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,800
in those regularities of the niche you

2100
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,320
know if the fish were just the

2101
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,080
statistical regularities of water there

2102
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,360
wouldn't be a fish there

2103
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,679
so it has to be something a little bit

2104
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:22,560
bigger

2105
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,679
now another uh cool thing is we we've

2106
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:27,040
been talking about this

2107
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,440
uh similarity between the physical

2108
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,400
ecology

2109
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,239
and then our social ecology which is

2110
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:34,159
also natural so we can think of a

2111
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:36,000
physical example of stigma g

2112
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,840
like the ants that are digging out their

2113
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,280
nest and they're modifying their

2114
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,480
physical environment

2115
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,159
which then changes how their physical

2116
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:43,679
behavior is implemented

2117
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:45,600
but with this conversation and in the

2118
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,040
literature especially

2119
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,800
there's a stigmergy at the level of

2120
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,640
information the informational

2121
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,719
niche which has different perspectives

2122
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:54,239
within it different agents that have

2123
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:56,000
different access to different kinds of

2124
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,040
information

2125
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,920
and those kinds of communications in the

2126
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,120
informational niche

2127
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,960
are natural and the generative models

2128
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,880
that we have are natural as well

2129
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,120
so there's just so many fun ways that we

2130
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,159
can think about all right well

2131
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:09,840
now that we're niche constructing in

2132
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,760
this info niche

2133
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,320
what kinds of uh things do we want to

2134
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,520
put in this

2135
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,880
construction that we're working on

2136
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,719
together so just like the ant

2137
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:20,400
engineer might say well we could kind of

2138
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,920
have a corollary

2139
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,760
to this tunnel that branches off this

2140
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,280
way maybe there's something useful over

2141
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:25,600
here

2142
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,840
oh we falsified that corollary tunnel

2143
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,280
it's not useful

2144
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,480
it retracts so in the social world in

2145
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,239
this informational world

2146
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:36,239
how do we take that natural perspective

2147
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:38,320
and also make it useful for the colony

2148
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,920
scott and then anyone else who raised

2149
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,320
their hand

2150
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,880
just wanted to say with regard to the

2151
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,080
fish i think some of you heard the

2152
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:46,960
example i read

2153
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,320
research a number of years ago where

2154
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,400
they took a semi-rigid piece of plastic

2155
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,000
and put it in a stream

2156
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,760
and then they varied and increased the

2157
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,480
speed of the stream and ultimately the

2158
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,120
piece of plastic started undulating with

2159
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,000
the periodicity

2160
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,719
that resembled the fish and so they what

2161
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:04,480
they realize is the fish doesn't swim

2162
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,239
through water it actually passes through

2163
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:07,600
the water

2164
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,719
so it was really over deep time fish are

2165
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:12,080
formed by the water

2166
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,679
now again not the entirety of the fish

2167
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:15,520
but also formed by other relationships

2168
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,480
with other

2169
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,800
organisms and media but is similar to

2170
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:19,679
the way that

2171
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:22,800
insects bats and birds independently

2172
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:23,920
developed wings

2173
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,600
because they were flying in the medium

2174
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,520
of air

2175
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,400
but i think i think mel has a point yep

2176
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:30,960
let's go

2177
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:34,159
here yep we'll go mel ben

2178
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:37,440
shannon then marco i

2179
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,600
i point there's a it's like a lovely

2180
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,560
little video

2181
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,679
of a of a dead like salmon in a stream

2182
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:44,239
and it's

2183
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:47,440
it's it's it's behaving

2184
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:49,920
in this way that really seems very

2185
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,600
lifelike but sad

2186
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,960
um and and i i think i i once

2187
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,280
like posted this with the caption like

2188
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,239
is this

2189
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:02,400
is this morphological computation and

2190
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,400
that made a lot of people there was

2191
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,560
there like people were very up in arms

2192
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,840
over whether or not that was

2193
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,840
morphology

2194
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,800
interesting question and synapses and

2195
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,159
neurons being physical

2196
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:18,000
what isn't morphological computation

2197
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,600
under certain perspectives

2198
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:23,360
shannon then marco than anyone else

2199
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,679
that was a brilliant picture of what i'm

2200
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:27,440
thinking in my head right now and

2201
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,640
um to figure back on what um both mel

2202
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,320
and scott just said

2203
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,719
so the dead salmon or the piece of

2204
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:35,760
plastic

2205
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:39,040
you know is passing through the water

2206
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,640
in and you can very clearly see how

2207
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,080
the environment or the medium that it's

2208
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,960
in is forming its behavior

2209
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,760
even though it's dead or it's plastic

2210
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:50,480
and

2211
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:53,199
as you get into more weird creatures

2212
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:54,719
creatures with culture

2213
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:58,000
like humans even fish that interact

2214
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,440
in groups and communicate with other

2215
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,760
fish in a cultural way

2216
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,840
then you end up adding different layers

2217
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:08,159
of medium so you don't just have

2218
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:10,880
water you have now the other fish are in

2219
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,640
your medium they're part of

2220
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:15,040
this social organism and then with

2221
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:17,600
humans now the other humans are in

2222
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,840
are are making another social medium

2223
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,199
that you're interacting in

2224
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:24,880
so you have more and more in

2225
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,560
the terminology like nested levels of

2226
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,159
environments that you're

2227
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:32,159
embodying thanks for that point shannon

2228
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:35,840
marco then scott than anyone else

2229
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,360
yeah i'm not sure if it's appreciated

2230
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,760
but but i could i'll continue a theme of

2231
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,840
linking active influence to some

2232
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,600
spirituality slash eastern

2233
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,640
traditions it's um so so the notion of

2234
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:47,440
the dao

2235
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,920
right which stands for the way i think

2236
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:50,719
it's also

2237
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:53,840
for me it always evokes his resonance

2238
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,360
with active inference

2239
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:58,239
um because there's this emphasis on on

2240
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,199
on this

2241
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:01,040
the way the tao of how the universe

2242
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,679
works efficiently that is unnameable

2243
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:05,679
right and i think that that is also

2244
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:06,719
related to this

2245
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:09,120
issue of reification earlier that there

2246
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:09,760
is

2247
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,440
modes there's systematicity there's

2248
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:12,880
rules to how the world works

2249
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,480
but fundamentally it's unnameable the

2250
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,000
moment you name it it's not the real

2251
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,520
way right and uh this kind of finding

2252
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,719
the intermediate part

2253
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:24,000
the the one of least effort or as often

2254
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:24,320
as

2255
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:27,760
described no effort away um

2256
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,719
this this too is is exactly uh resonant

2257
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:31,920
with that picture of

2258
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:35,679
the life the dead fish in the stream um

2259
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:37,440
so yeah i think that's just in general

2260
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,040
there's this theme that i find also very

2261
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:39,920
exciting

2262
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,840
how much activation actually helped me

2263
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,120
appreciate a lot of

2264
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,400
philosophies and tradition not just

2265
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,239
eastern but a lot of

2266
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:48,880
let's say forgotten wisdoms and

2267
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,239
forgotten insights

2268
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:53,199
from not just religion and not just

2269
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:54,960
spirituality but also arts

2270
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,679
right we often see this false dichotomy

2271
01:17:57,679 --> 01:17:58,080
of

2272
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:00,480
arts as something frivolous in science

2273
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:01,520
truth

2274
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,440
but a lot of insights scientific

2275
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,520
insights were actually prefigured

2276
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:08,880
by a lot of artists into conceptual form

2277
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,000
and so in my experience active influence

2278
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,199
or this generalist

2279
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:16,400
general um lens or perspective allows us

2280
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,560
to reappreciate that which has become

2281
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,000
too decoupled

2282
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,360
from our modern postmodern over rational

2283
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:24,640
of analytic

2284
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,880
and a way of engaging with the world

2285
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:27,920
yeah thank you

2286
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,480
marco it's almost like dare i say it the

2287
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,320
math is not the territory

2288
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:35,360
so we'll go to scott blue sarah and then

2289
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:38,080
alex keefer

2290
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,960
so a couple other just observations

2291
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,000
along the lines of what

2292
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,320
um shannon was alluding to i think in

2293
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,199
focal

2294
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:48,320
um philosopher for co not the pendulum

2295
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:51,760
he um talked about pastoral control

2296
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,000
which was the idea that the persona of a

2297
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,679
person is formed

2298
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:59,280
by their external norms and rules and

2299
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:00,800
laws and

2300
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,400
culture that they're exposed to so the

2301
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,040
same kind of thing like a plastic toy in

2302
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:05,920
a metal mold

2303
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:09,360
being formed so that same kind of notion

2304
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:10,880
and one of the things i think is

2305
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,560
interesting about active inference

2306
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:17,120
for me is that those differentials

2307
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:20,840
what is the motivation for closing

2308
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,080
differentials

2309
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,840
and the motivation is de-risking in

2310
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,440
leverage

2311
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:29,520
grossly stated i think so the idea is if

2312
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:31,120
you have a differential between you and

2313
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,600
the environment

2314
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,520
you want to protect yourself from the

2315
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,679
harm from that differential or exploit

2316
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:38,080
the

2317
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,320
opportunities of that differential that

2318
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:41,840
differential is either temperature

2319
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,360
differential in the case of a heat

2320
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,000
engine

2321
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,840
or an information differential in the

2322
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,080
case of a von neumann or shannon

2323
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,600
extension

2324
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,360
of the second law of thermodynamics so

2325
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,280
those same differentials you have in

2326
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,360
carnot's equation

2327
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,600
for heat and cold you need the

2328
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,440
differentials and information to have

2329
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,560
market exchange

2330
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:03,679
and i think to have beijing exchange

2331
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:05,360
so what was what's the status of a

2332
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,040
bayesian process

2333
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:12,159
if you have no differentials between the

2334
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:15,360
input and the expectation

2335
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:19,199
so along those lines what it seems like

2336
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:21,920
is we have these identity stacks this is

2337
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,280
what i think shannon was

2338
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,600
alluding to not claude shannon but our

2339
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,600
shannon here

2340
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,719
um and both perhaps but that the

2341
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:32,800
you take these combinations of things

2342
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,320
that in the environment that make you

2343
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,159
who you are we're like bauer birds we

2344
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:37,040
collect up

2345
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,280
these externalities and internalize them

2346
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,360
for our expectations

2347
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,679
and there's a whole set of them and then

2348
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:44,480
we go out

2349
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:48,159
and identify those that are anomalous

2350
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:50,960
for our expectations so on another call

2351
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:52,159
earlier there's a

2352
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:53,840
someone who talked about the difference

2353
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,280
uh narrative and

2354
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,320
story and how your internal narrative

2355
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:58,880
and your

2356
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,719
story is being told you have to line up

2357
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:01,840
well to the extent that there's a

2358
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,040
differential

2359
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:06,639
that motivates activity of interaction

2360
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:08,400
and markets have been described as

2361
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,760
places where you find

2362
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:13,120
price discovery and solution discovery

2363
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:16,560
at large scales so the beijing process

2364
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,199
seems like a way of incrementally

2365
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:21,360
identifying the externalities that are

2366
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,520
anomalous for your expectations

2367
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,000
and then being able to internalize them

2368
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,600
is kind of that bayesian

2369
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,320
process i think so anyway it's something

2370
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,199
the

2371
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:33,199
part of the reason that is so appealing

2372
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:34,400
to me is that

2373
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:35,760
i've been arguing for a number of years

2374
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,000
that markets and countries and companies

2375
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,080
are biological

2376
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,000
because their iterations and artifacts

2377
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,320
of structures of biological beings which

2378
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:45,600
is us

2379
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,440
they happen to take on an abstraction in

2380
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,880
an informational

2381
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:52,400
embodiment but they represent those same

2382
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,360
processes as biological systems in terms

2383
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,360
of those differentials and trying to

2384
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,440
render externalities innocuous or

2385
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:00,960
exploit externality

2386
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,679
differences anyway there's a lot this is

2387
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:05,199
feeling very

2388
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:07,600
like a there's a strange attractor here

2389
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,440
it feels like that's pulling

2390
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,440
the conversation in the direction of

2391
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:12,960
that um

2392
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:16,560
generative systems that i define

2393
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,719
the last point i define life as being

2394
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:20,320
auto catalytic

2395
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:23,679
entry entropy secreting systems

2396
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:26,080
so these auto catalytic they keep going

2397
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,520
and entropy secreting they get rid of

2398
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,159
disorder

2399
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:29,840
but the problem is that the neighboring

2400
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,639
system has to absorb that disorder

2401
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:35,440
and so how do you manage disorder among

2402
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:36,400
systems

2403
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,120
is again when shannon arshan and not

2404
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,000
claude shannon

2405
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,199
was talking about the different things

2406
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:44,800
the different characteristics

2407
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,880
that's the neighbors good neighbors when

2408
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,639
they bang into each other in terms of

2409
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:49,360
their

2410
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:51,199
creating anomalies for each other's

2411
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:52,880
expectations

2412
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:56,000
manage the anomalies instead of just

2413
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,560
winning over each other so anyway just a

2414
01:22:58,560 --> 01:22:59,520
couple of things there

2415
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,719
thank you scott blue sarah alex

2416
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:06,000
marco so i'm gonna

2417
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,679
skip over what scott just said and go

2418
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:09,760
back to what marco had had previously

2419
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:10,480
said about

2420
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,960
um the connections right between active

2421
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:13,679
inference

2422
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:16,239
and eastern religion so i'm a student of

2423
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:18,239
buddhism for many years and i've been

2424
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:19,440
wondering right

2425
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,000
do we in fact have free will like if

2426
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:22,960
we're considering

2427
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,120
karma and also considering active

2428
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,880
inference so this is something that like

2429
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,800
i i find this parallel

2430
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,719
like karmically we're connected we've

2431
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:32,639
got collective karma with groups with

2432
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:33,600
systems with

2433
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,000
you know the universe right in this in

2434
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:36,719
this uh

2435
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:39,600
philosophy so and then we have our own

2436
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,760
karma like our previous actions and

2437
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,400
and um you know have have collected

2438
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:45,120
collectively

2439
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:48,080
formed us right and so when we're faced

2440
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:48,960
with a choice

2441
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,800
like like i wonder do we in fact have

2442
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,480
free will because

2443
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:55,040
all we can really do is like if we're

2444
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,040
just the product of our karma we only

2445
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,159
have one choice

2446
01:23:58,159 --> 01:23:59,440
like it's the choice that we're going to

2447
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,719
make but obviously that's the only

2448
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:02,080
choice that we could have made

2449
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,320
because of all of our previous karma

2450
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,920
right so so

2451
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,600
and in the same way in active inference

2452
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,600
in thinking about active inference

2453
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,560
as um like a computational uh from a

2454
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,480
computational aspect if this is really

2455
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,400
representative of

2456
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,560
you know the brain and how how we think

2457
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,560
and how you know we operate and how we

2458
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:21,679
make decisions

2459
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:23,520
so thinking about active inference

2460
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,199
there's really only one decision that we

2461
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:26,880
could make right like given

2462
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,440
the inputs the sensory inputs and like

2463
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,520
we have this generative model like given

2464
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,440
our model and given the inputs of the

2465
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,440
system and our selected policy

2466
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,120
there's really only one choice that can

2467
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,199
be made like as a result of all this

2468
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,880
like collective computation going

2469
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:41,679
forward

2470
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:42,719
anyway it's just something i've been

2471
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:44,719
thinking about for a while blue it's

2472
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:46,320
it's awesome and i just

2473
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,159
checked on search engine karma as

2474
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:50,320
multi-scale bayesian prior the title is

2475
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,159
not taken yet so anybody who wants to

2476
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:53,679
write that one go for it

2477
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:58,320
sarah alex keeper then marco

2478
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,400
yeah just more random into the mix i

2479
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,320
guess but um

2480
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:05,040
you know i was i was reading about like

2481
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,639
early babylonian

2482
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:08,400
um i don't even know if it was

2483
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,000
philosophers but somebody you know said

2484
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:10,880
oh those guys

2485
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:12,480
those guys weren't scientists and

2486
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:13,920
because xyz

2487
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:16,800
and um of course i i disagreed uh but i

2488
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,560
was just thinking about just generally

2489
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:19,440
the

2490
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:22,639
um evolution of of science and math

2491
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:24,000
um and there just seems to be this

2492
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,040
constant like bifurcation bifurcation

2493
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:30,560
and kind of contrasting this

2494
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:33,440
ever more complex ecosystem to the fact

2495
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,040
that we're

2496
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,440
um really diminishing our like we're

2497
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,360
going through species extinction in the

2498
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:40,960
actual material world

2499
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,719
but in the model world we're going

2500
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:44,480
through this this proliferation

2501
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,639
and that just like totally trips me out

2502
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:48,080
like what does it all mean

2503
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,800
in terms of um connecting those two

2504
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:51,440
things i

2505
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:53,920
i often think about the informational

2506
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:54,960
versus material

2507
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:58,880
and mourn the loss of um

2508
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,960
i'm more in the loss of analog actually

2509
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,320
like this is a big thing for me and i

2510
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,239
don't quite know where to go with it but

2511
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:08,000
um at some point when things became

2512
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,080
digitized we really did decouple um

2513
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,320
behavior from material in a way that i

2514
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,000
think is really significant but i can't

2515
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,239
quite get my head around

2516
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:20,400
where it matters and where to where to

2517
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:22,159
cut out the joint i love that phrase

2518
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:25,040
um and how to how to explore that so if

2519
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,960
anybody has advice about that also

2520
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,760
um but yeah thanks sarah it's like

2521
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,120
marshall mcluhan's

2522
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,440
work and other media theorists on the

2523
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,440
innovation of the written word as one

2524
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,520
kind of uncoupling and you're hinting at

2525
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:39,840
even beyond the written word there's a

2526
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,520
digital uncoupling and how that

2527
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:42,239
influences

2528
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:44,320
us and especially just you captured it

2529
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,679
so well there's a diminishing

2530
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:48,800
biological diversity in some ways as we

2531
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:51,199
modify our environments but at the same

2532
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:52,880
time at least over historical time

2533
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:53,440
periods

2534
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,360
we're proliferating there's more songs

2535
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,800
there's more scientific theories there's

2536
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,000
all these types of things

2537
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,239
but what happens if we reduce our

2538
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:01,840
uncertainty about the biological world

2539
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,360
till it's just something that can't

2540
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:04,639
support

2541
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:07,040
that kind of theoretical proliferation

2542
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:07,920
alex keeper

2543
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:11,840
then marco then scott oh man um

2544
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,280
really interesting stuff going on here

2545
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,120
so i mean i originally raised my hand

2546
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:15,440
just

2547
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,120
because i wanted to explicitly say that

2548
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,560
i do appreciate

2549
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:21,840
marco's um connecting the stuff to

2550
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,920
buddhism and things like that um that's

2551
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:25,199
something that like i hope to write

2552
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:26,159
about once i've

2553
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:27,679
established myself as a serious

2554
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:30,000
philosopher a science type person enough

2555
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,600
that then i can say things about that

2556
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:32,639
and no one will

2557
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:34,239
react badly um because i think it's

2558
01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:36,000
awesome um but

2559
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,440
and and this issue you're bringing up

2560
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:38,880
now with like we're kind of enriching

2561
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,880
the model space at the expense of the

2562
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,560
physical world is really deep and

2563
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:43,840
important i don't know what to say about

2564
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,280
it but it's there

2565
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:49,199
um and uh

2566
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:54,639
yeah um i that's uh

2567
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:56,080
the thing that i was that i wanted to

2568
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,760
bring up i figured since we're all

2569
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,280
talking nicely and getting along about

2570
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,840
this these big you know interesting

2571
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:04,239
large-scale themes that maybe um what we

2572
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:05,120
should do is instead

2573
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,840
argue about like some detailed annoying

2574
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:08,480
thing

2575
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,440
so um so so i just wanted to push um

2576
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,199
this idea that so the reason that i

2577
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:15,520
that i don't see the fep as innocent of

2578
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:17,120
representation is just

2579
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,880
this might this might be a sort of

2580
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,800
because of my provincial view of what

2581
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,719
representation is but i figure

2582
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:24,480
if you think of a mathematical model as

2583
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,880
like a structure right and then we can

2584
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,159
sure you have different windows in that

2585
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:30,000
structure depending on like the

2586
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
the actual mathematical language you use

2587
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,280
to write symbols down

2588
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,280
but maybe this presupposes mathematical

2589
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,639
realism in some sense but like you've

2590
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:37,840
got a structure

2591
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,760
if you've got any system of equations

2592
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:41,760
and then on my view that just represents

2593
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:42,800
whatever

2594
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,639
is isomorphic to that structure and it

2595
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:46,159
could be like a

2596
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:48,560
idealized physical system i don't know

2597
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,159
you could argue about applications and

2598
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:52,000
where applications come in but

2599
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,320
i guess i don't see like how you can

2600
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,360
escape

2601
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:59,199
representation um so let's see what

2602
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:01,920
what that does if i say that yep and the

2603
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:02,560
uh

2604
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:05,040
infamous representation wars earlier on

2605
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:06,320
active streams

2606
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,320
marco then scott then anyone else who

2607
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:11,840
wants to raise their hand

2608
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,159
thanks um uh i'll try to address a lot

2609
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:16,800
of points

2610
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,800
and hopefully meaningful um so

2611
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,159
i didn't catch everything which you said

2612
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:24,320
scott but but i fully agree that there's

2613
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:24,960
this huge

2614
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,120
hugely important issue of dealing with

2615
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,880
externalities right so

2616
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,800
so i i have some issue with saying that

2617
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,159
we simply

2618
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:34,400
throw disorder out in the world i think

2619
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,000
that's maybe a consequence of taking the

2620
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,760
notion of

2621
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:41,360
exuding entropy a bit too oversimplified

2622
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:44,480
entropy isn't strictly disordered um

2623
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,239
because as it's been noted it's all

2624
01:29:46,239 --> 01:29:48,159
about actually almost

2625
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:49,679
pretty much yet every information

2626
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:51,360
theoretic measure is

2627
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,880
subjective it needs to be relative to

2628
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,880
something something often forgotten but

2629
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:57,199
re-emphasize invasionism and now also

2630
01:29:57,199 --> 01:29:58,480
machine learning because they're

2631
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,320
discovering that it's a huge issue

2632
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:02,480
anyways so the point is that that

2633
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:05,600
um first of all i want to also let you

2634
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:06,080
know

2635
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,080
that amongst research and active

2636
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,520
influence this is indeed something

2637
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:10,400
that's being

2638
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,080
addressed right there's for me one of

2639
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,679
the most exciting applications of active

2640
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:14,560
influence

2641
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:17,600
is kind of a philosophy of society or a

2642
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:18,960
philosophy of how we

2643
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,320
engage with each other in the world and

2644
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,159
how i like to say it and bryce huber

2645
01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:23,600
also took that word i think

2646
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,480
of co-regulation we regulate each other

2647
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:27,920
so i wouldn't say that that we

2648
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:30,480
intrinsically exude disorder in the

2649
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:31,679
colloquial sense

2650
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:34,480
it's more about the basic knowledge of

2651
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:35,920
active infants you know you perceive

2652
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:37,440
something you do something the question

2653
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,080
is to

2654
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,560
what extent is that problematic do the

2655
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,560
changes that you enact in the world

2656
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,719
lead to undesirable consequences that's

2657
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:45,600
the only question

2658
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:48,320
really um but indeed we can't really

2659
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:48,719
address

2660
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:50,400
questions systematically in my opinion

2661
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,320
without a framework such as active

2662
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:53,120
influence

2663
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,840
and until then we will be myoptic until

2664
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,679
then we will take these externalities

2665
01:30:57,679 --> 01:30:58,800
for granted

2666
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:01,679
and have to wait we're at the mercy of

2667
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:03,040
our discovery when it becomes too

2668
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,000
problematic

2669
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,520
such as what we saw with industrial

2670
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:07,679
revolution great great progress in the

2671
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:09,120
terms that you care about

2672
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:10,960
then way later you find out the

2673
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:12,800
consequences the catastrophic

2674
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,080
consequences

2675
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:16,480
of externalities at the point than

2676
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:17,920
natural revolution um

2677
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:21,120
ignored um but you know we're working on

2678
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:21,840
it

2679
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:24,239
um and a small side point to add to that

2680
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:24,960
is

2681
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:27,920
um having said that that our exuding of

2682
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:28,480
entropy

2683
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,719
is not problematic in itself it comes

2684
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:32,239
also with a re-emphasis

2685
01:31:32,239 --> 01:31:34,320
on how the entropy we exude are actually

2686
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,239
really great think of children you know

2687
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:37,520
those children are still learning

2688
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:38,800
they've taken all this stuff they don't

2689
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:39,760
understand

2690
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:43,360
and they just express so much chaos

2691
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:45,600
but we love it it stimulates us it

2692
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:46,880
apparently nurtures us you know

2693
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,480
people get happy when they see children

2694
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,000
playing um

2695
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,719
and partly because i think when people

2696
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:53,280
are

2697
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:56,400
doing this chaotic what a chaotic

2698
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,560
weird messy behavior in the real world

2699
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,320
we're able to kind of understand what's

2700
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:01,120
behind that

2701
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:03,120
and i think that's quite a beautiful way

2702
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:05,280
to look at it because then you can also

2703
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:09,040
see that what maybe messy random

2704
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,280
behavior for some person might perceived

2705
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:12,560
as something stimulating

2706
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:15,520
nurturing nourishing uh so so there's a

2707
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,080
nice kind of ecology going on there

2708
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,800
um and and as for blue about free will

2709
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:23,120
so i i hate the notion free will

2710
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,719
mostly used in philosophy because it

2711
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:26,159
seems it almost

2712
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:29,199
always seems like free from determinism

2713
01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:30,719
right and i think that's that's that's

2714
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:32,880
already a trap that you cannot fall into

2715
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,280
instead it's more about autonomy right

2716
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,120
the behavior that you that you engage in

2717
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,239
the actions that you

2718
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:39,920
that you that you make to what extent

2719
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:41,679
are they driven by factors that are your

2720
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:42,560
own

2721
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,800
factors that are more internal rather

2722
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,000
than external

2723
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,120
and then of course you would get the

2724
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:49,280
problem of oh well we don't have a self

2725
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,719
nothing is true internal

2726
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:53,920
sure but okay then that is simply

2727
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:55,840
because that which is internal

2728
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,120
is also cultivated because of the

2729
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:58,880
external but it doesn't take away the

2730
01:32:58,880 --> 01:32:59,840
fact i think

2731
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:01,760
that we can say when there's a

2732
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,679
generative process to what extent is set

2733
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:05,760
due to idiosyncratic factors

2734
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:07,920
um which i think is beautiful because a

2735
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:10,320
lot of these idiosyncratic factors

2736
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:13,120
are cultivated in part their engagement

2737
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:13,440
with

2738
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:16,080
other people with other cultural

2739
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:17,440
artifacts

2740
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:20,560
and so our cultivation of culture

2741
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,880
of narratives of interactions with each

2742
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,719
other our practices our rituals

2743
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:27,840
these are all participating to cultivate

2744
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:28,719
this collective

2745
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:30,800
kind of autonomy to what extent can we

2746
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,159
as a collective

2747
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:33,920
shape the world niche construct the

2748
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:35,920
world in a way that's more adaptive to

2749
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,040
us as an agent

2750
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:40,320
on multiple skills um so

2751
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,800
so also i actually don't really like the

2752
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,560
notion of district choices but more

2753
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,639
fluid navigation imagine if you're

2754
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:48,560
conscious your conscious being

2755
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:51,440
the space that which is conscious you're

2756
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:54,239
more affluently navigating

2757
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:56,239
the density and it expresses itself

2758
01:33:56,239 --> 01:33:58,080
maybe as a choice but i think that too

2759
01:33:58,080 --> 01:33:59,920
is the real kind of case we talked about

2760
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,400
earlier um

2761
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:06,000
so yeah nothing go too long on that um

2762
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,280
yeah and i also really like the notion

2763
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,199
of uh this uncoupling

2764
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:12,159
so for me what the danger is kind of uh

2765
01:34:12,159 --> 01:34:14,159
to use a word used earlier um

2766
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:16,719
there's this body catalytic power to

2767
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:17,360
some

2768
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,239
uh narrative to some practices which

2769
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:21,040
shifts

2770
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:23,600
uh the the fitness of these practices to

2771
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:24,239
a more

2772
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:26,639
overly pragmatic mode of behavior one

2773
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:27,520
other way i want to

2774
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:30,080
want to describe this is basically a lot

2775
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:31,920
of our digital technologies create a

2776
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:34,080
training set that is too decoupled from

2777
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,440
the actual test set that we will

2778
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:37,280
encounter in the world

2779
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:40,960
um what you see in the kind of rise of

2780
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:42,480
some people might know the notion of

2781
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:44,159
meat space and service space when you

2782
01:34:44,159 --> 01:34:46,159
live in service space you're being

2783
01:34:46,159 --> 01:34:49,119
attuned to a world that isn't conforming

2784
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:49,520
to

2785
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:52,320
the meat space and i think exactly that

2786
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,199
is a danger

2787
01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:54,880
and i fully agree with that even though

2788
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,880
i'm much very much ancient denizen

2789
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,480
i do think this is a problem that hasn't

2790
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:00,880
been fully addressed is dangerous

2791
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,560
and the fact that we can't with all

2792
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:03,840
these smart people here that we can't

2793
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,360
formulate it properly or characterize

2794
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:06,239
properly

2795
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:07,760
is another indication that this deserves

2796
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,600
more attention um

2797
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:11,840
yeah so thanks thanks for all the

2798
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:12,800
thoughts

2799
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,560
scott and then anyone else who raises

2800
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,320
their hand

2801
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:19,600
so a small fun point and then a big um

2802
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:22,639
fun point so the small fun point is

2803
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:24,080
marco you're talking about children

2804
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:26,000
throwing off wildness and

2805
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,520
entropy and that's recreational disorder

2806
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,119
right because you know that there's a

2807
01:35:31,119 --> 01:35:32,880
thing there it there's two points on

2808
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,000
that one one

2809
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,320
hot sauce is another one of those right

2810
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,159
because it's it's uncomfortable but

2811
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:39,600
people like it right

2812
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,600
and so on that there's actually a

2813
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:43,119
physical there was an article in nature

2814
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:44,880
this is a small fun point

2815
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:46,800
article in nature magazine that in your

2816
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,800
senses of taste

2817
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,480
there are five senses right there's

2818
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:53,440
actually two channels good and bad

2819
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:56,400
the good channel is sweet which is

2820
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,320
carbohydrates and umami which is

2821
01:35:58,320 --> 01:35:59,360
proteins

2822
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:02,400
the bad channel is bitter and sour which

2823
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:03,520
are poisons

2824
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:06,560
typically an unripe fruit and so salt

2825
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,560
doesn't have its own channel

2826
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,719
salt goes from the good channel until

2827
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:12,400
the level of blood salinity and then

2828
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,320
switches to the bad channel

2829
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,560
so the reason for mentioning that is in

2830
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:18,320
food you use bitter and sour

2831
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:21,760
as highlights as recreational disorder

2832
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,280
right and so they're and they're because

2833
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:25,440
they're not indicative usually of

2834
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:26,480
consumables

2835
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,239
in nature so that was just an

2836
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:29,920
interesting side light on that

2837
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,080
it's a similar to this notion in the

2838
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:34,000
dentist there's this research now

2839
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
that if you have a very painful dental

2840
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,400
procedure you should actually finish up

2841
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,679
the procedure with a little

2842
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:43,280
extra pain but not but a soreness type

2843
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:45,199
pain not a difficult pain because the

2844
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:49,119
mind remembers the last pain experienced

2845
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:51,760
so the the article said do you want a

2846
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:52,960
little pain with that

2847
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:54,960
and the idea was extra irritant and the

2848
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:56,560
ada said they can't

2849
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,239
because of the do no harm they can't

2850
01:36:58,239 --> 01:37:00,000
administer extra pain

2851
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,639
as a matter of policy but the idea was

2852
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:05,119
to hijack the sensation the memory of

2853
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:07,600
the bad experience with the lesser pain

2854
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,440
which is kind of interesting so that was

2855
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:10,719
the small fun points

2856
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:12,159
let me get to the bigger point which i

2857
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:13,920
think um is

2858
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:16,480
uh it goes back to what sarah was

2859
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,239
alluding to

2860
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:20,320
so this is that idea of symbolic and

2861
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:21,600
physical beings

2862
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,280
okay this is something i've been playing

2863
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:24,800
with for a little while it takes a short

2864
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,000
period to describe

2865
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,199
and so let me try that so what if put

2866
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:31,280
put aside all your notions of causation

2867
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:32,480
for a minute i'm going to go back to

2868
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,400
something that seth lloyd raised for me

2869
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,239
a guy at mit wrote programming the

2870
01:37:36,239 --> 01:37:38,800
universe and he asserted in his book

2871
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:41,440
that all interactions since the big bang

2872
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,040
have increased exponentially

2873
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:46,000
all interactions in the universe okay so

2874
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,520
two two particles hit each other then

2875
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,960
they get four particles it's 16

2876
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,000
particles whatever

2877
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,480
and then that iterates out to us okay so

2878
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:53,440
moore's law

2879
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:55,040
you have this exponential increase in

2880
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:56,719
transistor density on chips

2881
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:58,239
that has led the fifth order effect of

2882
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:00,840
that to an exponential increase in human

2883
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,400
interactions okay

2884
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:03,920
because the chips are more ubiquitous

2885
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:05,360
they can digitize more interactions

2886
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:06,880
we're having this discussion now is not

2887
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:08,159
possible before

2888
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:09,840
okay so the more interactions are

2889
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,280
happening exponentially let's go with

2890
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:11,600
that

2891
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:14,080
for a second suspend disbelief and just

2892
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:15,840
imagine that all interactions are

2893
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:17,199
increasing exponentially

2894
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:20,320
okay what happened with humans is

2895
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:24,639
physical space did not offer enough

2896
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:27,840
vectors of engagement

2897
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:30,800
to contain interactions increasing

2898
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:32,159
exponentially and so we had to go to

2899
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:33,920
symbolic space

2900
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:36,239
so there were a couple a couple of other

2901
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:37,679
i'll get back to that in a second

2902
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:40,080
so think of clonal reproduction versus

2903
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:40,800
um

2904
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,880
sexual reproduction clonal reproduction

2905
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,719
you resemble your parents

2906
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:46,960
and for niche space and again this is

2907
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:48,719
not intelligent design but

2908
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:51,840
stay with me for niche space clones are

2909
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,440
not sufficiently varied

2910
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,520
so that if the niche space is changing

2911
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,440
rapidly the clones won't have as much

2912
01:38:57,440 --> 01:39:00,000
survivability mutation random mutations

2913
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,080
can introduce that noise that can allow

2914
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:03,600
the accommodation of

2915
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,760
that change in physical space i think

2916
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,159
what's happening with humans

2917
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:10,719
is that we are becoming information

2918
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:12,320
beings increasingly

2919
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:14,080
and i say that to people like yeah yeah

2920
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:15,600
yeah and then i say hey

2921
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:17,840
you know that 401k that you have if

2922
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:20,560
anybody has any retirement savings

2923
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,800
the i say to them do you think that's a

2924
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,080
pile of groceries

2925
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:26,560
or or a house waiting for you to retire

2926
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:27,520
that is data

2927
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:29,600
that is nothing the system goes you got

2928
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:30,880
nothing it's

2929
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:34,480
totally symbolic so one of the if and to

2930
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:35,199
the extent

2931
01:39:35,199 --> 01:39:37,600
that interactions have and their

2932
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,440
artifacts are increasing exponentially

2933
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:40,159
throughout

2934
01:39:40,159 --> 01:39:42,639
time throughout deep time it was

2935
01:39:42,639 --> 01:39:44,560
inevitable that we moved to

2936
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:47,600
information space because the

2937
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:50,719
the phase space available for solutions

2938
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:51,920
to our problems was

2939
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:55,040
insufficient in physical space we needed

2940
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:57,040
more dimensionality

2941
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:58,639
in order to address things and that's

2942
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:00,960
what language does for us it opens up

2943
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:03,040
dimensions it opens up abstractions it

2944
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:04,800
opens up things called war

2945
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,800
it opens up things called stock markets

2946
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,080
it opens up things called

2947
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:11,119
insurance law governance

2948
01:40:11,119 --> 01:40:14,239
all these things that allow for us to be

2949
01:40:14,239 --> 01:40:16,719
human and the thing that separates us

2950
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:19,040
from other organisms to some extent is

2951
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:22,960
that language is where the mind exists

2952
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:25,760
because that's the symbolic element of

2953
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:27,760
who we've become as information beings

2954
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:28,960
there's a lot there

2955
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:30,480
but i think one of the things that's

2956
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:32,719
been i've been playing with just try to

2957
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:34,639
understand what this might be

2958
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:36,719
is what does it mean to be converted

2959
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:39,760
increasingly to information beings

2960
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:41,679
and not we're not still have a physical

2961
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:42,800
presence but

2962
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,560
this came up first and last point here

2963
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:46,159
this came up first in the identity work

2964
01:40:46,159 --> 01:40:47,600
i did years ago

2965
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:49,119
where people are saying oh you can't

2966
01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:51,199
control me on the internet i said sure

2967
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:51,679
you can

2968
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:53,840
a government a sovereign can put you to

2969
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,679
death they have the monopoly legitimized

2970
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:56,400
violence

2971
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,000
or they can silence you which is we've

2972
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,880
seen happen now and so the physical body

2973
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,560
if i die right now while i'm talking

2974
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:03,840
which some people might like with this

2975
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:04,639
long thing i'm

2976
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:07,360
saying here if i died right now

2977
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:08,639
immediately

2978
01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:11,119
my legal agency to do things on the

2979
01:41:11,119 --> 01:41:12,320
internet would change

2980
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,080
and it's an entanglement it's almost

2981
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:15,760
like a quantum entanglement because it

2982
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,360
would happen instantaneously i cannot

2983
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:19,199
have agency if i'm dead

2984
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:22,560
so anything pre-programmed in my

2985
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,400
phys in my symbolic self could keep

2986
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:26,000
running but the

2987
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,960
physical world then doesn't respect you

2988
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:29,520
as

2989
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:32,880
having a will anymore

2990
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,480
so there is an entanglement so as long

2991
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:36,080
as governments continue to control the

2992
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:37,280
physical body

2993
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:39,280
and have the monopoly of legitimate

2994
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:41,040
violence they can control the digital

2995
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:43,239
body because putting you to death

2996
01:41:43,239 --> 01:41:47,280
de-animates the in

2997
01:41:50,239 --> 01:41:53,360
and we have uh dave then

2998
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:56,239
sarah then stephen and we'll steer it

2999
01:41:56,239 --> 01:41:57,280
back to the paper

3000
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:00,400
and also get towards the last thoughts

3001
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:01,440
that each person

3002
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:03,840
wants to share so again dave sarah

3003
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:04,800
steven and then

3004
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:07,280
anyone else

3005
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:12,320
okay the um when the kids make a lot of

3006
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:13,520
chaos

3007
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:16,560
uh you look at the the

3008
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:18,719
especially one-on-one games that kids do

3009
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:21,440
they are largely dominance games

3010
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:24,320
one kid is going to tend to monopolize

3011
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:25,199
being the

3012
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:28,159
the dominant figure the cowboy the

3013
01:42:28,159 --> 01:42:28,800
sheriff

3014
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:31,760
for a while and then switch back now if

3015
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:33,119
they hang with that

3016
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:36,159
role for more uh more than about 60

3017
01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:36,960
percent

3018
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:39,440
of the time eventually it gets actually

3019
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:41,040
almost sadistic

3020
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:43,760
and it becomes too aggressive the little

3021
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:44,159
and

3022
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:47,119
things get out of hand the dominated kid

3023
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:48,159
cries

3024
01:42:48,159 --> 01:42:50,719
runs off the smart mommy just kind of

3025
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:51,840
gives a little pat

3026
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:54,840
and lets the kids go on their way the

3027
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:57,520
overprotective mom though

3028
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:00,159
almost takes over the bullying and makes

3029
01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:01,520
it a terrible thing

3030
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:05,119
which means that kids can't go back and

3031
01:43:05,119 --> 01:43:08,880
achieve restoration so when the

3032
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:12,480
when the the child who has been

3033
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:15,360
paranoid doesn't have the reassurance

3034
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:16,960
that oh well okay the world does

3035
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:18,400
eventually become okay

3036
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,480
and the kid who's been in the sadistic

3037
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:21,840
infantile mode

3038
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:24,080
doesn't get the reassurance well even if

3039
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:26,960
i was evil mommy for a while

3040
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:29,440
i'm not evil mommy anymore now i'm good

3041
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:30,719
mommy

3042
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:33,040
so another reason to let your kids whack

3043
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,840
on each other and get dirty

3044
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:38,239
okay thank you sarah stephen and then

3045
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:40,799
anyone else

3046
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:42,880
oh um scott's comment kind of reminded

3047
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:45,119
me of what i

3048
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:48,000
what i unconsciously was bridging um

3049
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,440
with respect to

3050
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:52,639
information scott said something i

3051
01:43:52,639 --> 01:43:54,239
verbatim i don't remember but basically

3052
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:56,639
that um something about language and

3053
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:59,760
for me you know language uh languages

3054
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:03,280
as with ecosystems as with um species

3055
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:04,719
extinction like languages

3056
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:07,679
are going extinct and so languages are a

3057
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:09,679
really interesting bridge to this

3058
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:12,800
you know information space um and it

3059
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,760
seems that

3060
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,520
that fact of language is going extinct

3061
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:17,199
seems to contradict something you said

3062
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:18,320
scott but

3063
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:20,480
again because this is i feel like mel's

3064
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,239
show i want mel to like

3065
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:24,560
hook this into whatever she's working on

3066
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:25,360
if if

3067
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:28,639
that makes sense for her steven

3068
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:34,639
tim then mel or anyone else

3069
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:37,679
stephen muted

3070
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:40,239
all right sorry sorry i'm really i'm

3071
01:44:40,239 --> 01:44:41,760
just trying i was looking for a paper

3072
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:42,960
that i was trying to find on something

3073
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,080
this okay um

3074
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:47,199
so what i was gonna say is that

3075
01:44:47,199 --> 01:44:49,360
there's there's a lot of stuff coming up

3076
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:51,040
here absolutely

3077
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:53,199
um and one thing i like about this paper

3078
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:54,239
is it

3079
01:44:54,239 --> 01:44:55,760
it sort of starts from the free energy

3080
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,440
principle and sort of really

3081
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:59,280
pays attention to that and the active

3082
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:01,199
inference and i think that there is

3083
01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:02,320
something important

3084
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:03,440
like because we get into this

3085
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,040
conversations about information and

3086
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:05,760
stuff is

3087
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:08,320
it's like the free energy principle

3088
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:10,080
there's a collary for active inference

3089
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:11,360
of these stages

3090
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:13,920
and different scales and then once that

3091
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:16,400
scaling is happening there's also

3092
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:19,119
a free energy principle that sort of

3093
01:45:19,119 --> 01:45:20,000
scales up

3094
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,760
anyway the natural nature of how these

3095
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:26,719
these societies try to work with these

3096
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:27,360
models

3097
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:30,239
and there's a paper that was i think in

3098
01:45:30,239 --> 01:45:31,679
the physics review of life

3099
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:33,520
and i'm trying to find it but it sort of

3100
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:35,360
talks about how we

3101
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:37,760
naturally try and reduce free energy

3102
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:38,880
over time and i think this is

3103
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:40,480
particularly what's happened

3104
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:43,280
since capitalism in the last 500 years

3105
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:43,760
or

3106
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:46,880
200 years particularly we want to reduce

3107
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,719
or there's a tendency in different ways

3108
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:50,239
to try and reduce

3109
01:45:50,239 --> 01:45:52,159
the amount of free energy out there and

3110
01:45:52,159 --> 01:45:55,040
we can do it more and more because

3111
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:59,040
we can construct and our focus is

3112
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:00,800
constructing

3113
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:04,000
um these um larger scale

3114
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,560
um societies social networks ecosystems

3115
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:07,840
a super organism

3116
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:10,560
as uh mel talks about it and we're kind

3117
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,760
of

3118
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:13,840
we're sort of constructing this niche to

3119
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,360
such an extent that we just take that

3120
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:16,480
for granted

3121
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:18,719
and these perspectives on things and the

3122
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:21,199
rarification is almost

3123
01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:24,800
um de facto but there's also

3124
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,639
probably more traditionally in history

3125
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:28,080
and it's probably also true if you think

3126
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:29,360
like what do you do when you're out in

3127
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:30,320
the middle of the ocean

3128
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,800
you can't control the ocean so now you

3129
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,800
have to try and adapt whatever the winds

3130
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:35,679
are doing

3131
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:40,000
based on what you've got so this

3132
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:45,840
the organism like as an active inference

3133
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:46,639
process

3134
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:50,239
to try and minimize free energy and just

3135
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:51,440
to stay

3136
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:55,119
attuned and alive in a niche

3137
01:46:55,119 --> 01:46:57,840
um is is something that the sort of very

3138
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:59,440
foundational

3139
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:01,679
understanding from physics and chemistry

3140
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:02,560
sort of

3141
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:05,280
still alludes to you know and then we

3142
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:06,719
have these higher the

3143
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:10,560
this ability to construct through action

3144
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:14,320
and um and this is where

3145
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:17,119
we can start to feel that these actions

3146
01:47:17,119 --> 01:47:17,920
that we do

3147
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:19,280
like we talk about that we are

3148
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:21,119
information but

3149
01:47:21,119 --> 01:47:22,639
this is this is the danger of the

3150
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:25,760
verification of information because

3151
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:29,760
we at some extent because we've built on

3152
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:31,920
top of things yeah we kind of construct

3153
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:33,600
things in our niche

3154
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:35,760
which makes it and it is kind of an

3155
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:37,119
informational

3156
01:47:37,119 --> 01:47:39,679
hole in our niche but we're still a

3157
01:47:39,679 --> 01:47:40,960
being

3158
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:44,400
that has to um

3159
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:47,679
dynamically engage with that niche

3160
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:51,199
and that information doesn't travel

3161
01:47:51,199 --> 01:47:53,679
like unlike in traditional inactivism

3162
01:47:53,679 --> 01:47:55,840
that information doesn't come in as like

3163
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:58,800
that's a tree it comes in again in

3164
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:01,040
amongst all this noisy

3165
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:04,080
um statistical variations

3166
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:06,960
and we infer from that so there's this

3167
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:08,239
question about

3168
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:10,639
that danger the information starts to

3169
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:12,480
get rarified and is

3170
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:15,040
and becomes seen as something being

3171
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:16,800
transmitted down the channel

3172
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:18,960
but that's only something that

3173
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:21,360
effectively emerges

3174
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:24,480
once some processing is done so i think

3175
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:26,000
i think that's that's what sort of came

3176
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,920
up for me thank you steven

3177
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:30,560
so in our last couple of minutes we will

3178
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:31,440
go to

3179
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:33,760
tim marco and then anyone else so let's

3180
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:36,000
just keep it brief and summary and

3181
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,560
remember that next week in 14.2

3182
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:40,719
we're going to be on the same paper so

3183
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:42,560
no need to cram it in in the last minute

3184
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:45,040
maybe raise some questions or ask

3185
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:46,400
somebody about their perspective

3186
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:48,159
so that we can mull on it in the next

3187
01:48:48,159 --> 01:48:49,760
week and then come back next week with

3188
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:51,520
the links ready and with the ideas ready

3189
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:52,719
with the questions ready

3190
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:55,040
and read the paper another time so tim

3191
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:57,119
marco and then anyone else

3192
01:48:57,119 --> 01:49:00,159
yeah just uh briefly uh the child's play

3193
01:49:00,159 --> 01:49:01,760
maybe it's obvious and it's like what

3194
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:03,360
everybody already knows about

3195
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:05,199
things but uh it struck me when you were

3196
01:49:05,199 --> 01:49:06,639
talking about it that that's kind of

3197
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:06,960
like

3198
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:08,880
active inference on hyperdrive right

3199
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:11,520
because the the child's play is this

3200
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:13,280
you know generating these fanciful

3201
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:16,000
hypothesis you know like the imagination

3202
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,760
is just going and then that puts them in

3203
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:19,760
a position to enact with interact with

3204
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:20,320
the world

3205
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,400
and maximize surprisal as they run all

3206
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:23,440
over the place and

3207
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:26,159
trip over things right so it's like it's

3208
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:26,960
learning on

3209
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,960
hyperdrive and then the only other thing

3210
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:30,719
i want to say is wrapping up was as i

3211
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:32,159
was going through and reading the paper

3212
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:33,119
and all those

3213
01:49:33,119 --> 01:49:34,880
attempts to answer the question what is

3214
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:36,400
the free energy principle in terms of a

3215
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:37,199
category

3216
01:49:37,199 --> 01:49:38,880
there was one kind of startling

3217
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:40,880
reductive idea that came to mind

3218
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:42,560
it seemed really silly but i'll throw it

3219
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:44,560
out there it could it just be like an

3220
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:46,960
idealization like frictionless

3221
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:49,040
you know because um it's kind of it's

3222
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:52,000
compared to the um

3223
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,760
principle of at least action right but

3224
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:55,119
but if you look at the actual free

3225
01:49:55,119 --> 01:49:56,239
energy principle

3226
01:49:56,239 --> 01:49:59,280
through the layers of statistical

3227
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:00,960
mechanics like all those layers

3228
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:04,320
going into that uh kind of translation

3229
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:06,159
uh the free energy principle almost just

3230
01:50:06,159 --> 01:50:08,000
seems like since we can't really see all

3231
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:08,320
that

3232
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:09,760
through all that cloudiness of

3233
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:11,599
statistical and probability and such

3234
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:13,679
and um it seems like just an

3235
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:14,639
idealization

3236
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:16,400
a way to say we can do something with

3237
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,159
this even though it's this distant thing

3238
01:50:18,159 --> 01:50:19,520
that's gone through this probability

3239
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:20,239
machine

3240
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:21,760
but we can do things with it because we

3241
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:23,440
have this idealization that we call the

3242
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:24,960
free energy principle so it's just

3243
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:27,119
another another option for your what it

3244
01:50:27,119 --> 01:50:29,040
is thing maybe it seems silly i don't

3245
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:29,679
know

3246
01:50:29,679 --> 01:50:33,119
yep mel then marco yeah so

3247
01:50:33,119 --> 01:50:36,320
so interestingly um we've had

3248
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:37,920
we've had in philosophy of science we've

3249
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:40,320
had series of how

3250
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:42,000
science works for a long time and we've

3251
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,159
gone through many kinds of

3252
01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:46,639
uh popular accounts and mainstream

3253
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:48,880
accounts of how science works

3254
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:53,520
and um these have traditionally

3255
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:57,360
emphasized um

3256
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:02,320
series um um and accuracy

3257
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:05,360
right you want you want you want a an

3258
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:08,639
accurate true representation of of

3259
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:12,800
what's going on in nature right um

3260
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:15,119
but uh and and false circulation this

3261
01:51:15,119 --> 01:51:17,520
sort of thing um

3262
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:20,880
the the kind of and rogue view right now

3263
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:25,040
the the the idea du jour

3264
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:27,360
is is really in a lot of ways focusing

3265
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:28,719
on models focusing on

3266
01:51:28,719 --> 01:51:32,719
idealization focusing on pluralism um

3267
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:34,320
there are a lot of great books on this

3268
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:37,280
um michael weisberg's simulation and

3269
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:38,320
similarity

3270
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:40,800
fantastic book great introduction to

3271
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:41,440
models

3272
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:43,679
some of the big debates models um steven

3273
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:45,199
downes has a new like

3274
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:47,360
tiny little just introduction that just

3275
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:48,400
gives you a breakdown of all the

3276
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:49,760
literature and models

3277
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:53,119
and um angela pertochnick

3278
01:51:53,119 --> 01:51:55,520
in my department has a fantastic book

3279
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:57,040
called idealization in the aims of

3280
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:58,320
science

3281
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:01,119
and then um so what was funny to me is

3282
01:52:01,119 --> 01:52:02,080
like i wrote this

3283
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:05,280
paper i wrote this paper and then

3284
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:07,760
the the math is not the territory and

3285
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:09,440
then a few weeks later someone

3286
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:12,400
um uh a professor of my apartment clean

3287
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:13,199
line department

3288
01:52:13,199 --> 01:52:14,840
announced that they were running a

3289
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:17,119
course for the spring term um

3290
01:52:17,119 --> 01:52:20,960
on on this new book by uh

3291
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:24,400
called when maps become the world

3292
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:26,719
which is actually a fantastic book i'm

3293
01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:28,880
really enjoying this book

3294
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:30,639
and it's touching on all of these things

3295
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:32,639
that you guys have been

3296
01:52:32,639 --> 01:52:34,880
talking about like kind of different

3297
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:36,560
modes of representing and

3298
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:39,199
do these things represents or not um and

3299
01:52:39,199 --> 01:52:40,800
how

3300
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:43,280
the kind of feedback between our maps of

3301
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:44,000
the world

3302
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,400
and like cultural differences and how we

3303
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:47,599
how we

3304
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:51,599
represent things and um

3305
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:53,520
where the world is going these kinds of

3306
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:55,280
kind of big picture questions and

3307
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:58,320
it's a really lovely read um

3308
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:01,520
the idea with with models right

3309
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:04,000
is that what they do is chiefly

3310
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,040
idealized

3311
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:07,920
right um if if you look at like the the

3312
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:09,440
the whim facts

3313
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:11,920
um the one side account of of what's

3314
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:13,199
going on in modeling

3315
01:53:13,199 --> 01:53:16,480
right the idea is that um

3316
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:19,520
it's it's not meant to be

3317
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:22,400
a maximally accurate depiction of some

3318
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:24,159
natural system or some natural process

3319
01:53:24,159 --> 01:53:27,920
um it's not it's fidelity

3320
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:30,400
to the world that makes the model useful

3321
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:32,239
but in fact it's the idealization

3322
01:53:32,239 --> 01:53:37,199
it's what gets coarse-grained black box

3323
01:53:37,199 --> 01:53:41,119
away you know it's it's it's it's about

3324
01:53:41,119 --> 01:53:43,280
finding is but latching on to some kind

3325
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:45,040
of key feature

3326
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:47,360
of the system of interest and that's

3327
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:49,360
always mediated by kind of what our

3328
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:50,960
what our questions are as researchers

3329
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:52,639
what our interests are in these natural

3330
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:54,480
systems and researches so it's kind of

3331
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:55,440
value-laden

3332
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:58,800
in a way um and it's discarding the rest

3333
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,639
it's discarding the information that is

3334
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:02,320
inessential to

3335
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:05,599
the question at hand so so idealization

3336
01:54:05,599 --> 01:54:11,119
is at the core of what a model is

3337
01:54:11,199 --> 01:54:14,320
awesome response so any very

3338
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:16,400
rapid final words this is the true

3339
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:17,840
lightning round marco

3340
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:21,280
scott alex kiefer oh dear i'm not good

3341
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:22,159
at lighting around

3342
01:54:22,159 --> 01:54:25,280
um uh well okay very brief

3343
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:27,199
so so i agree about the importance of a

3344
01:54:27,199 --> 01:54:28,719
notion of friction but i do think it's

3345
01:54:28,719 --> 01:54:29,599
already

3346
01:54:29,599 --> 01:54:32,000
uh you get it for free my colleagues say

3347
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,040
you get it for free with active

3348
01:54:33,040 --> 01:54:34,320
influence i think because

3349
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:36,560
you have two situations where i think

3350
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:37,520
you will get friction

3351
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:39,360
one is pathologically stuck when you're

3352
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:40,560
overly rigid

3353
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:42,400
because there's no alternatives of

3354
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,000
sufficient credence the base factor is

3355
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:44,960
too high

3356
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:47,360
so you can't move out of it right so

3357
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:48,800
instead of saying there's a present

3358
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:49,360
friction

3359
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:51,040
it's more like there's an absence of a

3360
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:52,880
lubricant or something or an absence of

3361
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:54,159
a passive

3362
01:54:54,159 --> 01:54:55,599
and the other side if you have too many

3363
01:54:55,599 --> 01:54:57,920
possibilities your base factor can't get

3364
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:59,199
too high because everything's kind of

3365
01:54:59,199 --> 01:54:59,840
similar

3366
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:02,000
so you get stuck in that and i think for

3367
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
me those are two forms of friction slash

3368
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,639
inertia um i just very briefly want to

3369
01:55:06,639 --> 01:55:07,280
wrap up

3370
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:09,360
that big theme of how we scaffold all

3371
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:11,040
these things upon society which is

3372
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:12,800
attractive upon extractions

3373
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:15,520
and the many many dangers that lie there

3374
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:15,920
where

3375
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:17,760
indeed you would have i think an auto

3376
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:19,280
catalytic

3377
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:23,440
pitfall of um trying to cope with the

3378
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:25,280
complexity of the world but falling into

3379
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:26,560
heuristics

3380
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:28,960
and when these heuristics are used to

3381
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:29,840
minimize your

3382
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:32,880
experience consequences of excessive

3383
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:34,320
free energy

3384
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:36,239
and then adopt that heuristic then it

3385
01:55:36,239 --> 01:55:38,080
will spread this kind of self-selecting

3386
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:38,639
manner

3387
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:40,320
as in the people exposed to these

3388
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:42,239
notions such as for example q anonymic

3389
01:55:42,239 --> 01:55:43,360
conspiracies

3390
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:44,960
they heuristically connect everything

3391
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:47,679
together and so you seemingly experience

3392
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:50,159
coherent as long as you don't stick too

3393
01:55:50,159 --> 01:55:51,119
far or commit

3394
01:55:51,119 --> 01:55:54,480
to proper epistemic virtues and and

3395
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:56,880
indeed this will become worse and worse

3396
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:57,679
unless we have

3397
01:55:57,679 --> 01:55:59,840
an alternative a better ground at least

3398
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:01,040
in my opinion

3399
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:03,280
um and i do want to push back a little

3400
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:04,320
bit on this

3401
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:07,440
uh mostly true claim that the models

3402
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:08,880
are just vitalization but i think what's

3403
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:10,639
really really interesting is not just

3404
01:56:10,639 --> 01:56:13,199
models as presented in papers models as

3405
01:56:13,199 --> 01:56:14,560
defined in maths

3406
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:16,080
but take into account the human

3407
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:17,679
enterprise that is science

3408
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:19,760
because everyone has to adopt this model

3409
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:21,840
not just program it didn't some code

3410
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:23,679
way more interesting is what happens

3411
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:25,599
when you adopt or incorporate or

3412
01:56:25,599 --> 01:56:26,639
internalize

3413
01:56:26,639 --> 01:56:28,800
an idealized model and for me that's the

3414
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,159
expressiveness vacuum

3415
01:56:30,159 --> 01:56:32,320
upon incorporating it you will

3416
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:34,000
de-idealize it you will

3417
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,239
fill it up you will make it your own

3418
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:38,239
particular and that expressiveness my

3419
01:56:38,239 --> 01:56:39,440
opinion is what makes

3420
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:41,840
it interesting and what mel has really

3421
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:43,760
laid the groundwork for it might be

3422
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:45,119
but yeah i wish we could have talked

3423
01:56:45,119 --> 01:56:47,280
more about the paper thanks marco

3424
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:49,440
again it's dot two it's not about

3425
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:51,440
answering every question in the dot one

3426
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:53,920
or even the dot two it's about staying

3427
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:54,639
excited

3428
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:56,239
about including as many people in the

3429
01:56:56,239 --> 01:56:58,080
conversation hearing from everybody's

3430
01:56:58,080 --> 01:56:59,440
perspective if you're curious and

3431
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:00,159
listening

3432
01:57:00,159 --> 01:57:02,719
joining the key base actinflab.public is

3433
01:57:02,719 --> 01:57:05,040
a great way to get engaged with action

3434
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:07,599
not just inference so again single kind

3435
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:10,080
of closing thoughts but less personal

3436
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:12,000
review paper my ted talk but more

3437
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,599
what are we going to move forward to

3438
01:57:13,599 --> 01:57:16,000
into 14.2 not that anyone did that

3439
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:19,280
scott alex kiefer steven sled

3440
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:22,480
the painter kandinsky said that

3441
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:27,119
violent societies yield abstract art

3442
01:57:27,119 --> 01:57:28,800
and one of the things i always wondered

3443
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:31,040
is is the reverse also true

3444
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:35,119
is abstraction a form of violence

3445
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,679
and so that's something i i posit to you

3446
01:57:37,679 --> 01:57:39,679
that 2008 financial break was

3447
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:40,880
abstraction

3448
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:42,960
of mortgage instruments that caused a

3449
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:44,000
violence

3450
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,840
of people who were kicked out of their

3451
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:47,360
homes the math

3452
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:49,040
so the math of the mortgage was not the

3453
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:51,199
territory of the lived experience and

3454
01:57:51,199 --> 01:57:52,719
the need for housing

3455
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:54,239
and so that is where the disconnect

3456
01:57:54,239 --> 01:57:56,719
happened so something to be aware of in

3457
01:57:56,719 --> 01:57:58,800
terms of abstraction and the possibility

3458
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:00,480
of it being a form of violence

3459
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:03,119
and the monopoly of legitimate violence

3460
01:58:03,119 --> 01:58:05,599
being a definition of the sovereign from

3461
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:08,400
mills you might think about the monopoly

3462
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:10,080
of legitimated abstraction

3463
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:12,719
being a form of sovereignty thanks thank

3464
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:13,119
you

3465
01:58:13,119 --> 01:58:17,360
scott alex keefer stephen and then sarah

3466
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:19,920
um so one thing i'm still interested in

3467
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:20,639
talking about

3468
01:58:20,639 --> 01:58:23,679
um potentially next week is i guess this

3469
01:58:23,679 --> 01:58:25,679
probably is like a microcosm of some of

3470
01:58:25,679 --> 01:58:27,440
the stuff we've talked about but um

3471
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:30,000
sort of the jaynesian perspective in

3472
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,440
thermodynamics and

3473
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:33,119
in physics and how this relates to all

3474
01:58:33,119 --> 01:58:35,040
this um because

3475
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:37,840
um i think there's potentially something

3476
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:38,800
interesting so i

3477
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:40,320
one thing i like about this paper i will

3478
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:42,239
be brief here one thing i like is that

3479
01:58:42,239 --> 01:58:43,520
it goes through sort of the history of

3480
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:45,280
the formalism of the fep and where it

3481
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:46,159
came from

3482
01:58:46,159 --> 01:58:49,040
and i think in part that's meant to cast

3483
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:49,679
doubt on

3484
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:51,840
any direct connection between the fep

3485
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:54,239
and physics but at the same time

3486
01:58:54,239 --> 01:58:56,560
the jnz perspective in physics is

3487
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:58,080
something the fep inherits from and it

3488
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:00,159
sort of already maybe gets epistemic

3489
01:59:00,159 --> 01:59:02,719
stuff into physics at a lower low level

3490
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:04,080
so i want to talk about the relationship

3491
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:04,880
between

3492
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:06,800
um entropy and thermodynamic sense and

3493
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:08,320
entropy in the shannon sense

3494
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:10,000
if we have a chance thank you we're

3495
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,880
gonna go to mel um with uh first author

3496
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:14,639
privilege and then again anyone can drop

3497
01:59:14,639 --> 01:59:16,400
off if they need to go but let's

3498
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:18,320
bring it to a close together otherwise

3499
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:20,960
mel stephen sarah

3500
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:23,679
yeah actually um i i would really love

3501
01:59:23,679 --> 01:59:24,719
to talk about

3502
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:28,400
that point that you raised um and

3503
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:33,199
my other reviewer i know who it is

3504
01:59:33,199 --> 01:59:37,760
they find it um my other reviewer uh

3505
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:41,760
andrew corcoran actually a great guy um

3506
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:45,119
raised that there's this new paper um

3507
01:59:45,119 --> 01:59:47,920
like gothwald and brown published

3508
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:48,800
december 3rd

3509
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:51,840
2020 that is in

3510
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:55,280
plus computational biology um

3511
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:57,920
and it's uh it's it's really getting

3512
01:59:57,920 --> 01:59:58,880
into changes so

3513
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:00,400
it's really getting into free energy

3514
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:01,920
it's really getting into the jameson

3515
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:04,080
perspective it's like the first

3516
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:07,280
it's like the first time

3517
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:10,320
anyone has really delved into

3518
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:13,520
james and the fep um so

3519
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:15,440
i'd love to discuss that because i

3520
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:17,040
haven't i haven't read it

3521
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:20,719
um yet and i'd love to discuss that

3522
02:00:20,719 --> 02:00:23,760
thank you now julian james which jeans

3523
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:24,560
is that

3524
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:27,599
no et james so so max thank you maximum

3525
02:00:27,599 --> 02:00:30,159
entropy principle i can i can drop this

3526
02:00:30,159 --> 02:00:32,080
link in the in the comments below and

3527
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:32,960
i'd also like to talk about

3528
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:34,000
representation

3529
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:35,199
like different different approaches

3530
02:00:35,199 --> 02:00:37,679
representation and how models represent

3531
02:00:37,679 --> 02:00:41,199
if they do necessarily excellent steven

3532
02:00:41,199 --> 02:00:42,560
and i'll go back to just my regular

3533
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:44,080
camera steven go ahead and then anyone

3534
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:45,119
else

3535
02:00:45,119 --> 02:00:46,800
yeah i think the i would like to hear

3536
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:48,880
more on that uh james the entropy the

3537
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:50,080
maximum entry

3538
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:52,639
approach because i think the whole

3539
02:00:52,639 --> 02:00:53,199
entropy

3540
02:00:53,199 --> 02:00:54,800
agonic thing is really interesting i

3541
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:56,400
think that's this paper like i say is

3542
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:57,520
really tapping into that

3543
02:00:57,520 --> 02:00:59,360
and uh and i suppose one thing i'd like

3544
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:01,280
to say is we talk about models

3545
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:03,360
is um we're using models to get the

3546
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:04,400
dynamics

3547
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:06,320
and there's a slight trap because well

3548
02:01:06,320 --> 02:01:08,080
that makes sense

3549
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:09,599
um but you have to take a perspective

3550
02:01:09,599 --> 02:01:11,440
and verify it and it's like this modern

3551
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:12,159
world we just

3552
02:01:12,159 --> 02:01:14,719
do it but the the key thing that's also

3553
02:01:14,719 --> 02:01:15,760
present with the whole

3554
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:19,360
flows of information is and is that your

3555
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,560
models can reveal

3556
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:23,440
other ways of knowing which are not

3557
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:24,880
perspectival

3558
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:28,000
and are not themselves so the

3559
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,360
interesting thing

3560
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:32,000
about dropping something out of the

3561
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:32,960
active inference

3562
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:35,440
model isn't the model is the dynamic

3563
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:37,360
shifts that the graphs show

3564
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:40,320
when the model's running so that and

3565
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:42,080
that can tap into indigenous ways of

3566
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:42,960
knowing because the thing with

3567
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:44,719
indigenous people i'm saying earlier is

3568
02:01:44,719 --> 02:01:46,239
that they're trying to attune to the

3569
02:01:46,239 --> 02:01:47,920
world

3570
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:50,560
not say what the world is and model it

3571
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:52,400
and that maybe is what we need to do

3572
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:53,040
more

3573
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:55,760
to actually survive on this planet as

3574
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:57,599
it's an ecological collapse because we

3575
02:01:57,599 --> 02:01:58,239
might need to

3576
02:01:58,239 --> 02:02:00,639
sense what is it that we need to

3577
02:02:00,639 --> 02:02:02,800
dynamically

3578
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:06,480
embody that isn't entirely more

3579
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:07,840
liberal so you know we could talk about

3580
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:09,840
that that's enough for me yes

3581
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:13,040
sarah did you have something okay

3582
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:16,080
marco any last thought

3583
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:19,119
i just want to um echo what's been said

3584
02:02:19,119 --> 02:02:20,159
by mel and

3585
02:02:20,159 --> 02:02:22,159
alex i also think that one of the most

3586
02:02:22,159 --> 02:02:23,440
interesting things especially for the

3587
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:24,320
next session

3588
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:25,840
to talk more about the relation with

3589
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:27,440
thermodynamic and information theoretic

3590
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:28,320
entropy

3591
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:30,080
especially because there's one sentence

3592
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:31,840
in males that i just want to point out

3593
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:33,360
so it says the elements of the framework

3594
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:35,040
do not map onto any known features of

3595
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:36,000
real-world systems

3596
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
at least not with any more granularity

3597
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,199
or specificity

3598
02:02:39,199 --> 02:02:40,719
than the constant dynamics of such

3599
02:02:40,719 --> 02:02:42,719
systems but i found a very short

3600
02:02:42,719 --> 02:02:44,320
sentence because it seems that

3601
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:46,239
the granularity or specificity of their

3602
02:02:46,239 --> 02:02:47,520
causal dynamics would be

3603
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:50,000
sufficient to act as a model right and i

3604
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,520
think the really really interesting

3605
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:52,800
thing that hasn't been exported enough

3606
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:53,119
but

3607
02:02:53,119 --> 02:02:55,520
but mel griff's a good uh starting

3608
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:56,560
ground for is

3609
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:58,560
asking more about the relation between

3610
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:00,000
the topic

3611
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,920
thermodynamic and information theoretic

3612
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:04,480
entropy where i think we should

3613
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:07,440
maybe move more or emphasize the the

3614
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:09,440
perspective of interpreting entropy as

3615
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:11,599
distribution how fast homogeneous how

3616
02:03:11,599 --> 02:03:12,480
distributed is it

3617
02:03:12,480 --> 02:03:14,960
as a tendency to kind of flat out to

3618
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:16,239
spread out

3619
02:03:16,239 --> 02:03:18,480
in the thermodynamic sense and then i

3620
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:21,119
think with that conceptual metaphor

3621
02:03:21,119 --> 02:03:22,159
it's not really a metaphor it's just

3622
02:03:22,159 --> 02:03:23,840
true but with that concept in mind i

3623
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:24,800
think it's much

3624
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,480
easier to have a conversation about the

3625
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:27,679
relationship between information

3626
02:03:27,679 --> 02:03:28,400
theoretic

3627
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:30,239
and thermodynamics that being said

3628
02:03:30,239 --> 02:03:33,119
looking forward to uh

3629
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:36,400
thanks so much mel any last thoughts as

3630
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:36,719
the

3631
02:03:36,719 --> 02:03:38,320
first and last author otherwise i'll

3632
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:39,840
close it out

3633
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:42,080
phenomenal thank you this is great yep

3634
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:43,760
it's great

3635
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:46,080
mel thanks so much for not just the

3636
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:47,840
paper but for engaging with us you know

3637
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:49,599
asynchronously on twitter and

3638
02:03:49,599 --> 02:03:50,480
synchronously

3639
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:54,320
on video chat all of the participants

3640
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:56,159
there was so much we brought up today

3641
02:03:56,159 --> 02:03:57,840
and it was just awesome to hear what

3642
02:03:57,840 --> 02:03:58,400
everyone

3643
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:01,119
had to share so if you're listening live

3644
02:04:01,119 --> 02:04:02,000
or in replay

3645
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,079
you're part of the community of practice

3646
02:04:04,079 --> 02:04:05,119
and we want to just

3647
02:04:05,119 --> 02:04:07,040
have you participate however so if

3648
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:08,239
you're curious about something

3649
02:04:08,239 --> 02:04:10,239
post a question if you want to know how

3650
02:04:10,239 --> 02:04:11,520
you can participate just

3651
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:13,280
reach out to us through any number of

3652
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:14,639
these mechanisms

3653
02:04:14,639 --> 02:04:17,440
other than that on january 26th we will

3654
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:18,719
be right back here

3655
02:04:18,719 --> 02:04:21,760
for 14.2 and we'll deal with some of

3656
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:22,560
these questions

3657
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:24,400
everybody will come with a few new

3658
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:25,760
digested thoughts

3659
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:27,840
a couple of polished questions and we

3660
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:29,599
will go from there so thanks again

3661
02:04:29,599 --> 02:04:30,560
everybody

3662
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:36,880
and we'll see you next week
