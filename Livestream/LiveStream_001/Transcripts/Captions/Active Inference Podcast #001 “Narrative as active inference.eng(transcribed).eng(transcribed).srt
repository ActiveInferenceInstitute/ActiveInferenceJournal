1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,279
hello everyone

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,200
welcome to team com podcast one

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,840
tentatively titled really looking

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,400
forward

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,440
to this discussion i'm daniel and

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,000
along with me are yvonne alex do you

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,439
want to introduce yourself briefly

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,640
yeah my name is alex i just can't say

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,039
what

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,320
i'm a researcher in system management

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,360
school in moscow

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,800
by now just for protocol

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,399
hello my name is ivan i'm just

14
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,079
interested in internet active inference

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,360
stuff great well

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,840
to be interested in active inference is

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,719
all that's needed

18
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,360
for this paper and this discussion so

19
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,000
let's

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,199
get right into it we're gonna

21
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,920
structure the discussion like this first

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,600
we'll start with some warm-up

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,799
questions then we'll get to the paper

24
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,920
itself

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,280
and this isn't the end-all be-all

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,000
format for paper discussions but a few

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,080
big areas that we'll hit upon

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,080
we'll ask what are the big questions are

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,240
this paper what do the authors want to

30
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,360
address

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,439
then we'll go through the abstract line

32
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,600
by line because it's really important

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,000
to understand how the authors summarize

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,920
their own work

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,159
we'll look at the road map of the paper

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,560
at which sections come in which order

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,280
so that we can have a big bird's eye

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,320
perspective

39
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,360
on where the paper is going then

40
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,079
we'll go down into some definitions and

41
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,759
claims that the authors make

42
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,920
we can ask whether we agree with their

43
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,159
definitions or whether their claims

44
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,600
resonate with how we think about the

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,560
world then we'll have time

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,880
to have any questions that we want to

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,680
address

48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,719
that are about the paper and then also

49
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,600
there's a few slides at the end where we

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,759
prepared some visualizations

51
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,160
about markov blankets and about active

52
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,560
inference itself

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,800
so let's get to the warm-up questions

54
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,920
and so

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,480
either of you can maybe give a first

56
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,560
thought here what what is a narrative

57
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,840
and how is a narrative different than a

58
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
story

59
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,280
and this can come from the free energy

60
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,200
active inference perspective or not

61
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,400
but one of you two guys go ahead

62
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,080
uh at the moment uh

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,400
i believe what first we what we need to

64
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
do what we need to define with

65
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,599
difference because uh if we have

66
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,720
two words uh it would mean something

67
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,000
different

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,200
but as in any case it's

69
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,400
depends on perspective and interest

70
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,480
from how we see it and um

71
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,120
[Music]

72
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,239
maybe his uh narrative and

73
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,959
ontology is also some different and

74
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,080
ontology is

75
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,840
different from the story as well so

76
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,120
some kind of more formal

77
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,640
definition for it we have a

78
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,080
great review

79
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,519
on different papers presented

80
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,720
in the text and so it

81
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,760
looks like as state of the art

82
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,480
in this field from scientific point of

83
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,480
view

84
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,599
but we if we go more engineering way and

85
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,959
trying to find

86
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,959
a way to and approaches to use

87
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,519
functions of his narrative

88
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,640
scientologists

89
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,680
and lately

90
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,200
stories very nice

91
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,439
and we'll get to see exactly their

92
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,239
definition

93
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,760
of narrative it's actually the first

94
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,439
sentences of the paper

95
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,439
uh yvonne anything there no

96
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,798
cool another question that is

97
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,279
sort of a fundamental in communication

98
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,160
but also

99
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,880
very important applied question is how

100
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,880
individual and collective narratives

101
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,840
interact

102
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,520
so do groups genuinely have narratives

103
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,080
or do group narratives just consist of

104
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,039
individual narratives

105
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,320
we can i mean we can move past these

106
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,040
these are really

107
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,639
just for warming up and thinking about

108
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,759
what the paper is arising out of and so

109
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,560
just the last

110
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,960
warm-up question that anyone could like

111
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,759
a stretch

112
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,400
before hitting the paper before you run

113
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,919
the paper you might want to stretch with

114
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,120
these questions

115
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,360
and just to to really get us thinking

116
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,639
big about

117
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,759
what this paper could be about and what

118
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,680
science can tell us about narratives

119
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,600
this question is what does a functional

120
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,919
evolutionary or statistical perspective

121
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:10,880
on narratives

122
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,360
look like so instead of just approaching

123
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,800
it from a psychological

124
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,360
or from an anthropological perspective

125
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,080
how can we

126
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,479
take it deeper and connect it to other

127
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,759
areas

128
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,080
any last warm-up thoughts or we can just

129
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,039
go right into the paper

130
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,639
uh maybe

131
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,720
yes and it's about introduction

132
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,400
and first sentence in introduction um

133
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,680
about narratives a report of real or

134
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,639
imagined events and maybe i was not so

135
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,759
close inside but

136
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,919
maybe we need to define some

137
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,919
definition and perspective about events

138
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,199
what is it events for us at

139
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,639
this moment and in

140
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,400
in systems uh and events in uh

141
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,680
active inference what could be

142
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,280
here like a fundamental for us

143
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,160
good question and we're going to return

144
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,280
to their exact

145
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,199
definition of narrative we'll have it up

146
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,479
on a later slide

147
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,880
so keep that thought around and let's

148
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,720
just go into the paper

149
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,479
so the paper we're going to be

150
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,840
discussing

151
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,240
is called narrative as active inference

152
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
an integrative account of the functions

153
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,280
of narratives

154
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,840
and it was posted on psi archive which

155
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,360
is a pre-print server

156
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,120
the version we're looking at is from

157
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,520
june 18 2020

158
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,360
and the first author's name is nabil

159
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,880
buzagarin apologies for pronunciation

160
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,199
and uh there are several other authors

161
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,639
as well

162
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,520
the paper really sets out to address a

163
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,000
few

164
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,199
big questions the first question

165
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,160
uh is what does the concept of active

166
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,759
inference offer us

167
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,599
in the context of narrative or when

168
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,759
discussing the concept of narrative

169
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,160
that's the big question and then to take

170
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,880
it down

171
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,479
one more level they're going to

172
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
specifically ask how does this active

173
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,319
inference perspective

174
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,880
on narrative address questions related

175
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,919
to identity

176
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,800
episodic memory future projection event

177
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,680
segmentation

178
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,680
which is actually i trimmed it but it's

179
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,120
related to what you're discussing

180
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,319
storytelling enculturation and more

181
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,199
so let's get to the abstract um it's

182
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,400
kind of simulating

183
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,160
reading a paper you know i start from a

184
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,400
title then we'll go through the abstract

185
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,720
and then we'll go into the definitions

186
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,240
next but let's just go

187
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,000
bit by bit through the abstract so we

188
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,240
can really see what the authors think

189
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,800
they're doing in this paper

190
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,000
first sentence is basically saying that

191
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,440
narratives are important

192
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,639
and other people have recognized it

193
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,879
the second sentence says that research

194
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,080
has identified

195
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,919
several functions of narratives that are

196
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,120
important

197
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,840
uh if if anyone has any thoughts that

198
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,560
they

199
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,479
want to add on to one of these sentences

200
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,919
or disagreement

201
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,800
they can uh also use the raise hand

202
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,160
feature in jitsi

203
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,560
so on the bottom left the hand if you

204
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,440
want to uh

205
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,720
say something um the abstract is not

206
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,160
too contentious in this paper

207
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,199
this is the key signal phrase that's

208
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,200
marking what they're actually doing in

209
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,679
the paper they're going to characterize

210
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,000
social and cognitive functions those are

211
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,360
the plurality of functions

212
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,360
of narratives in terms of the framework

213
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,479
of active inference

214
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,839
which we're going to talk a lot more

215
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,600
about in detail what is active inference

216
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,320
and then they say that active inference

217
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,120
is

218
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,200
depicting the fundamental tendency of

219
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,959
organisms to adapt

220
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,720
update and maintain inference about

221
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,560
their environment that's sort of the

222
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,240
beginnings of a definition of active

223
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,600
inference which we're going to come back

224
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,200
to

225
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,160
they then review literature related to

226
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,640
the function of narratives in all of

227
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,040
those

228
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,519
areas that we discussed identity event

229
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,720
segmentation episodic memory etc

230
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,560
and then the last sentence of the short

231
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,080
abstract is

232
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,240
we recast these functions of narratives

233
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,160
in terms of active inference

234
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,080
outlining a parsimonious model that can

235
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,000
guide future developments in narrative

236
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,480
theory

237
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,800
research and clinical applications and

238
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,839
so this is kind of

239
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,720
a common theme that we see in active

240
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,360
inference

241
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,519
and free energy principle related

242
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,800
research at this

243
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,839
current moment in time the

244
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,600
second half of the 2010s and the 2020

245
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,480
period

246
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,320
which is um the authors

247
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,040
usually consisting of a team with some

248
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,640
disciplinary experts

249
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,160
as well as some more free energy or

250
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,200
active inference

251
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,480
experts will approach an area like

252
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,920
narratives or depression or evolution

253
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,800
and they'll seek

254
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,920
to integrate multiple phenomena under a

255
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,120
common model

256
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,560
so instead of saying well you got the

257
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,160
short-term memory system and the

258
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,760
long-term memory and the declarative

259
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,200
memory and this you know this type of

260
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,079
memory

261
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,519
they'll sort of recast a lot of previous

262
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,800
models into one common framework

263
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,360
so that's what active inference can do

264
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,360
and the idea would be that by having an

265
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,640
integrated framework

266
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,640
we're going to get multiple benefits the

267
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,640
first is that we have an elegant and a

268
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,079
parsimonious way

269
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,519
for addressing the otherwise unrelated

270
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,240
phenomena

271
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,640
arising from the same physical system so

272
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,079
we shouldn't have 10 models for

273
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,839
describing 10 different kinds of memory

274
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,720
in the brain

275
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,320
we should have one model for memory in

276
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,560
the brain and then different aspects of

277
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,399
it could relate to these

278
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,839
phenomena that we want to actually

279
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,399
explain and the second thing so it gives

280
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,399
internal coherence to the study of

281
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,800
systems to use an integrated framework

282
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,440
but also it provides external coherence

283
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,560
because now

284
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,959
the information or the thermodynamic

285
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,560
components of the brain can be

286
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,320
considered alongside something like a

287
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,760
computer

288
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,800
so that's the abstract

289
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,040
here's the road map of the paper and i

290
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,279
just copied out the section

291
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,480
titles and this is just

292
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,320
so that even if some of these section

293
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,079
titles sound a little bit

294
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,000
like they're not fully specified or

295
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
anything this is just so we can

296
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,920
first sketch out the whole arc of the

297
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,240
paper the first section is called the

298
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,760
function of narrative

299
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,440
and you can see they're going to be

300
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,800
talking about

301
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,680
narrative from a non-free energy

302
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,680
non-active inference perspective

303
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,279
they're going to be drawing on other

304
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,880
research for example

305
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,760
relating narrative to identity meaning

306
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,519
making which is also sometimes called

307
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,720
sense making

308
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,279
and coherence as well as storytelling

309
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,639
and they'll talk about the narrative

310
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,160
practice hypothesis which

311
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,200
is from social psychology the second

312
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,800
section of the paper

313
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,519
is explicitly about active inference

314
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,480
where they define

315
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,000
active inference and then they

316
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,480
specifically relate how active inference

317
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,519
can be thought of when looking at human

318
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,320
social and cultural life

319
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,720
and then the third section of the paper

320
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,920
no surprise

321
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,200
is narratives as active inference and so

322
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,040
here is where they're going to combine

323
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,600
section

324
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,800
one and two into discussing

325
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,040
how framing narrative as active

326
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,839
inference

327
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,160
gives us these features of a model that

328
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,360
we'd like to see

329
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,160
like it's elegant it's parsimonious it

330
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,160
has high explanatory power

331
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,920
it might lead to unique predictions

332
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,440
unique explanations

333
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,680
uh unique experiments that we could test

334
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,200
these are all the things that we care

335
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,720
about from a scientific

336
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,760
and a meta scientific perspective so

337
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,320
that's the big road map of the paper and

338
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,959
now we can

339
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,000
finally get into the first two sentences

340
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,880
of the paper

341
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,920
which are right here and alex this is

342
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,360
where you were talking about the

343
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,160
definition

344
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,720
of narrative so it's great that they

345
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,079
begin the paper

346
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,079
just with the definition of narrative

347
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,079
and i'll just read it out and then

348
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,760
either of you or both of you i'd love to

349
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,680
hear your thoughts where does this

350
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,560
resonate with you

351
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,760
where does it not resonate they write

352
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,839
narratives are reports of real or

353
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:20,880
imagined events

354
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,320
which can be presented in language

355
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,000
either verbally or textually

356
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,240
or through sequences of images or other

357
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,519
symbols

358
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,680
that's their first short definition and

359
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,040
the second sentence is

360
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,519
the narrativity of these reports lies

361
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,880
not just in their content

362
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,480
which may point directly to specific

363
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,959
events but also in their structure

364
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,279
that is the ways in which the linguistic

365
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,959
or other symbols convey a set of

366
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,480
relationships among events

367
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
especially temporal relationships so

368
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,839
what do you guys think

369
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,680
here for me what is important here that

370
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,800
uh its present idea

371
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,680
about uh

372
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,839
ability uh in a language to

373
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,760
present

374
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,959
to represent maybe to a person firstly

375
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,399
and he can share its uh in texts and

376
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,279
describe himself and maybe try to

377
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,320
understand

378
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,199
somebody using these symbols

379
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:45,839
yep yep yvonne anything

380
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,160
no not right now sure so i think uh

381
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,560
there's a few other words that we might

382
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,199
want to

383
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,480
also define and this is the nature

384
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,560
of language right we could always go and

385
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,959
ask well what is a report

386
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,639
is the narrative only real if it's

387
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,480
reported or what's the difference

388
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,839
between real and imagined

389
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,240
or what do you mean symbols so there's a

390
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,040
lot of

391
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,760
play in these definitions still but the

392
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,720
features that i

393
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,000
found interesting the first part is

394
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,720
that narratives are specific reports of

395
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,560
real or imagined events

396
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,720
so it's kind of like if a tree falls in

397
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,160
a forest and

398
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,959
no one hears it did it happen uh if no

399
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,399
one reports the narrative

400
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,560
there is no narrative okay if nobody's

401
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,240
speaking there's no narrator

402
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,759
so a narrative is a declarative event

403
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,680
in that telling the narrative or

404
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,360
experiencing it

405
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,399
is what makes it real and then also

406
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,440
this idea that a narrative is a sequence

407
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,639
of symbols

408
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,759
whether they're verbal symbols or text

409
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,680
symbols these symbols are representative

410
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,959
as symbols are and to bring it to the

411
00:15:58,959 --> 00:15:59,440
second

412
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,560
section the string of symbols

413
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,800
it's not just that there's a shannon

414
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,560
entropy of the string or there's some

415
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,880
surprise or there's some sequence

416
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,560
it's actually that the representative

417
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,320
nature of the symbols

418
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,959
is inferring something about specific

419
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,600
events again either real or imagined

420
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,399
also how the events are linked and this

421
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,560
is especially important in the context

422
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,279
of things happening through time

423
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,600
so that's their definition of narrative

424
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,399
and

425
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,519
pretty shortly after that we get to

426
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,240
one of their fundamental claims and

427
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,920
there's going to be

428
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,560
a key sentence here that is actually

429
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,000
meta scientific

430
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,800
in the sense this is their evaluation of

431
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,680
the research

432
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,639
literature they say that narrative has

433
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,959
socio-interactional

434
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,440
and cognitive representational functions

435
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,279
however the extant literature

436
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,000
tends to focus on only one of these two

437
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,120
aspects

438
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,800
so in other words they're saying that

439
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,360
the narrative has socio-interactional

440
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,079
roles

441
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,720
for example the narrative of a country

442
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,199
is often manifested through politics or

443
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,319
through politics

444
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,599
uh or through policy and so there are

445
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,839
social implications for the interactions

446
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,439
between different narratives

447
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,160
and then that sort of bodies interacting

448
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,280
with each other

449
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,599
but then inside of the head there's also

450
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,280
this cognitive representational

451
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,799
component of narrative

452
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,959
and that has to do with how different

453
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,880
people experience narratives or how

454
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,080
different altered states of

455
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,720
consciousness

456
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,240
influence the ability to generate

457
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,640
narrative and then they write

458
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,760
in this paper we propose a unified model

459
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,000
that accounts for both of the functions

460
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,120
of narrative

461
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,799
so this is where they're taking stock

462
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,720
of the previous state of the literature

463
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,080
they're saying look

464
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,760
narrative literature falls into

465
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,400
basically either one of two categories

466
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,039
either it's about treating the person as

467
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,320
a black box

468
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,480
and then looking at how narratives occur

469
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,240
in the social context

470
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,880
or it goes the other approach which is

471
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,440
it zooms in on the brain or on the mind

472
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,520
from a neuro or from a psychological

473
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,480
perspective

474
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,919
and that ends up giving

475
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,640
not enough emphasis to the social

476
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,280
components of narrative

477
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,760
so my questions for you two are what are

478
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,799
the implications

479
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,440
of this unresolved dichotomy and what

480
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,840
might an answer to this problem look

481
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,200
like in other words what would it look

482
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,799
like to have a satisfying

483
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,679
science of narratives and what are the

484
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,559
implications

485
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,120
of us not having that satisfying science

486
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,840
of narratives

487
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,840
uh if there will be

488
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,520
an implication for one common model

489
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,840
and it will be possible to

490
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,440
predict outcomes

491
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,919
for testing this model in different

492
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,559
applications this could be more

493
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,520
scientifically

494
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,960
or at least engineering

495
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,880
yep and another engineering perspective

496
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,080
on this would be

497
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,480
false positive and false negative so

498
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,840
let's just say that we have

499
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,160
two different methods for dealing with

500
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,440
narrative one of them

501
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,200
doesn't give enough emphasis to what's

502
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,960
happening inside of the head

503
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,600
that's the socio-interactional one and

504
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,880
then the other

505
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,200
perspective on narrative doesn't give

506
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,480
enough

507
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,919
emphasis on what's happening outside of

508
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,000
the head and so we're going to end up

509
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,320
with false positives and false negatives

510
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,000
we're going to end up with lost in

511
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,679
translation we're going to end up with

512
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:46,640
situations

513
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,880
where one approach leads to one

514
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,640
prediction but then a different approach

515
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,320
leads to a different prediction

516
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,080
and without some sort of higher level

517
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,000
theory to help us resolve that

518
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,640
there's just not going to be clarity so

519
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,200
we can

520
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,960
see that having this unresolved

521
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,120
dichotomy not just is it theoretically

522
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,640
unsatisfying

523
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,360
uh it'd be like if you had one model for

524
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,360
physiology that happened you know just

525
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,080
in the liver

526
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,799
and one and outside of the liver but uh

527
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,640
that would be theoretically unsatisfying

528
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,400
but also it might lead to

529
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,360
some very real consequences when models

530
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,320
don't agree

531
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,559
and then people end up acting off of the

532
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,240
bad information

533
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,120
so no surprise here but they're going to

534
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,720
resolve this dichotomy

535
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,600
with active inference so here's how they

536
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,159
define

537
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,559
active inference and then we're going to

538
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,600
spend a lot of time

539
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,280
talking about active inference and

540
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,799
adding in some more figures because

541
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,480
there aren't any figures in this paper

542
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,080
which is totally fine

543
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,600
um but the crux of the issue

544
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,840
is about applying active inference to

545
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,600
the idea of narrative so we really want

546
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,840
to understand what active inference is

547
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,679
and then we'll use the active inference

548
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,760
framework to potentially reduce

549
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,679
our uncertainty about what narratives

550
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,280
are so they write

551
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,440
active inference is a new theory that

552
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,880
provides an account of the nature

553
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,360
and mechanisms of knowledge driven

554
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,679
context appropriate action

555
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,440
originally proposed as a theory of the

556
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,280
structure function and dynamics of the

557
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,080
brain

558
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,400
in the 2010 first in paper active

559
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,520
inference provides

560
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,679
a broad framework that has been extended

561
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,440
to explain living organisms and

562
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,480
cognitive systems across multiple scales

563
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,000
so that's the definition of active

564
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,799
inference and i i just tried a little

565
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:27,200
first

566
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,640
stab there's two big key

567
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,440
terms and they come up again and again

568
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,200
in this discussion and in others and

569
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,720
that's active inference

570
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,200
which is i put it in idea cloud because

571
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,559
this is the big idea

572
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,320
that we're talking about and on the

573
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,400
bottom right there is the free energy

574
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,280
principle

575
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,760
and the free energy principle is the

576
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,640
background

577
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,000
it's the uh it's the model that we're

578
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,640
working

579
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,320
under that we get active inference from

580
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,080
and in the 2018 interview

581
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,559
where fristen says that the free energy

582
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,000
principle is beyond

583
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,320
falsification it's at the axiomatic

584
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,120
level

585
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,039
so that doesn't mean it's indubitably

586
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,760
correct in fact axioms exist

587
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,760
beyond the space of correct versus

588
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,600
incorrect because correct and incorrect

589
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,320
only exist

590
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,039
within the context of an axiomatic set

591
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:19,679
and first

592
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,200
compares free energy principle to

593
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,799
something more like the principle of

594
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,760
least action

595
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,480
from physics in the sense that other

596
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,120
patterns

597
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,039
are fit within that so it's kind of like

598
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,799
the it's the canvas that we're going to

599
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,080
be drawing on

600
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,720
and so here are a few of the key things

601
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,000
that combine

602
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,360
to give us active inference one of them

603
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,760
is

604
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,640
informational thermodynamics another

605
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,200
important

606
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,159
topic is informational foraging and the

607
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,159
that's the active part is the actual

608
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,000
foraging for information

609
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,480
then another term that comes into play

610
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,280
is deep models so temporally deep models

611
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:55,760
with a

612
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,320
deep past and a deep future predictive

613
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,280
component

614
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,799
as well as you could almost call them

615
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,880
thick models so models that include

616
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,640
multiple modalities or multiple

617
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,000
perspectives

618
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,720
there's an element of the integration of

619
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,280
ecology evolution and development

620
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,880
so we're not looking to make a science

621
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,280
of narratives that only applies to

622
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,080
tweets or only applies to novels we want

623
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,880
something that's

624
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,520
fully grounded in ecology evolution and

625
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,559
development

626
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,720
and then also there's this key term the

627
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,559
markov blanket which we're going to go

628
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,679
into a little bit

629
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,400
more detail in the coming slides but

630
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,039
first off

631
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,200
what do you think about that what is

632
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,120
that uh

633
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,399
what does that make you guys think about

634
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,360
great overview about domains

635
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,799
and basic stones

636
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,159
for his ideas

637
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,039
so really as free energy principle the

638
00:23:59,039 --> 00:23:59,840
principle

639
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,559
gave us opportunity

640
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,480
freedom to try to implement it to

641
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,679
explain different uh

642
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,200
systems and organisms so and

643
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,159
active inference as a more focused

644
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,080
on his domain around

645
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,360
the brain about how its work on

646
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,960
cognitive and metacognitive levels

647
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,320
and so on yep

648
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,720
and that's the key difference between

649
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,679
the

650
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,960
axiomatic principles which cannot be

651
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,679
falsified

652
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,919
in other words there's no observation

653
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,120
that would falsify

654
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,679
the free energy principle whereas

655
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,440
evolution by natural selection

656
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,080
just to give an example uh it could be

657
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,960
falsified

658
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,000
if we found some sort of uh anomalous

659
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,960
explanation or an anomalous observation

660
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,520
then

661
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,840
it could reduce the likelihood that a

662
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,720
certain model

663
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,240
is true in other words specific

664
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,000
hypotheses arise

665
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,360
from these other fields that i have

666
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,840
written in the black or the dashed line

667
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,600
like if you find that the organism is

668
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,480
only looking

669
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,880
one second into the future it's not a

670
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,679
deep model

671
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,200
so you can test whether it's a deep

672
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,279
model or not you can test the role of

673
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,000
ecology evolution development etc

674
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,480
you could look at whether the actions of

675
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,080
the organism are consistent with

676
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,919
thermodynamics you know if more energy

677
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,520
is coming out of the system than coming

678
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,159
in

679
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,559
then it violates thermodynamics so

680
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,000
that's something specific

681
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,600
and on the other hand free energy

682
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,440
principle is a little bit different

683
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,320
and uh there's so much to this and you

684
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,279
know every

685
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,520
every podcast we do every discussion we

686
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,400
have

687
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,279
we could spend so long discussing the

688
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,159
fundamentals

689
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,000
and so i feel like it's a good approach

690
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,559
each time it's like a coat of paint

691
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,400
we're just to keep on coming over the

692
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
same topics again and again

693
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,080
and going into them a little bit more

694
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,840
deeply each time

695
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,320
so let's look a little bit at the markov

696
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,520
blanket and here

697
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,000
i'm drawing from a paper of gallagher

698
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,640
and allen 2016 which is in the synthesis

699
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,760
the journal

700
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,080
and this paper is pretty nice because

701
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,440
it's not by firstin

702
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,919
uh it's a rarity you know but it's not

703
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:18,720
by fristen

704
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,279
but it contextualizes the work of

705
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,960
fristin and collaborators

706
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,679
from a philosophical perspective so here

707
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,520
are philosophers trying to talk about

708
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,279
markhaw blankets

709
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,559
they're focusing on this center node a

710
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,400
and they write the circle that's shaded

711
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,840
in gray the big one

712
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,559
represents the markov blanket of node a

713
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,840
this consists of a

714
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,799
its children parents and parents of

715
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:43,679
children

716
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,640
so here is how i'm thinking about this

717
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,919
pedigree

718
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,039
like a family tree is a metaphor for the

719
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,039
generative process that leads to

720
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,520
people or leads to a person you know

721
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,799
that any person

722
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,039
has to have two parents and if any

723
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,799
children there has to be a partner so

724
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,760
that's like s

725
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,880
in this the parent of child so

726
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,120
now what what's interesting to note is

727
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,279
in a world where the rules are different

728
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,080
for example

729
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,159
if three people were required to create

730
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,480
a child or we were able to create

731
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,960
a cloning technology where only one

732
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,520
person was required to create a

733
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,679
another human then the rules of this

734
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,960
system would be different and so the

735
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,559
mark called blanket would be drawn

736
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,520
differently

737
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,880
so generalize this idea

738
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,919
of a structural form or a scheme a

739
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:34,640
schema

740
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,440
for causal forces so it's like the two

741
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,399
parents cause

742
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,960
a now this is not saying oh those are

743
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,039
the only two things that cause a person

744
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:43,679
to exist

745
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,679
of course a civilization is required and

746
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,720
all these other things

747
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,039
but just within the context of a

748
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,159
pedigree

749
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,159
the all the only information you need to

750
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,600
know is the parents

751
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,640
and then there's times where

752
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,559
these connections that are being

753
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,399
extracted are statistical and there's

754
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,320
times where they're causal and this is

755
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,480
sort of um an interesting point

756
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,799
because it really gets at the heart of

757
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,200
what do these lines represent

758
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,799
and so there's times where the real

759
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,520
world system we want we don't know

760
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,919
about where the edges are and we want to

761
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,480
use observed data to get the edges so we

762
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,240
have a bunch of stock prices

763
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,320
and we want to run a model that says

764
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,520
okay when gold

765
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,000
goes up then we want an arrow from the

766
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,039
gold node to

767
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,520
some other node for when the price

768
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,159
responds

769
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,720
in relationship to gold so that's like a

770
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,679
statistical

771
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,480
or numerical extraction of these edges

772
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,120
and that

773
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,120
is uh related to approaches like

774
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,720
structural equation modeling

775
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,320
sem modeling or causal entropic

776
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,360
uh type of causal entropic forces and

777
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,080
then

778
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,000
there's other times like in the case of

779
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,919
this graph where the relationships are

780
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,200
genuinely causal

781
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,880
so that's where the edge is actually

782
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,240
representing a cause

783
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,399
effect relationship of the states of the

784
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,440
world

785
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,760
so i'm going to nuance this marcotte

786
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,720
blanket drawing

787
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,320
a little bit so here it says

788
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,480
in small script the subpartition of

789
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,399
internal and external states is going to

790
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,840
occur according to the free energy

791
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,600
principle this is the caption of their

792
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,919
figure and then i just added extra

793
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,080
colors instead of just having the

794
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,600
subscript so i blacked out the hidden

795
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,039
external states

796
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,120
to really emphasize that the things that

797
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,600
are outside of the markov blankets

798
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,799
are are truly speculative causes

799
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,640
so in this case it's like we don't know

800
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,080
who the grandparents of

801
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,799
a are we know that something led to the

802
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:37,600
parents

803
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,399
but we truly don't know what they are

804
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,840
and then we know that something has to

805
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,039
lead to the parents

806
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,640
of the child but again we don't know

807
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,000
where they are and then there could be

808
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,600
downstream effects of the child but we

809
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,720
don't know what they are

810
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,600
and so a like the focal individual

811
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,600
what's happening inside of that green

812
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,880
node is uh the internal states of a

813
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,880
the system and focus the system of

814
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,000
interest

815
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,240
and then you can think of the things

816
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,279
that a

817
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,399
causes whether by itself or with a

818
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,520
collaborator

819
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,840
are like the active the active states

820
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,240
those are the emitted actions of a

821
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,520
and then everything that is coming into

822
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,799
the markov blanket

823
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,679
but isn't an internal state and isn't an

824
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:20,640
active state

825
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,120
is a sensory state and it's kind of

826
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,960
weird to think about a pedigree as

827
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,360
having

828
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,600
sensory states but we'll see a few other

829
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,279
versions of marcotte blankets where

830
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,960
the term sense is going to be more

831
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,799
appropriate but the point is whether you

832
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,640
call it a sensory state or

833
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,120
just a markov blanket input it's the

834
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,799
same structure

835
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,880
any questions on that or there's some

836
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,279
more visualizations of markup blankets

837
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,600
yeah maybe let's um see some more

838
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,960
cool cool so another key point about

839
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,880
marco blankets is that they can be

840
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,240
multi-scale

841
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,120
and so here i've borrowed a figure from

842
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,279
ramstead at all 2018

843
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,919
and this is the answering schrodinger's

844
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:04,960
question paper

845
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,600
which is a extremely powerful

846
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,960
multi-level phrasing

847
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,360
of the free energy principle and so i've

848
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,360
carried over those same

849
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,600
hidden internal active and sensory

850
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,880
states

851
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,240
idea and then added this uh pink or

852
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,760
magenta color to the outside

853
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,919
and that's the markov blanket so we can

854
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,760
see the hidden states are outside of the

855
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,559
blanket

856
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,960
and then the active states the blue

857
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,600
circles

858
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,240
are what penetrate outward those are

859
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,399
actions that leave the monaco blanket

860
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,519
and then the red states are in incoming

861
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,960
sensory data now the reason

862
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,039
we can talk about multi-scale markov

863
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,240
blankets

864
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,480
is reflected here so this whole

865
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,679
thing let's just say this is like a cell

866
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,360
you know inside the cell you have some

867
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,440
stuff going on and then you have

868
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,960
actions coming out and you have sense

869
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,640
coming in but that

870
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,320
cell is actually also in the context of

871
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,279
a larger

872
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,000
uh unit let's say a tissue and in this

873
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,399
case

874
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,080
a bunch of cells are next to each other

875
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,679
and so each cell is doing

876
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,480
this at the cellular receptor level but

877
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,039
then

878
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,360
the organ can also be thought of as

879
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,159
having

880
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,640
internal external active and sensory

881
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,159
states

882
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,679
and what the mathematical claim

883
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,519
is is that there's a continuity

884
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,480
between these two different levels of

885
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,679
analysis

886
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,240
and so there's a few ways you can think

887
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,840
about this continuity

888
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,480
one is just the compositionality

889
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,519
argument

890
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,600
which is like okay if tissues are

891
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,840
composed of cells and cells are composed

892
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,039
of organelles

893
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,200
it's sort of a markov blankets all the

894
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,080
way down

895
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,720
approach but there's also some formal

896
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,760
continuities

897
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,640
as well as some possible ways which we

898
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,200
can

899
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,559
make a model of this level which is a

900
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,480
mixture of martial blanket states

901
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,120
and then here at the uh more granular

902
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,399
level we can actually

903
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,559
parameterize those relationships

904
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,640
and another way that we can look at the

905
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640
mark call blanket again i'm

906
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,760
invoking the um previous magenta

907
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,159
uh uh pedigree version so here's the

908
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,000
pedigree version of the markov blanket

909
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,399
around

910
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,200
a the focal individual and then here

911
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,240
i've used the same

912
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,159
colors on a neural uh focused markov

913
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:30,799
blanket

914
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,120
so here the markov blanket is around the

915
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,039
brain or the brain of the body

916
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,559
and the internal states are what are

917
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,640
happening inside the brain

918
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,799
action states leave the brain and

919
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,559
sensations enter the brain

920
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,799
and then the hidden states are what are

921
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,880
happening outside of the brain

922
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,600
and then i put this kind of arrow in

923
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,360
quotation marks and this is really where

924
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,440
we get to the idea of a causal

925
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,600
generative model of the world and that's

926
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,799
when the brain

927
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,000
speculates about how causes in the world

928
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,399
might actually be related and it turns

929
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,120
out that

930
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,440
having a causal model of the world is

931
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,440
one of the most effective ways to reduce

932
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,719
your uncertainty

933
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,199
because if you're always just waiting

934
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,960
for sensations to show up

935
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,719
and then trying to deal with them by

936
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,440
changing your model or by doing actions

937
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,760
it's going to be a very confusing world

938
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,520
but if you can have a causal model of

939
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,599
the world that says for example

940
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,320
oh a car is something that emits a

941
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,119
certain light

942
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,359
and sound and heat and so none of those

943
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,399
different stimuli are surprising

944
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,879
because i have a generative model of the

945
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,560
world where a car is driving in the

946
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,918
street in front of me

947
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,679
and so that's what explains the

948
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,839
sensations you don't need to explain the

949
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,440
sensations of the sound

950
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,639
by changing your role model uh or by

951
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,359
doing action per se just making this uh

952
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,119
causal link in the world can reduce your

953
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,960
uncertainty a lot

954
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,200
but that's something that whether or not

955
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,720
it's in the world it's actually being

956
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,400
inferred by the brain

957
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,680
and then just to unpack the math

958
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,599
one more level and also connect the

959
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,800
brain out to

960
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,200
other systems here's a very similar

961
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,320
drawing

962
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,760
and this is just showing how um again

963
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,280
the internal states of the brain

964
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,800
influence the active states

965
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,640
which influence the world plus the world

966
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,320
has its own dynamics

967
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,800
those relate to sensory breaths which

968
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,720
influence the brain's internal model

969
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,119
and again that plays back into action

970
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,119
and similarly in the context

971
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,720
of a non-brain cognitive entity like a

972
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,760
bacillus

973
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,000
we see that this internal model there's

974
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,920
the exact same relationship the internal

975
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,920
model influences action

976
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,839
action influences the world plus it

977
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,520
influences itself

978
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,680
then the world influences observed

979
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,280
states sensory states

980
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,680
and those feed back into the internal

981
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,359
model of the bacterium

982
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,040
and so this is something that goes

983
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,240
beyond brains or neurons or neuroscience

984
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,839
this is something that has to do with

985
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:58,560
inference

986
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,760
and markov blankets any thoughts on that

987
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,920
one

988
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,920
uh i don't know maybe it will be late

989
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,119
important i think about

990
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,880
how markov blanket set up borders

991
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,960
with outside

992
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,040
of the system yeah we can

993
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,359
consider and work with it as a

994
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,400
real body and to define information

995
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,960
flows or something like this

996
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,880
yeah yeah so i think there we could go

997
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,480
to section 1.1

998
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,280
of the paper narratives as cognitive

999
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,400
schemas

1000
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,440
um maybe i'm sort of

1001
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,160
jumping ahead by just already talking

1002
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,920
about the active inference perspective

1003
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,280
on narratives

1004
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,480
but when i think about uh narrative and

1005
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,839
markov blankets

1006
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,320
one thought is like a joke uh you know

1007
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,720
three people walk into a bar

1008
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,680
it's like it's already told you the who

1009
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,640
and the what

1010
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,040
it's told you who is entering what the

1011
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,079
markov blanket

1012
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,280
you know we're not talking about the

1013
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,520
street outside the bar we're not talking

1014
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,240
about

1015
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,560
the uh office building down the road

1016
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,680
we're talking about

1017
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,040
the physical border of the bar

1018
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,200
and we're talking about three people

1019
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,560
entering that

1020
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,720
so we still there's a lot of uncertainty

1021
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,960
in that narrative but just by saying

1022
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,920
three people walk into a bar um if the

1023
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,040
next line of the story

1024
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,160
is and then the chicken says it's like

1025
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,760
it's a non-sequitur because

1026
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,400
that is something happening uh in the

1027
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,760
story

1028
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,800
but it's not part of the actual uh

1029
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,280
narrative it's not part of what was set

1030
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:45,920
up

1031
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,599
and so short stories or jokes or other

1032
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,240
narrative retellings are like little

1033
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,599
model systems

1034
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,040
where we can explore how exactly are

1035
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,119
narratives set up what are the inputs

1036
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,880
what are the transformations that happen

1037
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,160
during the narrative and then what are

1038
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,119
the outputs

1039
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,560
what do you think about that

1040
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,720
yeah i think it's possible to consider

1041
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,800
this perspective and um

1042
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,000
maybe one thing i want to add

1043
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,200
on this slide about

1044
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,520
sensations and sensations and action

1045
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,720
uh so if we can uh speak

1046
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,400
about mental action and

1047
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,960
a sensation like

1048
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,560
mental representation of person for

1049
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,400
himself for example

1050
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,680
yep yeah so in this way

1051
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,119
uh mental action

1052
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,880
is it the same action or uh you need to

1053
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,560
do a section with

1054
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,720
here you need to do a section with uh

1055
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,599
out of what

1056
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,040
yeah for sure great great

1057
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,640
great question and uh this is kind of

1058
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,400
for example when people talk about

1059
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,920
speech as a

1060
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,520
motor behavior then it's like it all

1061
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,359
works for when people are speaking but

1062
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,160
then what about

1063
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,880
the mental action of preparing speech or

1064
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,359
of hearing voices but not vocalizing

1065
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:24,560
them

1066
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,320
so there's this question about

1067
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,240
representation which is basically like

1068
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:28,720
you said

1069
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,000
is mental action action and then the

1070
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,400
flip side of that is is mental

1071
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,680
representation

1072
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,759
sensation is that fair

1073
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,320
yeah correct all right so here's what i

1074
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,920
would say to that

1075
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,359
um what we're experiencing as

1076
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,119
conscious entities i mean not speak for

1077
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,680
anyone else but what we're experiencing

1078
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,800
is always our internal generative model

1079
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,200
so that's why when we look out at the

1080
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,880
world we don't see a blind spot

1081
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,880
it's why the world appears to have

1082
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,160
similar clarity

1083
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,800
across the whole visual field have color

1084
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,720
across the visual field etc

1085
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,640
because we're experiencing our

1086
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,760
generative model

1087
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,960
and so when there's a uh mental

1088
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,599
uh arising when there's awareness of

1089
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,000
some

1090
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,319
phenomena that isn't necessarily driven

1091
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,160
by a change in the external

1092
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,920
conditions so you're in the room it's a

1093
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,920
dark room or it's a you know it's an

1094
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,480
unchanging light and all of a sudden you

1095
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,000
think about

1096
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,240
being at the lake so that's an

1097
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,119
experience

1098
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,880
that you're having um it could be a

1099
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,480
memory it could be a fantasy you could

1100
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,920
put different words on it

1101
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,839
but no sensory data entered you

1102
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:43,200
to cause that thought to occur and so in

1103
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,920
this

1104
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,359
model of the markov blanket the

1105
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,200
sensations are actually very very

1106
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,720
specifically

1107
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,160
the sensory information that's being

1108
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,119
transmitted

1109
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,520
through the primary senses so the

1110
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,560
internal states

1111
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,319
the dynamics of the internal states it

1112
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,319
can be like it's like wow i'm bored in

1113
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,280
this room

1114
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,119
i wish i were at the lake now i'm

1115
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,720
experiencing the lake

1116
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,240
and so that's you can still have that

1117
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,839
awareness and the representation of the

1118
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,280
lake but that's actually not

1119
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,640
happening through the sense uh thing so

1120
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,240
again just there we're always

1121
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,839
experiencing the internal

1122
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,880
generative model uh so experiences are

1123
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,599
not here

1124
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,160
experiences are out here this is purely

1125
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,240
about actual sense data

1126
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,440
and then in the exact same way action is

1127
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,720
actually referring

1128
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,000
to um what is physically

1129
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,359
embodied by the organism and so if the

1130
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,720
organism is planning which strategy it's

1131
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,440
going to use

1132
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,079
policy planning and it's like okay i'm

1133
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,079
going to wait 10 seconds and then as

1134
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,680
soon as he goes left

1135
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,200
i'm going to go right i'm going to run

1136
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,880
past him that's

1137
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,599
all part of the general model of the

1138
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,400
world

1139
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,359
it's part of the internal state and not

1140
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,800
until the organism

1141
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,920
actually acts is the action real

1142
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,119
so mental experiences and mental

1143
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,240
processes are all happening on the green

1144
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,280
and the red is literally smell

1145
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,800
taste sound vision and the blue is quite

1146
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,800
literally motor behavior

1147
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,400
does that categorize it or what do you

1148
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,240
think about that

1149
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,200
yeah cool inputs for me right now it's

1150
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,480
more clear

1151
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,839
good so um a few

1152
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,480
let's go to section three narratives as

1153
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,440
active inference

1154
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,599
since um let's we can kind of get to the

1155
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,640
real crux which is what does it mean

1156
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,800
to take a active inference perspective

1157
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,319
on narratives

1158
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,040
and so one part that i thought that was

1159
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:43,599
pretty

1160
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,960
nice point was that this the second

1161
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,760
sentence of

1162
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,079
section three they say we suggest that

1163
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,680
the capacity to build and share

1164
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,640
narratives evolved so key it evolved

1165
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,400
largely because it provides group

1166
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,319
members with the ability to engage in

1167
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:59,920
cooperative action by avoiding

1168
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,200
unexpected states of

1169
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,200
uncoordinated or contextually

1170
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,800
inappropriate action

1171
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,599
eg this is how we do things here not in

1172
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:08,640
other ways

1173
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,520
and so you reduce uncertainty for other

1174
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,000
people

1175
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,480
in a cultural context when you drive on

1176
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,319
the correct side of the road

1177
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,480
it would lead to a lot of uncertainty if

1178
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,400
every single time

1179
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,160
people had to come to a sort of

1180
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,160
just-in-time decision about which side

1181
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,520
of the road to drive on

1182
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,480
and so norms whether they're implicit or

1183
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,680
explicit

1184
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,040
norms are really interesting to think

1185
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:33,520
about

1186
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,560
in the sense of reducing uncertainty

1187
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,119
and so you can reduce uncertainty about

1188
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,640
somebody's um

1189
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,280
behavior in various ways and they

1190
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,440
suggest that this leads to an account

1191
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,440
of the conservative aspects of cultural

1192
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,480
practice

1193
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,160
or the traditional components really

1194
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,000
just the idea that anything is

1195
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,480
preserved is conserved or held as

1196
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,240
traditional from the past

1197
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,880
and that ensures that human agents that

1198
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,760
are in culture

1199
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,319
that way are able to reduce their

1200
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:05,119
uncertainty when working with each other

1201
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,359
what do you think about that or how does

1202
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:08,800
that

1203
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,520
seem to you too

1204
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,960
uh for me it's interesting to address

1205
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,040
from ideas of niche construction

1206
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,240
and really from functional side it's how

1207
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,280
you describe it

1208
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,960
it's reducing uncertainty

1209
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,480
and provides ways to be more effective

1210
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,000
in communication

1211
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,839
and our kind of

1212
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:42,480
stuff doing in collective way

1213
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:46,079
yeah so that's that's one on page 19.

1214
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:46,640
that's just

1215
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,079
one nice uh idea about how this

1216
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,119
reducing uncertainty perspective of free

1217
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,240
energy principle

1218
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,040
rather than maximize reward it

1219
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,359
contextualizes a lot of traditions

1220
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,520
so for example it's hard to understand

1221
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,200
how some cultural traditions

1222
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,640
or cultural norms are simply about

1223
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,040
maximizing reward because it's like

1224
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,240
reward for whom

1225
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,240
or how is it calculated or how is it

1226
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,280
implemented

1227
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,599
but rather when we switch out the thing

1228
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:16,480
that has to be

1229
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,760
done by culture as not just maximizing

1230
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,200
success or reward

1231
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,319
but actually just maximizing um

1232
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,720
the precision of the action it makes a

1233
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,839
lot more sense

1234
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,280
so then at the end of page 19 this is a

1235
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,480
second uh

1236
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,720
area where narratives and active

1237
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,920
inference are gonna

1238
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,400
intersect they write coherent self

1239
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,440
narratives

1240
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,119
provide individuals with a mean to

1241
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:42,800
maintain a stable course of action

1242
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,800
pertaining to own particular goals and

1243
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,680
experiences

1244
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,960
which limits the occurrence of

1245
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,520
unexpected states and so that first

1246
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,319
account of uh cultural uncertainty

1247
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:53,359
reduction

1248
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:54,800
is something that's happening at the

1249
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,440
level of like a population or a group

1250
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,720
and this second uh sense of narrative is

1251
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,359
more like something that somebody tells

1252
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,319
themself

1253
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,160
as a means to maintain a stable course

1254
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,160
of action so for example

1255
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,400
i'm gonna go ride my bike to get some

1256
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,400
batteries because my flashlight doesn't

1257
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,680
have any batteries

1258
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,200
and i'm riding to the store and then i

1259
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,280
get a flat tire so now i need to walk my

1260
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,560
bike to the bike store

1261
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,640
but after i go to the bike store then

1262
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,920
i'll be able to get those

1263
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,160
batteries so i can go to the flashlight

1264
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,119
it's like

1265
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,480
it makes sense because that story

1266
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,440
about i that story about what has to get

1267
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,319
done

1268
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:35,760
it's very flexible but it also prevents

1269
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,319
the occurrence of unexpected states and

1270
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,240
when unexpected states do occur

1271
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,480
like getting a flat tire it can be

1272
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,520
incorporated

1273
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,640
into my narrative about my day instead

1274
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,359
of

1275
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,920
causing me to freeze or halt like a

1276
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,000
computer if there's an unexpected

1277
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,119
exception might just freeze or crash

1278
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,280
but informational foragers real

1279
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,280
evolutionary creatures can't do that

1280
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,240
so that's one other very very personal

1281
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:02,640
uh

1282
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,839
way that narrative matters and then

1283
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,240
just on page 20 furthermore narratives

1284
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,480
are potential generators of innovation

1285
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,599
and change and this is sort of combining

1286
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:14,800
those previous two

1287
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,680
the collective narrative precision uh

1288
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,440
increasing components and then the

1289
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,400
individual

1290
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,160
precision increasing components of

1291
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,000
narrative and then this is sort of

1292
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,520
bringing them together

1293
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,000
and saying that by doing active

1294
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:28,559
inference

1295
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:32,000
like search of imagining of exploring

1296
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,160
imagining new possibilities in response

1297
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,960
to or anticipation of adaptation

1298
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,119
can reduce or uncertainty and so for

1299
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,400
example if we say

1300
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,160
we're going to reduce our uncertainty

1301
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,440
about the future

1302
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,599
of the climate by doing this and that

1303
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:46,640
kind of modeling

1304
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,599
and even though this or that weather

1305
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:50,400
pattern hasn't

1306
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,040
actually occurred we should build a new

1307
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,839
wall here

1308
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,599
and we should prepare this field for

1309
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:56,880
growing this crop

1310
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,119
so that's the way in which using

1311
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:00,640
predictive action

1312
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,440
um or acting in anticipation of

1313
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,200
environmental changes can reduce

1314
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,800
your uncertainty and that's a story that

1315
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,559
you're telling about the future it's a

1316
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,880
narrative

1317
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:16,160
um any other

1318
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:21,839
thoughts there um

1319
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,440
i want to say is for self narratives

1320
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,559
that

1321
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,839
actually people spend most of their time

1322
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:33,280
living in their self narratives and

1323
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,599
as for really feeling

1324
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,760
themselves the goods they always

1325
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,000
creating some kind of

1326
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,440
unreal stories and uh

1327
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,520
really going sometimes going in the

1328
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,640
wrong way mentally

1329
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,720
yeah it's a one of the

1330
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,880
the tenants about what leads to an

1331
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,319
organism surviving

1332
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:01,440
is the organism has to have a an

1333
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,280
optimistic uh future model like it

1334
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,680
the organism has to have a world view

1335
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,599
where it sees itself existing in the

1336
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:10,160
future

1337
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,319
i mean why sleep if there's no tomorrow

1338
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,319
or why eat if there's no tomorrow or

1339
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,480
you know all these things and we see

1340
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,720
that kind of survival reflex playing out

1341
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,680
when

1342
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,440
somebody's being held under water their

1343
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,599
body will struggle because it's not

1344
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,160
part of the expected sensory inputs to

1345
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,359
be drowning

1346
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,160
so on one hand we see this fundamental

1347
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:30,720
struggle

1348
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,760
for life which is deeply optimistic but

1349
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,599
then at the same time

1350
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,880
that goes awry when people sort of uh

1351
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,760
end up licensing themselves to be the

1352
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,720
judge jury and executioner so to speak

1353
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,760
of the world and then they're the star

1354
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,599
in their movie and they're walking

1355
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:50,800
around the world and

1356
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,960
everything is only mattering to the

1357
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,880
extent it makes sense to them or it

1358
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,079
benefits them

1359
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,800
so having this uh personal level

1360
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,240
narrative

1361
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,240
is uh sometimes at odds with the

1362
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,680
collective narrative

1363
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,480
that's really a huge area of tension and

1364
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,119
that

1365
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:09,040
makes me think a lot about this

1366
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,280
multi-level markov blanket

1367
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,319
you know here here's us you know here's

1368
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:15,920
one person let's just say on the left

1369
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:16,480
side

1370
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,240
here's stories coming in narratives

1371
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,079
coming in memes coming out

1372
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,000
so information in information out and

1373
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,440
the hidden model is

1374
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,200
someone's political beliefs or their

1375
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,200
beliefs about lord of the rings

1376
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,119
and then that person is actually taking

1377
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:33,359
part in larger systems and so here's the

1378
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,119
whole country or the whole

1379
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,160
group chat or the whole team

1380
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,119
and then that team also gets inputs and

1381
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:42,880
gives outputs

1382
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,040
and so that's coming back to your

1383
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,160
original question

1384
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,119
about what are markov blankets in the

1385
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,960
context of narratives

1386
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,839
and one element is markov blankets are

1387
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:56,079
defined by what comes in and what comes

1388
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:57,040
out

1389
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,520
and that's informational in this case

1390
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,440
and another answer or another aspect of

1391
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,160
the answer

1392
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,800
is because these markov blankets are

1393
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,079
also defined by their

1394
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,440
internal mechanics or at least their

1395
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,040
internal dynamics

1396
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,800
so dynamics would be referring to the

1397
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,200
patterns that are just simply observable

1398
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,880
and the mechanics would be the actual

1399
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,800
rules that lead to those dynamics

1400
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,760
arising

1401
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,079
we can think what are those rules and

1402
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,319
one example about where the rules

1403
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,880
um could be a little different let's

1404
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,800
just go back to that joke about three

1405
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,000
people in the bar

1406
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,280
we go three aliens walk into a bar on a

1407
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:33,760
world

1408
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,800
where gravity is reversed so it's like

1409
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,720
i've put this extra rule

1410
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,000
into the narrative and now other stuff

1411
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,839
is going to happen in the narrative

1412
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,400
that locally is going to make sense

1413
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:46,960
because

1414
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,920
i've also specified this other mechanism

1415
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,119
that's going to be relevant

1416
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,079
but without specifying that uh that

1417
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,200
mechanism

1418
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,319
then uh it's assumed

1419
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,960
that the rules of gravity are regular

1420
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,839
and actually

1421
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:04,559
another funny thing and there's been

1422
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,480
some work on this is with humor

1423
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,160
and optimal surprise like simply to be

1424
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,359
insulting is not funny as well as to say

1425
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,440
what everyone else says is also usually

1426
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,880
not funny but it's on that edge of chaos

1427
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,680
where comedy and uncertainty and people

1428
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,280
some are laughing some are crying some

1429
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,720
people are trying to stop themselves

1430
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,839
from laughing

1431
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:28,480
all these things happen due to surprise

1432
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:28,960
and so

1433
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,720
to think about this joke and again not

1434
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,160
to get too over

1435
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,960
analyzing of jokes but when the joke

1436
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,559
ends with a twist

1437
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:38,319
and it was like you know uh something

1438
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,720
that wasn't necessarily specified the

1439
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,079
beginning but there's a

1440
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:44,960
there's a double entendre there's a pun

1441
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,240
these things are all

1442
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,480
humorous and what's humorous about them

1443
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,559
is they deliver that optimal level

1444
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,079
of novelty or surprise

1445
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,800
so let's go to

1446
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,400
section 3.1 cognitive schema

1447
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,440
and active inference on page 20. and so

1448
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,440
this is going to be drilling down

1449
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,760
a little bit into the cognitive schema

1450
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,280
so this is internal

1451
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,160
to someone's brain these are the uh the

1452
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,119
cognitive

1453
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:18,400
patterns that one person has

1454
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,280
on board that are related to narratives

1455
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:21,760
that

1456
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,800
has to do with active inference and so

1457
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,000
they basically write about how

1458
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,880
having specific narratives of events

1459
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:31,200
like

1460
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,640
i was going to the store and then this

1461
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,319
happened and then this happened or

1462
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,400
i went to college and then this happened

1463
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,440
those events

1464
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,480
organize your life they org they give

1465
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,240
meaning to what you have to do when you

1466
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,640
have to wake up and not just like a

1467
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,880
you know theological meaning like

1468
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,160
literally it just gives

1469
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,160
sense to your day it tells you which

1470
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,000
direction to head out of the house

1471
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,680
and then secondly there's this

1472
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,520
meaningfulness that arises

1473
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,000
from uh general events and collective

1474
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,680
narratives

1475
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,839
and they basically say that what we can

1476
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:02,880
do and

1477
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,720
also i'll just point out that those two

1478
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,160
levels of analysis

1479
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,280
the cognitive and the collective those

1480
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,400
are referring back to when they said

1481
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,319
that the issue with the field

1482
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:17,359
is that the literature on narrative

1483
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:18,079
focuses

1484
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,599
on either one or the other so

1485
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:22,720
psychologists will focus on

1486
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,640
the internal cognitive schema of

1487
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,640
narrative and the anthropologist well

1488
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,839
focused or the cultural

1489
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,160
researcher will focus on the collective

1490
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,200
narratives

1491
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,720
um and they're going to try to use

1492
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,520
active inference to bridge that gap

1493
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,920
and so basically they say on the quote

1494
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,920
that goes from 20 to 21

1495
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,960
um what explains these associations why

1496
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,880
these individual collective narrative

1497
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,359
roles

1498
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:48,079
are adaptive in an evolutionary sense is

1499
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:50,319
basically because they facilitate the

1500
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,119
process of active inference in page 21.

1501
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,440
that is the capacity of narratives to

1502
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,599
represent the specificity of events and

1503
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:59,200
to represent multiple events

1504
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,680
in a meaningful and coherent way helps

1505
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,520
individuals to more accurately

1506
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,280
predict future events and therefore

1507
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,040
respond to changing circumstances in

1508
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,160
their lives

1509
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,480
so that's pretty key what do you think

1510
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,960
about that

1511
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:21,760
um

1512
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,280
as it's stated about active inference

1513
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,559
that here in paper but it's first of all

1514
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:29,440
about

1515
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,880
adaptive behavior and

1516
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,880
for sure this part is about how it's

1517
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,000
work in real life

1518
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,440
for example and people are rarely act

1519
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,440
like this always living in some stores

1520
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,720
and describe

1521
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,599
for them for themselves future where

1522
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:55,040
future possible events and

1523
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,079
in terms for example engineering again

1524
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:01,280
you first need to

1525
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,240
create a description of future system

1526
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,160
and how it will work

1527
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,680
in future so it's way

1528
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,960
yep yes and um and just at the end of

1529
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:15,520
that

1530
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,880
section on the bottom of 21

1531
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,040
where they say in short having a

1532
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,000
narrative or a repertoire of narratives

1533
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,760
furnishes inference with a simple and

1534
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,680
efficient way to account for sensory

1535
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,359
evidence at hand

1536
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:32,960
and what that allows uh organisms to do

1537
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,839
is to then provide hypotheses that

1538
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,319
enable inference to the best prediction

1539
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:40,000
so you're telling the story and it's

1540
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,920
like okay so there i was i had the

1541
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,720
flashlight

1542
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,400
and the batteries and my bike was

1543
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,240
working and then

1544
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,559
you can actually make hypotheses even if

1545
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,480
you knew very little about the person

1546
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,000
you could then say well what do you

1547
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,440
think would happen if they found out

1548
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,960
that the batteries were dead

1549
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,799
oh they might go back to the store

1550
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:58,079
because remember they needed the

1551
00:56:58,079 --> 00:56:59,680
batteries for the flashlight

1552
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,760
or what would happen if this other thing

1553
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,880
happened so

1554
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,839
the narrative allows temporally related

1555
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:06,960
events

1556
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,160
to um become meaningful

1557
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,400
and in the context of artificial

1558
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,160
intelligence and in big data

1559
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,280
this is so important because the

1560
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,680
data overload means that let's just say

1561
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,040
that you had somebody who

1562
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,000
was they had agreed uh consented to

1563
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,599
provide you all their data

1564
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:27,680
so in the whole day you have their full

1565
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,440
movement patterns

1566
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,520
all their their smartphone and every web

1567
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,599
search and all their transactions all

1568
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:34,640
this stuff

1569
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,280
you still might never be able to reduce

1570
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,160
it to so

1571
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,240
simple a story in just a few sentences

1572
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,839
as i had to get batteries for my

1573
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:43,440
flashlight but then my bike tire got a

1574
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,480
flat

1575
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,440
that is really really hard to extract

1576
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,200
from just the gps data and the

1577
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,480
transaction data

1578
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,119
um because it's intermingled with so

1579
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:54,079
many other

1580
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,559
different components happening and so

1581
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:57,760
narratives are

1582
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,880
how we relate that sequence of events to

1583
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:01,920
ourself

1584
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,160
it's how we relate it to other people

1585
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,720
and then the challenge is to generate

1586
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,359
computational systems that can interact

1587
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,920
at that level of analysis

1588
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,799
um like you know okay google i want to

1589
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:15,280
you know

1590
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,280
get a haircut within three miles of

1591
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,319
where i am

1592
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:20,480
or something like that that's what we

1593
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,160
don't have and that's why

1594
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,000
the artificial intelligence community is

1595
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
so interested in these topics

1596
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,160
because potentially an act of inference

1597
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,319
based artificial intelligence

1598
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:33,839
uh both confusingly ai could

1599
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:37,680
have a more uh effective role

1600
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,799
in some of these questions so let's go

1601
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:41,280
to

1602
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,680
three one one narrative identity and

1603
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,119
active inference

1604
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,520
in this section they're gonna go a

1605
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,559
little bit more into that first person

1606
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:53,760
narration component and

1607
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,000
on 22 they write coherent narratives

1608
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:56,799
link together

1609
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,480
aspects of our experience in ways that

1610
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,920
decrease contradictions

1611
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,200
amongst choices values and goals and so

1612
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,680
the contextualization of narrative is

1613
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,319
like

1614
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:09,119
well it was really important to me to um

1615
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:10,559
spend time with my family

1616
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,720
but then for work i had to go away for

1617
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,839
two days

1618
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:16,799
and so that narrative is what allows

1619
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:18,000
that person

1620
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,520
to have two things uh that are otherwise

1621
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,720
contradictory which is

1622
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,640
well if families are important and work

1623
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,000
is important then

1624
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,079
what are you gonna do but the way that

1625
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:29,200
that's narrated

1626
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,599
it ends up not being that big of a deal

1627
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:32,319
and so

1628
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,400
it isn't that big of a deal because as

1629
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,760
they point out

1630
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,200
coherent narratives can reduce the

1631
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,880
dissonance amongst the complex and

1632
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,960
overarching expectations we have about

1633
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,960
our lives

1634
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,440
especially with relationship to future

1635
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,040
states

1636
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,760
so that's kind of i think one very

1637
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,559
interesting

1638
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:54,079
uh topic

1639
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:56,480
anything there or yvonne any questions

1640
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:01,040
or thoughts

1641
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,400
uh and again again i want to put

1642
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,680
about personal and uh

1643
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,720
fun functionally for coherent narratives

1644
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,720
that people in their in their

1645
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:18,319
lives uh usually not action

1646
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:21,119
we're trying to create a new narratives

1647
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,400
way

1648
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,839
why we don't uh do any action

1649
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:29,200
and uh when we speak about

1650
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,400
action it's about learning and

1651
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,839
learning it's about updating your model

1652
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:39,680
and it's

1653
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,480
looks like it's quite difficult for

1654
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,720
people stop to create

1655
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,640
new narratives just not going to

1656
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,839
do some actions yep

1657
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:55,200
very very true um two quotes that that

1658
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,559
really makes me think about on 22

1659
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,599
about two-thirds the way down says self

1660
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:03,280
and identity narratives are framed

1661
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,200
against a background of cultural norms

1662
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,240
and values

1663
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,319
so they also can reference alternative

1664
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:10,000
narratives that provide explanations for

1665
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,960
non-normative

1666
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,520
unusual inconsistent or untoward events

1667
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,359
in the individual's life trajectory

1668
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:17,200
so that'd be something like you know

1669
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,799
when i was growing up

1670
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:21,440
everybody uh was drafted into the army

1671
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,359
but then because of this situation i

1672
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:24,000
didn't have to

1673
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,200
go so that explains why the individual

1674
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,319
was doing something

1675
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:30,400
explains why they had the sensory

1676
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,839
experience of being at home for a

1677
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:33,680
specific interval of time

1678
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,079
but it also juxtaposes it against a

1679
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:37,040
collective

1680
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,400
potentially normative idea

1681
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,880
and so this has a lot to do with humans

1682
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,640
seeking to differentiate themselves

1683
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:48,079
from each other is one tendency we want

1684
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,799
to be unique in some ways but also

1685
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:52,240
there's other areas where

1686
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,039
uh we want to fit in and so there might

1687
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:56,480
be cultures where it's

1688
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,119
valued more to be fitting in or not

1689
01:01:59,119 --> 01:01:59,839
there might be

1690
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:01,520
different dimensions where we fit in

1691
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,280
different dish dimensions where we don't

1692
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,240
that's kind of like

1693
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,680
the idea of intersectionality and then

1694
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,119
on the page 23 where they're talking

1695
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:11,599
about

1696
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:14,640
meaning making and sense making and i

1697
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,960
i totally agree with that what you're

1698
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:17,839
talking about

1699
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:21,839
with most people being in a non-active

1700
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:24,880
state the sensations coming in the you

1701
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:25,440
know

1702
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,240
media coming in or the internet coming

1703
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,200
in

1704
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,359
it's just updating their internal states

1705
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:33,119
updating updating updating

1706
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:35,440
but it doesn't seem to be reflected that

1707
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:36,880
heavily in action

1708
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,880
sometimes and then they write on the

1709
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,160
middle 23

1710
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,240
the meaning making process is an

1711
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,440
adaptive response

1712
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:44,880
to the occurrence of unexpected

1713
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,119
circumstances when expectations are

1714
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:48,160
broken

1715
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,400
an imaginative reorganization of our

1716
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,240
representations of ourselves and our

1717
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:52,880
environment

1718
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,839
is needed um but unfortunately if

1719
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:56,400
somebody

1720
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,039
sometimes gets a statistic or a fact

1721
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:00,559
that is not consistent with their

1722
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:01,520
worldview

1723
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,599
then that's where we see logical

1724
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:06,079
fallacies like oh ad hominem or that

1725
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:07,039
that person's just

1726
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:09,280
trolling or they're just uh you know

1727
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,039
trying to frustrate me or something

1728
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:14,079
because it's uh it's always possible to

1729
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:16,160
include into your view just the idea

1730
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,079
that that one fact is wrong

1731
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:21,039
or irrelevant rather than actually move

1732
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:23,039
into this totally new worldview because

1733
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:24,640
shifting the deeper attendance of your

1734
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,280
worldview

1735
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,720
is uh anxiety producing and so then

1736
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,799
also just to what you said about niche

1737
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:32,319
they talk about how

1738
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:34,880
uh before a new sense of familiarity and

1739
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:35,520
coherence

1740
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,599
i.e a new niche that's like a narrative

1741
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,760
niche can be reinstated

1742
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,240
exploration of new meaning epistemic

1743
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,039
foraging

1744
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:44,799
must occur in order to generate tests

1745
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:48,000
and discover new adaptive inferences

1746
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,480
so that's kind of a cool idea

1747
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,599
let's go to uh 3.12

1748
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:59,760
event narratives so this uh section 3.12

1749
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:00,720
which is

1750
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:04,720
a good length uh we can kind of just

1751
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,000
skip to the summary

1752
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,359
on 27 of this section where it says

1753
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:11,200
event narratives are ideally suited for

1754
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,720
active inference because of their

1755
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,480
ability to represent past and future

1756
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,799
events respectively in segmented event

1757
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:17,599
sequence

1758
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:19,440
and that provides a pool of uniquely

1759
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,960
structured information that helps

1760
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,480
predict future events

1761
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,319
and structures these inferenced in the

1762
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,520
form of cohesive

1763
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:29,119
future events so um

1764
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:32,319
it it it seems like a very basic

1765
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:35,200
point to build the paper towards which

1766
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,079
is that

1767
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:38,880
narratives help us recognize where we

1768
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,520
are

1769
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,839
recognize who we are personally and

1770
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:42,720
culturally

1771
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,440
recognize where we've been and then make

1772
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,799
predictions about the future that

1773
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,160
hopefully will help us reduce

1774
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,440
uncertainty

1775
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,559
these points are not major but i would

1776
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,319
argue that it's actually quite

1777
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:57,599
um encouraging and powerful that

1778
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,480
these sorts of claims which usually

1779
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,240
would be the qualitative

1780
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,480
uh end point of some sort of

1781
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,480
psychological or cultural analysis of

1782
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,359
narrative

1783
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:09,680
rather those are the starting points for

1784
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:10,720
us having a

1785
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,799
quantitative analysis potentially to

1786
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:14,960
analyze narratives

1787
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,440
um but that this section we've been kind

1788
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,400
of discussing

1789
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,319
uh throughout so section 3.13

1790
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:24,799
integrating the functions of cognitive

1791
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:25,839
schema narratives

1792
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:28,799
as in as active inference so that's one

1793
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:29,359
of the

1794
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:32,240
final sections before they turned to

1795
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,760
storytelling

1796
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,839
um and uh

1797
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:41,359
that just is about what it says it's

1798
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:42,079
gonna be

1799
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:43,920
about any thoughts on that one like

1800
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,200
that's kind of related to what we've

1801
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,160
been discussing as well

1802
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,480
where they say on uh 27

1803
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,400
on the bottom future projections and

1804
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,520
episodic memory

1805
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,839
can be understood as mental action or

1806
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:00,000
policy selection and perception

1807
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,440
so that kind of relates to the idea of

1808
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,240
mental action

1809
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,280
yeah yep

1810
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:11,280
and then just to kind of finish out the

1811
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,760
uh body of the paper before we return to

1812
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,920
a few more images and close out

1813
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,319
the section three two storytelling

1814
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:20,240
regimes of attention and deontic

1815
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,440
cues so uh regimes

1816
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:27,119
of attention are this idea that um

1817
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,280
you're paying attention to something you

1818
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,319
know when

1819
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,319
the child is in school and they're being

1820
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,760
trained to pay attention to different

1821
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,039
sorts of cues and

1822
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:37,520
what symbols mean this idea that

1823
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:38,640
attention

1824
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,520
and that attention as shaped by active

1825
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,720
inference

1826
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:45,839
uh as on 29 where there's a few

1827
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:46,960
citations to

1828
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,839
constant at all 2019 and constant at all

1829
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,200
2018

1830
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,359
that the narratives direct what is

1831
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:55,760
salient to human agents

1832
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,160
um so it'd be like you know three people

1833
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,280
walk into a bar

1834
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,760
and one of them has three legs it's like

1835
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,200
one of those statements

1836
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,119
is surprising the one about three people

1837
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:06,559
walking into a bar is not

1838
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:08,319
but the one about somebody having a

1839
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:10,319
different number of body parts is

1840
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:13,920
and so narratives allow us to very very

1841
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:14,799
easily

1842
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:16,799
draw on the tremendous amount of

1843
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,079
information that we have in our

1844
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:19,760
generative model of the world

1845
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,880
and then use that to discover anomalies

1846
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,480
in our observations

1847
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,760
and deontic is a word that

1848
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:30,880
means duty so related to

1849
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,000
what somebody uh must or should

1850
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,039
do and theref and so

1851
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:38,559
we can think about narratives for

1852
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:40,799
ourself and collective narratives as

1853
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:41,359
being

1854
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:44,880
deontic so when jfk

1855
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,119
you know said ask not what your country

1856
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:48,720
can do for you but what you can do for

1857
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:49,920
your country

1858
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,079
it's almost like instead of thinking

1859
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:53,039
about the

1860
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:55,680
united states of markham blanket and how

1861
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,280
that is going to provide something for

1862
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,480
you

1863
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,400
as well you might want to think about

1864
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,319
you as a markov blanket

1865
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:05,119
and how you as a personal narrative

1866
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:06,799
active inference machine

1867
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:08,720
might also be playing a role in this

1868
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,240
larger system

1869
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,920
uh maybe he was thinking about free

1870
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,400
energy maybe he wasn't hard to say

1871
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,120
and then they kind of closed the loop in

1872
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:17,439
um

1873
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:19,600
that paragraph in the middle of 30 where

1874
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,640
they write

1875
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,000
um deontic cues guide the sensory motor

1876
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,839
patterns through which agents engage

1877
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:27,600
adaptively their niches

1878
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,319
action thereby guiding the ways in which

1879
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:30,880
agents

1880
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,799
update their recognition model so for

1881
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:35,120
example when my alarm clock goes off

1882
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,640
and i go okay i have 30 minutes to take

1883
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:39,359
a shower

1884
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:42,238
get dressed bike to school because i

1885
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:44,158
have to be sitting in this lecture hall

1886
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:46,000
so that i can receive the sensory input

1887
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,198
of the lecturer

1888
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:49,040
so that i'll be able to update my model

1889
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,640
about organic chemistry

1890
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,560
so that when there's a final i'm able to

1891
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,238
reduce my uncertainty about what the

1892
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:55,279
answer is

1893
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:56,640
so that i'm able to get this grade that

1894
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,319
i want and so

1895
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:01,198
the deontic cue is like the post note

1896
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:02,158
that might be on my

1897
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:04,319
alarm clock that says get up you have to

1898
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:06,000
go to organic chemistry

1899
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,158
but that ends up guiding the sensory

1900
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:09,759
motor patterns

1901
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:12,479
and ideally that is a adaptive

1902
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:13,439
engagement

1903
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:16,080
through action and then that leads to

1904
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,960
differences in perception and learning

1905
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,198
and then this relates to a lot of other

1906
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:24,319
work um i think it might be the vessier

1907
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:27,839
uh at all 2020 citation on page 31

1908
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:29,439
which is the idea of thinking through

1909
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:32,319
other minds which

1910
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:34,960
is a more recent development in the free

1911
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:35,439
energy

1912
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:37,279
slash active inference cultural

1913
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:39,439
perspective

1914
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:42,158
so let's go just to their conclusion the

1915
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:43,520
authors are going to summarize

1916
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:46,560
what they've been discussing they write

1917
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,799
we have proposed an integrative model of

1918
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:50,399
the diverse functions of narrative as

1919
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:51,839
tools for active inference

1920
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:54,320
in ways that clarify their cognitive and

1921
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,560
social uses so again the big point of

1922
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,360
the paper

1923
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,360
was that there's this cognitive internal

1924
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,159
level and this social external level and

1925
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:02,880
the literature

1926
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,000
tends to focus on one or the other they

1927
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,159
brought the big guns out active

1928
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:09,440
inference and so they're going to

1929
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,080
integrate

1930
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,719
cognitive and social under the umbrella

1931
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:14,159
of active inference so that's going to

1932
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:14,480
give

1933
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,080
internal coherence to the study of

1934
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,760
narrative and

1935
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,280
it's also going to give external

1936
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,880
coherence because now

1937
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,360
we can study narrative alongside other

1938
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,960
informational and thermodynamic

1939
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,159
processes

1940
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:28,400
then they in the following sentences

1941
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,480
recall a bunch of the specifics

1942
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,679
they talk about how narratives are

1943
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:34,159
useful for segmenting events

1944
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:36,960
for uh building an information pool for

1945
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,880
making future projections

1946
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,679
for meaning making and sense making for

1947
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:42,159
belief

1948
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:44,880
updating for assimilating unexpected

1949
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:45,920
information

1950
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:48,560
for maintaining cohesive integrity of

1951
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,280
our complex network of expectations

1952
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,640
so as to minimize internal

1953
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,800
contradictions as well as providing

1954
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:55,920
expectations

1955
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,600
to culturally common situations and

1956
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,280
typical life trajectories

1957
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:02,320
um and then they close by discussing

1958
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,440
that idea of the

1959
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:06,719
deontic narrative and the narratives

1960
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:09,199
that are about how the world could or

1961
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:09,760
should

1962
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,880
be and then that situates our role

1963
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,800
in the world and that actually shapes

1964
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,440
our sensory motor action patterns

1965
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,000
and that their last sentence is just

1966
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,040
that the

1967
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,760
importance and ubiquity of narratives uh

1968
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:24,080
in

1969
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,679
the various domains of adaptation and

1970
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:27,920
sociality it should be

1971
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,960
explained not by appeal to entertainment

1972
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:31,440
or

1973
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,360
simply information exchange or

1974
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,040
communication only

1975
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,679
but rather by phrasing this all within

1976
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:39,440
the context of active inference

1977
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,679
we get a very very powerful framework to

1978
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:42,480
get internal

1979
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:46,559
and external coherence for narratives

1980
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:51,840
um then just sort of in closing i

1981
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:52,560
thought i would

1982
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:56,320
go to a paper from

1983
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,520
march 31st to 2020 uh active inference

1984
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,000
on discrete state spaces a synthesis

1985
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,679
and just a little bit looking at how

1986
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:08,320
uh active inference what what could be

1987
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,840
the next steps and this is something

1988
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:10,480
that

1989
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,239
uh you know the three of us have talked

1990
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:14,000
about quite a lot which is

1991
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,280
this paper is awesome it's also a

1992
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,640
qualitative

1993
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:22,000
perspective that doesn't dig into

1994
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,679
all the details that we wanted to see

1995
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:25,679
resolved that's why

1996
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:28,400
research is on the edge and so these are

1997
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,679
just a few of the ways

1998
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,760
in which active inference has been

1999
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,000
specified and so we might begin to think

2000
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:34,560
about

2001
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:37,120
how narrative could play into some of

2002
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,239
this stuff

2003
01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:40,480
so here we see that familiar diagram

2004
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,280
with the brain

2005
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,679
internal states action states external

2006
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:45,040
sensory states

2007
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,520
and then there's basically two things

2008
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,400
that are happening

2009
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,040
two optimization processes that are

2010
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,400
happening at the same time

2011
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,719
perception is the brain making sense of

2012
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:56,080
sensory data

2013
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,320
and action is the brain's selecting

2014
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,520
policy

2015
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,320
and what happens is the way that free

2016
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,320
energy is minimized

2017
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,320
given the sensory data two things can

2018
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,000
happen you can either

2019
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,239
make sense of the sensory data by

2020
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:12,000
changing your worldview

2021
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,040
or you can change your sensory data

2022
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:18,000
by engaging in action and so it turns

2023
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,120
out that by different

2024
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,199
transformations of these mathematical

2025
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:22,239
relationships

2026
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:25,040
that are specified exhaustively in this

2027
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,480
paper

2028
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,800
we pull out a few key terms so here's

2029
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:29,600
value

2030
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,760
this is the discounted or the expected

2031
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:32,719
utility

2032
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:36,000
it turns out that the value um expected

2033
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,360
value of an action

2034
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,840
or expected value of a stimulus relating

2035
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,040
to questions about optimal control and

2036
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,600
cybernetics as well these questions

2037
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,800
about value

2038
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,840
uh actually arise uh

2039
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,920
purely from thinking about uncertainty

2040
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,120
through time

2041
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,520
uncertainty through time is also related

2042
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,320
to uh

2043
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,320
surprise this is why on both of these we

2044
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,360
see this log

2045
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,800
p be a given m um and this negative f

2046
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,080
and f and then um also

2047
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,320
we're able to introduce the topics of

2048
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,920
entropy self-organization

2049
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:13,199
synergetics homeostasis and of course

2050
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:16,320
model evidence this is the key um

2051
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,600
uh term pebm that's represented in all

2052
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,280
of these

2053
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,560
so those are a few interesting topics uh

2054
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,600
this is another visualization

2055
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,400
that talks about how active inference

2056
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,800
and markov blankets

2057
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,320
have very specific other downstream

2058
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,080
mathematical relationships again

2059
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,320
not too much to discuss at this point

2060
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,560
but these are just to put up

2061
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:46,159
and then this is the brain and here

2062
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:48,480
are the different variables in their

2063
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,840
brain

2064
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,600
represented visually so here are

2065
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,560
for example the generative model and how

2066
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,000
things are being influenced and how

2067
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:58,719
voter

2068
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:01,280
cortex is ending up select policy moving

2069
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,480
to the motor cortex

2070
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:05,040
moving out and then maybe we can just

2071
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:05,679
close

2072
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:08,880
on this slide which alex i think you

2073
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,239
put in where we have two agents

2074
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:15,520
or more and here for agent one

2075
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,360
here's their regime of attention this is

2076
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,199
their internal model what they're paying

2077
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:21,520
attention to what is salient for them

2078
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,679
and this is related to who they are if

2079
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:25,120
they don't speak the language they can

2080
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,480
pay attention to the sounds but they

2081
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,000
can't pay attention to the meaning

2082
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,760
if they don't know the area they can pay

2083
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,040
attention to the words but

2084
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,760
not really the connections agent one

2085
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,280
engages in action

2086
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,199
and that kind of dumps into the world

2087
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,320
and the world

2088
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,960
is full of epistemic resources cues this

2089
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:41,440
is just

2090
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:44,480
what is and then the world

2091
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:47,520
uh ends up dealing out sensations to

2092
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,199
both of these agents and then it feeds

2093
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:50,640
back and so it's kind of like the

2094
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:51,440
conversation

2095
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,440
would be okay this person is listening

2096
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,679
they speak it dumps it into the text

2097
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:56,560
room or the

2098
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,600
the jitsi video chat that's sensed by

2099
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:00,239
agent n

2100
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:03,040
agent n pays attention acts that goes

2101
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,320
back into the chat room

2102
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,640
and so there's like this infinity here

2103
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,000
uh and that's

2104
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,480
thinking through other minds that's how

2105
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,159
narratives are shared this is really

2106
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,760
where we want to go

2107
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:17,520
is thinking at a really formal level

2108
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,480
as well as an applied level how can we

2109
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,880
bring this kind of clarity to action

2110
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,520
sensation and collaboration how can we

2111
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:26,400
bring that

2112
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,080
to the system's perspective the

2113
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:30,640
complexity

2114
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:36,640
yep perspective and um i want to

2115
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:40,080
add here we see a green zone about

2116
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:43,199
epistemic resources and silence and

2117
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:45,920
as we see from this paper narratives are

2118
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:46,640
really

2119
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:50,800
one of fundamental part of

2120
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:54,159
human well-being and developments

2121
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:58,000
and culture social and so on

2122
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,320
so and if so much functions

2123
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:05,520
in it we need to uh

2124
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,480
see closer to things like about

2125
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,080
epistemic

2126
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:13,679
side of his narrative and silent silence

2127
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:17,280
part of his narratives and trying to

2128
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:17,679
find

2129
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:22,239
ways to have some kind of

2130
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:24,560
evaluation and qualification for such

2131
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,000
sources

2132
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
or narratives as well

2133
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,719
agreed agreed and again with this idea

2134
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:34,159
of like there's the internal

2135
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:35,440
coherence and then the external

2136
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,679
coherence we can return to that joke

2137
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:39,600
it's like in the context of the joke you

2138
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,920
can make a mark of blanket for the joke

2139
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,600
where three people walk into a bar

2140
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:44,880
that's literally the three people

2141
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,960
walking into a barkov blanket

2142
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,560
um probably there's three people walking

2143
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,080
to a mark called blanket

2144
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:54,080
they get lost um but then zooming out

2145
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,640
there's also the cultural context that

2146
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,880
the joke occurs within

2147
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:02,000
uh the kind of context that makes

2148
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,480
uh three people walk into a bar now

2149
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:05,360
that's common

2150
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:08,159
it's an american or it's an english joke

2151
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:09,920
format you know this many people walk

2152
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:10,880
into a bar

2153
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:14,000
or knock knock who's there now

2154
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
that might be a culturally specific

2155
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,239
thing and so that joke is going to be

2156
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:18,640
more

2157
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:22,000
or less expected more or less funny to

2158
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,080
somebody who's in that cultural context

2159
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,440
and so the epistemic

2160
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:28,159
resources and the salience have to deal

2161
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:28,719
with

2162
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:31,360
the stimulus in question like the joke

2163
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,239
itself

2164
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:35,360
but also it has to be taken into account

2165
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,199
that because we're talking about agents

2166
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:38,800
that are paying attention

2167
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,880
the culture of the agent is going to

2168
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,199
dictate what they find salient

2169
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,560
there might be things that are in the

2170
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,719
world that are

2171
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:49,440
not salient because the uh individual

2172
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,199
doesn't have the narrative that allows

2173
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:52,159
them to

2174
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:55,600
retain that salience um

2175
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:59,920
any closing thoughts especially yvonne

2176
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:04,000
i just i just uh have

2177
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,239
remembered one russian joke

2178
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:11,520
that's congruent with the english

2179
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,239
three people walking the barriers the

2180
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:15,280
bill goes

2181
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:18,020
in the forest it's uh it's

2182
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:20,960
[Music]

2183
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,760
start with the beer goes in the forest

2184
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:24,320
and

2185
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:27,920
it has a lot of different ants

2186
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:31,120
in this story exactly

2187
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:34,239
and some of these cultural stubs like

2188
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:35,360
these starters

2189
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:38,880
for jokes it allows uh the

2190
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,280
format for anything it's kind of like a

2191
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,239
http

2192
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:44,400
packet you know you have the header that

2193
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,480
just says i'm an internet packet

2194
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,560
that's like saying you know when you say

2195
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,080
a bear walks into a forest

2196
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,800
it's like i'm telling you a joke but you

2197
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:53,679
can't just say

2198
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:55,520
i'm going to tell you a joke right now

2199
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:56,880
and so these are

2200
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:00,080
signals that are extremely rich with

2201
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,520
information

2202
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,320
and just having a text-based natural

2203
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:05,440
language processing

2204
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,560
ai will totally miss out on that

2205
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:09,120
cultural

2206
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,360
context and then let's say you told like

2207
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,960
a variant of the joke you know

2208
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:16,960
um uh an ant walks into the forest

2209
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,120
it's not a non-sequitur but it's not

2210
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,960
really referencing a real ant walking

2211
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:22,080
into a forest

2212
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,239
and these are these overlapping levels

2213
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:25,920
of cultural

2214
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,120
jokes and meaning that are

2215
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,760
really pointing the way to how rich the

2216
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:35,679
study could be with active inference

2217
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:40,639
so how

2218
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:43,600
how do you think

2219
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:46,719
what the first thing that

2220
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:50,560
is uh people don't have

2221
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,800
people of different culture don't have

2222
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,960
to

2223
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,880
to do not missing

2224
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:02,960
the point of communication how can

2225
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:05,450
what do they can what can they

2226
01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:07,920
[Music]

2227
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,199
do first to

2228
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:15,360
reduce miscommunicating

2229
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,159
yeah good question and especially in a

2230
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:19,040
digital

2231
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,199
and international context it's so

2232
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:22,239
important

2233
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:25,840
that there's reduction of uncertainty so

2234
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,639
i mean just really quickly a few things

2235
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:29,440
would be

2236
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:32,960
just at every possible opportunity where

2237
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,080
there's any question about uncertainty

2238
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,960
i feel like always getting the uh

2239
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,639
consent from both okay we were just

2240
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:42,000
talking about this topic

2241
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,400
right and so just getting used to

2242
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,199
agreeing

2243
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:48,480
with each other and getting used to

2244
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:52,239
uh altruistically or just politely

2245
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:55,199
exchanging information starts to train

2246
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:55,520
us

2247
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:58,000
to work well together even when the

2248
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:58,880
situation

2249
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,679
is very tense so that's one part is

2250
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:04,080
where we can be extremely accurate in

2251
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,120
communication

2252
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,520
we should be extremely accurate and then

2253
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,199
on the technological side

2254
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:10,719
i think it's important just to

2255
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:13,280
communicate simply instead of using

2256
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:15,199
think oh we'll just use video and use

2257
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:16,800
body language and make sure that you're

2258
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,960
really expressive with your hands

2259
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,679
uh yeah the tone of voice and the hand

2260
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:22,719
motions

2261
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:25,679
even if they come across with no lag and

2262
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:27,600
the person is watching your screen

2263
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,520
different cultures might unpack

2264
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,280
different hand motions or different

2265
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,400
facial expressions

2266
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,199
very differently and so i think that

2267
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:36,080
when there's

2268
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,560
differences in culture that lead to

2269
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,639
challenges in communication

2270
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:43,360
it's critical to really just focus in on

2271
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:44,560
what you're actually trying to

2272
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:45,679
communicate

2273
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:47,040
and make sure that there's as little

2274
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,800
uncertainty as possible about

2275
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:52,480
that and then the cultural stuff

2276
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,719
deal with it as it's needed and whenever

2277
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:55,920
it's needed to deal with it

2278
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,320
um absolutely it's important to deal

2279
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:59,679
with it because nothing can be more

2280
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:00,639
important

2281
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:03,120
than helping the team become more

2282
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:06,480
effective more precise

2283
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:09,920
i think in digital it's more

2284
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:13,199
simple to um

2285
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:15,760
to make clear enough communication

2286
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:16,639
between

2287
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:20,320
email between two people because in

2288
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:23,600
when we when we are talking in real life

2289
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,639
we can't to add some

2290
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:29,920
hashtag to uh

2291
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:34,960
describe what what do we uh

2292
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,679
[Music]

2293
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,480
what do we mean

2294
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:47,760
yep we can use a rich multimodal

2295
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,679
features so we could be having this chat

2296
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:50,800
and someone could say

2297
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,960
i'm sorry i just could you spell out the

2298
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,800
city that you mentioned

2299
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,400
and then they can type it in the text

2300
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,159
box or

2301
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:00,000
somebody can share their screen and draw

2302
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,360
something out things that couldn't

2303
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:02,800
happen in person

2304
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,440
i i agree these are all really important

2305
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:08,239
and that relates to epistemic resources

2306
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:10,639
so when the people who you're dealing

2307
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:12,400
with are all in the same discipline and

2308
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,600
all the same culture

2309
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,840
maybe the epistemic resources are very

2310
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,040
professional

2311
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:19,360
but when we're talking about broad

2312
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,159
spectrum

2313
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:22,719
communication potentially the epistemic

2314
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:24,960
resources and the salience cues

2315
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,040
would be like using a color scheme

2316
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:28,880
that's accessible for everybody

2317
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:32,000
and using icons to demonstrate

2318
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,679
where the settings are like having a

2319
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:35,920
gear in the bottom right of jitsi the

2320
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,040
three dots

2321
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,760
having a gear that says setting that's

2322
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,040
really helpful because it's kind of like

2323
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,600
a universal icon for the settings

2324
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,280
and then otherwise it could be a

2325
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,719
situation where someone doesn't know

2326
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:47,760
english

2327
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,440
and they can't find the settings so then

2328
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:50,800
how are they going to be able to find

2329
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,199
the language uh option because they

2330
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:54,560
can't even find the settings

2331
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,600
section but with the gear it's um

2332
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:00,239
it's a salience cue that goes beyond

2333
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:00,960
culture

2334
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:03,760
uh and so that is what helps people get

2335
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:04,159
along

2336
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:06,239
together and again going back to like

2337
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:07,280
what are the actual

2338
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,520
applications of this if we could

2339
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,639
understand

2340
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:13,760
how individuals in different cultures

2341
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,440
are going to perceive different

2342
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,440
narratives and what role they see

2343
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,280
themselves playing in the narratives

2344
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,440
it could really open the door to

2345
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:22,320
extremely

2346
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,960
interactive and authentic narratives by

2347
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:25,679
people

2348
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:28,400
that don't have to be situated as being

2349
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:29,360
at odds

2350
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,920
with some sort of evil system and it's

2351
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:32,400
like

2352
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,400
they're they're the righteous crusader

2353
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:35,840
fighting against everyone else who's

2354
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:36,560
dumb

2355
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,639
or the system's corrupt and they're just

2356
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:40,000
you know doing what they can

2357
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,400
all these narratives that that uh hit

2358
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,159
the individual versus the group

2359
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:47,600
or versus specific groups lead to

2360
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,719
adversarial game theory and so

2361
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:52,480
not not that there's never going to be

2362
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,320
competition in the world but potentially

2363
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,840
by having these protocols for

2364
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,040
interaction and for

2365
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,960
communication just like we have

2366
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,159
protocols for

2367
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:02,159
trade we could have protocols for

2368
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:08,480
information that are also healthy

2369
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:11,840
yeah cool and as for protocols uh

2370
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,880
and you said before about signals and i

2371
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:15,840
think

2372
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,719
if you speak about culture it's really

2373
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:20,159
mostly

2374
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:23,679
uh shared by narratives and uh if he's

2375
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:27,280
considered culture not like a global

2376
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:30,400
uh gentleman but a local so

2377
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:34,320
each team could have

2378
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:37,760
own culture and they define it

2379
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:41,600
by narratives and it creates a niche

2380
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:45,440
by that supporting by tools and the

2381
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:45,920
tools

2382
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:49,840
really could support such protocols

2383
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:52,159
where some meta information

2384
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:55,760
added to communication and communication

2385
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:56,560
process

2386
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:59,600
is also structured according to

2387
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:03,440
some models from active inferences we

2388
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:04,960
see

2389
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,760
totally agreed and i think on a closing

2390
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:08,639
note

2391
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:12,159
this has been our first podcast live

2392
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:12,960

2393
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:16,000

slides

2398
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:28,800
for the presentation the pre-print

2399
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,560
servers psi archive

2400
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,159
and the internet in general are what

2401
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:35,199
allowed us to make these presentations

2402
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:38,320
and um we can really just

2403
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:40,800

having met in uh you know in service of

2408
