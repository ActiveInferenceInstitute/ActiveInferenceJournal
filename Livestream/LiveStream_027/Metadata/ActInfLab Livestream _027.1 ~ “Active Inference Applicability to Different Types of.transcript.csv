"Speaker 1","00;00;11;00","00;00;11;09","All."
"Speaker 2","00;00;11;09","00;00;39;15","Right. Welcome, everybody, to the Active Inference Lab. Today, it's Active Lab Lifestream number 27.1 on August 24th. 20, 21. Welcome to the Active Inference Lab. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing apply to active inference. You can find us at the links here on this slide. This is recorded in an archived live stream. So please provide us with feedback so that we can improve on our work."
"Speaker 2","00;00;40;08","00;01;07;27","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and will follow good video etiquette for live stream so people could just raise their hand and see if they want to speak at any time or write a question. Live Chat. This short link has a calendar of upcoming live streams and today we're here at 27.1 on the 24th and in August 31st we'll follow up with another discussion on this same paper and then we haven't yet decided what to read in the upcoming weeks."
"Speaker 2","00;01;07;27","00;01;37;07","So if you want to come on and discuss that would be cool today in active stream 27.1. Our goal is to learn and discuss this very cool paper active inference applicability to different types of social organization explained through reference to industrial engineering and quality management by Steven Fox. And we're going to go anywhere we want with a paper or a questions and we're really appreciative to have Steven here."
"Speaker 2","00;01;37;07","00;02;01;04","So that will be a cool discussion. Let's start with just introductions. The non authors can say what was interesting to them or what kind of brought them to this discussion, and then it will be awesome to hear some context on the paper that we can take the discussion anywhere. So I'm Daniel, I'm a postdoc in California and I'll pass it to Dean Yeah."
"Speaker 3","00;02;01;04","00;02;23;02","Good morning. My name is Dean. I'm in Calgary, and the thing I found really interesting is that this was the fastest turnaround time between the point zero, which is a bit of a deconstruction. And now this point one, which is now going to be sort of put back together, reconstructed today. And I just like the, the idea that the sort of the feedback loop is really tight."
"Speaker 3","00;02;23;17","00;02;33;22","So I'm really kind of both curious and happy that that the feedback of is such quick turnaround and I'll pass it over to Stephen."
"Speaker 4","00;02;33;22","00;02;56;29","So it oh, thank you, Dean. Yeah, yeah. I'm just really intrigued. I'm very excited to hear more questions about how active inference fits in at the larger social and applied scales. And I know a lot of us here, it's kind of a bit of our thing is how does this get applied in different contexts? So yeah, thanks."
"Speaker 2","00;02;58;22","00;03;06;24","Awesome. Agreed about the whiplash dot zero. So Stephen, welcome. Please introduce yourself and then maybe give us some context."
"Speaker 1","00;03;09;26","00;03;17;23","Hello, everybody. My name's Stephen Fox. I'm a principal scientist at the Technical Research Center of Finland."
"Speaker 1","00;03;19;24","00;03;57;09","And my background is I left school when I was 16. I was an apprentice and a craftsman. And master craftsman with manual work for ten years. Then one, I was working full time in industry. I got a Ph.D. in engineering design and subsequently I've got a doctor science degree in production, engineering and I came across acts of inference and I thought it looked pretty straightforward and useful."
"Speaker 1","00;03;58;14","00;04;29;26","But then I started reading some scientific papers about it, and it became more and more difficult to understand, at least for me. So I thought the only way to resolve this was if I wrote a paper about it and sent it off to peer review. So three iterations and 5000 words of critique. Later it was published in the paper that you've read."
"Speaker 2","00;04;33;16","00;04;51;24","OK, awesome. I have a few thoughts on that and then anyone can raise their hand. So one piece was not getting more difficult to understand active inference as you went along. What dimension was that in or like what made you feel that way? And is that different than other areas that you learned about?"
"Speaker 1","00;04;53;07","00;05;45;12","Well, the scientific papers about on the topic, they are they addressing particular audiences only. And so, for example, some papers are addressing computer scientists who were using established machine learning paradigms. So the paper is directed to them. And I guess the papers are sort of responses to criticisms that come from the audience. So if a reader's not a member of that audience, it it's not clear what it's about."
"Speaker 1","00;05;45;16","00;06;28;26","So I think the core idea is straightforward enough, but so it's sort of this the, the relationship to between thermodynamic entropy and information and the, the so this is beyond the active inference literature. The basic idea is simple enough. But of course if you read a scientific paper about it, the scientific paper about it is about some particular issue that when it's applied in a very particular for a very particular purpose."
"Speaker 1","00;06;29;15","00;07;17;27","So I think I understand that the relationship between thermodynamic entropy and information entropy, but if I read any scientific paper about it, I at least can become baffled because it's a very focused issue. And of course in in scientific literature, you need to go beyond the state of the art. So I think that the thing that I asked to a colleague of mine who to to look into the literature as well, and he he was baffled enough to decline my invitation, complete with a funding possibility to carry on looking into it."
"Speaker 2","00;07;17;27","00;07;26;09","So Dean, thanks for sharing that. Stephen. So, Dean, go for it and then anyone else with a question?"
"Speaker 3","00;07;27;08","00;07;54;09","Yeah. Stephen, I was just curious. So you're kind of alluding to who's in the room that that, you know, who is the audience thing. And, and I'm curious because you, you sort of understand yourself as being a bit of a craftsman and a bit of an artisan. So who do you think the paper has already audience or do you think your paper can act as, as an attractor state?"
"Speaker 3","00;07;54;19","00;07;56;12","Because we're talking about active inference."
"Speaker 1","00;07;58;17","00;08;35;15","My own my own paper that you've been reading. Yeah. Well, well, I think well, the first thing is now it's clear to me so and also it turned out I didn't know until it was published that the academic editors, Professor Forrester. So at least it's clear to me what it is in what I'm doing. And so I can apply it."
"Speaker 1","00;08;35;15","00;09;14;07","So, for example, I've put it into a proposal that's currently under review and hopefully get some funding and then if it's of use to others, then that's good. But that would be and I've had one person who's read it very thoroughly and said it was he said it was a great help to him. And he wished this paper existed three years ago because it would have saved him so much trouble of going on."
"Speaker 1","00;09;14;07","00;09;43;00","The treasure hunt through the literature. So there's that gentleman in the world of business, right? So he also had been on this treasure hunt through the literature, finding a sentence here and a sentence there that he could sort of put together and say, well, do I understand this? Don't I understand it? So, yeah, hopefully it's of help to others, but it's not."
"Speaker 1","00;09;43;10","00;09;51;20","I mean, I don't think there's a big there's not a big audience for this. I don't think it's a niche."
"Speaker 2","00;09;53;06","00;10;16;17","It'll always be a niche. And it makes me think about how the development of this niche and the community dynamics within it have been different than maybe other fields. Like what you said, again, about getting more difficult or perceiving the the implications or the difficulty to be higher than when you initially jumped in. First off, is a is a mental learning characteristic."
"Speaker 2","00;10;16;17","00;11;01;01","You're updating your uncertainty or your scope or the policies that you're going to have to take as you explore the space. And then there's something about this field that impels a lot of people to learn theory and to explore applications, whereas I don't know other related fields. Sometimes, like you said, they're either framed as a technical debate, like people have shown this relationship under this condition here we show it for this other condition, and then that's a bit to abstracted away from meaning for many people, or it's just in some corner of the literature or just sort of it remains that a qualitative sort of, OK, cool cybernetics like goal orientation, and then it can"
"Speaker 2","00;11;01;01","00;11;17;08","veer off and maybe get disconnected from some of the formalisms. And so you mentioned the core of active inference or that now you have a clearer sense of it. So what did you initially or what is your more refined sense of what that is now?"
"Speaker 1","00;11;21;01","00;12;12;16","And so well, illumination came to me when I read a paper on kids and uncertainty and stress and it says a professor, for instance, one of the the authors, and it says that free energy something like this, that free energy is the information that somebody is lacking to to make the internal model match reality and of course, we know then we could be discussing forever and a day about what reality is."
"Speaker 1","00;12;12;16","00;12;57;24","But I thought that was so on the treasure hunt, that's a sparkling jewel of information because I thought, OK, so oh, so it's an information gap. It's an infant. What we're talking about is the information gap between the internal generative model and the external state and what the and there's variation or free energy because of course, the internal state keeps changing and the external state of the world keeps changing whether we want it to or not."
"Speaker 1","00;12;58;15","00;13;41;02","So as we try to and as actions have, having the actions we're going to take, we haven't taken them yet. So we seek to reduce expected free energy over a series of actions. And so to me, what what is that mean? It means we we seek to reduce the information gap between our internal generative model of the world and the world which we are in, that we're in so and then out of influence as well."
"Speaker 1","00;13;41;02","00;14;18;02","How do we do that? We can the actions we can take, we can either we can change what we pay attention to that's an action, or we can take action in the world to change the sensory inputs. So that's it. So and if so, if it's now this reducing the information gap on, as you noticed in the paper, I'm using this term unwanted surprise."
"Speaker 1","00;14;18;29","00;15;03;13","So surprise. All is the difference between what we are predicting and then the sensory input and the world itself. So these things can be for example, in consumer culture, survival may mean selecting the right girl and accessories. So one can survive in a social group and prosper and maintain one social capital. So if we're in the if we're in the rich world, survival can be at that level."
"Speaker 1","00;15;04;04","00;15;22;00","But if we're in the other parts of the world, survival can be the difference between literally between energy output and energy input over the course of a week. And you literally might not survive if you don't get that right."
"Speaker 1","00;15;27;14","00;15;29;14","So does that make sense?"
"Speaker 2","00;15;31;13","00;15;58;03","Very interesting description. Just to kind of trace out the order that you brought up a few variants of free energy, and so you framed it as being free energy is the information gap between the internal generative model and then the external states dynamics. So that makes me think about like trading. Like if you knew what the shape of the stock or the crypto was going to look like, you could trade perfectly."
"Speaker 2","00;15;58;15","00;16;26;22","And then for other situations, it's also like if you knew perfectly what was going to happen you could act perfectly, you could steer your ship. So that given the exact wind distribution, you were always like navigating at the fastest possible rate. But that is kind of an intractable calculation to make due to for other reasons, the internal and external states changing, and that's leading us to the variation free energy."
"Speaker 2","00;16;27;17","00;16;55;06","And then that is a statistical calculation conditioned on action which leads us to the expected free energy, which is seeking to minimize free energy indirectly through expected free energy directly. And then you point out that there was this capacity to change attention and to change sensory states through action. So I think that was a very succinct run through of a lot of the active inference things."
"Speaker 2","00;16;55;29","00;16;58;04","Stephen, what did that make you think about?"
"Speaker 3","00;16;59;20","00;17;00;14","Well, what I'm doing."
"Speaker 1","00;17;00;27","00;17;28;00","Oh, yeah. Could I just could I just read you could I just read exactly what it says in the paper? Yes. Uncertainty, interest. It says free energy. Can be regarded as the information a person is lacking and which he strikes. She could use to make his her internal model as close as to reality."
"Speaker 1","00;17;30;04","00;17;47;05","And the authors of this paper are then these are so there's professor for some, but the other authors have been doing research and so so there's Bruce McEwan and Carl Forrester."
"Speaker 2","00;17;48;02","00;17;49;05","It's called stress and."
"Speaker 1","00;17;50;06","00;18;01;19","Stress and uncertainty. Why it causes diseases and how it is mastered by the brain. And it's published in Progress in Neurobiology."
"Speaker 2","00;18;01;23","00;18;02;20","Got it. Thank you."
"Speaker 2","00;18;10;24","00;18;22;03","Cool. So that was the paper that kind of gave you the insight into the of free energy yes."
"Speaker 1","00;18;22;06","00;18;26;04","Where where's the chat here? I can send you the link in the chat."
"Speaker 2","00;18;28;04","00;18;34;13","It's on the bottom left or you can email it afterwards and we'll go to the YouTube description. So cool."
"Speaker 2","00;18;37;13","00;18;42;00","Dean, what were you going to say on that?"
"Speaker 3","00;18;42;18","00;19;06;18","No, I'm just going to ask I was just going to ask Stephen so when I was going through the paper until I got, I don't know, probably 80% in and started seeing the references that you made to the to the wayfinding aspect in the, in the exploration piece. Prior to that, there was a lot of there was a lot of attention given over to the precision piece around the free energy principle."
"Speaker 3","00;19;06;18","00;19;46;06","And what I was one of the things that I commented in the 2.27 zero was if we're talking about active inference where we're basically talking about two things at once, we're talking about precision and we're also talking about provisioning. And I think my my simple metaphor is, are we talking about a hand that fits into a glove or are we talking about the provisioning piece, which is how many different gloves have we provisioned in terms of the context that the hand might find itself in cold weather, water, or a piece of hot iron or whatever."
"Speaker 3","00;19;46;17","00;20;12;25","And so what I was, what I was curious about was in terms of the social organization and the industrial engineering piece, how the how the provisioning and the precision coincide with one another in terms of what you are thinking now, post hoc writing this paper can I."
"Speaker 1","00;20;13;18","00;20;16;04","Can I share my screen somehow?"
"Speaker 2","00;20;16;10","00;20;16;27","Yes."
"Speaker 2","00;20;18;28","00;20;30;24","Let me on share these slides. So on the bottom, left the middle button, share your screen and then I'll make it like full screen so you can make it look however you want on your side."
"Speaker 1","00;20;33;07","00;20;44;13","Could, could OK. Can you see."
"Speaker 2","00;20;44;15","00;20;55;02","Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hi, I'm Jessie, which has OK, you sharing your screen and then yeah, I can make that full screen. So thanks."
"Speaker 1","00;20;56;06","00;22;07;04","So you see a diagram? Yep. Figure one OK, so why there's so much emphasis on what's going on in down here in make to stock, in a symbol toward is because what I was trying to do was get a, an anchoring so that OK in here in where where there's mass production and mass customization where there's a great deal of refinement of what is offered through many rapid iterations that then there's something that's fixed that OK, there are there are a lot of activities like this in the world and the diagram about the quality assurance process, the so this is in a way, this is, is if we think about evolution."
"Speaker 1","00;22;07;21","00;22;43;25","Well, the Toyota Corolla is a highly evolved species compared to if we make if we make a vehicle ourselves from scrap. So I don't know. It's been in the news. The teenage teenager in India is made a took took out of scrap solar powered as well. So then that's a it's not highly evolved. It's the first prototype working prototype."
"Speaker 1","00;22;44;25","00;23;47;08","And then these things up here this top engineer to order the initial situated entropy is much higher and the barriers to information gain a much higher. So as the diagram you're looking at, just change yeah. Yeah. OK, so this is from another so that the diagram and you showed a minute ago that's from another one of my papers naturally and this is from another one so what's going on is, is that if so, with DIY, do they want do it with others presumption massive engineering that we begins with just an idea or not in our minds and we may begin the level of this in the video to you show carved piece."
"Speaker 1","00;23;47;29","00;24;17;16","So it might be if you go to a tree stump in your backyard more of a tree so and start down there raw materials and you might tape it. And then there can be this phenomenon that well there is a dialoging between the human doing the shaping and the piece of wood itself because the piece of wood has got its own properties and you're not going to get a an esthetically pleasing carving if you chisel against the grain."
"Speaker 1","00;24;17;28","00;24;58;18","Right? So, so the grain that has been shaped through perhaps hundreds of years, trees that are in California. So there's a dialog between the, the human doing, the shaping and the, the piece of wood itself shaping what the human does. But then more from an industrial point of view, if anything, that is bespoke. So the term apparel is more in it's own bespoke is more appropriate in apparel than engineer to order."
"Speaker 1","00;24;59;02","00;25;43;17","So bespoke is short for bespoke and for bespoke in full by an individual. So the materials that were to be used will be spoken for by an individual and in today what happens with Bespoke is that they'd be cloth. So that's a form material parts, buttons, and then suppose it show business. Or suppose Elton John in his most flamboyant days at an idea in his mind for a new costume, it would be a preliminary idea."
"Speaker 1","00;25;44;00","00;26;13;05","There'd be iterations of sketch ing and and doing some mock ups maybe and looking at the fabrics and they do it and then maybe we get to quite an advanced stage of the fitting and they decide that he'd look at it and think, I don't like this actually, and completely change his mind and they do something else. And then with engineer to order that could be, for example, the late Steve Jobs, his yacht."
"Speaker 1","00;26;13;27","00;26;50;09","So you might have an idea in his mind about what it might be, what it would look like. And then the, the ship builders, they're going to try and get as far up the building materials as they can. So they're going to try to use the the carbon modules that they've used on other ships or at the very least to use the 3D digital models that they've got so what's in the paper?"
"Speaker 1","00;26;51;06","00;27;34;04","It's really around this like device picture it's it's down here because then it stops the serial. So to start with something that's quite concrete and highly transferable before then, as I do later in the manuscript in the paper getting into the project processes and the wayfinding and so on, does that answer the question?"
"Speaker 3","00;27;34;28","00;28;07;00","Can I just do a quick follow up just so it's clear in my mind? So what I'm seeing here, what you put up on the screen is an idea and I don't I want to be corrected if I if I haven't got this right is I see that I see ways of laying out a a fabrication series. And I guess what I was wondering is more on a philosophical level, as you're transferring from idea to fabrication how do we use active inference there?"
"Speaker 3","00;28;07;13","00;28;49;22","How do we turn the idea and translate it into this fabrication exercise? Is there is it is it is it a planning effort? Is it a is it a getting our ideas plural? Provisioned? Is it about propositioning the garment maker before they they go on to to do the construction? Is it you know, what I'm trying to do is get in my head, clear what your focus was on, because I could I can tell now already 40 minutes into our conversation today that there was much more you could have written about."
"Speaker 3","00;28;49;22","00;29;16;10","But I'm I'm sure basically what you wanted to do was was get 11 thing clear in terms of this paper. But that for people like me that opens up a whole Pandora's box. So I just want to be in my mind certain that the focus here is about the fabrication piece and not the stuff that comes before the fabrication piece of my mind leaning in the right direction."
"Speaker 2","00;29;31;01","00;29;33;17","He was like he silently left actually."
"Speaker 1","00;29;35;17","00;29;38;24","Oh, no, sorry. Oh, no. I was on I was on mute."
"Speaker 2","00;29;39;03","00;29;40;12","OK, continue that. Oh."
"Speaker 1","00;29;41;13","00;29;41;25","It was all."
"Speaker 2","00;29;42;19","00;29;43;03","Powerful."
"Speaker 1","00;29;44;18","00;29;44;29","Yeah."
"Speaker 1","00;29;47;16","00;30;26;12","Yeah. So in the in the paper itself, I think I'm using the term it's mass production and project production. Is it. Yeah. So in so yeah. So the, the focus on the paper of the paper is on this mass production to just to try to put the word I'm looking for, I can't think of anything better. But just, just, just to sort that out, just say, OK, so that's what happens in mass production."
"Speaker 1","00;30;27;17","00;31;13;08","Here are these diagrams and these explanations here. And there's the, the statistical process control charts and things like that. That's what goes on there that's settled. Now we move on to the project. The project production. A more I'm focusing on physical production is because it's then it's tied into action. It's the there's a clear link between action and energy and of course, energy using the finite supply of for individuals and organizations."
"Speaker 1","00;31;14;21","00;31;33;16","So the mass production stuff is to provide the, the, the platform to go into more challenging areas my answering your question, Dean, or."
"Speaker 3","00;31;34;03","00;31;34;18","Yeah, more."
"Speaker 1","00;31;34;19","00;31;37;01","Problem tangential rambling trouble."
"Speaker 3","00;31;37;06","00;32;04;29","No, no, no, no. Like it. I guess it depends on how much you decide decide to zoom out. And so I just want to be clear in my head what the focus is on, because there is absolutely active inference in fabrication and manufacturing. I have no, no quarrel with that whatsoever. I just want to be able to make sure that I don't overextend what I think is the active inference potential."
"Speaker 3","00;32;05;29","00;32;20;27","Because as I said when I was reading the paper, where it got exciting for me was that whole exploration beyond the precision and on to the provisioning or provisioning part so thank you. Yes. You you cleared that up for me."
"Speaker 2","00;32;23;05","00;32;31;23","Awesome. How about Stephen with Ray's hands and then anyone else yeah."
"Speaker 4","00;32;31;23","00;32;32;09","Thank you."
"Speaker 4","00;32;34;19","00;33;10;19","I'm I'm looking at this here, and I see some interesting ways that you will engage in free energy in relation to active influence, because often we we might see mathematical models and then philosophical arguments. And I sense that this mid-ground which may be where a lot of the applied work happens at scale, is hubristic based or principles based to sort of get a sense of how to navigate and may not be directly model able because there's so many dimensions."
"Speaker 4","00;33;10;20","00;33;44;06","That's kind of interesting. So I wonder, you know, where people are talking there about situated entropy or the, the is a potential so I'm wondering how you how you think about the heuristic and how you think about how much someone could model this type of thing or how much it's about modeling and if so, what type of modeling might be useful in organizational industry contexts?"
"Speaker 1","00;33;46;02","00;34;48;29","Right. Well, I think at the end of the paper I, I raise this question. I think about well, there's, there's math and then it's modeling and then there's simple rules. And so in engineering design not just engineering design, simple rules can be extremely powerful. So design for manufacture and assembly the application of that, this led to 90% reductions in the assembly times of many products so you could, you could have just kept modeling the, the form of process as people did for for many years with ever more sophisticated mathematical models and simulation tools."
"Speaker 1","00;34;49;26","00;35;29;04","But it still still wasn't very good. We could just apply some simple rules reduce assembly time by 90% and then well then it's a lot better so I'm, I sat in one of the the meetings that Professor Frist and Maxwell Ramstad I think were going through professors persons book the monograph the name of which escapes me now."
"Speaker 2","00;35;29;11","00;35;31;19","A free energy principle for a particular physics."
"Speaker 1","00;35;32;15","00;35;48;14","Yes so Professor Freston and Thomas were in discussion with is it my cool guy who's he works for a Japanese firm."
"Speaker 2","00;35;48;23","00;35;49;13","Martin Beal."
"Speaker 1","00;35;50;08","00;36;35;05","Yes. Money Bill. Yeah. And at least one colleague of Martin's and they were discussing among themselves and I don't think as far as I could tell, they weren't able to get an intercept. Chatted about understanding between themselves and even and Martin's published a paper in Entropy where he's contesting some of the math and so my view is that of course things develop and they have to start somewhere and no doubt that will lead to good things."
"Speaker 1","00;36;35;24","00;37;10;22","But it would the more people that can understand something, the more likely it is the opportunities rich development and flaws in its current framing can be identified and progressed. So I'm an only person in my email this morning, this quote from Einstein didn't know from from geometry and experience that what do you have it there now?"
"Speaker 1","00;37;13;14","00;37;18;17","The current quote from Einstein was in my email."
"Speaker 2","00;37;19;03","00;37;31;06","I can look it up in just one second. But right now, just on the screen was the guest stream with Martin and so totally agreed. Really fascinating there. OK."
"Speaker 1","00;37;31;29","00;38;04;27","So it's a question. I'm I see. Of course, there's there's a place for math. There's a place for computer simulation. But if so if we go for so it may be that some are engaged in positive istic research and they're seeking to establish a correspondence truth and others, you know, anti positive tests interpreted as they are engaged in looking for constructive truth."
"Speaker 1","00;38;05;26","00;38;28;04","And what I'm doing is I suppose it's critical, really pragmatic truth. So if it works, it's true. So what I'm doing is well, it's probably a bit rough but maybe it's good enough to get something done yep."
"Speaker 2","00;38;28;04","00;39;21;10","Very interesting. One question I had was you talked about that kind of co-evolution with the iterations, whether it's the, the craftsperson working with the raw material with its imperfections or its characteristics, and then all the way up to this more social form, which is like Elton John and the costume designers in that feedback. So whether it's just hands on objects like drawing or whether it's it's more extended to include all these other aspects, how do we hold space for that versioning and co evolving process and for the material to allow it to reveal its characteristics while also having effective supply chains, you know, that can make CPU's and that deliver high precision materials because it"
"Speaker 2","00;39;21;10","00;39;32;08","just sounded like you had experience on on both sides with the industrial engineering as well as the craft and artisan insight yes."
"Speaker 1","00;39;32;10","00;40;51;28","Though, well with automated engineering tools, as you I'm sure you know, there are these communities of makers and where people are sharing is Instructables still going as a got online community of giving instructions for projects and things? So so one, one big challenge is that a skill. So manual skill. So if if work like carving it depends upon quite a lot of manual skill to get a reasonable looking carving that somebody might be happy with but if you're going to make something, if you can a 3D print something, then the the manual skill required isn't so, so high and that can be communicated so some of the work I've been doing is in this virtual"
"Speaker 1","00;40;51;28","00;41;46;22","social physical convergence that through virtual technology you can share socially skill, knowledge, in doing physical work and if also, you know, the open ecology movement, whether engineering designs freely available on the Internet. So through virtual social physical convergence there is great potential to enabling more people to produce what they consume to become pros humans and as Gandhi, I paraphrase Gandhi now, he said, prosperity can't come from mass production."
"Speaker 1","00;41;47;16","00;41;51;06","It can only come from production by the masses."
"Speaker 2","00;41;54;05","00;42;23;11","Very, very interesting answer. Reminds me a lot of Bucky Fuller trying to pivot the supply chain from weaponry to living re mass producing the aluminum sheets for housing. But that was kind of only potentially a transient step in this supply chain in production. And then eventually knowledge re-imagining. Will we all have a silicon foundry in our house? Probably not."
"Speaker 2","00;42;24;02","00;42;44;18","Could we all have a compost bin or could we all have a sewing kit? That's something that's a totally different type of artifact. So it can be mapped differently, Dean, than anyone else or any questions and live chat."
"Speaker 3","00;42;46;05","00;43;27;29","Well, I don't want to go off into the woods here, but I was curious, Stephen, if if you've ever read any of this stuff from Matthew Crawford in particular, shop his shop craft title and then the other one is The World Beyond Your Head. And the reason why I'm asking is because in that in that second book, which is one of my favorites, he he talks about all of the distractions in the world that caused us to not be able to be focused and precise and do the crafting never mind being able to do the the and don't play, you know, production at an industrial scale."
"Speaker 3","00;43;28;18","00;44;03;24","And so I just I was just curious if if maybe there was maybe that author was maybe whispering in your ear when you were putting this together, because if you whether you're whether you're carving something out of a piece of wood and having a dialog with it, which I completely agree with, or you're just making sure that there's no bugs in the in the command software for the for the making of the copies, it's still an ability to be able to use things like he wrote he wrote the Beyond your head book in 2014."
"Speaker 3","00;44;03;24","00;44;27;17","So I don't think he was looking at active inference but I think that that how that is employed can sometimes be perceived as just the right amount of being able to give attention over to something and still remain open to possibility. So I just wondering if that was something that may have been adding some color to what you were doing here."
"Speaker 1","00;44;29;19","00;44;34;21","No, I had not heard of that before, but I will I shall look into it with interest."
"Speaker 3","00;44;35;16","00;44;37;00","Yeah. It's fantastic stuff."
"Speaker 2","00;44;37;25","00;44;40;21","Yeah. Thanks for the comment. Dean. Stephen So let."
"Speaker 4","00;44;44;03","00;45;21;04","Yeah. This I hope this does again. Doesn't go in the weeds either. But but I think this is like, say this this touches on so many things is when you talk about the generative model and you've got embodied cognition sort of fitting into that generative models of me thinking that is an action orientated model. So it's that it's a model of how to act OK and I'm curious how far for instance, if you do welding, you mentioned welding and stuff like that."
"Speaker 4","00;45;21;23","00;45;50;00","So with this skill performance idea, that can be the generative model of how to weld, but at what point or this sort of maybe ties into something I've been exploring at what point do you think that the instructions to weld are in the niche and being used by someone's generative model of which they only have a certain sequence available?"
"Speaker 4","00;45;50;03","00;46;07;02","You know, now welding, it may be that someone just they get skillful practice and go the whole way, you know, so it's all in there. But I'm just wondering, once you get to so this management level, what point it's a niche artifact, as much as it is a generative model internally."
"Speaker 1","00;46;13;08","00;46;54;21","Well, I think with craft skills it's been able to do it. It's just at some point or another. After all, I was an apprentice I think most people who are apprentices have this feeling that you're struggling and then you wake up one morning and then suddenly you've got a feel for it. You can do it. And exactly how that is I don't think anybody really knows because somehow it's going into the the fussier system."
"Speaker 1","00;46;54;29","00;47;56;08","That's the thing. The feel for it is embodied in the flashier system. And most to my reading as a craftsperson, most literature about embodied cognition is just paying lip service to it being about embodied cognition. And it's not really addressing the nature of embodied cognition about how much that depends upon the facet system and body memory. And in this for model about extended cognition so put put your memories in your mobile phone type of thing that there's no way that you can put your, your manual skill all embodied cognition, muscle memory in a mobile phone."
"Speaker 1","00;47;56;08","00;48;24;12","You can have many videos of people doing manual work from all kinds of different angles. But so that can be informative, but it's not as you can have many videos of people riding bicycles but that's not the same as having your body memory of how to get on a bike and not fall off while you pedaling it yeah."
"Speaker 2","00;48;24;14","00;48;26;19","Stephen, go further than I ever thought."
"Speaker 4","00;48;27;22","00;49;00;17","Yeah, I think this is a good. I agree. I mean, it's just so there's some transition that happens when it goes from presumably some instructional process which is being decoded in a in a kind of a cognitive way to something more embodied, like you say, and it becomes a practice. But then there's also, I suppose and I don't know, but when you start coordinating, for instance, you've got a whole group of welders working on the size of a oil tanker so there's this kind of then it might start to move again."
"Speaker 4","00;49;01;09","00;49;25;10","There's, there's a scale beyond the individual welder, you know, and at what point does it then get beyond what I've been thinking of as an arc and experiential, eco systemic kind of know in something which has to be coordinated through some artifact, like a plan or something cool."
"Speaker 2","00;49;26;12","00;49;27;22","Let's go to Blue first."
"Speaker 4","00;49;29;27","00;49;32;03","Daniel, go ahead. Because your thought was probably in my thought."
"Speaker 2","00;49;32;13","00;49;34;03","Oh no, you should go for it."
"Speaker 4","00;49;35;26","00;50;03;12","So I have a question that was kind of related to Stephen's question. In terms of the niche modification as not as it relates to craftsmanship per se, but to industrial engineering and in this paper that was the topic of our discussion, you said that, you know, the the processes need to be carried out, right the first time in like 99% of the cases."
"Speaker 4","00;50;03;20","00;50;30;12","So remember this. And to what extent is that first time, right? I mean, I just remember as a business owner, there's a lot of soapy developments, right? So you develop recipes and KPIs so that everybody knows exactly what their job is. Exactly. What they're supposed to do and exactly the procedure for executing the job so that theoretically anyone can come in and be subsumed under the of blanket for the business."
"Speaker 4","00;50;30;12","00;50;50;05","And the niche has been modified maybe in such a way to make that happen correctly. 99% of the time, the first time said so do you think that that process developments in the industrial engineering application is niche modification or perhaps something else yes."
"Speaker 1","00;50;50;05","00;51;10;14","So this the 99 times out of 100 plus so that's six Sigma which is under the umbrella of total quality management. And that is where so if you, if you've made. So this is all by the way, are you still seeing my screen."
"Speaker 2","00;51;11;10","00;51;15;10","No. Maybe. Can you be sure OK?"
"Speaker 1","00;51;15;10","00;51;35;02","Yeah, hang on. So let me just if I go back to sure so if I go back to the point I was making about some embodied cognition."
"Speaker 2","00;51;37;06","00;51;40;19","So yep. Looks at."
"Speaker 1","00;51;40;19","00;52;21;28","This, this you see that segment of predictive processing. Yep. OK, so what I'm doing in this paper is I'm I'm making reference to the fuzzier system and body memory and relating this, you know, well, predictive global neural workspace so that's as far as I'll go with that. Now this 99 now can you see the treadmill."
"Speaker 2","00;52;22;02","00;52;22;09","Yeah."
"Speaker 1","00;52;22;17","00;53;10;17","Treadmill. Okay, there is this, this 99 point of the time. Right. This time this is come with the treadmill of production and consumption. So if if an organization invests $1,000,000,000 in building a factory and then the tooling, then it's got to mass produce and it's got to get people to, to buy what it's selling and they can't be disgruntled customers because now there's global competition and that 99% it can be measured to microns with car body panels and things like that."
"Speaker 1","00;53;13;03","00;53;49;27","But if if you're in the leather the leather cluster in Italy and you're making leather bags as has been going on for hundreds of years, then the precision is not so desirable. It's good if every one of the leather bags is made that is made is a little bit different to each other because that signals that it's handmade."
"Speaker 1","00;53;51;16","00;54;48;21","So the 99% right. First time is all wrapped up in this treadmill of production and consumption with varying levels of precision depending on what the nations. So if the nation is you're a global car maker. Well, the door better close with the obligatory clunk and it better be a watertight, airtight fit when you're driving at maximum speed otherwise customers will be lost so in different niches the level of vision that's required depends upon what customers are expecting and what the competition will tolerate."
"Speaker 1","00;54;51;20","00;54;54;10","Does not answer the question at all."
"Speaker 2","00;54;55;28","00;55;17;29","Thanks for the interesting answer all give a thought and then we'll go to Scott So first, it's almost like, what about a semantic precision? Like a writer who is outputting precision in terms of at multiple levels typographical precision and also like they don't just want to release, you know, their hand hitting the keyboard. That's not what their writing product is."
"Speaker 2","00;55;18;08","00;55;55;15","So it's not just the mechanical precision that we can talk about. And then that idea of waking up to a skill and the way you connected it to embodiment is really interesting. Maybe people would expect that from an industrial designer, but then when we think about craft in the continuum, it makes more sense. And then also that waking up aspect of it, it's like during sleep when we're simplifying and pruning neural connections, the more neural applications of free energy principle and active inference could help us see that as like a process of model simplification and unlearning the details."
"Speaker 2","00;55;55;27","00;56;30;15","And that is sort of where skill and mastery comes in, and that could be cognitive unlearning and bodily updating in terms of the morphogenesis of the tendons or the sensory receptors or all kinds of other changes. And so it's just cool that we can like really telescope in on just wanting to apply it to as you did in the paper, really partitioning out the biological systems, partitioning out the flesh and bone but we know we can go there."
"Speaker 2","00;56;30;25","00;56;58;08","But there's there's so much that you can say about just the engineering side that it was just like it makes it very interpretable yet also clearly comprehensive, which is what you pointed out was kind of lacking in the literature when you were learning. So Scott, go for the question. I don't know if you watch the dot zero, but we, we, we, we, we had a Scott David alert with a markup like it's of contracts and law, but yeah."
"Speaker 2","00;56;58;08","00;56;59;06","Anyway, go for it."
"Speaker 5","00;56;59;26","00;57;19;06","Yeah. Thank you. Sorry I was delayed. I was on another call. Yeah. A couple of things that thank you. The couple of interesting comments that sparked some questions ahead. So the talking about the fashion and the and your statement about the mobile phone can't record the fashion. Obviously, that's true. But it sparked three things in me I wanted to get your thoughts on."
"Speaker 5","00;57;19;15","00;57;47;02","One is what in the notion of fashion and the embodiment, is it possible to use active inference framings or is it fruitful in the opposition of various fashion elements? So when you're learning diving or Frisbee playing, one muscle's pushing against the bone or whatever. And so the fashion has multiple components as well. And so are there learnings that happen among fashion elements themselves?"
"Speaker 5","00;57;48;01","00;58;09;08","Because they're building actin myosin, you know, bulk or whatever. And I guess those are the proteins, but in any event, they're building both. That's one is the opposition among fashion elements. The other one is they reminded me a little bit on the mobile phone thing, Sandy Pentland at MIT, he talks about I think he did some work on predicting if people are going to get Alzheimer's by."
"Speaker 5","00;58;09;08","00;58;35;03","They have their mobile phone in their pocket and they start walking around their apartment differently. And the mobile phone is able to track that. There's a difference in Anomaly and so I thought that was kind of interesting that although the mobile phone can't track your craft, your but it can note anomalies based on picking up Sasha histories. And then the third thing, it made me think a little bit about robotic prosthesis and haptic sensors."
"Speaker 5","00;58;35;14","00;59;13;07","And so there again, you have this feedback mechanisms that are bounded. Obviously, again, they're not storing craft. But it seems like I just wondered if any of those sparked any thoughts that relative the question of the I guess that there's the mobile phone, but that sensory apparatus and the information networks being responsive with elements of fashion in different direct and indirect ways and maybe an active inference framing a hybrid between the technology, embodying a certain expectation, let's say, and the fashion, embodying a certain expectation in that kind of harmonic coupling."
"Speaker 5","00;59;13;12","00;59;15;20","If that had any thoughts on that, thank you."
"Speaker 1","00;59;20;12","01;00;19;20","Well, I think one thing that I consider in all these things is what's the but I'm going to mention the R word now reward. What's the what would be the effort to reward moderation of doing that? So if if what you said about learning to dove. So I'd say that maybe there be some rules sort of like design rules for learning to dove that maybe could be formulated that might be useful for people to learning to dove, but then going into very sophisticated modeling when individuals are so different, that might require a huge amount of effort."
"Speaker 1","01;00;19;27","01;00;57;18","And the reward may be less so. I don't think you're alone. When I was saying before, Scott, that that in industrial engineer so up until 1980 people used the mathematical models and the simulation tools available to to to model industrial processes, but then design for manufacture and assembly was introduced an assembly times in many products was reduced by 90% with simple rules."
"Speaker 1","01;00;58;19","01;01;43;14","And so all the amount of there's this place for modeling but what I'm more interested in is focusing on all the simple rules, all the simple methodologies tables and diagrams that can provide insights as design for manufacturing assembly, but that can lead to very substantial improvements. So that's, that's what I think. But, but then like this gate tracking you were talking about about people."
"Speaker 1","01;01;43;19","01;02;33;00","The other thing I also am is that if one thing that I think's very attractive about active inference is it can provide a starting point where humans and artificial intelligence can be started from the same place that, OK, what's going on here is we're trying to reduce this information gap between the internal generative model of the human being and the external state of the world that they're moving around in and both the human being trying to do that and the and the artificial intelligence is trying to do that."
"Speaker 1","01;02;33;17","01;03;12;08","And how is that done? It's done through active inference where we learn from either changing what we pay attention to and or changing the action we take. So then that can be a common starting point and maybe this can make the human being feel much more comfortable around the artificial intelligence. So I've got I'm working on a project at the moment that's this sort of third wave of AI where there's some top down rules and bottom up sensory inputs."
"Speaker 1","01;03;13;09","01;03;41;04","Combining and I see active influence has been well worth exploring as a starting point for human interaction, where both the human and the AI have got these will this this generative model that's the human, it's understandable to the human and."
"Speaker 2","01;03;43;17","01;04;21;21","Awesome points about where active inference could come into play. And also almost from a designer's perspective if they have a systems diagram or a digital twin of some type that includes active inference agents interacting first because they're all of a similar type of model, there'll be increased interoperability and ease of computing these kinds of systems and then the system designer or whatever can simulating with counterfactuals or with any other technique can formalize what affordances they do and don't have."
"Speaker 2","01;04;22;02","01;04;57;22","So it's like if someone says, the only way I'm going to get this marketing to succeed is if I update their generative model so that they think that, you know, this isn't a Ponzi scheme. It's like if that can be formalized, then we could have benevolent shaping of the niche and kinds of interjections. Like We're going to inject this much money with this much of an equation because we're doing KLA optimal control on this parameter, conditioned all these other parameters, you know, how do people feel about that versus we're going to do an ad hoc strategy based upon conversations that you weren't part of."
"Speaker 2","01;04;58;06","01;05;32;01","So and then that just while you were saying about the generalized principles, again, really interesting because there was a lot of detail in the paper and a lot of really insightful comments, but it wasn't the same formalism driven approach that we've seen in some other works directly. Of course, cited a lot of the primary literature there. So it's just cool how you pulled back to the level of the generalized principles and then we can dip down into more special mathematical framings."
"Speaker 2","01;05;32;16","01;05;49;02","But this last part of Table one, which were also all sections of the paper, are like essential kind of principles that at least you and the reviewers agreed were important enough to define clearly."
"Speaker 1","01;05;53;17","01;06;25;20","You know, I found that quote now. So this is from Albert Einstein Geometry, an experience addressed to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. 27th of January, 1921. As far as the law of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality nice."
"Speaker 2","01;06;25;20","01;06;45;08","That reminds me also the way that you again describe free energy is that information gap. It's almost like we can have a description or an estimation of, of a gap, a negative space. And so it's like, what is it? What's what's in the gap? It's like, well, if I knew or if we had any more precision than we'd tell you."
"Speaker 2","01;06;45;17","01;07;28;11","But all we know is how large the deviation is. So it's sort of like a way of one way around. It is like using a positive definition of something that's lacking and then that's closely related to this idea of tractable minimization that is better suited to be calculated than an intractable maximization like maximization of reward or expected utility, which is a totally different set of constraints and outcomes than a variation of free energy gradient descent so Scott and then anyone else."
"Speaker 5","01;07;30;03","01;08;05;29","I wanted to you got me thinking of the just the I guess the library of opportunities for a system. I'm not sure how to characterize it, but one of the things I've been fussing with is the Chris Christopher Alexander for folks who haven't been in that space with I just learned that a few months ago about him. But he's an architect who collected the idea that he had had was the collect up is in architecture and is collecting up different practice and architecture and different patterns."
"Speaker 5","01;08;06;15","01;08;35;09","And he came up with the pattern language. The idea was if you want to create a portico and a place to negotiate private and public space for instance, he had certain patterns that happen in different kinds of architecture. And so if you wanted to do architecture, you could look at a bunch of patterns and stare at them for a while and see which one look best and it's interesting with these questions of filling gaps, you know, the easiest place to look is what other similarly situated parties have done in similar situations."
"Speaker 5","01;08;35;09","01;09;10;23","So if you have that crosstalk, the peer to peer conversation, then you can discover without having to go through all the pain and the cost of discovering yourself. And that's the notion of guilds, right? I heard reference earlier to Apprenticeship Learn by the Masters, not just reinventing the wheel kind of idea. OK, so and it's interesting when we talk about gap filling because in more static systems, culturally static systems, let's say historically quiescent system periods, then you can learn a lot from the guilds."
"Speaker 5","01;09;11;17","01;09;49;03","But in periods of high dynamic change, environmental change, the guilds are going to maybe under-served you because there may be so much change that the old practices just don't hold up the externalities are such that they swamp them all things. And so I wonder in that gap if there is an element of discovery, both of the available, what are the ways to discover what's available and then discover the things that are not available a bit because they're in a different silo so they haven't been available, but maybe because they haven't yet been tried in any silo, right?"
"Speaker 5","01;09;49;03","01;10;09;25","So they're just not emerging type of notions. And maybe that's a bad question. I don't know. It just it felt like that gap. There's there's easy, low hanging fruit of practices. Chris Alexander kind of stuff is relatively low hanging and then it seems like there's other mechanisms here of discovery, and maybe that's randomness and maybe that has to do with evolution."
"Speaker 5","01;10;10;05","01;10;13;13","But anyway, if that's comments well, I'd like some comments on that."
"Speaker 2","01;10;13;18","01;10;14;24","Yeah, awesome question, Scott."
"Speaker 1","01;10;17;06","01;10;19;18","Are you are you still seeing my screen?"
"Speaker 2","01;10;19;18","01;10;21;08","Yes, I'll make it big. OK."
"Speaker 1","01;10;22;07","01;11;18;25","All right. OK, so now leapfrog skills. Leapfrog skills. Yes, there it is. So the thing is about manual skills, as Scott was just saying, the guilds and everything. So in the work I do, development projects point out that industrial thinking is 300 years old. It came from the English Midlands 300 years ago and and taking that as the as the basis of doing development work may not be a good idea because it's 300 years old and the world's changed and so it is with skills that it's good to be able to carve wooden pieces."
"Speaker 1","01;11;18;25","01;11;50;03","It's can be very rewarding and maybe it can bring a few people some economic benefits, but that can't address the poverty of billions of people and craft skills, as I say to people will when they say ministers, when they say, well, we need to develop training centers and give people apprenticeships. And I point out, well, that's medieval thinking, so that isn't good, that's not very good."
"Speaker 1","01;11;50;28","01;12;21;02","So here there's an explanation of leapfrog skills that take you down to a there's some diagrams here who just simply go bear with me this is taking a long. So where."
"Speaker 2","01;12;21;15","01;12;31;28","Were you? What was your active inference stage or awareness at this time in 2016 or when you were writing it leading up to here zero."
"Speaker 1","01;12;32;24","01;12;55;14","I didn't well but the thing is it looks it depends how you look at it because I so if you're doing manual work then you're doing active inference because it what what what are we doing. That's right. So information gap and we're going to do this because I need to do this because if I don't do this I'm not going to get paid."
"Speaker 1","01;12;56;13","01;13;25;01","If I don't get paid, I can't buy food. I can't pay the rent. So how am I going to do that? That's the information gap. And then so I'm going to pay attention to my priors. What have I done before? I'm going to pay attention to this, the sensory input from the external state and notice that, oh, that or not, all the materials I need are here."
"Speaker 1","01;13;25;21","01;13;54;28","So I need to improvise adaptive expertize. I need to not apply what I've done before. Where it's not going to help. I'm going to have to think of a bit of something to do it. And so in my opinion, active inference is certainly what's going on in manual work. And then you give it a try. It doesn't all right."
"Speaker 1","01;13;54;28","01;14;10;11","It works to some extent or not to the extent. So then look back in the generative model. I go on what I tell something like this before, look around though. Look, I see in the distance that there's some bracket I can use over there or use that and so on."
"Speaker 1","01;14;12;20","01;14;41;28","But to go back to this craft thing that can you see that figure five? Yep. The kind of stuff you put around to do. So doing these joints that difficult to forward's effects. And very often if you stare at the search joints closely, you'll see the living filled up with glue and dust or a bit of more paint being stuck in the well."
"Speaker 1","01;14;41;28","01;15;17;15","Then if you do this instead, it actually looks better and it doesn't no need for the Craft Gill Guild. It's just a kit. It's just these molds it's just a kit. So you've got the and these blocks here in the corner, it makes it look more fancy. And you can just assemble it. So I go back to this one kind."
"Speaker 1","01;15;17;27","01;15;26;08","So do you see now a diagram that says movable factories?"
"Speaker 2","01;15;26;08","01;15;26;18","Yep."
"Speaker 1","01;15;27;21","01;16;09;25","OK, so movable factories on the job training product. Kids in the middle engineering design, capable processes for mistake proof production so this is as we know, IKEA spread around the world much more successful. Any furniture company is competitors because they do engineering design processes for mistake proof production. And this can be applied to many things. Water towers solar arrays, anything, really."
"Speaker 1","01;16;10;28","01;16;55;28","So this is what Scott said about the craft guilds that yes, craft guilds, although I'm the most successful myself, it's medieval thinking and it's it's just not scalable. And it's very, very wasteful. Hugely wasteful and really crap. Skills are good for coping with chaos, but chaos is hugely wasteful, awash with entropy that can't be resolved so in doing our development projects, this is what I'm advocating, what's in my diagram."
"Speaker 2","01;16;59;16","01;17;03;03","Dean with a raised hand and then anyone else who raises their hand."
"Speaker 3","01;17;05;12","01;17;51;28","I'm just throwing down a couple of things here. So it's kind of fit. And this is a nice fit into the glove of, of what Scott was asking and then what I saw in terms of the title of that paper. So my question is this If we using the same kind of triangular shape as the five wise if we start at the top with learning and that learning, then breaking down into one aspect of which is updating and then that breaking down into one act of which is gap, respecting that, then breaking down into assessing what the step function is and then that breaking down finally into some sort of action taken, which is the"
"Speaker 3","01;17;51;28","01;18;31;02","filling to follow or the gap closing. Is that medieval thinking or is that an invention gradient descent I know that's a lot of stuff, but if you want to take the best of what happened 300 years ago and not get locked in to starting with I'm going to close a gap because I perceive a gap present, is there a way that we can take the best of the past, meld it with the current and come up with an inventive gradient descent, which which doesn't sort of hold us to either the craft or the mass production."
"Speaker 1","01;18;34;06","01;18;35;09","I believe we can."
"Speaker 3","01;18;36;16","01;18;38;18","Good. We'll be good friends."
"Speaker 1","01;18;40;06","01;18;50;09","Yes, and in in the paper. Let's see if we can get this."
"Speaker 2","01;18;55;21","01;19;00;08","There's yet uncertainty and stress. Nice questions."
"Speaker 2","01;19;07;06","01;19;38;22","What you said about the scalability of the mentorship and the guild model versus alternative models was really interesting because there's the sort of academia versus non academia divide. So with that sort of student or a PhD and that traditional mentorship system and how that's evolving then there's the traditional craft trajectory, The Apprentice and the Master, and the way that that is also changing and the way that academia and research are reconnecting."
"Speaker 2","01;19;38;22","01;19;43;16","So there's just so many cool threads about how everybody will find guidance."
"Speaker 1","01;19;44;27","01;20;15;09","OK, so are you, are you seeing my screen yet? Massive engineering must customization mass production. Yep. So on I'm looking at in this one, I'm looking at it from the point of view of consumer culture and seeing how these complement each other. So it's in the design about how these can all be complementing each other."
"Speaker 3","01;20;17;17","01;20;19;03","I'm definitely going to have to redo that."
"Speaker 1","01;20;20;26","01;20;24;27","Remember to maintain firm downward pressure on the soles of your feet. What do you do."
"Speaker 2","01;20;27;15","01;20;30;09","Add pump to the tempo of staying alive."
"Speaker 1","01;20;32;07","01;20;35;16","And to keep your feet on the ground, otherwise it'll blow your socks off."
"Speaker 2","01;20;37;14","01;20;41;00","Scot Yeah."
"Speaker 5","01;20;41;09","01;21;10;15","When I get back, that was you struck me with that statement before. The craft skills are very wasteful and they're useful with chaotic situations, but chaos is really wasteful. That's really that struck me. And I wanted to ask you, I thought, well, that's interesting because inefficiency is resilient and distributed makes me think about distributed agriculture, distributed manufacturing. A lot of the resilience discussions that are going on now."
"Speaker 5","01;21;10;15","01;21;36;17","I work with a group called All Fed that's trying to figure out how everyone in the world and things like that, and then also the notions of monoculture in the production of cheap industrial calories. But then there's no variety. And again, getting back to this, the notion in active inference I keep coming back to Cano's characterization in the second law of thermodynamics that you need the hot and cold differentials to perform work with the heat engine."
"Speaker 5","01;21;37;07","01;22;09;11","And I feel like you need the differentials in information to have active inference, Bayesian occurrence, so that inefficiency feels like it's laden with value because of the differentials that are in there, the chaos and the it feels like there's lots of value to be derived from chaos and inefficiency. And maybe that's part of what was well, I guess it was being done in the Industrial Revolution notions is to craft skills and reduce the inefficiencies and derive value."
"Speaker 5","01;22;09;29","01;22;40;20","And it feels like as we have more chaos in the information sphere, are we how might we release those that value what but still recognizing that maybe it's a there's a font of inefficiency that keeps coming at us because interaction volumes are going up. So we don't have to worry about exhaustible supply of inefficiency that awaits us. But if we mine the inefficiency and bring it into the system where it's known then it seems like it creates value."
"Speaker 5","01;22;40;20","01;22;48;06","I wonder, does any of that come into play? And I hope that was made some sense yes."
"Speaker 1","01;22;48;06","01;23;40;20","Yeah, yeah. But before I go into that also, Dean, there's this paper domesticating artificial intelligence can you. Yes. On the screen. Yeah. OK, so expanding human self-expression through applications of artificial intelligence in process action. So that's another one about this combining different, different paradigms of production and consumption and consumption. OK, so yes. So what I was saying about inefficiency, so perhaps I should explain better what I mean, that redundant variation."
"Speaker 1","01;23;41;18","01;24;13;02","So redundant variation doesn't add it consumes energy and it doesn't add any value. So that that is the thing that with this leapfrog skills of pointing that out that, well, it serves no useful purpose to have redundant variation, variation can add value but not, not redundant variation. So that's what I mean. And also it depends on what people's circumstances are."
"Speaker 1","01;24;13;02","01;24;49;21","So if people of live in on the edge as many people are, then there's just no, they don't have any spare energy and redundant variation can well, we know it. You know, this term the precariat that people in the West that that people don't have they have 0 hours contracts and and things like that and they're in the precariat."
"Speaker 1","01;24;50;03","01;25;22;19","But the real precariat in the world are the people who were living on the edge in developing countries because, you know, they're poor then they're staying alive is literally precarious. The very don't getting water is difficult. And when they get water, it's dirty. So they've got a choice. They can drink it to keep living, but if they drink it, they're going to get ill and maybe the illness is going to kill them."
"Speaker 1","01;25;23;21","01;25;39;14","So there are different scenarios. And in in development work, it's redundant variation is just trapping can keep people trapped in desperate poverty."
"Speaker 5","01;25;42;06","01;26;10;01","You just comment a little bit on the expand on that redundant variation, what that looks like in some examples. And also I just wanted to mention in one of the groups and working with all that we're thinking of developing how many days to starvation app for people and like the countdown clock in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, but how many days a person has in their food availability, including what's in the refrigerator, what's in their food desert, et cetera."
"Speaker 5","01;26;10;11","01;26;21;01","But it's days to starvation because of that awareness that precariousness. But anyway, but if you could talk a little bit more about we're done in various ways, I'm not quite sure what that looks like is it?"
"Speaker 1","01;26;22;16","01;27;00;28","Can you see this diagram again on my screen? Yes. OK, so in that in the difficult to form and fix on the left hand side, the shape, if there's a little bit of a twist and a little bit of poor machining in the timber sections there, it can make forming that joint really difficult. And then those so those variations, they're just they're just redundant."
"Speaker 1","01;27;00;28","01;27;45;05","They don't they don't add any value. They lead to because there is this this dualistic of entropy. There's a little bit of physical disorder because maybe the woods a bit twisted or the machining was a bit off. So those are the information uncertainty. How am I going to make that joint? So then suppose, suppose there's six ways of forming that joint with equal probability, just like if they're doing the, the information entropy 2.58 bits and that 2.58 bits, it's just it's just not adding any value to that gap of 2.58 bit."
"Speaker 1","01;27;45;19","01;28;15;02","But with this alternative on the right hand side, those are the square pieces in the corners. They can have a rebate formed in them in that in their thickness. So there's quite a substantial overlap. There's maybe nine millimeters to three eighths of an inch overlap. So if, if the joint isn't perfect, it just covers it up and it doesn't matter."
"Speaker 1","01;28;16;09","01;28;42;23","So that's a practical example. And then if we scale that up to all the the many, many things that can be so why should that factor an assembly reduce its assembly times by 90% is because it just eliminated all redundant variation does that help you."
"Speaker 2","01;28;43;09","01;29;16;23","With that reminds me of is almost like we talk about aberrant precision. We've talked about that on the neuro psychiatry side delusional beliefs, failure modes of decision making algorithms. It's OK to not be latched on to the perfect strategy as long as there's this healthy uncertainty about strategic decision making because it's that uncertainty that's getting kind of coasted on that should the system persist, ends up finding an appropriate or an adequate strategy but aberrant precision when there's like high precision confidence."
"Speaker 2","01;29;17;01","01;29;36;24","But then also it's off target with its mean estimation, things can go awry. And so it's like that doorframe on the left, the mass produced one. Then, as you've pointed out, it's kind of like a false sense of precision because if you look at it, it looks like the more precise one, it looks like, oh, it's sharper or it was machined such and such angle at exactly this angle."
"Speaker 2","01;29;37;05","01;30;03;17","But in that one degree, tolerance would sounds like really accurate on the machining wheel. Now that plays out on the doorframe and now it's actually less precise in practice. And also like you pointed out, the example with the cupboard or the bookshelf being attached to the wall, like you can design for internal precision really well, but then it's hard to take a step back and have latitude for like the wiggle room of real life."
"Speaker 2","01;30;03;28","01;30;13;01","But that's actually where the success or the failure of the product in use is going to be. So it's very interesting topics that you brought up."
"Speaker 5","01;30;15;01","01;30;33;17","You know, just, just a quick follow up. My happiest one of my happiest days in my life is when I discovered that you can mix sawdust with epoxy and then do gap filling. And I actually completed projects a lot faster as a result. The one other comment on that is contracts, you know, mass contracts. We had a lot of negotiations."
"Speaker 5","01;30;33;17","01;30;57;23","I used to work with banks and software companies and things doing contracts. And it was funny because in negotiations, a math contract has that you get rid of redundant variation, right? You just get there's no reason to have a different contract for this thing, but it constrains the people who have less power in the negotiation. But it was funny because people say to you when you're in the negotiation with someone who has a math contract, they'll say, well, you can't change it."
"Speaker 5","01;30;57;23","01;31;20;19","This is the way we always have done it. And then, right. They're saying, this is just it and then the answer back to that is, well, let me show you how we're going to do it for the next 20 years, you know, because it's a world changes around these things that have insufficient variation in them. And so it's, it's interesting when what seems like a system that is eliminated, redundant variation becomes anachronistic."
"Speaker 1","01;31;24;26","01;31;57;15","Are you seeing my screen? No. You sing three circles. Yes. OK, so the score you were talking about a distributed art. And so what's I'm working on is this it's this highly distributed process option, highly distributed and highly efficient compared to distributed subsistence, which is distributed but not efficient and centralized which is efficient but not distributed. So that's the thing."
"Speaker 1","01;31;58;00","01;32;04;14","And here is the dark picture of what happens with centralization OK?"
"Speaker 2","01;32;06;14","01;32;19;10","So it looks like the phobia and retina, the focus, all the attention is on the the heart of the empire. And then it's all dark."
"Speaker 1","01;32;22;14","01;32;23;10","So nice."
"Speaker 2","01;32;23;10","01;32;35;07","Images and also that distributed models. Very cool so Steven with a raised hand and then anyone else who wants to raise their hand or a question in the chat."
"Speaker 4","01;32;38;02","01;33;11;23","Now I'd like to bring in a bit more on that esthetics and embodiment. I got a couple of notes actually in the, in the, in the YouTube chat as well, just with a link I don't know if you've heard of the William Morris and Philip Webb Red House in Bexley. He can talk a lot about the crafts because they actually had this whole thing in the 1800s where they were wanting to redo the crafts in the, in the house and they actually had holes in the ceilings they could redesign the ceilings in a craft way for different events."
"Speaker 4","01;33;12;04","01;33;41;27","So there's this push against industrialization. So I'm wondering when you mentioned about the better esthetics by putting the corners, I mean in some ways you, you, you, you gain what could be seen at one level of esthetic. But there again with the craft and seeing some of the variation, the, the reach and I wonder how you feel about this, the reach of the embodied influence of the person making it is, is lessened."
"Speaker 4","01;33;42;04","01;33;58;16","So the ability to I wonder what your thoughts are about the ability to infer from the other direction what the process of creation was and how that esthetic creates more soul how that is in a way, what the soul of objects are."
"Speaker 1","01;34;03;12","01;34;47;08","And so let me try to sum up what my understanding is of what you or you were saying. So my understanding what you're saying, correct me if I'm wrong, is that if something is crafted, then it has more inherent value, at least to the person doing the who crafted it. So if somebody carves a carves a sculpture, then that has more inherent value to them."
"Speaker 1","01;34;48;03","01;34;53;13","Than if they downloaded a model of the sculpture and 3D printed it."
"Speaker 4","01;34;54;14","01;35;26;08","So yeah, there's an and on top of that, the ability for their embodiment of creation, they're in the process of creation of the active inference or an active inference process of creation extends further out into that distributed network because someone is further removed from that person could see that sculpture and they could get closer to being them than being closer to being a CDC routing machine operator."
"Speaker 4","01;35;27;02","01;35;27;14","You know."
"Speaker 1","01;35;29;25","01;36;09;00","I'm well OK. I don't, I don't well, I don't know because if I see it, if I see a sculpture, then I can appreciate it, hopefully. But I'm far from being able to do it myself. And so let me give you a more mundane example that in many parts of the world, wolves used to have wolves and ceilings used to have wet plaster applied to them to make them smooth."
"Speaker 1","01;36;10;12","01;36;39;00","And so plastering a ceiling getting the plaster on the ceiling, the wet plaster on the ceiling, and it's smooth is a very difficult thing to do. And so people will do apprenticeships as plaster ism and so on. And so I can see that, I can say, oh man, that looks maybe I could try to do it myself as well."
"Speaker 1","01;36;39;00","01;37;13;25","And all the plaster would end up on the floor and on me. And then I realized Oh, this is really difficult, but it doesn't get me any closer to being a plaster with the skill to, to get the plaster on the ceiling. And if all dwellings depend upon the construction of all dwellings depends upon such processes, then billions of people are going to be really mean in bad dwellings or no dwellings."
"Speaker 1","01;37;13;27","01;37;43;20","So that's that. If I understood you correctly, I don't think it makes me. But if, if I see somebody putting up some boards on a ceiling that are designed to give a a functionally adequate and esthetically adequate ceiling, and I see them do that, then I can do it cool."
"Speaker 2","01;37;43;20","01;37;44;05","Thanks."
"Speaker 4","01;37;44;05","01;38;12;14","Just one, just one just one follow up. Just very quickly, please. I think I suppose I could also I mean, I'm not necessarily disagreeing with what you're saying at all. I think that I would also just in terms of this distributed, like if you go into a medieval house and you see a more rough and ready plaster and you may not know how to do it, but you could imagine the process of someone embodies that did it even if you couldn't do it yourself, I so I was wondering about that."
"Speaker 4","01;38;12;29","01;38;29;20","Those kind of those removals as things get industrialized, which may be, you know, maybe that's why sometimes we add texture back in and sometimes more expensive stuff that we buy in the shops actually has texture put back in and that can be actually expensive to produce."
"Speaker 2","01;38;31;12","01;38;51;19","It reminds me of graffiti. Like when you see graffiti, you can imagine in Affordance that would lead to you having done that art versus like a, you know, an Apple phone. It's delivered like in the conch shell with smooth. And, you know, it's sort of the extreme case where at the very least, it's more cognitive to understand how it was built."
"Speaker 2","01;38;51;29","01;39;19;23","And that definitely makes sense. And things that are well-worn, they doesn't make it like better or more valuable or just makes them more able to play a part of a story in someone's life. Like putting up a kid's drawing. It becomes about the person and latching on to a broader network of connections versus the very parsimonious and ruthless efficiency of an industrial design process that kind of seeks to remove the human touch."
"Speaker 2","01;39;19;23","01;39;43;21","And like, you know, if it was a craft, beer has little dirt. It's character, it's a mass produced one, has little dirt, it's dirty. So we tolerate different types of imprecision when we know that we're dealing with like our neighbor versus when we're expecting some international shipment of food so Scott, with the question at then it looks like you want to share something else, Steven."
"Speaker 5","01;39;44;26","01;40;12;05","You know, it's it's interesting. It's kind of the discussed reaction is invoked there, too. And that idea of that rejection. And anyway, the that reminded me of that last bit was there's a black box of A.I. that we talk about now. Will, in a way, we have a black box of industrialization. Right. The thing was made, but we don't know how and it used to be that if you look at this, if you look at a shoe, you can say, I see the stitches and I see there's a cow over there."
"Speaker 5","01;40;12;05","01;40;33;24","I could see how you get leather and I get it. Then you look at a Nike shoe and you're like, I have no idea where that came from, how it was made, if it was glued, what was put together. Right. It's just so in a way, we have that black box now. When Marx was talking about alienation in industrialization, maybe part of our alienation is not knowing our connection to craft."
"Speaker 5","01;40;34;15","01;40;59;05","One of the things I talk to people about is in Europe, they have these rights called drop morale. They're moral rights. It's a copyright right overlay. So if I sell you a painting in Europe, you can't destroy it. I still have rights as an artist. Moral rights in the art is a form of expression. I think it has a Hegelian and Kantian background, but let's put that aside and then in the United States, buy sell your painting, do anything you want to it."
"Speaker 5","01;40;59;16","01;41;34;25","We have a long, utilitarian notion of these expression and rights in individual rights. So it feels like there is indifference here philosophically in terms of connection to expressive content in the drop moral context. You're not talking about industrial production, government, copyright, which gets towards industrialization of guild type production, right? Because it didn't work of original authorship. Again, maybe not directly related, but I just thought was really interesting that in a way we're looking at that black box question again and humans being alienated from production."
"Speaker 5","01;41;35;12","01;41;44;26","And I wonder if there's some aspect in the work that we're seeing here of that De Leon needing production. Would come in on that?"
"Speaker 2","01;41;45;22","01;41;47;03","Next question, Scott, thank you."
"Speaker 1","01;41;48;10","01;42;21;02","Can you can you see a diagram? It's sort of got a slope line and some black boxes sort so it says we're increasing geographical and social distribution of production. So Degrowth, now degrowth, centralized industrial production. This is happening with premature deindustrialization in many countries in the world. They had some industrialization and now it's it's going and we see that it's coming on."
"Speaker 1","01;42;21;02","01;43;12;25","It's as distributed, industrial, distributed, artisanal and distributed DIY that's growing and what but probably what's still going to come from centralized industrial production is materials form materials and then components and then local goods is becoming more distributed than distributed infrastructure down here this so industrial production. So this requires massive capital investment in fixed industrial manufacturing assets. Then you get industrial mass production and this is all based upon you get higher productivity from that massive capital investment."
"Speaker 1","01;43;14;12","01;43;49;23","But can this produce higher wages, more goods purchased? Is there still scope for that? Will this lead to increased production, employment evidence suggests not so. This is non-industrial production and for want of a better term, so with this, there's minimal capital investment in flexible non industrial production, outside industrial production. Then there's higher productivity and that's coming. What are the options?"
"Speaker 1","01;43;49;23","01;44;24;20","There is you can have higher value artisanal production so if you know, if if shoes are handmade to some extent, as they are with the company doing that, those in Ethiopia that can lead to higher wages and that's more goods and infrastructure made with personal commitment leading to increased paid personal production, employment and then down lower price, DIY production, lower expenditure."
"Speaker 1","01;44;25;09","01;44;59;12","So with presumption there are you could, for example, do produce something with some degree of craft in it and that could produce oil sales price, higher wages. And then at the same time your costs can be reduced. So if you if you fabricate your own solar panels and you install them yourselves and suppose you can get all your electricity from that, well then your energy costs go down."
"Speaker 1","01;45;00;02","01;45;06;03","So I'm seeing this as being is that diagram very visible and you'll have."
"Speaker 2","01;45;06;17","01;45;11;00","I made it large. It's what you see on see is not what the livestream is."
"Speaker 1","01;45;11;20","01;46;06;20","OK, all right. So so that diagram I think is addressing both sides of this that on the one hand you're reducing the lower priced DIY. So the the idea is to eliminate all redundant variation to drive down costs of essential goods as low as possible so as many people can access them as possible so they can fabricate and install themselves and the higher value artisanal production this this is this using automated engineering, this massive engineering type of thing so."
"Speaker 2","01;46;07;08","01;46;34;05","Reminds me of doing more with less and also Bucky so maybe we can just each have a final thought or a final area that we want to explore a little bit next week. And then otherwise this has been an awesome discussion. So you just think for a few seconds for what would, what would be our what was something that will stick with us from today?"
"Speaker 2","01;46;34;07","01;46;39;09","Where do we want to take it in our data? So Scott first, then Dean."
"Speaker 5","01;46;41;03","01;47;08;14","I really like that concluding thought on that really feels like that conversion of labor and attention and skills and the into embodied are embodied world and that feels like that dynamic is going to be very interesting to continue to explore in that last diagram there. Those pathways in the complimentary pathways are fascinating and thank you for a fantastic discussion thank you."
"Speaker 2","01;47;08;14","01;47;09;03","Scott Dean."
"Speaker 3","01;47;09;19","01;47;31;02","Yeah, I just wanted to I have to read this because I was listening and thinking about what I wanted to close with my takeaway today, besides the fact that I got a new reference with embedded jet boots, that I'm going to have to go in and try to hold myself down with is that perhaps life is an apprenticeship in wayfinding across scales."
"Speaker 3","01;47;32;08","01;48;03;27","So one of the things that I think that we're trying to do in these live streams is popularize active inference. We're trying to drive down the costs per se of that entry barrier. And so these kind of interaction processes like we're having today in this point, one, I think are giving us more of a sense of how that cost factor can be addressed beyond a roomful of academics, which I think we all agree is kind of a small niche."
"Speaker 3","01;48;04;24","01;48;41;04","And I think that's something that we're all trying to make available to more people. So that last reference that you made, Scott, was actually pretty, pretty helpful. I think one of the things that we try to do in terms of an interaction ist forward approach is in the point zero, we deconstruct in the point once we reconnect direct and then in the point year, which is next Tuesday, which I'm unfortunately going to be on a I'm going to be away from, but that's where the new or next Superordinate is sort of emerge."
"Speaker 3","01;48;41;08","01;49;02;25","And so I think the way that we're trying to set this up, whether it's going to I don't know when it's going to sort of take off, like when the jet boots will really be fired up. But I think we're putting things in place for that to happen. So I think on the one hand, I can I can kind of laugh about the fact that I'm going to have to anchor myself."
"Speaker 3","01;49;03;10","01;49;14;17","But on the other half of me says any time we can get creative with this stuff, it's it's worthy. It's it's enthusiasm worthy. So thank you for sharing with us today. I really appreciate it."
"Speaker 2","01;49;15;23","01;49;18;23","Thank you, Jean. Steven, and then Blue."
"Speaker 4","01;49;20;13","01;49;52;01","Thank you again. Yeah, really enjoyed it. Today is a great, great call. And I'm going to take away the idea of situated entropy. I think that's really useful as a bit more a lot legs to it. And I'm really interested in more about talking about pragmatic approaches to use in the variation of expected free energy. I think that goes beyond what is often maybe pragmatism, which we've had here as a kind of philosophy or thing, but maybe pragmatics in terms of design and application."
"Speaker 4","01;49;52;01","01;49;53;15","So thank you, William."
"Speaker 2","01;49;54;16","01;50;40;10","For than just my closing thought is I'm really fascinated by your experience and theorizing and other publications on this, the past and present and future of that continuum. Or multidimensional space between craft and Artisanship the boutique bespoke everything on that principle component side and then industrialization side. And have we hit peak something? You know, have we seen the biggest solid state drives of all time in 2019 that was peak solid state or what will be peak what and what's going to be what are we at the bottom of what are we near the top of and some of the the roads and the paths that you sketched are pretty cool."
"Speaker 2","01;50;40;14","01;50;44;01","So Stephen Fox if you have any final comments."
"Speaker 1","01;50;46;04","01;50;51;13","Scott could you email me a link to the organization that you were mentioning?"
"Speaker 2","01;50;52;27","01;50;58;05","I will email I'll email Stephen's email address to Scott."
"Speaker 1","01;50;59;10","01;51;14;01","OK, thank you very much. Well, thank you. Thank you very much for taking the trouble to read my my paper because I was plowing a lonely furrow when I was doing it."
"Speaker 4","01;51;15;11","01;51;15;22","Oh."
"Speaker 2","01;51;16;21","01;51;17;23","Lou, with the last word."
"Speaker 4","01;51;18;17","01;51;31;04","Thanksgiving. And, you know, you gave us so many additional references to read that. That's really what I'm looking forward to doing between now and next week is digging into some of this additional literature that I've been made aware of."
"Speaker 2","01;51;31;24","01;51;42;20","Cool. So till next week, we'll read the papers think your questions, invite any colleagues or anyone else. So all backgrounds are welcome to join. So we'll see you all next week."
"Speaker 1","01;51;43;13","01;51;45;06","Bye bye. Bye. Bye."
