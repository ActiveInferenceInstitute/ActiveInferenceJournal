"Unknown","00;00;00;00","00;00;34;25","Three, two. What Hello and welcome to active in French love live stream number 27.0 it's August 23rd 2021 and we're going to be discussing the paper active inference applicability to different types of social organization explained through reference to industrial engineering and quality management. So welcome to the Active Inference Lab. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing apply to active inference."
"Unknown","00;00;35;10","00;01;04;09","You can find this at the links here on this slide. This is a recorded and archived live stream. So please provide us with feedback so that we can improve on our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we'll be following video etiquette for lectures at the short link, you can find the roadmap of the upcoming discussions that we're going to be having, and these are going to be group discussions on August 24th tomorrow and then August 31st for number 27.1 and two."
"Unknown","00;01;04;24","00;01;28;04","And hopefully the author will be joining us for both discussions and we have some openings in the coming weeks. If you want to join for a session or if you want to recommend somebody who should join today in Active Stream 27.0, we're going to be learning and discussing about this paper with the aforementioned long title by Stephen Fox."
"Unknown","00;01;28;08","00;01;51;23","And the link is here. And just like a lot of the other zero videos, all of them, this video is just an introduction for some of the ideas it's not a review or a final word. It's kind of always this assemblage of all of the participants here, just modifying the slides and going down a few avenues that we thought were interesting and setting up some questions to discuss in the DART one and two."
"Unknown","00;01;52;19","00;02;13;06","So we'll go over the aims and the claims of the paper and the abstract and roadmap and then talk about keywords, then go through the figures and tables. So if you want to participate in these group discussions tomorrow or the following week, then just let us know or save and submit your questions and get in touch with us if you want to participate."
"Unknown","00;02;14;14","00;02;37;16","So we can just start with hello that. It will be cool to hear from both of you. What drew you to the paper or what made you interested in talking about it? I'm Daniel and I'm in California, so whoever wants to go first I'm blue and I'm a independent research consultant in New Mexico, and I liked this paper."
"Unknown","00;02;37;16","00;03;19;16","It was a really refreshing, kind of interesting and very readable perspective compared to a lot of the other papers. And it made some links with industrial engineering, which I thought was very interesting and kind of like a new take on active inference. And a few people DNA and I'm up in Calgary, and what I found interesting about the paper is just looking at it through the lens of Engineering's Engineering's Priors, I guess in terms of what they would hold up as active inference just because of what they do every single day."
"Unknown","00;03;20;25","00;04;06;24","And again, that kind of juxtaposed with the social piece was really interesting to me. Because not to overgeneralize, but when you're focusing on how to break something down, you don't tend to tend to look at the whole. So I thought that was really interesting to try to pull those two things together and make them coherent. I agree. There's that discussion of the interfaces between the engineered system and the actual way it's used in the niche, which I think we're going to return to when we're talking about like a bookshelf so the paper is titled, the link are shown here, and I guess maybe do either of you want to just read the first two aims"
"Unknown","00;04;06;24","00;04;43;03","and claims? Sure. So the principal contribution of this paper is to relate active inference theory to everyday practice in social organization. Active inference is a core corollary of the free energy principle, which formalized with cognition in the oral poetic organization of living systems that resist the second law of thermodynamics by occupying a limited, limited repertoire of states thus persisting as bounded self-organizing systems over time, ok, then I'll read the last two, then anyone can give a thought."
"Unknown","00;04;43;18","00;05;36;27","It is explained throughout the paper how industrial engineering and quality management better enable social organization to occupy a limited number of states in order to persist as a bounded self-organizing systems over time. Rather than dissipating into their surrounding environment. Although previous papers by others have encompassed active inference up to the levels of sociocultural cognition this is the first paper to address active inference in everyday organizational practice, including industrial engineering and quality management so the paper is setting up to be just like one more plank towards applying active inference, bridging some of the practices that are already in use in the fields that we're going to be exploring, like the quality management and industrial engineering, and"
"Unknown","00;05;36;29","00;05;55;23","then sort of the adjacent possible for what kinds of systems could exist in those domains. So sometimes we have a more mathematical paper or more philosophical paper. This one's going to use a lot more of the jargon. And like Dean said, the priors of engineering. So that's why it's kind of cool to hear about it."
"Unknown","00;05;58;08","00;06;21;18","Daniel, can I add something to that? Yep. Yeah. I just think it's interesting that I think we, we, to use a bridging metaphor is seems just to be a really easy thing to do. And then I think, well, what the paper in terms of the aims and the claims does is tries to point out where that that connection might exist."
"Unknown","00;06;22;02","00;07;08;23","And we can always argue whether or not it exists in all situations at all times. But I do think that there are some times, again, when we can hold a static connection between an idea at one scale and an idea at another scale. And so not not all scales allow for that or have those affordances, but sometimes they do so I mean, that part of it, maybe what we need to do is separate the times when the metaphor works and when it doesn't the grid being utilitarian implies some sort of utility metric having a preference for reward or for preferred states implies those being defined maybe."
"Unknown","00;07;08;23","00;07;38;22","And also I think this will come up in this paper because it's all about which are the useful metrics to check up on useful policies to pursue. OK, so does anyone want to read abstract one I read it. Yep. Active inference is a physics of light process theory of perception in action and learning that applicable to natural and artificial agents in the paper active inference theories related to different types of practice in social organization."
"Unknown","00;07;38;23","00;08;09;22","Here, the term social organization is used to clarify that this paper does not encompass organization in biological systems, but rather the paper addresses active in, for instance, social organization that utilizes industrial engineering, quality management and artificial intelligence alongside human intelligence. Social organization referred to in this paper can be in private companies, public institutions, other for profit or not for profit organizations in any combination of them."
"Unknown","00;08;10;10","00;08;48;07","The relevance of active inference theory is explained in term variation, free energy prediction errors, chatter models and markup lengths are pretty interesting. I think usually when we talk about these multi scale perspectives on institutions, city societies, it's always like the entire edifice, all of the niche and everything that's moving in. It is part of this one biological organism and or at least biological co regulating system and here it's very explicit that it's trimming the biological component from the engineered component."
"Unknown","00;08;48;07","00;09;16;13","It's kind of like the car and then the passenger. So then instead of just saying, well, the car and the passenger is a part of the same extended cognitive niche because that's one way to look at that situation. Like it's an extended affordance that the driver has. Another way to think of it is by making a very clean partitioning, recognizing that there's still this emerging function that cars don't drive themselves, but you can still pass out the individual who's using the car from the design process of making the car."
"Unknown","00;09;17;24","00;10;00;00","And the 11 thing is add to that if you haven't read, see, and I'll always kill our last name, Lucy Sigmund, as to you see, I mean, she's got a book out many years ago that I think is got an incredible shelf life. It's called Here. It's Reconfiguring the human machine interface. And if you haven't read it, it's a fantastic book in terms of looking at how her case study is, how people walk up to a photocopy machine for the first time and where the engineers are trying to make it intuitive and how the human interface with that isn't always necessarily something that you can engineer for so something to consider."
"Unknown","00;10;00;00","00;10;38;07","If you're looking at this this idea, if I could just give another thought, I think that the uncoupling of social organization from biological organization is kind of a really unique and fresh perspective compared to some of the other papers that we've looked at. I mean, especially considering that like, I mean, it is a biological organization because it's happening in biological creatures, but it's it's an interesting partition that the author creates to make it known that it's not talking about hierarchical organization in structures of societies."
"Unknown","00;10;38;27","00;11;05;01","Yeah. So we don't need to worry about what's inside of the tissues and go into the biological organization. OK, or in the second abstract to then anyone can give a thought. Active inference theory is most relevant to the social organization of work that is highly repetitive. By contrast, there are more challenges involved in applying active inference theory for social organization of less repetitive endeavors such as one of a kind projects."
"Unknown","00;11;05;22","00;11;31;23","These challenges need to be addressed in order for active inference to provide a unifying framework for different types of social organization employing human and artificial intelligence so I have a thought on that might be somewhat controversial, but, you know, so I think that the highly repetitive so I mean, I think about active inference in terms of exploration and exploitation."
"Unknown","00;11;32;04","00;11;58;03","And I think like it really depends on on where your generative model rests right? So like is the generative model like the model of the organization or is it the model of the individual? Because I think that doing a highly repetitive project that reminds me of exploitation, where like a one off project can be like exploration like so so you can still like update your model depending on, on exploring some new avenue by this little side project."
"Unknown","00;11;58;03","00;12;08;19","But like you come back to updating your model, the model of your business yourself, the way that you work your organization with knowledge about how to do processes in a one off kind of process."
"Unknown","00;12;11;09","00;12;48;28","I agree, especially because we talk about it a lot in the context of generating strategic novelties perhaps, and those are seemingly less repetitive. But I think there's going to be some further clarification on that. And also this points to this yeah. Exciting areas like one shot learning or like true structural novelty and active inference models. That's something that we've talked about in other areas like how do you know when to be tweaking the knobs of the parameters as you currently have them set up versus expand a hidden state into two types of hidden state or something like that?"
"Unknown","00;12;49;13","00;13;22;24","Again, thinking about what the system is realistically or from this instrumentalist way, OK, the roadmap is written out here and it's a we're going to go through it in rough order. It introduces in each of these sections one of the kind of key ideas or principles, the variational free energy prediction errors, generative models, markup, blankets and survival. And then in Section seven, active inference is proposed as a unifying framework."
"Unknown","00;13;23;07","00;13;54;08","So this is kind of one of those classic paper layouts with some disciplinary sections, one through N disciplinary sections. And then the next section is active inference as a unifying framework. And then the next section is like challenges or current research directions, and then a concluding section maybe with a more call to action or a more philosophical lift off there are a bunch of keywords and I think we're going to get to all of them."
"Unknown","00;13;55;16","00;14;31;05","So two columns of keywords shrink the video. Yeah, two columns secured. OK, so first active inference, it's in the title of the paper and here's how it's written in the paper. Who wants to read the large text here? I got active inference in the physics of life process theory of Perception, Action and Learning. Accident finance generates predictions. Active inference predictions are based on knowledge learned from past situations and perceptions of presence situations."
"Unknown","00;14;31;16","00;14;58;01","Active inference minimizes errors between actions that are planned through the inference of predictions and what happens when the planned actions are taken. So this is the first lines of the paper, right in the introduction. That's how it begins with no active inference is the first words so that's sort of the opening shot, and it's just a cool framing to bring it out as a physics of life process theory."
"Unknown","00;14;59;03","00;15;40;17","Yet this isn't about biological organization, so it's almost like recognizing the origins and some of the motivations for the kind of modeling that active inference provides, yet making another later decision to partition the system of interest a certain way. So cool framing and then the next line so kind of shrinking that definition of active inference this is because prediction errors cause unwanted surprise surprises, which individually or cumulatively can threaten survival by going beyond a limited number of states in which survival is possible."
"Unknown","00;15;40;28","00;16;27;18","By contrast, minimizing prediction errors facilitates survival through least action so this is also linking up several of those key terms that are going to be section headers later. But it's just this idea that predictions about the external world, especially if they incorporate preferences that are optimistic, help reduce the complexity of deciding which actions to take. And then the way that that gets operationalized is with the process theory of prediction error minimization, which is a real time estimate of how good the generative model is performing and then just add anything or say more here."
"Unknown","00;16;27;18","00;17;01;15","But it just an interesting topic, how it's described as the principle of survival through least action. So what is this principle of least action and how do we reconcile active biology recall agents as being in one way participating under this survival to release action, even if it's just a misnomer? What does that really mean? And then how does survival through list action, contrast or overlap with more familiar phrasing?"
"Unknown","00;17;01;15","00;17;41;14","Probably survival of the fittest like is the survival of the fittest, the survival of the least active? Or how should we read this relationship between maybe Darwinian conceptions of fitness and which individuals survive versus this physics based framing of survival through least action under the principles of lease action stationary for something? Daniel. Yeah, yeah. So I think it's interesting that you depending on how you define each of these terms, that you can you can sort of transfer or oscillate across frame."
"Unknown","00;17;41;25","00;18;14;14","But a frame is which to me is identifying a focal point, maybe a margin or a limit in what a fit is, what goes in the other like glove and hand or hand in glove. And I think sometimes we talk about a niche, but that's, that's different than a what the frame of the niche is. So the fact that we're, we're sort of thinking back and forth between the two, I just wonder whether or not we're looking at the same thing or if we realize we're looking at two things at once."
"Unknown","00;18;17;14","00;18;53;06","That's continuing on with the introduction. It's written active inference is a corollary of the free energy principle FIP which formalizes cognition of the auto poetic organization of living systems within ATP. Active systems must occupy a limited repertoire of states. This requires minimizing the long term average of surprise associated with sensory exchanges with the world minimizing surprise enables them to resist a natural tendency toward to disorder."
"Unknown","00;18;54;09","00;19;14;11","So this just kind of relates to some questions like how do framings for this sort of active, intelligent behavior, what other framings exist, and how do we think about broad concepts like reward preference and curiosity and surprise in active inference?"
"Unknown","00;19;16;24","00;19;42;07","And then the last paragraph then any thoughts are not surprise, rests on predictions about sensations, which depend on an internal generative model of the world. In particular, although surprise cannot be measured directly, a free energy bound on surprise can be suggesting that agents minimize free energy by changing their predictions about what sensory inputs will come from actions or by changing the predicted sensory inputs through changing action."
"Unknown","00;19;47;16","00;20;15;28","This just reminds me of the kind of fundamental hearing in active inference where the ways that you can go down that free energy gradient are either by updating parameters of your internal model learning developments or by updating action states which is through action, because you can't control external states directly and you can't control the incoming sensory data directly, then all you can do is control those two states that are under your control."
"Unknown","00;20;15;28","00;20;37;24","The internal states, the action states all right. Another term was the Markov blanket. So anyone want to just like give what's what's the Markov one to one or what's what's the way in which Markov Blanket's came into play in this paper or in another context?"
"Unknown","00;20;42;15","00;21;29;12","So Markov blankets are essentially the the boundary or how how a system creates a boundary and how you can define essentially like a non equilibrium steady state system with a marked like it. I thought it was an interesting play in this paper and I think maybe we'll unpack it here later on in the in the intro video we just in number 26 talked a bunch about bar called blankets so suffice to say that there's still open exactly which cases which sense of the Markov blanket is meant on this continuum from analytical and mathematical with Markov OG Blanket the Bayesian statistical generalization by Perl and others."
"Unknown","00;21;29;27","00;21;55;26","And then this partitioning into incoming sensory and outgoing active states of the blanket by first in and others and then how that exactly relates to all these other topics that we're discussing OK, I'll play the video. 46 seconds blue. What was exciting to you about this? So this is the video from the Tesla AI Day that just happened last week."
"Unknown","00;21;55;26","00;22;26;15","And this is it's a humanoid robot that Tesla is going to attempt to design. And so I just put this definition of artificial intelligence from like Google and it said the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision making and translation between languages. And so spoiler alert, this is actually not not a robot."
"Unknown","00;22;26;15","00;22;44;04","This is actually like a person. But but he made it look like a robot that was getting up. And then like bam, I'm going to dance. But I think like that kind of movement and perception about about space, that kind of spatial awareness is something that's still very much a challenge for AI. So so that's why I threw this video in there."
"Unknown","00;22;46;22","00;23;13;04","It will be interesting to see how they do processing and what kinds of algorithms and hardware and software end up being used for real time robotics systems. Any comments on artificial intelligence or anything in physics? Again, I don't spend a whole lot of time on this because to me, artificial intelligence is always a it's always a post hoc domain."
"Unknown","00;23;13;12","00;23;46;20","Even this example, can we create a copy of this? So I mean, it's already been done by something and now we're trying to re-engineered or re develop it as opposed to what active inference is, which is the inclusion of ad hoc. The what if so? I mean, if they can get artificial intelligence to a place that it's it's including what if in that in the truest sense of all possibilities then I'd probably be quite excited or scared."
"Unknown","00;23;46;28","00;24;21;23","I'm not sure which nice. So some other keywords were social and organization. And one of the goal statements of the paper was this paper is intended to contribute to bridging the gap between theoretical papers in active inference theory which have been reported to be too opaque to be understood widely and potential application opportunities in the multi intelligence social organization, that being social organization that employs human intelligence and different types of artificial intelligence."
"Unknown","00;24;22;07","00;24;46;21","So and whoever put this image, what did it mean or represent in the context of the paper so I just looked so I didn't I don't know that it's necessarily really in the context of the paper, but I started to look into like how are societies organized right? And so this is like I just was doing some Googling and I thought that this was an interesting paper and the title and the author there in the small print if you're able to read them."
"Unknown","00;24;46;21","00;25;34;03","But this is like a state organization. Right? And and it describes the fascist media model model as focusing on community and culture and it describes the communist media model as focusing on state bureaucracy and the liberal media model as focusing on market exchange which I just I just thought was interesting and just kind of an interesting way to to, I don't know, reflect on societal organization and what what is the central theme there and it's kind of in line with that positioning of the kind of the car from the user, because not included here are like the human users this is kind of everything but the eyes on the TV."
"Unknown","00;25;34;13","00;26;05;09","This is just partitioning the structure of the organization as an engineered object. So that's cool. Similarity to that. Yeah, we just had a guest stream and Pranav and, and Rafael even they were debating can we, can we say that something that's an emergent property and an individual, which is then something that we can test as an emergent property within a dyad can also become an emergent property within these high variability states."
"Unknown","00;26;05;15","00;26;32;07","And even they couldn't agree that there's there's some sort of a parallel. I think we know that on these high variability things like a social organization afterwards again, we can you can take an account of what it became, but we it's really hard to know where it's going, even if you break it down into the communist or a fascist direction."
"Unknown","00;26;32;07","00;27;04;10","It's telling us, like you say, what what direction the higher down the highway the car is going. But that but beyond that, it's still a lot of questions. Yeah, so I guess that's where industrial engineering comes into play for that. Designing for that car on the highway. Industrial engineering involves applying methods such as task analysis and job design in order to predict results, evaluate results and improve results from processes during their development."
"Unknown","00;27;05;00","00;27;35;00","The application of industrial engineering has been progressing around the world since the 1900s. So so it wasn't an area I was too familiar with I saw a lot a lot of mention of the 99 out of 100 and the three standard deviations and then halt the process. So that kind of just was an interesting thing to hear about any thoughts or we can continue on as I guess a related field of industrial engineering is quality management."
"Unknown","00;27;35;25","00;28;03;07","And so this is a type of system that involves I guess hardware and software and behavioral protocols. Quality management systems comes involve documenting processes which have been developed through industrial engineering as process specifications, work procedures, et cetera, monitoring processes for conformance to specifications, et cetera. And using observations of non conformance is to inform the further development of processes."
"Unknown","00;28;03;23","00;28;36;29","Both industrial engineering and Kumasi are focused on the continuous improvement of processes. The application of industrial engineering has been progressing around the world since the 1900s in quality management since the 1950s Any thoughts on that just having been a business owner it's you know it's a process it definitely makes me think about precision of measurement changing and then what can be measured and what can't be measured gets entrapped."
"Unknown","00;28;36;29","00;29;08;23","Then what can be regulated becomes gamed and all these sort of complex ways that assessments of performance fits one into local versus global optimum you can also see how instructional ism got systematized. Yep. If there's a way to do it and this is the way that's approved even if the later becomes like a, you know, an improvement in the protocol or some sort of change in the context, maybe it can't be utilized because it's not part of the approved version."
"Unknown","00;29;09;15","00;29;51;02","And so, you know, there's no simple answer there because you can't just say, well, OK, accept all changes. And then if you just say, OK, we'll have a small bar for making edits, it's like there's no perfect trade off point with the false positives and the false negatives, especially for situations that truly are ambiguous, which is why we fall back to these approaches that put us at the kind of functional inflection point of the pragmatic and epistemic outcomes, which is like active inference, rather than just pursuing reward over short term or over some other time for but common to all these different frameworks for control theory is basically statistical process control."
"Unknown","00;29;51;24","00;30;20;13","So maybe whoever made this slide was it? Yep, blue, go for it. So statistical process control is a collection of tools and techniques used to measure and analyze process data in order to characterize the behavior of our processes and achieve process control. And so in the paper, I don't know how much will we'll get into it here, but the paper really describes statistical process control and gives a figure similar to this."
"Unknown","00;30;20;13","00;30;46;11","So you have normal process variation which they described as Six Sigma deviation from whatever is optimal. So there's the optimal, which is like the Green Line and then three segments to the up and three segments to the down to like an over or under estimate or of your target. And then any time that you have a process that deviates from the Six Sigma range, you have this special cause variation."
"Unknown","00;30;46;11","00;31;12;04","And so like in the, the business schema that I'm familiar with at least, which is minimal, but some, you know, you have you do this root cause analysis, like why is there this special cause variation? Like what is what happened in that in that one circumstance? We have to go and analyze that instance to find out why it was outside of the Six Sigma deviation, because it's just like that's an unacceptable data point."
"Unknown","00;31;12;15","00;31;15;29","At that point. Nice, good explanation."
"Unknown","00;31;20;15","00;31;22;01","How about thermodynamic entropy?"
"Unknown","00;31;24;05","00;31;59;00","Also, this was to me, but it's a quantity representing the unavailability of a system's thermal energy for conversion into mechanical work, often interpreted as the degree of disorder or randomness in the system. And so, you know, there's the law of thermodynamics that says that entropy in the universe is always increasing. So are becoming going from more ordered to less ordered or from highly ordered to more disordered, which this kind of shows in this example things spreading apart."
"Unknown","00;31;59;00","00;32;23;26","And like it's like you would if you left town for two years and you came back and found that your house was a mess, that wouldn't really be surprising even if you left it clean, even if, you know, I mean, things deteriorate and fall apart and dust goes in and whatever rodents creep around and stuff like that. And it's that apparent and empirical local organization of matter like into bones and flesh and life and whatnot."
"Unknown","00;32;24;14","00;32;59;14","And also the always and only occurrence of that kind of local organization of energy with cybernetic or anticipatory behavior. That's what motivates a kind of framework that is going to, on one hand, work for particles but also work for active particles. And all of the continuum between. So that's why there's all these different cognitive structures as well as physical structures that are being linked together through basically physics and by hooking to free energy principle and variational methods and all these other areas of math of physics."
"Unknown","00;32;59;21","00;33;31;16","Then it puts active inference just like one step closer towards embodiment on some of those different pathways OK, information theoretic entropy. So this is the, the Shannon Entropy that's referred to because it was, I think first described by Claude Shannon. But I always put Maxwell's daemon here when I'm thinking about relating thermodynamic energy and informational entropy. And this was it."
"Unknown","00;33;31;16","00;33;59;09","Alex Cooper wrote a paper that really we did in one of the live streams that really kind of outlined how these are connected with the Helmholtz distribution. And so if you really want to dig deeper into these relationships, that's a good way to do it. But I always think about, you know, so Maxwell Siemens is the idea that you know, if you have molecules like shown on the left here in this box and you have two sides of the box and there's a partition in the center and like, you know, they're cold and hot molecules."
"Unknown","00;34;00;02","00;34;30;18","So if you knew which molecule was hot and which molecule was cold, so the daemon is sitting there, who can see is the molecule hot or cold? And only lets the hot ones go through to the right and only lets the cold ones go through to the left. And every time he opens the partition effectively that is, is work and so just kind of conceptually that like shows that the relationship between information and work, the more information you have the less work you have to do maybe."
"Unknown","00;34;30;28","00;34;52;04","So that's kind of the relationship that I think about in my mind. And then there's a form of this definition of action and entropy down below, but it's usually given in an informational context as a measure of surprise, as we've talked about on the livestream many times. And they really information as negative entropy. So it's the reverse surprise."
"Unknown","00;34;52;04","00;35;20;25","It's the reverse of of surprise or information is the reverse of surprise oh, thanks for the explanation, Dean. Any thoughts on that? Yeah. One of the things I, I mean, I love this next blue. Thank you for that. Explanation. It's really, it's really good. So one of the people I'm reading right now is a guy by the name of Dan Siegel and his book about the mind and what he talks about is when people are a dis ease."
"Unknown","00;35;21;00","00;35;51;27","So not an easy state, but when they're when they're struggling with something, he talks about the fact that there's one of two ends of the continuum, be it blue and red. In this example, one at one end is chaos and the other is rigidity. And so from an information theoretic entropy state, are we stuck? Are we bored, are we feeling trapped or are we being overwhelmed or underwhelm meaning we're where we're not in that in between state."
"Unknown","00;35;51;27","00;36;21;19","And so I think that I think there's a lot and there's a lot that can be done if we get a basic understanding and understanding of Maxwell's Daemon without sort of getting scared off by well, it's almost like, yeah, what would these particles and their temperature represent if they were, I don't know, ideas or something more related to inference rather than just particles, because we're always looking at the intersection between the physical systems and the informational systems."
"Unknown","00;36;23;15","00;37;04;16","All right. Variational free energy. So this keyword was defined in the paper as the difference between predicted sensory inputs and actual sensory inputs when monitoring processes the increases as the difference increases between what is predicted to happen if actions are taken and what does not happen, what does happen when those actions are taken. The more prediction errors there are, the more thermodynamic energy will be consumed amidst the thermodynamic entropy of remedial actions, corrective actions, restorative actions and firefighting this will leave less thermodynamic energy available for doing productive work comprising productive actions."
"Unknown","00;37;05;02","00;37;35;07","Thus, if the variation of free energy is high then thermodynamic entropy, e.g. energy not available for doing productive work will be high and the thermodynamic free energy is high. Energy available for doing productive work will be low. Hence, variation of free energy can have an inverse relationship to thermodynamic free energy. This is because the bigger a prediction error which can be considered in terms of bigger V, the smaller can be the thermodynamic free energy available to do productive work."
"Unknown","00;37;36;10","00;38;02;22","So this is a pretty interesting passage. David, if you have a thought on it, it's exploring this thermal thermo info nexus in a little bit of a different way. And on one hand, it's kind of confusing that the variation of free energy is going to be the opposite of the thermodynamic free energy, but it's almost like what is happening here."
"Unknown","00;38;02;27","00;38;26;13","And it just to see that they have a negative relationship, it's like if the engine were perfectly anticipatory and super efficient it would be carrying out a ton of work. If it's moving in a super spurious heat producing way, then the product, a lot of variation, free energy, a lot of surprising observations relative to functional operation of the motor."
"Unknown","00;38;26;23","00;38;54;22","Then your capacity to perform work to capture those very noisy vibrations is low and so a lot of the underlying potential becomes dissipated rather than used to perform kind of useful inference, useful action so not sure if that's a correct mapping, but I think it'll be cool to talk to the author because this is a very fascinating idea about how different formulations of free energy actually relate to modeling processes."
"Unknown","00;38;54;22","00;39;19;03","Yabulu. So it's like I really thought this is kind of what made me think of Maxwell's Daemon, right? So it was interesting because, you know, the variation of free energy, when we talk about minimizing free energy, we always think about as minimizing surprise so if we if we minimize surprise, then then we don't have to do all this thermodynamic energy like the firefighting that they talked about."
"Unknown","00;39;19;03","00;39;34;05","And I think that the paper, when we get into the five whys and that figure and people elaborate a little bit more on that. But the it's just interesting because we don't have to output as much work. And that's kind of what made me think about about Maxwell's daemon. And it's kind of why I snuck that in there."
"Unknown","00;39;34;27","00;40;00;25","But yeah, you're right. I don't know, like, you know, I think that the relationship between info dynamics and thermodynamics is still very much being defined. There's a lot of very recent research that's looking closely at how those two relate to one another. Nice. Yeah. I just I immediately said to myself, I really want my autonomic nervous system to work."
"Unknown","00;40;00;25","00;40;26;08","And I don't want to have to think about it, cause a lot of the mechanical things are dependent on that. So I'm not I'm not sort of pulling part what the claim is here, but I think if you read that, you're kind of saying, OK, a lot of the surprise you're not even aware of because you're on and on and omics a nervous system is functioning correctly."
"Unknown","00;40;28;21","00;41;02;28","Great point there. It's almost like a surprise. Variational surprise does not equate to attention or even especially the conscious awareness of attention in a human psychological situation. So it's totally possible that like the difference in pressure sensing, depending on your body's posture that's completely normalized out, that's recalibrated from the expectation of body position without coming to our attention, unless we bring it to our attention."
"Unknown","00;41;03;08","00;41;27;27","So that and many other similar examples. So something I love how you're like not able to to stay outside of the biological partition. Right. Well, I, I just, I'm not again, I'm not I want to be able to create with this stuff. I mentioned that. And so to me, to willfully ignore that is hard for me to do."
"Unknown","00;41;27;27","00;41;49;07","I'm not saying it's not possible. I'm not saying that it's the right thing to do here. I'm just struggling to let go of it. I want to let go of it, and I'm having a hard time with it. Well, I think for all of us, you know, the urge to apply to every system is very strong right here's table one."
"Unknown","00;41;49;14","00;42;19;05","So here's the mapping of a bunch of different sets of terms from active inference constructs. And then thinking about how they're applied in industrial engineering and quality management practice. So variation of free energy, which we just were talking about, is the difference between the predicted sensory inputs and actual sensory inputs. The variation of free energy, upper bound, as well as its lower bound is basically the range in which that system is working well."
"Unknown","00;42;19;05","00;42;48;19","It's like the loaves of bread are within the calibration range and we can just keep on pumping them out. Precision weighting has to do with which aspects of the process are monitored, with which level of precision, for example, which with of a part has to be machined in fractions of a millimeter versus other tolerances. And then the expected free energy is the expected energy between the preferred sensory inputs from process operation and the actual sensory inputs."
"Unknown","00;42;49;28","00;43;17;16","So the variation of free energy is the difference between the prediction and the actual. Do you have some generative model of your data center? And then you have the generative model of the temperature through time and the comparison with the actual. But here it's about the preferred versus the actual. So that's like we we recognize that it is warmer than we would like it to be, which is why we're conditioning our policy in the long range towards getting back to that zone."
"Unknown","00;43;17;28","00;43;27;07","But for now, we need to also have an accurate sensor measurement. So that's also a nice juxtaposition. That's not always finessed in other papers."
"Unknown","00;43;29;26","00;44;04;26","Then in all these keywords, the first set were about free energy and precision and how these terms are calculated relative to one another. The second set of terms in table one is some of the key terms of Bayesian statistics. So just to read only the constructs and these are also really helpful because we're as a lab thinking about what are the core terms of active inference, what are the definitions that are general enough to be really educational, but also not to limiting or prioritize one sense over another, for example."
"Unknown","00;44;05;08","00;44;35;13","So the Bayesian terms that would be found in any other course or textbook on Bayesian statistics, prior expected posterior, actual posterior preferred posterior and prediction error. So that kind of puts the predictive processing as a under the umbrella of Bayesian statistics. OK, the next set of terms in the table was related to this dichotomy of two different types of inference."
"Unknown","00;44;36;00","00;45;03;00","So epistemic inference was defined as updating the definitions of process during process improvement based upon analysis of non conformance reports, whereas instrumental inference is updating which actions will be included in the process during process improvement. So this is sort of like epistemic knowledge based. This is about updating the knowledge based upon especially the times where things don't go right."
"Unknown","00;45;03;21","00;45;41;15","And then this is like policy inference action planning as inference because it's like instrumentally it's actually like about what the instrument is going to do. So and then the last, OK, any thoughts on these terms OK then the next set of terms in table one was Markov Blanket, internal state and external state so definitely check out number 14, number 26, a few of the other live streams to learn more about the markup blanket it and this is the figure from de Costa at all 2021."
"Unknown","00;45;42;09","00;46;10;02","The blanket is here is the boundary state between the internal state of the social organization so those are the ones and the and the external state of the environment. When operating processes are defined in the quality management system then what are those internal states. Those are the social or organizational processes developed during industrial engineering for minimum risk in the process environments and then the external state is the environment."
"Unknown","00;46;10;22","00;46;41;03","So that's kind of mapping the mark of like it kind of the car, the interfaces and outside the car or maybe that's not the perfect mapping, but I think that's kind of what is being suggested. And then the last few terms of table one are four of just the general constructs, general principles that are also section headers and important topics, risk, ambiguity, principle of least action and principle of survival yeah."
"Unknown","00;46;41;03","00;47;04;01","So I think all of this ties in to a way of looking at the world through through rows and columns, which is fine. I mean it's a good a good place to try to look at things and analyze them. But not everybody, not everybody creates off of that because not everybody is necessarily looking for a precision forward view."
"Unknown","00;47;04;10","00;47;46;15","Sometimes you're, you're experimenting and you're making all kinds of mistakes and learning from that as well. So again, you just want to just want to see this for what it is. It's nothing wrong with it, but it's not it's not the only way that's blue anything OK, so then there's the figures and these will recall some of the key terms we talked about earlier the Texas, as shown in FIG. one SPC charts, these statistical process control charts have upper and lower control limits."
"Unknown","00;47;47;08","00;48;15;18","And processes need to remain within these limits. Processes that go outside the limits do not meet specifications that defined intended states. So left side good top of the Drake mean right side bad bottom of the Drake mean not working OK figure two is this five wise so it's written out here more textually if you want to pause it and look at it and here it's more graphical."
"Unknown","00;48;15;25","00;48;59;02","So if you want to give a thought on the five whys or OK, well the scenario that's laid out is kind of working backwards from why there was a not reliable organization and the five whys, it's actually not related to Aristotle's four wise, but that would have been a nice opportunity maybe there's a four by five matrix, but these five whys are referring to needing to go back kind of five layers or like five derivatives up the chain asking what led to a high reliability organization being unreliable."
"Unknown","00;48;59;27","00;49;28;29","So the general case of this sort of cascading failure in terms of variation or free energy. So the general phrasing is that there's high uncertainty high entropy in work instructions. So the IKEA instructions are not accessible enough to many people or the radio is really blurry, so people can't hear what letters are being said. And then that makes the variation of free energy high because of prediction errors."
"Unknown","00;49;29;19","00;49;51;09","Which then leads to unproductive actions. So then you're you're scanning on the radio because you can't quite log on and then that's consuming energy and then that ends up reducing your battery so that you can't do what you actually need to do. And then the case in the truck driver incident is that the truck drivers getting ambiguous logistical data."
"Unknown","00;49;51;09","00;50;24;14","So this itself is a policy communication from like, you know, some cloud mapping service or the company that's contracting, the trucker and then this leads to the driver having increased spatial uncertainty, getting lost, which leads them to drive around Unproductively so they don't have enough fuel to efficiently complete the deliveries that are imported. And so here's the graphical layout of the five whys showing without example, how on the bottom is the truck drivers getting the bad info?"
"Unknown","00;50;25;04","00;50;57;13","And then that surfaces after sort of several repercussions in terms of the the structure of multi-level decision making and act of inference, how we can use this framework, which maybe is used in industry and mapped onto the states of decision making from active inference perspective. But notice that there's no reward here. It's not well, drivers minimize their reward about this or, you know, risk on this or maximize their reward on this."
"Unknown","00;50;57;24","00;51;09;20","So it just shows how this sort of framework has a different framing than people might expect. If the only machine learning model they were aware of was machine learning and specifically reward reinforcement learning."
"Unknown","00;51;11;21","00;51;37;24","Yeah, yeah. And it isn't just industrial. You can, you can be like me and jump in the car with two of my friends who are both emergency doctors and you're heading off to the ski hill. And at some point the conversation comes around to there are no accidents in the world. And of course, being emergency doctors, they see the the outcomes of of events happening to people."
"Unknown","00;51;37;24","00;52;07;10","And so their perspective is there's always a way of being able to go back and see all the parts of the decision branch and how it arrived in front of them and then having to sort of put the pieces back together again. But again, I don't I don't know that necessarily that that means that randomness doesn't come into play and that there isn't a certain part of this where the variation simply can't be calculated in."
"Unknown","00;52;07;10","00;52;28;29","But I say go skiing with them. I don't know. It just it's just like them are different. So anyway, yeah, it just reminds me of like when I dropped a hard drive and then I thought, well, I guess this is the one and a hundred hard drives that fails every year. Yes, but it was also the one time that I dropped it."
"Unknown","00;52;29;11","00;52;54;01","So there's always this sort of like n equals one way to uncouple cause and effect or potentially actionable consequence to the not reliability of your organization. But then also there's this designing for the statistics when they decide to make a recall or not based upon, you know, the relative amount of failure versus the relative amount of, you know, legal changes needed something like that."
"Unknown","00;52;54;15","00;53;42;18","So that's where you talked earlier about including co occurrence instead of just only getting time or to the sequential aspect of this yet. So figure three frames the quality management system for comes the quality manual as a generative model comprising beliefs about processes so it's interesting because it could be seen as just a cookbook recipe book, instruction book, but it's being at least deployed in a generative capacity and instead of just like saying, you know, with the extra 5 minutes and then until they're frothy or, you know, until they're this make peeks, it's like we expect it to make peace with it until your expectation is achieved, it's a different way to get to that same"
"Unknown","00;53;42;18","00;54;10;05","outcome. Now, which one's going to be more resilient? If it says 5 minutes and there's no peaks, then what do you do? Do you add something? Do you keep on going? Whereas if you have a precision seeking process, maybe you can be resilient to it. If it only takes 2 minutes and you don't overdo it. And the example of something being correct, like 99 out of 100 times is just used I think just repeatedly in the paper, just it could be calibrated differently and I'm sure it's situational."
"Unknown","00;54;10;11","00;54;41;21","It just sort of like shorthand. 99 out of a hundred, but yet it is defining these times in terms of the actual act of states. So what should be done, you know, prepare 50 microliters of fluid into the little tube and then you monitor something about the process. And then that leads to this feedback cycle between the, the quality management review and then that being in kind of co-evolution with the industrial engineering itself."
"Unknown","00;54;42;14","00;55;11;28","And then that leads to the update of the process in the quality manual in step four. So that then there's kind of like, oh, OK, if it's too low after your first paper, then do a little bit more pipetting and then they keep on protecting that 99% functional outcome at each of those nodes that are bifurcating out. OK, and that's not going to read this whole thing."
"Unknown","00;55;12;07","00;55;40;13","But the top part talks about this design for assembly and one of the principles is to make parts either symmetrical or clearly asymmetrical. So nothing in the uncanny valley this is done so that it is immediately and unequivocally apparent how a part is to be put into sub assembly and this is the famous IKEA catalog esthetic and how that made furniture building like fun and accessible for some people, I guess."
"Unknown","00;55;41;07","00;56;02;24","And then in this second quote, it is kind of thinking about that IKEA paradigm. Although furniture companies may not be considering their industrial engineering in terms of minimizing variation of free energy, it is apparent that its aim is to minimize errors between what it intends to people to see when looking at its furniture kits and what people do see when looking at its furniture kits."
"Unknown","00;56;03;13","00;56;25;02","So it's sort of like it's the goal should be to make it look like it looks on the scale room floor or like it looks like in your imagination after you see the advertising. And then if you can see those flat pieces of wood and you can see that instruction booklet and you can see the policy, then you're going to be not surprised."
"Unknown","00;56;25;05","00;56;46;12","You're going to be satisfied because your preference was to have like the couch there. So just kind of a cool example that highlights how our preferences aren't just over temperature we often talk about those kinds of examples, but we can also have preferences for having affordances or niche modifications. If we can have a preference to have a handle on something."
"Unknown","00;56;46;28","00;57;10;16","And then that kind of relates us to this like behavioral economics, underactive inference, like what makes somebody expect there to be a new couch in their living room? And then what makes them drive out, pick it up on the weekend and everything? And then it's this kind of idea that the supply chain is this extended uncertainty reducer, and it's like bringing stuff to you."
"Unknown","00;57;11;01","00;57;36;17","And then there's this notion in this computational industrial case, and in the at home case, where the assembly information that's provided is a policy decision from the people who are making the product. And then that really relates to work like participation in making that product. If it's all pretty compiles, then there's no affordance for participation versus having like a culture of people working through it for many different ways."
"Unknown","00;57;36;28","00;58;01;17","So and then this was just the funny example of the interface, which although there may be little risk in furniture assembly, this can be followed by much ambiguity in furniture installation. So in other words, it's not just about what's on this brochure because predetermining all the possible production errors in fixing the assembled furniture to walls in millions of different buildings around the world is very challenging."
"Unknown","00;58;02;19","00;58;22;13","And so there's this difference between the assembly information, like how do you just assemble the system of interest, which is just the internal and blanket states of the new shelf? What's the difference between that information? How to build the bookshelf and then the operations like, Oh, well, you didn't tell me that I couldn't kick it from the side."
"Unknown","00;58;22;21","00;58;55;17","So you just told me how to build it. You didn't say that I couldn't use it this way. And then so how do you design for internal coherence versus designing for interoperable military with sort of unknown unknowns and all these different types of entities that the systems are going to interact with on the blanket, on the interface? So it's not just the IKEA booklet, but thought that was kind of an interesting notion that even just building it wasn't really the end of the story because then people take their perfectly build bookshelf and then it's like stapled to the wall the wrong way, like ruins."
"Unknown","00;58;55;17","00;59;24;05","Both So. Dean Yeah. And and then and I don't know if you can do this, but then how do you account for this? How do you account for somebody who took a piece of all of would any random piece of all wood and turned it into something like this? Right. So it's not there's no, there's no Billy, there's no way of deconstructing this you just have to pick up you have to pick up something that is a mark off blanket."
"Unknown","00;59;24;05","00;59;57;11","It's, it's, it's pretty hard. And then you have to be able to pull out what you think is in that. And how do you how do you engineer that? Well, it's a completely different process. So I think, I think, I think if people are capable of doing both now and I just I'd love to talk to the author about how how you how you do this kind of work when there is certain results that are are available and are the active inference model."
"Unknown","00;59;57;11","01;00;23;17","So it would be nice contrast tomorrow. Yeah. Yep. Nice. Good point. Like where's Artisanship and Craft and in this phrasing. So here's an example using that case of the like bookshelf or the cupboard being bolted to a wall. And this also gets at that partition between the part of the system that you can design and then the part of the system that is not being considered."
"Unknown","01;00;24;02","01;00;59;25","So here the internal states and this is kind of interesting, it'll be cool to see who is there alive to talk about the sort of embodiment aspect. The internal state is the person's embodied prior knowledge of fixing assembled cupboards to walls and depending on what they know about, you know, carpentry, if they're just totally watching the YouTube video and then let it rip versus if they're experienced, they're going to it with different materials, they're going to take actions and that's going to modify the niche, which is the external state, the room to which the covered will be fixed."
"Unknown","01;01;00;15","01;01;23;05","And that's going to be reflected in what the person perceives. And then it's just cool. Like here maybe there's multiple ways to interpret the center. It's like there's the wall blocking, like external blocking state. Then there's like the affordance block where the tools are inadequate. Like, you know, you need the, the hex wrench of say seven and you only have the size four."
"Unknown","01;01;23;05","01;01;44;06","So you just can't do it even if you know how to do it. And there's times where even if you have the right tool, it's like it's too rusty to do it. So there's like it's just a cool example and shows a little bit of that, that horseshoe theory again between philosophy and engineering where they're both radically focused on embodiment and pragmatics."
"Unknown","01;01;45;00","01;02;12;21","OK, then the next section after four is seven active inference as a unifying framework. And so basically they write an important application of active inference theory can be as a unifying framework for a social organization framework summarized in FIG. five, which we'll look at in a second, operated through quality management systems comes via interoperability protocols and upper level of multi-tier enterprise architecture."
"Unknown","01;02;13;05","01;02;41;10","So before we look at FIG. five, it's just like how does active inference serve as a unifying framework in some of these areas that we've been talking about for the last months? Like we heard people use this integrating word to talk about active in action in perception, engineering, biology, communication, cyber physical systems, remote teams, et cetera. So just it's being used a little bit in a different way here."
"Unknown","01;02;41;22","01;03;20;08","So let's see figure five and then you can give any thoughts on it here. Organizational active inference is again being mapped onto this sense. Internal action, external loop, this kind of circular loop. The internal states are the organizations belief, just like in figure four, it was the person's embodied beliefs. Here it's the organizations embodied beliefs embodied in the Q EMS, which is again being framed as beliefs over processes and states that results in human and artificial intelligence employed to fulfill specifications, procedures, et cetera."
"Unknown","01;03;20;21","01;03;54;22","So these can be actions that are taken by APIs or bots or by people this acts upon the external states, which lead to perceptions of sensory states, which could be the temperature in the room it could be the the age of the wine, it could be the number of sales on the course. So then they do industrial engineering on this loop as an organization in relationship to integrating perception and action through internal state updating pretty much just like we've been talking about for all these other active inference systems."
"Unknown","01;03;54;27","01;04;36;14","Any thoughts OK, table to rights? There are many. There could be many reasons why pragmatics subsumes semantics and leads to prediction errors. For example, inept priors and inept preferred posteriors can come from lock ins, past dependencies and success traps which place emphasis on past experiences, overdue information. Individuals may seek to survive by learning from filtered information that supports the preconception of groups which they believe can support their individual survival, rather than seek information that supports the efficient reduction of prediction errors in external states."
"Unknown","01;04;37;04","01;05;05;27","So it's almost like you can't prefer what you prefer so much, otherwise you're going to, I don't know, maybe follow that local band all the way to a local end instead of sometimes coming out of that local a local local tractor and a want to go for this blue? Yeah. Yeah. This seemed like just confirmation bias, right? You seek to survive by learning the information that supports the preconceptions of groups."
"Unknown","01;05;06;04","01;05;25;14","So that's like, you know, I believe this. Bye bye. Can, can my group believe this? Like, I don't know. That's that. Yeah, this is a cool table. It's like, OK, so in the perception phase of active inference, you can have a top down error based upon inept priors. So you can believe the wrong thing about what you should expect to see."
"Unknown","01;05;25;14","01;06;00;06","Or you can have the sensor be influenced interesting about e.g. emotion. But that's, I guess being framed as a bottom up way that perception can be modified. And then in the intermediary intermediate, it's bounded rationality. So not that's kind of like a compromise between what you think is possible and magical realism. Then the action phase also can be run aground by inept, focusing on basically poor outcomes."
"Unknown","01;06;00;06","01;06;21;10","Like if you're aiming for five degrees off of shooting a free throw then you're going to miss the free throws. And then that also your attention could be affected by poor signal to noise ratio. Like if you couldn't see where the hoop was and just interesting how like it's being really methodically broken down to sources of where the error can come from."
"Unknown","01;06;22;19","01;06;50;10","And then also in table three, there's a nice distinction and it relates to that notion that active inference would be potentially very effective for repetitive processes, but potentially not as effective for one of a kind processes. And so the repetitive processes are like mass production and then the one of a kind processes are like the project production. So right off the bat it's kind of like, well, how individual does a project need to be before?"
"Unknown","01;06;50;10","01;07;19;20","It's not best modeled by active inference. And then it just talks about how markup like it's generative models, prediction error and variation or free energy play out in both of these two areas. So that would definitely be something for people to like read through the table and then mention it and give a specific example or a question to the author because this is like super informative and a cool combinatorial way to look at how ideas are related."
"Unknown","01;07;19;26","01;07;52;00","So yeah, Dean and then Blue so when I'm looking at this and I don't know if this is helpful or if this just makes it even more turbid, but if, if one hand this is the ability to frame so we know what's in what we're looking at versus what we're not looking at. And if the other hand is we match essentially if you go back to table to in this table three in and configure the matching is what's super and what's subordinate, what's inside of what."
"Unknown","01;07;52;29","01;08;22;17","Those are the two hands that still doesn't tell us what is going on in between, which I think is the fit piece, which from a from a thinking standpoint is am I fitting now hand in glove meaning is is my is my glove size of size large or is it glove in hand? Does that just the glove I need serve the purpose because I'm skiing or because I'm I'm I'm forging or I'm or I'm water skiing."
"Unknown","01;08;23;04","01;08;51;17","Right. So between framing and and matching is this fit question there all three of them are different things to fit is in between these other two things. And even if we make a great table even if we make sure that we got the right headings and right definitions underneath, it still doesn't talk about is it glove in hand or hand in glove."
"Unknown","01;08;51;26","01;09;23;03","And I think for people who want to actually use active inference, they want to be able to not get stuck conflating fit with frame or completely fit with match. They want to put those two parameters the the frame in the match on the outside and then see what happens in the middle based on what those parameters are. I think that's the struggle for most people trying to gain entry into, well, how does this active inference thing actually work?"
"Unknown","01;09;23;15","01;09;47;12","It works different all the time. That's the point of the markup blanket. It's the potential to be able to invert at will that I think laying it out this way helps it get you like 90% of the way there. But it doesn't really tell you what you could do with it as opposed to what just happened very interesting."
"Unknown","01;09;47;26","01;10;14;24","Dean Bloop. So like just kind of this piggybacks right off of what Dean was saying, like the Markov link. And even here in the first line of this table, you know, the Markov blankets are hard when they're shifting, right? And this is something that we've talked about in other livestreams in other contexts, like shifting, overlapping my Markov blanket, interacting with your Markov blanket."
"Unknown","01;10;14;24","01;10;41;10","I think that the underlying mathematics to support those kinds of arguments are kind of missing still or not not missing, but it's still being worked out. It's probably more correct. But but I do think that Markov blankets do change. I mean, even if I just think about like my brain, Markov blanket, like thousands my cells are born. And I know that that's very controversial in our science field, but cells are actually born."
"Unknown","01;10;42;01","01;11;08;11","So so I mean, there's there's constantly this this turnover of who belongs inside the Markov blanket and any kind of, you know, organizational structure has that shift. It's not like the boundary of the think has to be has to retain some kind of flexibility. And and so that is seen here in this in this first line. And also, whose generative model is it?"
"Unknown","01;11;09;13","01;11;44;04","So this is kind of another something that that I was like, huh? So the quality management solution or the QM aspect quality, I maybe got the abbreviation wrong, but that that is the that is the generative model for like who does it belong to? Is it does it belong to the process? Does it belong to and this is maybe my like a deficiency in my understanding of industrial engineering because I'm just not familiar with the jargon, but like is it the process that get the quality of management solution or is it the organization that has the quality management or is it like some kind of sub unit?"
"Unknown","01;11;44;12","01;12;09;17","Is it a team so I'm just kind of unsure about they talk about this is the generative model, but like whose model is it? And like so depending on, on how that's answered and we'll have the author on so we can ask them. But depending on how that's answered, you know, this is one of a kind processes, as I said earlier, can maybe you'd be used to update the generative model in a very explorative kind of way."
"Unknown","01;12;11;03","01;12;39;29","Nice. So here's just for a few in implications and bigger questions. So here's just a quote. Marco Blankets are not features of real world systems, rather they are an intuitive post-hoc descriptions rather they are intuitive post-hoc descriptions made in order to model real world systems. Hence, any description of a markup like it is subjective and can be changed over time as the modelers focus changes and or as real world systems change in the opinion of the modeler."
"Unknown","01;12;40;23","01;13;02;14","Thus, as summarized by phrases such as The map is not the territory Mark on blankets, da da da da da da da. And then also, this is funny line. It has been been argued in relation to Mark blankets and other important constructs in active inference theory. That the math is not the territory. Hmm. Where we heard that before, but this is like kind of the ultimate instrumental."
"Unknown","01;13;02;27","01;13;35;21","Take it's making a clean distinction between map and territory, between the utility driven use of active inference and claims about what the system really is and then this just last line, but it's an interesting quote I'll just read. The last line is if the slides hence the description of Markov blankets could be a recurring challenge throughout project production, which may only be resolved by reference to decisions made in courts of law long after the project is completed."
"Unknown","01;13;36;05","01;14;02;19","Just made me think about, I don't know, maybe like the Bay Bridge being built in the Bay Area and California and like, you know, years later and it happened differently. And I'm sure some companies were bought and sold and all the morphing of the organization and the physical modification of the project and the personnel changing over all of that, which is sort of this on one hand, it's an end equals one unique enacted situation."
"Unknown","01;14;02;19","01;14;36;18","But then on the other hand, there's principles for engineering it well, and sometimes the process is itself wondering about how it's organized. And then sometimes you can't even know until it's after it's done. So just kind of cool and funny another quote, this is sort of picking a take on philosophy from the engineering perspective. Exactly how beliefs are updated in embodied cognition is a topic of ongoing research, which involved specialist mathematics to describe relationships between prior probabilities and posterior probabilities."
"Unknown","01;14;37;15","01;15;12;23","By contrast, updating beliefs through active inference in industrial engineering and quality management involves applying well-established practical methods, in particular planning. What should happen by active inference involves developing processes through applying industrial engineering techniques. So it's sort of like we know what our policy affordances is and mechanism of updating our affordances, ah, that's our discipline. And so more broader question is what are the implications for generalized frameworks like embodied cognition or active inference?"
"Unknown","01;15;13;19","01;15;39;27","What are the implications when they interface with disciplinary or project specific like one time work? And then how does active inference get simplified in the context of industrial engineering and how does work in the disciplines become linked in a bi directional conversation to the broader body of knowledge? Just general questions any thoughts or OK, Dean? Yeah, go for it."
"Unknown","01;15;49;16","01;16;22;25","Dana Muted. Yeah, I can't hear you, Dean. Oh, yeah, sorry. Yeah, I can hear, you know, my bad. Whether we're talking about the Bay Bridge as do we have the proper glove in hand or whether we're talking about instrumental ism, do I actually have a precise fit of glove for my hand? Yeah. I think what what we have to be aware of is that both of those questions come up post hoc."
"Unknown","01;16;23;27","01;17;02;23","I tried on the glove and it worked. Or maybe the design of the Bay Bridge should have been different given the contextual circumstance as well. I all I'm curious about is still before the Bay Bridge is Bill, before I, I fit one of two questions into that glove hand relationship. Am I aware of how that can be seen post hoc or ad I am I am I am I conscious of the fact of where I'm taking this active inference model and as blue pointed out earlier, whose is it?"
"Unknown","01;17;03;01","01;17;35;28","And now, just as importantly, when is it when is that when is that question being asked? In the context of what the project is? Because if we can talk about social organizations as the product, active inference allows us to look on both sides of that so if as long as we're including the win in terms of just discovering fit, I think I think we're actually using the inference in terms of what its potential is."
"Unknown","01;17;35;28","01;18;09;02","That's a nice little philosophy like we and not not like we need that. But I'm just throwing it in there. Yes. Cool. So then here's another quote in terms of the Explore Exploit dynamic project production involves much more exploration than exploitation, hence more wayfinding. The navigation than is involved. In particular, wayfinding involves the ability to create novel routes which are based on understanding a wider frame of reference than navigating along a pre-set route."
"Unknown","01;18;09;23","01;18;33;27","Wayfinding involves creating novel routes through changing situations by making non-conscious reference to subjective prior knowledge and conscious subject to reference to current situations and semantic information. That's pretty dense, but pretty fascinating because it does point at this kind of like repetitive then you can just write out the directions and follow them in a little bit more of a rule following way."
"Unknown","01;18;35;07","01;18;56;09","And then the extreme case being like a train like the Caltrain just went from San Francisco to San Jose. It just went and it was like it had, you know, the affordance to speed up or slow down. But then when there's the bushwhacking or the wayfinding here, then there's almost like novelty of path, and then there's higher novelties, like introducing a new tool or climbing to the top of the tree to see further."
"Unknown","01;18;56;16","01;19;29;03","But there's just this path finding novelty that is really important for, you know, all kinds of these applications. So just raises the question that'll be cool to discuss about like how does active inference juxtapose or interface with sense making and way finding, explore, exploit the pragmatic epistemic distinction? And then the way that the models are fit with accuracy minus complexity, just how does that come together in active any thoughts or content?"
"Unknown","01;19;30;00","01;19;58;09","Yep. Dean Yeah. It began because wayfinding is my is my niche. I was just so happy that he pulled these to Radford. Like if you haven't read 90 work of 95 and 96, I strongly recommend it because he's pulled out two fantastic references in terms of things you could look at in terms of what that exploration piece actually is that they're both fantastic, especially the 95."
"Unknown","01;19;58;25","01;20;23;27","Yeah, I've read both of them, and they're both, they're both excellent examples within the context, what he's trying to talk about in terms of the implications. So I wanted to do a clock for that one because I thought, glad, glad he brought the wayfinding piece into this. Cool. Yeah. The 95 is finding the way a critical discussion of anthropological theories of human spatial orientation with reference to reindeer herders of North Eastern Europe and Western Siberia."
"Unknown","01;20;23;28","01;20;52;15","2009. And then the second article is Humans use predictive strategies to target waypoints for steering 2019. So it's kind of interesting because and especially having adapted a visual foraging model to a stigma pheromones deposition model in the active inference paper, it has drawn out this contrast between two extremes of forage in both which can have a pragmatic and an epistemic component."
"Unknown","01;20;52;15","01;21;12;06","There's like skin in the game, a body on the ground where you're physically moving, you're hurting, and you have to go somewhere to find out how it is there versus visual foraging or visual scanning is sort of like you have the cost of movement, of course, but it's not like where your eye is, is directly paying the cost in most cases."
"Unknown","01;21;12;16","01;21;36;17","So it's kind of cool to see that the wayfinding and the sense making comes into play on these two extremes. With a niche modifying body on the ground, as well as with a scanning approach OK, another quote, we'll read the whole thing, but basically we can imagine after hearing all of this that the prediction error is something that you want to minimize for effective business operation."
"Unknown","01;21;36;17","01;22;04;11","So large prediction error could lead to the company dissipating, for example, through its internal resources being scattered into an external state by being taken into the possession of its own paid suppliers. So that's a market blanket dissolution via court mediated bankruptcy proceeding alternatively, the company could be acquired and merged into one of its large unpaid suppliers that seeks to move up the value chain from Tier one to OEM manufacturer."
"Unknown","01;22;05;02","01;22;39;05","In the case of acquisition and merger, the description of barcode blankets would need to be changed in legal documents. So that just totally set off my Scott David alarm. And maybe think about the ways that the mark of blankets can be designed the managing synthetic externalities, seeing law as a niche modification and as a technology in and of itself, but also one that can facilitate other technologies coming into existence or being hindered as we see all the time."
"Unknown","01;22;39;27","01;23;06;15","And then he uses the acronym BOLTS Business, Operational, Legal, Technical, Social. And then the bigger question is like, how can we see active inference serve in a de-risking or recovery capacity? And then how can we reframe existing or emerging practices for resilience in terms of active inference? So this is like a 1980 style merger and acquisition framed in the market blanket framework."
"Unknown","01;23;06;21","01;23;32;12","But what does the DFI active inference model look like? What does the smart contract active inference model look like? These will be like really interesting questions and how they're going to intersect with formal laws as well as the code as law any comments OK. And then I think the last point was just in the further direction of the paper."
"Unknown","01;23;33;03","01;24;12;25","Further refinement of active inference constructs is needed to enable wide application to social organization employing human and artificial intelligence. Apropos the practical examples in the paper can provide starting points for research into the challenges of ascribing market blankets, defining generative models, handling pragmatics and modeling variation on free energy in real world social organization and that's an idea that we touched on in our 2020 paper active inference and behavior engineering for teams, which is that in the case of remote teams, then the entire structure can be observed through the sensory data that's sent to a user."
"Unknown","01;24;13;04","01;24;41;26","And then the actions that are received for example on either side of an interface or either side of a blockchain wallet. So for remote teams, because they're defined digitally, we have access to the entire state space, so to speak, of sensory and active states. Whereas for trying to do the active inference model of people in a physical boardroom that's always going to be complicated, even if you have a really effective way to get body position out of the cameras in the room, for example."
"Unknown","01;24;42;05","01;25;09;18","So just kind of cool to think about industrial design or engineering, all these different ideas we talked about in terms of online as well as physical engineering. So not just like cars and stuff. Those are hardware and software as well. So we kind of just closed by saying what people can give their last thoughts blue. And then just what would a good understanding enable?"
"Unknown","01;25;09;28","01;25;56;06","What are some good unique predictions or implications or areas that this line of research might be addressing? What are the next steps for this kind of research, the goals of the research? And then also just what you're curious about asking the author tomorrow and in the following week yeah, I think I've laid out some questions today that I hope I don't forget before tomorrow, but I definitely think that active inference in systems, in organizations and social structures is definitely important along with the validation of your model through other models, like the models of other people and through like this, this confirmation bias, like, oh, my model must be good because you have a model that's"
"Unknown","01;25;56;06","01;26;23;17","like my model. So so I think that this, this existence can help to really set boundaries and definitions on how we really form social structures, not just businesses. And, and I mean, in businesses there's kind of a hierarchical component and but I mean, also like society as a whole reform these social structures and how the social morphogenesis really take place."
"Unknown","01;26;23;17","01;27;14;21","So I think really the author puts out a good way of, of kind of delving into social morphogenesis even through like quality quality management and industrial engineering. But it's not really four steps in any final comments. I'm really looking forward to talking to the author because I think at the end of the day, rather than what's the word here, rather than exploring why why these these mappings have been put together in this paper I'm kind of curious now about trying to figure out so when did when did these parallels sort of form in his mind and get to a place where he could take a lot of this background information?"
"Unknown","01;27;14;21","01;27;40;04","Because he's I mean, he's really cleverly and thoroughly sourced here when he sort of put these two things together as a reflection of one another. And where does he see that going forward? Totally agreed. It's a single authored paper that reflects a really deep understanding and probably a lot of experience presenting and thinking about this and maybe even applying it."
"Unknown","01;27;40;10","01;27;58;21","So those are all super interesting areas to find out about. All right. Well, Blue Dean, thanks. That was epic. Thanks for all the help on the slides and on the stream so that was great. We'll talk to everybody in the one day or two or later. So bye. Thanks, Dan."
