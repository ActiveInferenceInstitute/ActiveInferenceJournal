"Unknown","00;00;12;01","00;00;37;24","Hello everyone, and welcome to the Active Inference Lab. This is Active Lab Live stream number 27.2 on August 31st 2021 we are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links here this is a recorded and an archived live stream so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work."
"Unknown","00;00;39;03","00;01;22;19","All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we'll follow video etiquette for live streams and see who joins us. The short link is the calendar of live streams of the past and future and we did choose 28 paper but didn't update the slide. So check the link for next week's paper. Today in 27.2. Welcome to Stevens. Greetings. In 27.2 we're joined by the two Stevens as it were and Will and a few questions that we can have slides for the figures to go through the paper itself."
"Unknown","00;01;22;19","00;01;49;00","Anything else that anyone wants to add and then of course, any questions that people type in the live chat as well. If they're watching live so we can just say hello and then we can leave it to the author last just to maybe open it up or just bring what they were thinking about. Our second discussion here today."
"Unknown","00;01;49;12","00;02;13;17","So I'm Daniel and I'm a post-doc in California. Air. I'll pass to Steven Silhouette. Oh, hello there. I'm Steven. I'm based in Toronto and I'm working on social topographies and other spatial meaning making and hoping to find ways for active inference to shed light and all of that. And I pass it. I pass it to the other. Steven, is that OK?"
"Unknown","00;02;16;06","00;02;51;23","Yeah. Good day to you. I'm I'm in Finland, southern Finland, a base of the technical research center of Finland. And I'm ready to answer questions cool. So again, anyone who is watching can post a question, but then there's a few that we have lined up a little bit just one theme that stood out as far as selecting this paper was that it was applied."
"Unknown","00;02;51;24","00;03;33;17","It was applied to making the kinds of objects and supporting the ability to have the Internet and computers as well as just objects like pens and things like that. So how does this idea of helping us design physical systems, which ends up being our niche modification activity as an economy, how do we help design? Maybe if we're not an industrial engineer, but potentially people working on different kinds of projects that end up modifying the environment, maybe even influencing the same systems that industrial engineers use or using some of the same techniques."
"Unknown","00;03;33;17","00;04;21;28","But people who are just thinking along these lines and want to take what you translated one step towards application in your paper and then think about how it applies in their own work to cyber physical systems. So the latest trend in this is for example, in in the USA, I think it's called smart manufacturing and in Europe industry for quite a and a big thing in this is the idea of having digital twins or digital siblings or even avatars."
"Unknown","00;04;23;03","00;05;41;27","And the idea of this is, is that there's a physical machine. The physical process has got sensors on it and actuators on it. And the sensors bring live data to the digital equivalent of this physical process. And through so and then it seeks to optimize by seeing what's going on so on a basic or basic level is although difficult to achieve, is predictive maintenance, for example, so if nothing else, at least to stop the physical process from malfunctioning or even worse, stopping and there's no there's no theoretical foundation for these industrial innovations, things like digital twin."
"Unknown","00;05;41;27","00;06;32;18","So of course there's the theoretical background of cyber physical systems but there's nothing to anchor it with, in my opinion. That's very straightforward. So if we look at life sciences generally, we know that evolution has had millennia of millions of years to iterate, to develop elegant solutions so it seems sensible, at least to me, to to look to the life sciences to see how nature's evolved towards least action."
"Unknown","00;06;34;02","00;07;35;25","And of course, a free energy principle and active inference framework or theory from the life sciences and in their essence, I believe very straightforward, as one would expect guiding principles in nature to be and applicable to human and artificial intelligence or to artificial agents so I believe it's useful to start from that basis. And with the free energy principle, this very straightforward idea of the of trying to minimize the information gap between the generative model and the world itself."
"Unknown","00;07;37;01","00;08;15;22","So that's a very straightforward idea. And I know there's, you know, the the mask behind it is evolving all the time and that some debate and a courteous dispute about that, but the basic ideas seem straightforward. So I believe it's therefore a good place to start because this is such a basic idea, isn't it, minimizing the information gap between the the generative model and the world itself?"
"Unknown","00;08;18;27","00;08;21;03","Is this what I said helpful in any way?"
"Unknown","00;08;23;05","00;09;14;19","Thanks for this. I wrote a lot of it down Steven's let you have some really good points there. One thing I'd be interested in too, to know what your thoughts are is we can end up kind of adapting our needs through action as a kind of consequence of like following a path. And these types of things. And then we've got this kind of more constructed, sort of deliberative organizational work in which, you know, in many ways the point of that work can be to construct the environment in which tools will operate, you know, so in some ways we use the tools of our legs or the tools of being in in the world, and it"
"Unknown","00;09;14;19","00;09;46;20","can sculpt that niche. And also we can be very much scoped in a bounded niche. So in one day, my question is thinking about whether you see those, that kind of distinction as being significant and how you see the idea of like the free energy or the implications of the free energy, sort of roll it out in then the ish versus the generative model for that needs being embodied in some way."
"Unknown","00;09;46;28","00;10;46;24","So, you know, so anyway, so how much is there something what is embodied, for instance, when you're talking about these total quality management environments where someone is trying to maintain, I don't know, ISO standards of manufacturing or whatever. So I wonder what your thoughts are about that, whether this distinctions there in terms of active inference being particularly involved or, you know, the free energy principle more and more generally so all so I believe that the the the core of quality management is just an instantiation of free of the realizing the free energy principle through active inference."
"Unknown","00;10;47;07","00;11;37;09","But that's worth, you know, put in the paper but there's a bigger issue about or that in nature, things are evolving and so I put in one of my papers in entropy that that so there are new things are evolving to some degree naturally. And so if you just take predator and prey, they just it's evolved. And if you're a beaver trying to get back to the lodge that you've built, unleashed construction as a beaver and a lynx."
"Unknown","00;11;37;16","00;12;14;13","If you if you see in between where you are and you'll be the lodge and there's a lynx a hungry lynx standing in your way, then it's clear that this is a predator. And I should this is not my as a, as a beaver. That's not my preferred observation. Whereas my beaver lodges are preferred observation. But what goes on in human needs, construction and the ecosystem and environmental engineering is not so straightforward."
"Unknown","00;12;14;17","00;12;58;08","So for example, highly refined food it seems to be naturally to us like a preferred observation because it tastes good. And so it makes life less strenuous and more stimulating. So if the if the if the if the company making highly processed food ready meals so on, it's, it's acting within quality assurance so it's doing, in my opinion, active inference to realize the free energy principle."
"Unknown","00;12;59;06","00;13;40;12","But what it outputs is it subverts the free energy principle, the externality. It subverts the free energy principle because what it's offering to us as consumers it seems to be consistent with what revolt to do. So it makes life less strenuous or more more stimulating. But actually it's not good for our health in the long term of course, now and then, no problem."
"Unknown","00;13;40;25","00;14;28;04","But if that's all you, if you live in a food desert, if you live in a food desert, we know there are lots of studies that show that unfortunately this isn't good for our health. So if you take one entity at a time, it can be conforming with the three energy principle through acts of inference. But its output subverts the free energy principle because it makes all of our preferred observations instead of being good for us are not good for us."
"Unknown","00;14;28;04","00;15;31;27","But we only discover that 20, 30 years later so that's quite a lot to I have a diagram in this is a simple diagram in no time so the pipe is cool yeah. It's called multi-skilled energy analysis. Human Ecosystem Engineering OK, and there's one diagram a minute ago, one so it's an entropy as well. Yeah, I share my screen."
"Unknown","00;15;32;09","00;15;32;22","Sure."
"Unknown","00;15;35;22","00;16;19;10","There. Remind me. There it is. This one and OK, all right. Are you seeing able to give them free energy analysis, the human ecosystem engineer? Yep. All right. So here's this guy Gram, then there it is. So what what the what active inference is leading us to is that from nature is that our preferred observation supports survival, an unwanted surprise."
"Unknown","00;16;19;10","00;16;50;15","So an unexpected difference between a prediction of what we're going to experience based on our internal generative model. So an unwanted surprise. So if the beaver's going back to its lodge, it's thinking it's going have an unhindered path back to its lodge. And there's the unwanted surprise, little hungry lynx standing in the way and it threatens survival. So that's natural free energy principle."
"Unknown","00;16;51;14","00;17;41;29","But through human environmental engineering, these construction within a third observations can threaten survival so if my preferred observation is a comfy sofa, a large TV screen, and a device to change channels and do gaming, and then I can just order some food and it comes and very tasty, but perhaps no good for me. I could be sitting down for 16 hours and then go go lie down for the remaining 8 hours."
"Unknown","00;17;43;00","00;18;31;27","Might be all my preferred observations, but they're not good for me. Where's the unwanted surprise that supports survival? Could be a message. Is that okay? We should not sit down for more than 20 minutes. We should take lots of physical activity. We should eat, make our own food, and so on. So what's going on in human endeavors which may individually conform to the realization of free energy principle through active inference can end up subverting the free energy in school outside of the productive active of the production activity."
"Unknown","00;18;36;16","00;19;34;00","And here this some numbers occur. So so Beaver could develop a new generative right? So the year or so. So in nature or a Beaver, the the preference distribution for sensory inputs is for example plus turn to the protective pond lodge zero for woodland and -10 for a hungry predator then if there's a bit of pollution you translate OK so now this gets more complicated so this plus turn productive pond in clear water plus two practical and polluted water woodland zero hungry predators still -10."
"Unknown","00;19;35;06","00;20;17;13","But then or the example in this paper is in some island nations very small island nations where there's a lot of imported cheap calorie rich nutrient poor food and then the preference distribution to the cluster and importantly plus to local food -10 notion. And then this clear evidence that the imported food is not good OK so there it is."
"Unknown","00;20;24;13","00;21;06;05","OK, so did that does that up the hand. So I wrote down some stuff as well but blue welcome go for it then afterwards will be used. Let thanks. So I was really curious about that subverted model and like where you're maybe not optimizing where what your preference is is not optimizing for survival. And I think that you used it in the human context, but I can think of many contexts where animals do a similar thing."
"Unknown","00;21;06;05","00;21;26;12","Like a moth will fly into a flame and like a cat, like I have these two kittens now in my house and they're like such trouble, right? Like that curiosity like had my cat trapped in a box earlier today, like, I mean trapped like under furniture in the box, which was like so bizarre. So I mean, I can think of, of models where it's always not optimal."
"Unknown","00;21;26;12","00;21;58;07","And so is this something that you women excuse me. What was the last thing you said? Is this something that you frame as uniquely human? Because I can think of many instances of like nonhuman creatures that also have less than optimal preferences no, I'm not framing is only human. But what I'm pointing out is, is that so for example, the moth flies towards the flame, but where did the flame come from?"
"Unknown","00;21;59;12","00;22;33;28","And the cat's curiosity luckily did not kill your cats. That's good. But they were going into boxes. But where did the boxes come from? So all these things of course there are misjudgments, so all living things can make it big. And of course, with predators and pray that for sure the predators are trying to get to the prey only and people can have them."
"Unknown","00;22;34;00","00;23;18;06","And living things can misjudge the how far away the prey is and so on. And signaling systems can get messed up and things, but with human beings, the scale and the determination of activities is is much larger. So there's a there's an American author whose latest book is called Hooked that he studied the troubled food industry for many years."
"Unknown","00;23;18;06","00;24;12;26","And he his view is that there's nothing at all malicious going on. But it's just if you're if you're in the in the certain business you want, you're trying to get as many customers as possible and you're trying to retain them and with no no bad intentions at all to good intentions. But then the effects are we discover it can be decades later the OK at the this is what we thought was good is not so good."
"Unknown","00;24;14;07","00;25;02;16","Whereas in nature if the the wherever the flame suppose it was a flame from somewhere in nature, it was a natural fire well the the natural fire maybe came from a bolt of lightning or something. It wasn't a determined death over many decades of ever increasing refinement of a market offering but so there's more. So what I'm showing in the paper that you read about diagram about how the quality management system is like a pigeon is like an active inference system to reduce free free energy."
"Unknown","00;25;03;18","00;25;48;04","So it's optimum for the organization, but it can be suboptimal outside the organization. So I think a general good term for this is externalities just two quick things. One was trying to explore that distinction between what is human other than the fact that we care about us and each other, what is human? And I was just thinking of the ants foraging out there in the desert and they don't do margin trading or staking of their seeds to try to get fractional seeds and lending of seeds."
"Unknown","00;25;48;04","00;26;17;17","It's like layer one seed gathering versus the higher order, symbolic risks that the humans engage in. So that and the modification of the scale, among other factors. And then also what you said about misjudgment and the ability to misjudge because a lot of people think, oh, well, you know, if let's just say traditional understandings of evolution are about fitness, then why why do organisms fail?"
"Unknown","00;26;18;03","00;26;46;04","Why do all organisms not just maximize their fitness? Or if active inference is about reduction of uncertainty or using action and inference to reduce uncertainty then why do organisms fail? And that's where the engineering perspective comes into play, like things just do fall apart. And just because there is an imperative whether to maximize fitness or to minimize uncertainty, the point is of the ensemble, there's going to be a distribution of performance like 100 engines."
"Unknown","00;26;46;04","00;27;14;20","They're going to have some range of failure times the LG 50 for some pharmacological experiment. So just because the framework has sort of a imperative, whether fitness or uncertainty reduction doesn't mean that it's utopian or like panglossian, it means that every single thing always works perfectly so just cool points that you raised but it also blew my mind."
"Unknown","00;27;15;28","00;27;42;25","I have imperfect knowledge, that's for sure. And I wouldn't make I don't know enough. Maybe nobody does like what was just said about and of course though those words were coming from an expert and I don't know next to nothing about that and many of the behavior of many animals, I don't know. So for sure, it's not it's not clear cut."
"Unknown","00;27;42;27","00;27;48;11","It's not one that humans do in this. And all other animals aren't doing it."
"Unknown","00;27;51;07","00;28;30;07","Thanks, Steve in Charlotte. And then, of course, anyone who's watching life, I think this raises some useful areas where we have spaces where it's very free energy, minimizing as the main kind of way of getting a handle on things and the broader active influence. So for instance, when we're dealing with equilibrium chemistry, we're dealing with things which are often boiled or heated or made to be effectively dead, which is what happens in most engineering processes in most three processes."
"Unknown","00;28;30;07","00;28;54;16","I mean, the main thing that Coca-Cola does by putting sugar in is it makes a preservative. Some things milk. Why can't they just use water? It's an awful lot easier to to distribute Coca-Cola than to distribute bottled water, because Coca-Cola doesn't go off because it's got so much acid and sugar in it. It won't go off. Right. So that what you've got is you've got these processes like you're talking about with TQM."
"Unknown","00;28;54;27","00;29;24;07","And I've worked in the pigment manufacturing industry, so we they were bringing in the ISO standards. They're around pigment manufacturing because they're inheriting a lot of these formulas from like 100 years previous. And it was all about minimizing and to make things reproducible and within tolerance. But you're always dealing with you never want things to be organic. You don't want things to sort of to grow in any place in the, in the process."
"Unknown","00;29;24;07","00;29;48;00","You want it to all be I suppose you could say dead right. But then what's really interesting, as you point out, is, OK, that might be what happens within the containment of the factory or the industrial process. But it will go back into the world just like it when it's out now as a product, it will be used in an ecological niche and it will not be a dead niche."
"Unknown","00;29;48;13","00;30;16;16","You know, that food that maybe isn't even biologically feasible or some of those chemicals, there's no biological root to create them. There's no way to create fluoride compounds biologically. It just can't be done. It has to only be done synthetically. So what are your thoughts about that sticking with minimizing free energy more when you've only got dead equilibrium systems and then when and what and how much active inference is involved in that?"
"Unknown","00;30;16;16","00;30;58;29","I suppose a first order is only a second or third order, and then what? How things pop out into their niche in the community or whatever I think this is an open question. I mean, at one level, maybe at some in world systems theory, this the framing is that they're all so now we're talking about whole countries rather than just a company making something and more voluntary that that that they will inevitably call, I think in the terminology is cool countries that so it was the Netherlands, then Britain, then the US."
"Unknown","00;30;58;29","00;31;44;01","We now going towards China and then there are poor peripheral countries to levels of those and the the argument is that the development of local countries is dependent upon taking from the peripheral countries and is this entropy being shipped out of the. So if, if you think of like a factory as a heat pump and it's you're getting all the entropy out of the factory operations but then it's where's it going?"
"Unknown","00;31;45;05","00;32;09;16","Is it being shipped out of the factory and then is entropy being shipped out of the pumped out of the core countries into the rest of the world where things are confusing? So I don't know I mean, that's a bit of a broad sweeping statement, isn't it? So but it may maybe, maybe on one level that's what's going on."
"Unknown","00;32;09;16","00;32;33;21","If there's if you if you have supply chains, value chains and you push all the physical disorder out of those by eliminating all the information uncertainty, then does that mean the physical disorder is inevitably got to go somewhere else?"
"Unknown","00;32;36;29","00;33;35;08","Or it I don't know. So where that may be and then good with but for sure there are externalities and the imbalance of the interaction between levels is because in human endeavors it's it's a shifting matrix. It's not just a simple hierarchy of some sort. And I am can I just ask one thing? Just bouncing back of that is I think it's interesting though in some ways I, I things sort of being taken out of the ecological niche effectively by putting in a process, a processing plant where it's effectively dead you know, you heat up your sugar, your sugar cane raw material in a vat with sulfuric acid in it, you know, so it's all"
"Unknown","00;33;35;08","00;34;12;21","dead. It is basically a chemical process that gets put into whatever foods that someone's eating the consequence of having that that equilibrium based process, rather than one equilibrium steady state process, is that you're saying it puts a burden back on the ecosystems to try and reintegrate it in a way. So in some ways, is it pushing entropy out or is it just placing a burden on the system to try and find a way to cope with something that it can't naturally incorporate easily into its niche?"
"Unknown","00;34;17;07","00;34;27;29","What do you think blew yeah, I'm not sure, really. I'm not I'm not entirely certain."
"Unknown","00;34;31;05","00;34;59;26","On this on this transfer of disorder. It's definitely very important. Like, for example, when people say Well, look at the miles per gallon of this car and then, OK, but where did the metal come from? OK, but you know, everything is tied to everything and how we evaluate policies ultimately and choices are critical. And we do have to understand the relationships of the worlds supply chains."
"Unknown","00;35;00;10","00;35;30;06","But then I thought, well, it's not like there's a like we're in a bomb calorimeter or a heat bath where there's a constant number or proportion of some kind of negative activity. Like there could be an ant colony with of in a niche with very low nets, mate aggression or bodies, like there's organisms with low rates of cancer or in certain issues, you know, it's not like a statement of them across all patterns and times."
"Unknown","00;35;30;26","00;35;59;21","But but then again, it was like, so things do fail and there's no perfect state but then at the same time it's not zero sum in the informational game. It's not like we're trying to because we're getting energy coming in. So can we kind of transmute physical order with information disorder? Do we have to like offload something to another place physically?"
"Unknown","00;36;00;13","00;36;25;05","Does it bump up against any other information limits or calculations or density of processing or storage? We'll be not be able to remember enough. And then there's a catastrophic failure. I mean, there's so many components to your question. So I hope that we can all keep thinking about that because it's important at the level of like human activity with the supply chain."
"Unknown","00;36;25;24","00;36;34;13","And it's also important long range question. And if we don't have a long range preference, then we're not going to get there."
"Unknown","00;36;52;26","00;37;15;02","Could I have one more bit in there without. Yeah, I think what's interesting as well is there's this question of because I don't really believe there is, strictly speaking, entropy as such. So in terms of and it's always kind of a relative thing, but it's a useful it's can be useful to think about it that way sometimes, but ultimately it's always a change."
"Unknown","00;37;15;09","00;37;42;25","So I suppose the question comes in in terms of how much is it around the ability to infer using entropy as much as it is about how, you know, how much is it to be able to use change in entropy or dynamics of entropy which can be a complex jungle niche? You know, it could be a lot of entropy change and a lot of stuff going on, but it can be very healthy."
"Unknown","00;37;44;04","00;38;13;09","How much is that ability to dynamically get at the variation of free energy really important for life? Whereas for us it's all about, you know, at times in an engineering context is it's just reducing free energy per say as a kind of an overall entropy term, which could be actually not so much about variation or change, it's just an overall general reduction in entropy."
"Unknown","00;38;13;09","00;38;51;22","I wonder what what your thoughts are on that one thought on that on the biological side is what's an industrial engineering relationship, ecosystem engineering relationship that has persisted for billions of years or millions of years or just a long time, however you want to see it, the nitrogen cycle and some of the dark cycles in the bacterial relationships, biofilms, the mitochondria and the eukaryotes."
"Unknown","00;38;52;15","00;39;16;21","Now that's a shifting interface. But on the other hand, eukaryotes can totally count on that interface. The powerhouse of the cell, as they say, to persist but then there's this other sense in which there is still a game theory and a failure mode and probably an interface of maximal uncertainty and the requirement for active sensing and tradeoff costs."
"Unknown","00;39;17;20","00;39;42;02","So it's again, it's not like things I think work. 99% of time or 100% or 20% of the time. That is kind of how the chessboard is set up for the for the for it to even be a winning board at all. There's just niches where it can't work. Like there's temperatures that just the population will just diet period."
"Unknown","00;39;42;23","00;40;16;17","So is our engineering condition such that there is a path that's going to lead to what standard of life with what precision and uncertainty for what distribution of people like did we Weiwei overshoot and now it's going to change back down to a different way or is there some critical path to changing the distribution of industry because it's not going to be any way it was from zero to 2021."
"Unknown","00;40;16;17","00;40;18;07","It's not going to be that way next year."
"Unknown","00;40;25;22","00;40;40;21","And you. Are you still seeing my screen or I'm not? Can you be sure? OK, all right. This is a can I do that again?"
"Unknown","00;40;45;04","00;41;33;08","And could this is a are you seeing now bigger one, better ecosystems in the Anthropocene now? Yep. OK, yes. This is a paper I'll go to the title of so many of you will survive this thing. But this is not by me, Boyle. This was to do with me. I'm just a reader of it. And one thing that's saying that you can just so here, this this is the same these are showing the same things, but these were human impacts on migration based matter ecosystem."
"Unknown","00;41;34;03","00;42;19;09","It's it's just sort of implicit and on this framing of it, they say, OK, so we explicitly deal with the socio ecological framework. So what are human beings? What mental models of human beings go? What regulations arise from that? And then that inputs into it so let me go to the top. So you see the title. Yeah. On bedding matters, on embedding litter ecosystems into a socio ecological framework and this is a response."
"Unknown","00;42;19;09","00;43;04;19","This is just a short paper. It's a response to somebody who replied to the no, it isn't actually no, I'm mixing up with another one. There is thus the title. Anyway, so I'm wondering if that may be that each, each way of making things has got its own entropy dynamics and the in this entropy and dynamics that there's physical disorder is reduced information so is reduced."
"Unknown","00;43;05;14","00;43;57;25","But maybe that then pushes the entropy out elsewhere and then just doing more of the same thing. It's just not possible. There's a limit to it. And with world systems theory this is the gist of it, that there are these core countries and there are peripheral countries that serve them. And maybe the if there's one way of doing things, you can't address the entropy that's caused by that, by trying to do more of the same or trying to tweak that way of doing things and maybe something quite different has to be done."
"Unknown","00;43;59;09","00;44;40;23","And maybe there's something about something to be learned from landscape restoration ecology in less about that, about habitat fragmentation than that. So, OK, so here are these habitats and they've grown and they're thriving, but these ones over here, they fragmented, they split, and this there's nothing from them but dispersal. So less people are dispersing from parts of the world suffering from premature deindustrialization."
"Unknown","00;44;42;01","00;45;25;18","The maybe there's something in entry point dynamics that could be that will this doing this type of industrial production, this drives out the entropy. But is shipping out, it's going elsewhere. And the entropy is that in other places it can't be dealt with other time by some in another way of existing does that sound in any way sensible very interesting area."
"Unknown","00;45;26;01","00;46;21;19","Multiple levels of nested modeling and uncertainty and how informational and thermodynamic aspects transmute into one another and arbitrage with one another or relate to each other. So it's really interesting area. And one kind of thought on that and again, to the fast food and things that might be unhealthy for us or policies that might be unhealthy in the long term for an organization, it it made me think about being on a road trip and knowing that there was going to be not just the hyper stimulating experience which has been argued in many other frameworks, like in reward based frameworks, which is why, you know, oh, dopamine, the reward molecule, reinforcement learning, reward learning, they'll already"
"Unknown","00;46;21;19","00;46;56;09","have a framing for how those products hyper stimulating lead to failure modes of complex societies via hyper stimulation. OK, so that is sort of a common stance with active inference. We can also kind of highlight the fact that those products have lower variability and that there's actually very bland foods that for reason of blandness that or like a TV show or something that for reasons of narrative or esthetic just similarity, people will rewatch."
"Unknown","00;46;56;09","00;47;23;06","I mean even to videos that of types of people didn't expect why do people watch the log burning or the group playing? Because they're sort of like the frontier of optimal foraging is about like how it's going to sound, which is a very small thing to be resolving relative to the more deeper, unsettling levels of information that could be revealed like someone else's perspective of you or something like that."
"Unknown","00;47;24;09","00;48;08;10","So it's just interesting how we can actually, as you point out, like the supply chains are modeled on one hand by these cyber physical digital twin frameworks that need a unifying approach. And so on one hand, active inference does provide that. But then looking at the other side of the equation, so what you didn't discuss in our paper for these weeks, but where you left off, when you start introducing the biological and the survival imperatives, then we can also have some new ways of thinking about how those industrial products through precision hacking rather than reward hacking end up leading to maladaptive behavior."
"Unknown","00;48;08;19","00;48;46;27","With or without reward incentivisation you know, what are you seeing? Are you seeing my screen now are different? Yep. Like diagrams you see birds. Yeah. Generalist bird gap, specialist butterfly interior habitat, specialist beetle. So this is another paper again. I'll scroll up to the top title and it's making this point that landscape composition and configuration to different species perceptions."
"Unknown","00;48;48;11","00;49;27;29","And so the first one's a human and then it's different species. And as it's neatly illustrated, they're the same the same place looks different to different species. And so what on and the the kind of the terminology here is that there are patches, habitat patches, and there can be corridors between them or steppingstones between them and the stuff, the other stuff is called Matrix."
"Unknown","00;49;29;20","00;50;07;20","And I personally can't ever see that word or say it without thinking about the movie. So it's a bit of a problem. But, but in the landscape, ecology is called a Matrix. So this I think this could be useful of illustrating the well. Okay, so here's the road to the mind. These content companies built the road to the mind, the build the mind and they're taking the, the stuff out and the taking back to their country to do highly efficient manufacturing with it."
"Unknown","00;50;07;20","00;50;34;05","And then they send the completed goods back. And then what's left so if you just measure that in terms of GDP growth, then the GDP goes up divided by the number of people and their peers and prosperity is rising. But if if you look at it in this view, it shows the world there's a lot of blank spaces left, be left here."
"Unknown","00;50;35;09","00;51;24;27","And if we think about in terms of this restoration or regeneration, it it's looking at all these because, of course, the perspective is the human, generous bird, the specialist butterfly and the the beetle. They're all equally valid. And so they've got this cool landscape, ecology and restoration processes and even within the same physical overlap, one bug might be underground or in the roots or on the ground in the canopy."
"Unknown","00;51;24;27","00;52;21;12","So even the physical micro niche that different strategies or individuals experience in the same spot in the matrix can be very different. So there's just such richness to this ecological thinking and it's just challenging to bring it into play in some of our cognitive endeavors. But I think that it's also changing rapidly so I've taken our ecological perspective and yeah, we're doing one paper on meme ecosystems and rhetoric to ecosystems by the end of this year."
"Unknown","00;52;21;29","00;53;04;01","But it's not active, direct, but maybe it has some relationship to it could well do a you now seeing a tangled web one. All right. So what I've done here is I've done this from my ecological perspective and well, you can see these terms, but one thing in a restoration ecosystem restoration is mobile linking organisms that the birds and animals that can travel quite a long way, they can go."
"Unknown","00;53;04;01","00;53;41;05","So this is a forest fire. Then animals that control quite a long way, birds, they can come, they can fly and drop seeds and things like that. So this is an established term concept, mobile linking organisms. I know I'm pointing out this is something that can be done in mobile factories and then energetics and other key issue is if there's no if all the energy is all the matter and energy of flowing out, then life isn't sustainable."
"Unknown","00;53;42;13","00;54;18;22","And of course, we all like relating to my favorite subject, movable production technologies OK, so one of so that's I think this is decentralized systems. Is that the second point? That was that was the lead in the Segway OK, nice."
"Unknown","00;54;24;03","00;54;56;27","How about OK, go for it, Stephen. Yeah. So I think this is the thing if everything's so at the moment, there's this centralization. Oh, look at this. I've got I go again. So, so OK, here are you what do you see now? Do you see a taxonomy? Taxonomy of manufacturing distributions and the comparative relations to sustainability? Yes."
"Unknown","00;55;02;23","00;55;32;20","Just search right. So here they are. So there are distributed distributions and centralized and as we see, there's plenty of distributed options. And then I compare them in terms of economic ecological, social and institutional sustainability."
"Unknown","00;55;34;25","00;56;48;06","And where I think active influence I've just started to look into this that this age and environment systems and framing is the the agent has a generative model. The world is a generative process. The century inputs are coming from the general process to the world. And I think that this enables active inference to be linked to ecosystem dynamics, and that is that what we think or what I've been saying before about this centralized distribution, it it's super efficient and it's getting engineering out, physical disorder and information uncertainty."
"Unknown","00;56;48;06","00;58;09;01","But then it may be that entropy is growing somewhere else and maybe new information is needed to activate the more distributed options so do you think do you think that that if that if the only if only a certain so if if there is a predominant paradigm, which in this case there is industrial manufacturing based on the 300 year old paradigm that if the information about how to make things is all about that and how to improve that, and then then does it become a zero sum game that if if so if it is shipping out entropy like a heat pump out to the peripheral nations, do you think it's a zero sum game if"
"Unknown","00;58;09;01","00;59;01;29","there is an alternative information? So if nobody knows or there hasn't yet been conceived an alternative, then then is it like a closed system? So in a closed system, the entropy has it. If it's pushed out of one place, it goes to the other places. So is it is it a closed system? Is it a closed system? If all the information is about one paradigm, so is this loyal, for example, am I in any way coherent here it's an extremely important question."
"Unknown","00;59;02;19","00;59;46;20","And, you know, socio technical systems, political systems, token all mix that last forever. Are these the the perpetual motion machines of the twenties and just a new level of computational detail and flourish, but the same kinds of fallacies and then whatever the thermodynamics of the earth are our niches finite? And we've now made some potentially whether or not the sum is zero or even negative or could be positive but is negative."
"Unknown","00;59;47;04","01;00;23;23","There may be informational and strategic games that don't resolve like heat baths, so they can't be understood with some of the at least most tangible physical metaphors that thankfully guide the evolution of theories that our first principle like MVP like Carl person with the wood lice, seeing the trajectory of a real thing and that's based upon health and longevity."
"Unknown","01;00;24;21","01;00;58;19","Live yeah. I had a question about the table that you pulled up earlier, specifically about ego system engineering. And so I'm not sure if it's just like a term that I'm not familiar with or like in terms of engineering, I'm kind of naive. So when you're thinking about ecosystem engineering, I equate that to niche modification or like designing a system like even you know, you could design like a world system."
"Unknown","01;00;59;04","01;01;33;07","So here it says it does not require overriding the natural evolutionary balance of equal equal ecologic fitness. But like I think about the human paradigm, you could, I just could just picked that. But that's movable production technology is. So what I'm saying there is that if you've got a movable factory, so a truck, if you go got a second truck with a second hand container on the back of it, it does not require overloading the natural."
"Unknown","01;01;33;07","01;02;00;10","You really rebalance so it's it's specifically in relation to if you look at the top, it says movable production technologies. So so how how is that ecosystem engineering though like a move. No, it isn't. Yeah. But the point of this table is not clear. I mean, it is my responsibility. It's not clear I am the responsible for this."
"Unknown","01;02;00;10","01;02;51;05","But so what is meant by this is because further up in the paper, it's pointing out that if you have fixed production technologies, so if you've got a big fixed factory you build a load of roads, huge roads going into it and so on, that involves a great deal of ecosystem engineering. But a mobile, a mobile factory, it can just go over rough terrain it's also to play devil's advocate against the author, the enabling function of a realization of something, something physical that can be an ecosystem engineering agent, a.k.a niche modifying agent, that it's going to have to be a niche modifying agent."
"Unknown","01;02;51;05","01;03;27;25","So this is just sort of then connecting that to mobile organisms. So you have, quote, plants, A.K.A factories that are planted, and then those can be like they're not like trees simply, but they're planted. And so they have strategies not dissimilar from other rooted organisms, but then you have mobile organ linking organism. So it sort of connects that all the things that mobile organisms like all animals do and can do with what a factory could do ecologically blue."
"Unknown","01;03;29;18","01;03;57;12","So it just kind of makes me think about like what kind of biological organisms take their niche with them too, like maybe a snail or a turtle like, you know, to take take a large component of their habitat essentially with them wherever they go. The mobile technology, I mean, we think of that yep. Some people like to travel with light, you know, just the keys or something."
"Unknown","01;03;57;12","01;04;30;09","Other people full backpack every time. Stephen So I like this idea of something coming out of the factory, going into the space and then things being second hand. And so you see that third, fourth, fifth hand because there is something there that is delivered in this. I mean, if you're going to use entropy, I suppose you could say low entropy kind of you, new vehicle, you know, whatever it is, and slowly it gets incorporated into the ecosystem."
"Unknown","01;04;30;09","01;05;13;05","It starts to get scratches, it starts to get this. Then you seen in India, you know, people start decorating the vehicle. You know, all this sort of stuff will happen over time as it becomes somehow incorporated into the nation. I suppose you could argue something as quite quite interesting how that maybe starts to change the dynamic. I'm still not sure where the entropy is so useful term or whether it's some other way of looking at a metric, maybe something to do with free energy minimization."
"Unknown","01;05;13;18","01;05;46;03","As a as a thing. But that's the one other piece. That table that was interesting was there was multiple goals like sustainability and fitness. So it is not a univariate optimization. We're not just doing reward or utility maximization. We can choose multiple goals, we can have multiple human goals, which is especially important for things that, you know, we care about."
"Unknown","01;05;46;16","01;06;19;12","But then this one of mutualism is interesting because a lot of times mutualism could be seen as like an outcome like the outcome of these two bacteria's relationship in the niche is a commercialism or mutualism or symbiosis, whatever it happens to be. But actually using this idea of the the outputs, like the observation states of a higher level Bayesian model being like the priors on a lower level nested model, having a goal of mutualism is implicit in the lower level model."
"Unknown","01;06;19;12","01;06;49;00","Enacting that mutualism because you're not accidentally going to metabolically coordinate through millions of generations. And so this is kind of an interesting way where like we have to want to make it work because we're not going to accidentally make it work and get along but that can be a hyper fryer, like a belief about how things ought to be or how we want or prefer things to be."
"Unknown","01;06;49;15","01;06;53;08","And then we enact policy along those lines."
"Unknown","01;07;00;11","01;07;39;22","And by the way, I do that it's not it's it's about the way in in another paper, I do point out there are limitations to movable factories we're not saying that this is a panacea but it's sort of like like let's just say a cactus versus like a desert animal. You know, the desert animal, they have different ways of getting water."
"Unknown","01;07;39;22","01;08;21;14","And so but when we can design the system, we can do trade offs. Like you could have something that's stationary but then isn't just holding all of its own money because it's money can be like on a digital system. So it can have some of the advantages of a stationary organism from an ecological perspective like a tree. But then like the value of the tree could be protected in some other way because we have some other affordance and or that forest could be de-risked at a higher level because it's like, oh, each one of these is we expect to fail this many percent of the time, or we have these quality control checks on it."
"Unknown","01;08;29;21","01;09;18;26","And I think a lot of thought is required about all of these things, isn't it? It's I don't think there's one big answer, but but at least I think one good thing about the energy principle out of importance that it ties into action and that ties into energy so this is good. Yep. When you're doing the thought experiment you're getting and then it's like you can be elucidating, you know, imagine you're going towards the speed of light, or imagine you have a physical mass of this size."
"Unknown","01;09;20;10","01;10;01;01","But then there's no constraint, which is, again, a double edged sword on some of these attributes that require action. And so that's that's an interesting idea that it ties us to active states, which is pragmatic and useful, but also interesting. And then also one thing on the aspect of system and then blue you can ask anything was just we've talked also about higher order variables in organisms being kind of like affective states, whether they were the valence, like positive or negative or the anxiety or the relative beliefs of an organism."
"Unknown","01;10;02;15","01;10;30;22","So just how do we design for when there's higher order states, maybe even ones that we could be considered affective, either for people or for for organisms or I mean, organizations that have this kind of organismal structure, but blue so interestingly, like this is going to touch on what you just said, but also going back to what you said about mutualism and the goal like has to be mutualism."
"Unknown","01;10;31;10","01;10;59;26","So so I don't know, I really have to contact the author of the 2020 paper Sims is his name How to Count Biological Minds, Symbiosis, the ACP and reciprocal multi scale integration, which I have found very fascinating, but I would love to invite him on for a swim someday. The whole point of that is that there's like nested cognition happening at the biological scale."
"Unknown","01;10;59;26","01;11;36;08","And specifically that paper looked at the squid and the fish, right? That like light up the squid in the light organ and you know, in that kind of context, as in an industrial organization, there's like this nested cognition happening and where the point of that was the goal wasn't necessarily mutualism or in that case, symbiosis. That's not necessarily the goal, but but a bigger, grander organism was constructed out of the union between these two organisms."
"Unknown","01;11;36;14","01;12;09;16","And so perhaps in an industrial scale. That's also something that happens, right? I mean, there's different parts to the organization that'll keep it running. And you factor in all the supply chain things and so there's this nested hierarchical thing that happens and something bigger that has its own kind of cognition occurs as a result of this, like mutual beneficial relationship we see the paper the paper, we see the paper that Stephen just put up."
"Unknown","01;12;10;10","01;13;10;26","Yeah, there's some these the thought it said in his I thought it said in here somewhere about yeah, it's different sexual relationship. So mutualism is beneficial. Beneficial and parasitism is beneficial, harmful. But in between those there's beneficial and neutral and there are several in between mutual and para parasitism there are several of the states. And I just remember that one of them is beneficial and neutral if I could give a kind of random thought on that and why the informational sphere might have a different entropy dynamic than the physical like the electromagnetic spectrum that can have a lot of positive and neutral relationships."
"Unknown","01;13;10;26","01;13;42;02","Like if someone's operating on two different wavelengths and one was only on one wavelength, then they can be like a mutual service to each other. Or one could just be totally non interacting because they can be overlapping in space and time at once, and one person might not even have to be aware of it. Whereas in the tangible I guess most embodied one can be, you know, only one thing per spot that's zero sum."
"Unknown","01;13;42;10","01;14;28;29","There just can't be 22 atoms at the same spot or maybe, you know, two laws playing out in one territory, but informationally there's probably a lot more multi-channelling and that might give enough room for practice for success, if not ultimate theoretical answering Stephen's, let alone blue yeah. This brings up a lot of issues. It's very fascinating. And I'm curious so coming back to this idea and then you mentioned hype of priors, I things that we kind of have fixed."
"Unknown","01;14;29;11","01;14;53;14","And I actually look there are actually to make sure I understood it, but things that we have is very distinctive. And I'm again trying to compare these, these types of environments where one where you've got an agent wanting or being able to just calibrate in among the noise ones where you want to just keep it as clean as possible."
"Unknown","01;14;54;03","01;15;15;06","You know, so and the challenge is sometimes when you have a quality management system in those places. So for instance, I suppose one thing that comes to mind is the experiment with the rats that they used to have and they've had for years about having cocaine or addictive substances and how they would they only needed to have a couple of times and they would be addicted."
"Unknown","01;15;15;06","01;15;36;09","And it was seen as this kind of proof of principle about addiction and how it works. And then the more recent work where they instead of putting them in a beer box and just having the cocaine or whatever, they're been sort of exposed to. They were in a more ecological box, you know, where there was things to do."
"Unknown","01;15;36;09","01;15;55;10","And they suddenly found that the behavior of the animal was very different. They wouldn't necessarily become addicted in the same way because they would actually because they were in a better ecology. Now, in theory, the entropy is gone up there. If you look in and tropically but for the animal, they've been able to engage and and dynamically process that."
"Unknown","01;15;55;23","01;16;26;28","That's very different to how you would try and create you know, a medical production line, right? You want to keep it clean, you want to keep it sterile, you want to have those sorts of things so I'm just curious about that. And the danger may be in a biological system of this hyper prior, say, some sort of kick or something that comes from food, not having any other complements around then, you know, so there isn't other things."
"Unknown","01;16;26;28","01;16;47;04","So that just naturally kicks in like the reward goal which may be always there as a default. If there's not other things to complement, it just it starts running the show and that could be part of how we get into these maladjusted behaviors that you were talking about. I wonder what your thoughts are on that. Just quick point of clarification."
"Unknown","01;16;47;04","01;17;11;18","That's not what a hyper priorities. That's not a hyper stimulating stimuli. A hyper prior is is a prior over another a prior in a Bayesian level framework. So it doesn't need to be accentuating or differentiating or extreme or maladaptive. It's a general framework for the relationship between variables. Yeah. Well, I was thinking it was more the hyper prior could give is a is a fairly fixed prior reason."
"Unknown","01;17;11;18","01;17;37;04","It's one which is a go to solid prior and it's useful for being that done. Just saying having that present hyper prior could be fixed or learned or learned. OK, OK. But it tends to be hyper prior means it's quite accurate isn't it? It's quiet. It's not noisy. Hyper is, I think a spatial designation like supra. Not, not in the extreme case, hyper."
"Unknown","01;17;37;07","01;18;21;24","It's only referring to the fact that it's a parameter about another parameter and overarching. So it doesn't tend to be hot or cold or anything, it's just the general phrasing. OK, there so but Stephen Fox, if you want to add anything, it is an otherwise blue OK, we see the head yeah. So in male, the effective system so here is my diagram."
"Unknown","01;18;23;03","01;19;25;17","So in in this saying that if it's a little bit smaller, I can't see it myself that if there's the same starting point but of a generated model. So if the human being in the human robot interaction knows that OK so I'm I'm in the predictor, I'm human, I'm in the predictive processing business. That's what I'm doing. And and so I got prior beliefs and I have got generative models then the robot can be model."
"Unknown","01;19;25;25","01;20;34;25","So personas and scenarios for robot based on the humans well that's worldview, but generative model and human readable model of the robot mind that corresponds to that so that's this is in aligning human psychomotor characteristics with robot learned and reality in this the so there's a bit of a mobile world that's also very related to the shoulders. Paper trust is extended control act of inference and user feedback during human robot collaboration oh I'll put it in the YouTube channel one I'll put it on YouTube chat but really go for this one."
"Unknown","01;20;36;07","01;21;48;02","And so that's it's all in the past experiences physiology. So this is body memory in personality, gender, culture, emotion, reasoning and bio cybernetic so this paper I'm relating to what how this can affect interaction with robots, exoskeletons and augmented reality routines we got here a few equations for news, but in the two I point out in this that some of these foreign insight and previous production literature, the uncertainty of human behavior this is this is true."
"Unknown","01;21;48;20","01;22;18;27","So in previous production literature, the uncertainty of human behavior is being recognized this a source of productivity, equality and safety problems. And one of the fundamental reasons for the uncertainty of human behavior have been fraying previously as a black box. So what I was trying to do there was related to to open up the black box and frame it as an open box."
"Unknown","01;22;19;20","01;22;53;26","And then fundamental reasons can be aligned with production totally to facilitate improved production performance so that's as far as I've got with that it's almost like for the reward utility driven person, you can say there's going to be an increased expectation of performance for the uncertainty minded you can say there'll be a reduced variance for the resilience minded or for the reconfiguration minded, that there'd be an increased capacity to rapidly reorganize."
"Unknown","01;22;54;19","01;23;27;19","So I think that we'll have all or none blue so my thoughts kind of data at this point, but just going back to touching back on to mutualism and you know, this is the electromagnetic spectrum when you're talking about how like, you know, the signal can amplify. There's also like the possibility for the signal to cancel, right? If the wavelengths are the same and they're heading in opposite directions, they just directly cancel each other out."
"Unknown","01;23;27;27","01;23;56;27","And it kind of made me think of like cancel culture and also like the relationship between, you know, the parasite is also like a nested biological relationship, even though it's not necessarily beneficial. But there's still this nested layer, like the parasite is unable to function without the host, of course, but the host embodying the parasite like is a completely different cognitive dog mating creature."
"Unknown","01;23;56;27","01;24;48;07","And I think about like the zombie ants, right? That I don't know if you guys have heard of. Daniel can probably unpack the zombie answer a lot better than I can, but it's like a parasite that then drives the behavior of of the ants due to some rewiring of the cognitive process. So even in the parasite instance, there's still a greater colonizing structure and then going back to that mutualism because the, the other terms are so commensal ism is where one gains benefit while the others it doesn't there's a new neutral node benefit and then there's a Menzel ism where one is harmed or the other is unaffected."
"Unknown","01;24;50;29","01;25;36;13","So in between so the first mutualism and benefit, then commensal ism where there is benefit neutral and then there's mentalism where there is harm, a neutral group and then parasitism where this one is harmed and the other's benefits oh, I wonder if this has to do with the movement from maybe just it's semantic, but from sustainability to regenerative because sustainability, it's like the sustain on the guitar sound of the bell, like let's sustain, let's have this car and sustain it or make it so it can be meant to mean more than that."
"Unknown","01;25;36;13","01;26;23;26","But it's about sustaining something that exists versus regenerating means. Like we're going to have to be doing more than just persisting or stabilizing it, though it has to be also actively having this process of of regeneration, which always involves like multiple parts like Bucky Fuller saying that unity is plural and at minimum two. So then now thinking about how from poly culture of growing crops to monoculture, the Green Revolution and everything and then now, oh, maybe there should be the fish in between the roots of the plants and then the birds and then the mushrooms like this are these stable ecosystems so that is what remains to be seen."
"Unknown","01;26;24;06","01;26;44;18","But some human modified niches like sourdough bread and things and beer have been really successful so maybe there's higher or combinations too that could be really successful and be very productive. But this is kind of a framework that helps us at least explore that. So that's quite cool."
"Unknown","01;26;54;09","01;27;36;06","I wasn't remotely of course there was a launch the South African Grassroots Innovation Program. They did a launch yesterday with five lady innovators and one of them was doing movable aquaponics and she seemed to have addressed it's quite a surface ticketed system, but it's all it's all set up in buckets that can be carried. One person can carry the buckets that's the science layer."
"Unknown","01;27;36;25","01;28;16;11","And then you build up the, the farm by different just having the number of the different the more buckets you get, the bigger the aquaponics farm so that was interesting. And then again with a physical zero sum and then the electrode magnetic or informational or financial non-zero-sum, if the overlapping is just given the tools that already exist in the ecosystem that you find yourself in, like you're dropped on Survivor Island, you still may be able to find some synergies."
"Unknown","01;28;16;15","01;28;41;27","Most of them you won't know. But over a long time, traditional ecological knowledge can learn about some medicinal combinations. And oh, these two should be combined for the boat and these kinds of things. But design and this is related to what Stephen said about the product being plugged into another external niche and what you wrote about the cupboard being attached to the wall."
"Unknown","01;28;42;08","01;29;24;21","Like we could design some pretty minimal pieces that might really scaffold you build a trellis and then something grows within it. So the engineering might not be huge to connect a few pieces that have a latent capacity to work together yeah. The the word you use, the scaffolding, is that good? Any of of course I've heard it before, but does that have any basis in nature to your knowledge?"
"Unknown","01;29;26;28","01;30;21;28","I would certainly say so. From the spec you will structures like in bones and the way that physical structures are scaffolded to embryogenesis and the developmental scaffold scaffolding of the uterus and the core caretakers and it's different insects and humans and the family. And so I think there's a cultural scaffolding and then all the way down to the micro structural site or skeletal scaffold for scaffolding, enzyme complexes that then can do very efficient things to it's interesting because the problem with the, the challenge with so-called grassroots entrepreneurship innovation is scaling up."
"Unknown","01;30;22;20","01;30;58;04","That's the challenge. That's that's what we said yesterday. That's what said in India. There's this problem that solutions are developed and they work. But the best study where they've been in the village where it's been developed sort of just stays there. And so scaling up and it's open source wood. It's well, there it is. The technology's there is an open source ecology."
"Unknown","01;30;58;04","01;31;41;11","And so it's possible to put all engineering designs, building materials, and methods were broken all on the Internet where anybody can access it. But still, things are not scaling up thanks, Lou. So I think about scaffolding in terms of like neural systems, but also in societal systems in the brain. Like my Ph.D. work was focused on finding a scaffold that will promote the growth of neurons across across a lesion."
"Unknown","01;31;41;23","01;32;00;13","And so when you when you have a traumatic brain injury, the glia, which is like the natural scaffold, like freak out and form a scar to prevent like the whole rest of the brain from dying because cell death can be like this kind of cascading process. And so the clear and it literally results in like a hole in the brain where the injury was."
"Unknown","01;32;01;00","01;32;40;26","So I was looking at these bioengineered scaffolds that promote the growth of neurons across that hole. So it'll form a bridge or a structure, a scaffold for the neurons to grow. And then you know, in terms of the the societal setting, I think about scaffolding as infrastructure. And I mean, even in an organization like you have to have bridges and roads and Internet connections and utilities and, you know, these things are it's the infrastructure that's necessary for kind of new branches or systems to start up."
"Unknown","01;32;40;26","01;33;05;25","And even in like the farming terms, it's like, you know, the like, I don't know, here we just call them the ditches. But like the irrigation canals, I guess is probably the proper term like that, you know, where you can get a river to flow off into different subsections and then irrigate the farmland with that water. So so I think about that as as the scaffold awesome."
"Unknown","01;33;06;04","01;33;37;16","Nice connection and sounds like cool research we see in screen. Steven so you see grass roots and evolution program. Yes. OK, yeah. So that was that was yesterday. All of the press release was in July. But it's not it's not detailed in the book. But there we are. This is the. So in South Africa, there were the rate of unemployment is I think officially it's it's more than 30%."
"Unknown","01;33;38;19","01;34;19;28","But unofficially, it could be as high as 50%. And this is so they're now trying to address at least partly through this grass roots innovation problem program so one and there are similar and we know that but the book decades ago small is beautiful and Gandhi was before that was promoting this but it it's not scaling and so there are these in between industrial production there's just this ever increasing wasteland."
"Unknown","01;34;20;21","01;34;56;18","But efforts are going on around the world. The grass roots is a good term because it's just growing from evolving naturally as sounds like. Really interesting work. Thanks for sharing it, Stephen. Let Yeah, that ties in nicely. We were running a projects in South Africa, funny enough, and working on looking at how to create community driven innovation through strategic strategic conversations at the community level."
"Unknown","01;34;56;18","01;35;27;04","And there is there is an interesting difference between grass roots I think, and community driven. So I think that grass roots is often kind of tied to it's like the base level of the organizational structures. You often hear it with political campaigns and stuff is the grass roots. But those grass roots of the grass roots of a campaign where people sort of get into there, which is a little bit different to the kind of a community that is community driven scale."
"Unknown","01;35;27;04","01;35;54;22","And that comes back to this scaling question, which is the same thing that had the problems that the scaling is. Now, when you talk about scaling up and that's a big challenge is how the stuff gets scaled up and they often are talking as well about scaling out if you have a program or scaling deep. So you know some things might scale up because they go up to a higher level and then they basically get dropped down again."
"Unknown","01;35;55;20","01;36;39;02","But how do these things get scaled out? So there may be some I think you're you're you're tapping into a few multi-level issues, which I think are quite, quite important. So I wonder what your thoughts are about going to going into these kind of embedded local context to create new seeds. So to speak for like adaptability and innovation it's like a seed is a biological planting metaphor."
"Unknown","01;36;39;02","01;37;15;22","The scaffold is a highlighting the industrial components of a biological process, like you still need the tomato seed. So it's not saying it's not community driven, it's just like a soil metaphor, like how these communicate, what our vision is, and they really do matter. And so the really important points, actually. Here's a comment from Kevin in the chat who wrote, Is the scaffolding a schema or is this supposed to be anatomical that is is there some physiological analog in the human nervous systems or genome that corresponds to the scaffolding?"
"Unknown","01;37;15;22","01;37;38;23","I think Blum made an awesome point about the glia and about connective tissue being an immune tissue, being scaffolding physically for like this an option for cells and then the genome. Oh, yes, the chromatin scaffolding goes deep in a nuclear power structure and that's a whole cool area. And maybe there will be a day for transcription factor active inference soon enough."
"Unknown","01;37;47;00","01;38;59;25","So what you've seen in these hands, this is an organization active in Botswana and everything they're doing, the living room, you can see yeah. And what is home. So the yeah. So this is led by a Frobisher and he's applying design methods in communities in Southern Africa with great effect. And this is all that so the idea is that people all with their own hands developing innovations and as you say, can be scaled and so cool."
"Unknown","01;39;00;04","01;39;04;12","Yeah. Scaling. It's almost a grand scale."
"Unknown","01;39;06;15","01;40;00;05","So they're all so, for example, in in that part of Africa that there are many movements like many initiatives going on. But it would be very beneficial if there was a framing, a kind of unifying framing of what they're all doing, which can be seen as an alternative, an alternative form of socio economic development, rather than just as something that's well, fundamentally inferior to industrialize to to the conventional model of industry realization."
"Unknown","01;40;00;28","01;40;33;17","But so all suggestions are welcome I just put in the YouTube chat volume by Corporal Grissom and website developing scaffolds in evolution, culture and cognition. And so the paradigm change, as Stephen kind of hinted at very early, is like from systems where we eradicate the life to where we welcome to life and all that it brings. And we don't need to build that and we can't build it."
"Unknown","01;40;33;17","01;40;59;11","We're not going to be able to compose the lipids and the millions of years of fault tolerances into some sort of, you know, monster that helps our living systems. We don't even have to, though. We just have to build an engineered scaffold. And the scaffold can be radically different than what the final product looks like. The scaffold can even disintegrate if it's biodegradable."
"Unknown","01;41;00;03","01;41;46;24","So it it's a really interesting area that this discussion, which was like towards the engineering that makes us think of like foundries and some of the technical and precision processes tying them to some natural processes like this evolution, culture, cognition, volume does, and unifying frameworks, those together almost point the way towards engineering a scaffold, not a booster rocket or just a bunker, but bunkers might come into play of doing some scaffold design so that there could be reduction of expected free energy through deep time so pretty interesting point."
"Unknown","01;41;46;24","01;42;11;09","Stephen, thanks for sharing all these resources to blue. Just a quick comment. You were talking about the scaffolding disintegrating. Sometimes the scaffolding is designed to disintegrate, like I think about in in biological terms. We have like webbing between our fingers that enable like the growth of the digits. And then, you know, it's designed to be eroded in the developmental process."
"Unknown","01;42;11;17","01;42;53;26","So sometimes that's part of it or even like when you get a wound sealed, you know, you have like the stitches that scaffolds that form the scaffolding. So the healing process can occur, but they dissolve inside the wound mm. Actually that's a good that's quite cool to think about that as well in the processes and when, when we whether in areas that we live in or areas that we don't live in, when we plan to intervene are we planning to make something that sustains itself or are we planning to deliver or co-create a scaffold that is plans to disappear?"
"Unknown","01;42;54;16","01;44;04;25","Those are really different views on local and distal intervention. Stephen, with a scripture what's on the screen? C box? Yes. So now this is this is an initiative called Connected Hubs. So this this is coming from the Southern African Innovation Support Program. And the idea is to that there are hubs which support innovation and entrepreneurship. And these are this particular one is so as you can see, the connectivities here in this part of Africa and what they do is build capacities and support and connectivity."
"Unknown","01;44;07;13","01;45;01;16","So it's connecting different hubs together. And so a hub, it's just what that means. It's just that usually they've got a physical location and then a there are people you can contact there remotely and physically you've got can help with developing ideas through entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship. So this is something that's going on it's connecting hubs so maybe there is, wow, this is hopefully this is the intention is this persists after the Southern African Innovation Support Program is on the second phase."
"Unknown","01;45;01;16","01;45;57;00","Now, after it finishes so this is warm I suppose it's summed up in this diagram here, this idea that there are more and more hubs in and the European Commission is trying this African of a new treaty called hubs will see this, even though we don't. So this is kind of things that are going on. So I'm involved in this project sustainable network, digital innovation hubs."
"Unknown","01;45;58;04","01;46;43;04","So that's something that's coming down from the African Union and the your union. And the hope the aim is that this is a somewhat new way of facilitating socioeconomic development. And the idea is to try also catalytic effects by more connections and then more dynamism well, they're always welcome to come and talk about active inference at whatever stage in the last few minutes we'll just have Steven and then Blue and."
"Unknown","01;46;44;00","01;47;05;20","Yeah, just give kind of last. Yeah. A thought or question here as we close out. OK, yeah. Thanks. Very interesting. And I suppose with active influence, I think very interested in these these developments is actually how I ended up getting into this because I was trying to develop community based hubs in South Africa, funny enough, in rural will Maputo land."
"Unknown","01;47;06;24","01;47;26;27","And I think what's quite interesting as that was this this idea of a unifying framework rather than trying to reduce down all the complexity, which is what I was doing for far too many years is really amazing. And the other thing that all of these aspects that you're talking you just shared and it ties in with this lab is it's is about participation."
"Unknown","01;47;27;04","01;47;59;00","As soon as you bring in participatory processes, you you bring in these active influence dynamics, you bring in this complexity, you bring in this need. But also the ability to do what mass manufacturing can't do. But like I thought you said, it's seen as being inferior or in our culture and I think seen as being vital, but also challenging is really cool."
"Unknown","01;47;59;00","01;48;12;11","So I think that's something I'm going to take away because I can't I won't actually get to stay too much longer. I've got to jump on another call, but that's something I'd like to take away. So thanks very much. Brilliant. Really, really enjoy today. Thank you so much. Thank you, Stephen. See you later."
"Unknown","01;48;14;11","01;48;51;05","Blue So just a couple of final thoughts. John Boik and his idea of connected hubs. I mean, he was on like probably six different live streams and he gave a very good overview of sustainability and the, you know, how to build an architecture toward a sustainable future. So the connected hubs kind of reminded me of that. And then the one other thing was just about scaffolding and you know, how do we build kind of a scaffolding for our cognitive architecture?"
"Unknown","01;48;51;14","01;49;28;24","And is this a scaffolding that's maybe designed to dissolve and so I think about, you know, scaffolding for cognitive architecture as as education, right? Like we send the kids to K-12 and they form this like shared understanding of reality. And and two plus two was four and how to read books and so forth. And this kind of education, maybe Daniel will remember at least in college when I started college in biology, many things are so complicated that they just give you like a very broad overview that doesn't make sense or I was always searching for like, but that doesn't make sense."
"Unknown","01;49;28;24","01;49;57;02","But that doesn't make sense, like in your entry level classes. And then as you get like deeper and deeper into studying biology or biochemistry, you start to kind of understand electron transport and these different like things that are very like micro, but the macro level doesn't make sense without understanding that micro. And in my mind, this, this kind of educational or that way that I was taught in college was kind of like building a scaffold that was designed to disappear anyway."
"Unknown","01;49;58;24","01;50;22;14","But anyway, yeah, thanks for the for the talks today and for coming on those good if I can give my last comment and then to the author for the final comment. I just love this idea of the biochemistry education as the removable scaffold. Like you learn at once that there's the essential amino acids and then you never wonder, like why on the nutrition label is there essential and not essential?"
"Unknown","01;50;22;23","01;50;45;14","You forget the details, the side chains, you know, the C minus on the test that all disappears with something that's generalized, but otherwise we would look at macroscopic phenomena like, why can't I swim when there's this algae in the lake? Well, there's some molecular answer. We could know at least how to sense make in that area might even know the specific details."
"Unknown","01;50;45;22","01;51;16;12","But also it can be removed in a way. But can it be removed? Intergenerationally a chemistry to alchemy reversion with similar or different tools. That would be quite something. So Steven with the final notes, but just wanted to say thanks for coming on these streams. And it was just like super interesting discussions well, thank you very much. It was my pleasure."
"Unknown","01;51;16;22","01;51;37;16","And I look forward to further cooperation with you. Great. If you or any of your collaborators on these projects or your contacts in these hubs wanted to present on this or facilitate in any way, then we can talk another time."
"Unknown","01;51;41;03","01;51;45;08","Very good. Thank you very much. Thanks again, Steven. Thank you. Blue by."
