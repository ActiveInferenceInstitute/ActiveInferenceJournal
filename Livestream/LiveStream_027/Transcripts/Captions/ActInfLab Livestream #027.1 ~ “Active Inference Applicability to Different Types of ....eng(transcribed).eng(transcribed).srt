1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,480
all right

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,320
welcome everybody to the active

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,119
inference lab today it's active lab live

4
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,720
stream number 27.1 on august 24th 2021

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,960
welcome to the active inference lab we

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,439
are a participatory online lab that is

7
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,599
communicating learning and practicing

8
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,519
applied active inference you can find us

9
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,000
at the links here on this slide

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,160
this is recorded in an archived live

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,520
stream so please provide us with

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,200
feedback so that we can improve on our

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,320
work

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,920
all backgrounds and perspectives are

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,800
welcome here and we'll follow good video

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,640
etiquette for live streams so people can

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,039
just raise their hand in jitsi

18
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,640
if they want to speak at any time or

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,039
write a question in the live chat

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,719
this short link has a calendar of

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,960
upcoming live streams and today we're

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,000
here in 27.1 on the 24th

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,039
and in august 31st we'll follow up with

24
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,879
another discussion on this same paper

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,560
and then we haven't yet decided what to

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,240
read in the upcoming weeks so if you

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,400
want to come on and discuss

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,040
that would be cool

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,479
today in

30
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,360
active stream 27.1 our goal is to learn

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,479
and discuss this very cool paper active

32
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,159
inference applicability to different

33
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,320
types of social organization explained

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,840
through reference to industrial

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,759
engineering and quality management by

36
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,360
stephen fox

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,400
and uh we're gonna go anywhere we want

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,200
with the paper or questions and

39
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,040
we're really appreciative to have steven

40
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,000
here so that will be a cool discussion

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,520
let's uh

42
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,200
start with just introductions the

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,200
non-authors can say

44
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,720
what was interesting to them or what

45
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,640
kind of brought them to this discussion

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,880
and then it will be awesome to hear some

47
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,880
context on the paper that we can take

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,040
the discussion anywhere so i'm daniel

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,439
i'm a postdoc in california

50
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,880
and i'll pass it to dean

51
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,560
yeah good morning my name is dean i'm

52
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,119
i'm in calgary and uh

53
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,719
thing i found really interesting is that

54
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,399
this was the fastest turnaround time

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,959
between the 0.0 which is a bit of a

56
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,319
deconstruction

57
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,400
and now this point one which

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,000
is now going to be sort of put back

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,319
together or reconstructed today

60
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,680
and i just like the

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,000
the idea that the sort of the feedback

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,599
loop is really tight

63
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,440
so i'm really kind of

64
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,920
both curious and uh

65
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,640
happy that that the feedback uh

66
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,959
is such a quick turnaround and i'll pass

67
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,319
it over to stephen sillett

68
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,280
oh thank you dean yeah um yeah i'm just

69
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,360
really intrigued i'm very excited to

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,800
hear more

71
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,319
questions about

72
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,000
how active inference fits in at the

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,599
larger social and applied scales and i

74
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,599
know a lot of us here it's kind of a bit

75
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,800
of our thing

76
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,239
is how does this get applied in

77
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,800
different contexts so uh yeah thanks

78
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,200
awesome agreed about the whiplash dot

79
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,239
zero

80
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,480
so stephen welcome please introduce

81
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,239
yourself and then maybe give us some

82
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,720
context

83
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,040
hello everybody so my name's stephen fox

84
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,360
i'm a principal scientist

85
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,280
at the technical research center of

86
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,840
finland

87
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,480
and my background is i left school when

88
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,040
i was 16 i was an apprentice

89
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,080
and

90
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
did that

91
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,680
my craftsman master craftsman did manual

92
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,239
work for 10 years

93
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,000
and then when i was working full time in

94
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,680
industry i got a phd in engineering

95
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,840
design

96
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,720
and subsequently i've got a doctor of

97
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,680
science degree in production engineering

98
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,799
and i came across

99
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,080
um

100
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,239
active inference

101
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,760
and i thought it looked pretty

102
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,480
straightforward and useful

103
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,000
but then i started reading some

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,879
scientific papers about it

105
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,360
and it became more and more difficult to

106
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,280
understand

107
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
at least for me

108
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,480
so i thought the only way to resolve

109
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,200
this was if i

110
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,918
wrote a paper about it and sent it off

111
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,639
to peer review

112
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,440
so three iterations and five thousand

113
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,479
words of critique later

114
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,800
it was published in

115
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,919
the paper that you've read

116
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,759
okay awesome i have a few thoughts on

117
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,600
that and then anyone can raise their

118
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,479
hand

119
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,600
so

120
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,120
one piece was that getting more

121
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,120
difficult to understand active inference

122
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,120
as you went along what

123
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,680
dimension was that you know like what

124
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,600
made you feel that way and is that

125
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,199
different than other areas that you

126
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,800
learned about

127
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,160
um well the scientific papers

128
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,639
about

129
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,520
on the topic they are

130
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,080
they're addressing particular audiences

131
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,000
aren't they

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,600
and so for example some papers

133
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,840
are

134
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,240
addressing computer scientists

135
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,759
who are using

136
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,400
established

137
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,240
machine learning

138
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,759
paradigms

139
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,039
so the paper is directed to them and i

140
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,880
guess the papers are sort of

141
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,520
responses to criticisms

142
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,880
that come from that audience

143
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,520
so if a reader's not a member of that

144
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,360
audience

145
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,600
it um

146
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,479
it's not clear

147
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,199
what it's about so i think the core idea

148
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,240
is uh straightforward enough

149
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,600
but

150
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,240
so it's sort of like this the

151
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,000
like the relationship

152
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,800
to

153
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,479
between

154
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,000
thermodynamic

155
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,120
entropy

156
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,199
and information entropy

157
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,440
the the so this is beyond the act of

158
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,000
inference literature the basic idea is

159
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,319
simply enough but of course

160
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,680
if you read a scientific paper about it

161
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,319
the scientific paper about it is about

162
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,720
some

163
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,360
particular issue there

164
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,840
when it's supplied in a very particular

165
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,199
um

166
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,520
for a very particular purpose

167
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,319
so

168
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,080
i think i understand that the

169
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,240
relationship between thermodynamic

170
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,440
entropy and information entropy but if i

171
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,720
read any scientific paper about it

172
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
i at least can become

173
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,240
baffled

174
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,440
because it's a very focused issue and of

175
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,599
course in in scientific literature you

176
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,639
need to go beyond the state of the art

177
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,599
so i think that's the thing that

178
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,039
and i asked

179
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,960
a colleague of mine who uh

180
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,560
to to look into the literature as well

181
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,730
and he um

182
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,080
[Music]

183
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,120
he was

184
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,919
baffled enough to decline in my

185
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,120
invitation

186
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,319
complete with a funding possibility

187
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,390
to carry on looking into it so

188
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,440
[Music]

189
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
dean thanks for sharing that stephen so

190
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,840
dean go for it and then anyone else with

191
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,280
a question

192
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,680
yeah stephen i was just curious so

193
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,840
you you're kind of alluding to

194
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,639
who's in the room that that you know

195
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,720
who's the audience thing and i'm curious

196
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,319
because you

197
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,370
you

198
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,560
[Music]

199
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,080
sort of understand yourself as being a

200
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,319
bit of a craftsman and a bit of an

201
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,120
artisan so

202
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,840
do you think the paper has

203
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,680
a ready audience or do you think your

204
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,919
your paper can act as as an attractor

205
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,919
state because we're talking about active

206
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,160
inference

207
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,720
um my own my own paper that you've been

208
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,479
reading yeah um well well i think um

209
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,560
well

210
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,520
the first thing is

211
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,000
now it's clear to me

212
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,520
so uh

213
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,680
and also it turned out i didn't know

214
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,919
until it was published that the academic

215
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,039
editor's professor fristen

216
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,360
so at least it's clear to me

217
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,879
what it is

218
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,159
in what

219
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,679
i'm doing

220
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,880
and so i can apply it so for example

221
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,760
i've put it into a proposal

222
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,679
that's currently under review and

223
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,919
hopefully get some funding

224
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,399
and then

225
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,880
if it's

226
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,839
of

227
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,839
use to others then that's good

228
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,200
would be uh

229
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,800
and i i've had one person who's uh

230
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,399
read it

231
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,959
very thoroughly and said it was he said

232
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,880
it was a great help to him

233
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,320
and he wished he

234
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,120
this paper had existed

235
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,360
three years ago because it would have

236
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,680
saved him so much trouble of

237
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,519
going on the treasure hunt through the

238
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,720
literature

239
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,600
so that's uh that gentleman is in in the

240
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,760
world of business

241
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,320
so he also had been on this treasure

242
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,399
hunt through the literature

243
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,959
finding a sentence here and a sentence

244
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,640
there that he could

245
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,600
sort of

246
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,279
put together and

247
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,920
think well do i understand this don't i

248
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,920
understand it

249
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,160
so yeah hopefully it's of help to others

250
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,160
but it's not i mean i don't think

251
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
there's a big there's not a big audience

252
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,959
for this i don't think

253
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,200
it's a niche

254
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,560
it'll always be

255
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,920
a niche

256
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,399
um and it makes me think about how the

257
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,160
development of this niche and the

258
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,920
community dynamics within it have been

259
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,040
different than maybe other fields like

260
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,120
what you said again about getting more

261
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,279
difficult or perceiving the the

262
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,040
implications or the difficulty to be

263
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,600
higher than when you initially jumped in

264
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,839
first off is a is a meta learning

265
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,760
characteristic you're updating your

266
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,000
uncertainty or your scope or the

267
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,120
policies that you're going to have to

268
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,360
take as you explore the space

269
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,079
and then there's um something about this

270
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,680
field that

271
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,160
impels a lot of people to

272
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,800
learn theory and to explore applications

273
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,399
whereas

274
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,839
i don't know other related fields

275
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,839
sometimes like you said they're either

276
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,079
framed as a technical debate like people

277
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,680
have shown this relationship under this

278
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,279
condition here we show up for this other

279
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,079
condition and then that's a bit too

280
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,880
abstracted away from uh meaning for many

281
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,279
people or it's just in some corner of

282
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,480
the literature

283
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,720
um or just sort of it remains at a

284
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,160
qualitative

285
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,839
sort of okay cool cybernetics like goal

286
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,200
orientation and then it can veer off and

287
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,720
maybe get disconnected from some of the

288
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,079
formalisms

289
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,839
and so you mentioned the core of active

290
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,600
inference or that now you have a clearer

291
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,800
sense of it so what did you initially or

292
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,640
what is your more refined sense of what

293
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,199
that is now

294
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,800
um

295
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,199
so

296
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,880
well

297
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,720
illumination came to me when i read

298
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,800
a paper

299
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,720
i think it's an uncertainty and stress

300
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,560
and it says um a professor fristen's one

301
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,519
of the the authors

302
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,720
and it says that free energy

303
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,120
something like this the free energy

304
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,760
is the information that somebody is

305
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,760
lacking

306
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,199
to make their internal model

307
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,560
match

308
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,800
reality

309
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,959
and of course we know then we could be

310
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,399
discussing

311
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,560
forever and a day about what reality is

312
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,000
but

313
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,480
i thought that was a so on the treasure

314
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,720
hunt

315
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,200
that's uh a sparkling jewel of

316
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,320
information because i thought okay so ah

317
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,040
so it's an information gap

318
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,800
it's an info what we're talking about is

319
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,040
the information gap

320
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,880
between the internal generative model

321
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,800
and

322
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,839
the external state

323
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,160
and

324
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,519
what the uh and this variational free

325
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,600
energy because of course our

326
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,839
internal state keeps changing

327
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,639
and the external state of the world

328
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,320
keeps changing

329
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,639
whether we want it to or not

330
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,560
so

331
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,320
as we try to

332
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,120
uh and as actions haven't the actions

333
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,880
we're gonna take we haven't taken them

334
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,079
yet

335
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,200
so

336
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,600
we seek to reduce expected free energy

337
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,959
over a series of actions

338
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,880
and so to me what what is that mean it

339
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,200
means we we seek

340
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,240
to reduce the information gap

341
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,360
between

342
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,880
our internal generative model of the

343
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,000
world

344
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,839
and the world um

345
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,519
which we are in

346
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,160
that we're in

347
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,000
um

348
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,440
so

349
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,360
and then active inferences well how do

350
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,440
we do that we can the actions we can

351
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,199
take we can either

352
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,560
we can change what we pay attention to

353
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,160
that's an action

354
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,320
or we can take action in the world

355
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,760
to change uh the sensory inputs

356
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,760
so that's it

357
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,800
so

358
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,880
and if

359
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,850
so if

360
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,600
[Music]

361
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,880
now this

362
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,800
reducing the information gap

363
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,680
i'm as you'll notice in the paper i'm

364
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,040
using this term unwanted surprise

365
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,440
so surprise all is the difference

366
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,000
between

367
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,519
what we are predicting and then the

368
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,480
sensory input and

369
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,279
the world itself

370
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,480
so

371
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,959
these things can be

372
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,639
for example

373
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,000
in

374
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,079
consumer culture

375
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,560
survival may mean

376
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,519
selecting the right

377
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,720
garb and accessories so one can survive

378
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,560
in a social group and

379
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,959
prosper in there maintain one social

380
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,920
capital so if we're in the if we're in

381
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,760
the rich world

382
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,079
survival can be at that level

383
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,399
but if we're in the uh

384
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,800
other parts of the world survival can be

385
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,320
the difference between literally between

386
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,279
energy output and energy input

387
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,279
over the course of a week and you

388
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,199
literally might not survive if you don't

389
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,680
get that right

390
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,360
so does that make sense

391
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,759
very interesting description

392
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,959
just to kind of trace out the um order

393
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,720
that you brought up a few

394
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,480
the variance of free energy in so you

395
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,279
you

396
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,279
framed it as being free energy is the

397
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,959
information gap

398
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,360
between the internal generative model

399
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,160
and then the external states dynamics so

400
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,839
that makes me think about like trading

401
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,680
like if you knew

402
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,360
what the shape of the

403
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,720
stock or the crypto is going to look

404
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,800
like you could trade perfectly and then

405
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,639
for other situations it's also like if

406
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,920
you knew perfectly what was going to

407
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,959
happen you could act perfectly you could

408
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,680
steer your ship so that given the exact

409
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,759
wind distribution you are always like

410
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,320
navigating at the fastest possible

411
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,759
uh rate

412
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,399
but that is kind of an intractable

413
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,880
calculation to make

414
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,759
due to for other reasons um the internal

415
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,079
and external states changing

416
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,079
and that's leading us to the variational

417
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,600
free energy

418
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,759
and then that is a statistical

419
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,519
calculation conditioned on action which

420
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,680
leads us to the expected free energy

421
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,800
which is seeking to minimize free energy

422
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,240
indirectly through

423
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,480
expected free energy directly

424
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,560
and then you pointed out that there was

425
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,959
this capacity to change attention

426
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,240
and to change

427
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,800
sensory states through action so i think

428
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,120
that was a very succinct uh

429
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,560
run-through of a lot of the active

430
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,800
inference things dinner stephen what did

431
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,600
that make you think about

432
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,120
well when i'm done

433
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,839
could i just could i just read could i

434
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,919
just read exactly what it says in the

435
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,520
paper yeah uncertain to interest it says

436
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,039
free energy

437
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,839
can be regarded as the information a

438
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,559
person is lacking

439
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,559
and which uh

440
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,359
he strokes she could use

441
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,480
to make

442
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,959
his her internal model

443
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,720
as close

444
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,919
as to reality

445
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,679
and the authors of this paper

446
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,919
uh

447
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,520
then these are

448
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,520
so there's professor frison but the

449
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,679
other authors are being doing resurgence

450
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,400
right

451
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,640
so there's a bruce mcewen and carl

452
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,080
fristen

453
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,320
it's called stressing

454
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,960
stress and uncertainty okay why it

455
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,679
causes diseases and how it is mastered

456
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,840
by the brain

457
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,760
and it's published in

458
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,400
progress in neurobiology got it thank

459
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,559
you

460
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,840
cool

461
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,240
so that was the paper that kind of gave

462
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,600
you the insight into the of

463
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,240
free energy

464
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,559
yes where where's the chat here i can

465
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,360
send you the link in the chat

466
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,679
um it's on the bottom left or you can

467
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,520
email it afterwards and we'll add it to

468
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,679
the youtube uh description

469
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,160
so cool

470
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,440
uh

471
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,840
dean what were you um

472
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,559
uh gonna say um on that

473
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,080
no i'm just gonna ask i was just gonna

474
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,799
ask uh stephen

475
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,960
so when i was going through the paper

476
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,400
until i got

477
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,360
i don't know probably 80 in and started

478
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,960
seeing the references that you made to

479
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,360
the to the wayfinding aspect in the in

480
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,440
the exploration piece prior to that

481
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,120
there was a lot of

482
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,360
there was a lot of attention given over

483
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,200
to the precision piece

484
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,640
around the free energy principle and

485
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,760
what i was

486
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,440
one of the things that i commented yet

487
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,520
in the two-point 27-0 was

488
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,520
if we're talking about

489
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,600
active inference we're we're

490
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,360
we're basically talking about two things

491
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,880
at once we're talking about precision

492
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,640
and we're also talking

493
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,200
about provisioning and i think my

494
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
my simple metaphor is are we talking

495
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,080
about a hand that fits into a glove or

496
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,600
are we talking about the provisioning

497
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,039
piece which is

498
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,200
how many different gloves

499
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,440
have we provisioned in terms of the

500
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,320
context that the hand might find itself

501
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,440
in

502
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
cold weather water

503
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,080
forging a piece of hot iron or whatever

504
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,000
and and so what i was

505
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,840
what i was curious about was in terms of

506
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,360
the social organization in the

507
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,160
industrial engineering piece

508
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,440
how the

509
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,960
how the provisioning and the precision

510
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,039
coincide with one another in terms of

511
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,159
what you

512
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,760
are thinking now post hoc writing this

513
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,158
paper

514
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,679
can i

515
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,720
can i share my screen somehow yes

516
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,840
let me um unshare these slides so on the

517
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,400
bottom left the middle button

518
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,120
share your screen and then i'll make it

519
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,440
um like full screen so you can make it

520
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,520
look however you want on your site

521
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,159
[Music]

522
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,559
sure

523
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,320
all right

524
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,640
okay can you see him yeah hit the hide

525
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,880
on jitsi where it says

526
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,600
uh hide the sharing your screen

527
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,760
and then um yeah i can make that full

528
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,320
screen so thanks

529
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,000
so you see a diagram yep figure one

530
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,159
okay so

531
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,320
why there's so much

532
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,360
um

533
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,000
emphasis

534
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,720
on what's going on in uh

535
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,520
down here in make to stock and assemble

536
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,520
towards

537
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,000
is because

538
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,480
what i was trying to do was get a

539
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,200
an anchoring

540
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,080
so

541
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,159
okay in

542
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,440
here

543
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,840
in where where there's um

544
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,919
mass production and mass customization

545
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,559
where there's a great deal of refinement

546
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,679
of what is offered through many rapid

547
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,679
iterations

548
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,600
but then there's something

549
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,679
that's fixed that

550
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,600
okay there are there are a lot of

551
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,520
activities like this in the world and

552
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,360
the diagram

553
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,840
about the quality

554
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,480
process

555
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,360
so this is in in a way this is as if we

556
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,679
think about it every evolution

557
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,559
like the toyota corolla

558
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,400
is a highly evolved species

559
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,120
compared to um

560
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,840
if we make uh

561
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,919
if we make a vehicle ourselves from

562
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,120
scrap

563
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,640
so i don't know it's been in the news

564
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,159
there but a teenage teenager in india

565
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,799
has made a tuk-tuk out of scrap

566
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,840
solar powered as well

567
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,880
so then

568
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,520
that's a

569
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,400
it's not highly evolved it's the first

570
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,880
prototype working prototype

571
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,000
and then these things up here this uh

572
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,400
top engineer to order

573
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,039
the initial situated entropy

574
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,520
is

575
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,600
much higher and the barriers to

576
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,720
information gain are much higher

577
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,760
so

578
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,440
as the diagram you're looking at just

579
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,880
changed

580
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,919
yeah

581
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:06,720
okay

582
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,200
so this is from another so that that

583
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,559
diagram i just showed a minute ago

584
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,000
that's from another one of my papers in

585
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,280
entropy and this is from another one

586
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,440
so what's going on is is that um

587
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,799
if so with uh

588
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,720
diy

589
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,679
dude

590
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,360
do i do it with others prosumption

591
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,679
uh massive engineering

592
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,559
but we it begins with a just an idea in

593
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,280
our

594
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,080
in our minds

595
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,760
and we may

596
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,960
begin at the level of uh i think this in

597
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,000
the video did you show a carved piece

598
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,480
so it might be you've got a

599
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,640
a tree stump in your back garden or you

600
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,640
might have a tree and start down there

601
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,320
raw materials and you might

602
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,000
shape it and then there can be this

603
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,480
phenomena that well

604
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,200
there's a dialoguing between

605
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,760
the human doing the shaping

606
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,240
and the piece of wood itself because the

607
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,320
piece of wood has got its own properties

608
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,279
and

609
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,000
you're not going to get a

610
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,320
an aesthetically pleasing carving if you

611
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,200
chisel against the grain right so so the

612
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,159
grain that has been shaped

613
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,080
through perhaps hundreds of years some

614
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,120
of the trees there in california

615
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,159
um

616
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,080
so there's a dialoguing

617
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,360
between the

618
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,640
the human

619
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,559
doing the shaping

620
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,039
and the the piece of wood itself

621
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,760
shaping what the human does

622
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,240
but then more

623
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,960
from an industrial point of view

624
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,520
uh if um

625
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,799
anything

626
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,559
that is bespoke

627
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,600
so the term apparel is more inner

628
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,440
the term bespoke is more appropriate in

629
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,679
apparel than um

630
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,279
engineer to order so bespoke is short

631
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,600
for bespoken for

632
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,520
and it meant be spoken for by an

633
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,640
individual

634
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,880
so the materials that were to be used

635
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,840
would be spoken for by an individual

636
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,640
and in today

637
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,320
what happens with bespoke is that

638
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,000
there'd be cloth

639
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,799
so that's a formed material

640
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,159
parts buttons

641
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,200
and

642
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,400
then

643
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,840
suppose it's show business or

644
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,760
suppose that elton john in his most

645
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,400
flamboyant days had an idea in his mind

646
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,159
for a new uh costume

647
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,000
it would be a preliminary idea

648
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,919
there'd be iterations of sketching

649
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,679
and uh doing some mock-ups maybe and

650
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,919
looking at the fabrics and they'd do it

651
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,600
and then maybe we get to quite an

652
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,279
advanced stage of the fitting and he'd

653
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,640
decide that

654
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,440
he'd look at it and think i don't like

655
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,279
this actually and completely change his

656
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,840
mind and they do something else

657
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,520
and then with engineer to order

658
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,919
that could be for example uh the late

659
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,919
steve jobs is yacht

660
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,200
so he might have an idea in his mind

661
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,320
about uh what it might be what it might

662
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,679
look like

663
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,880
and then the the ship builders

664
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,679
they're going to try and get as far up

665
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,159
the bill of materials as they can

666
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,679
so they're going to try to use the um

667
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,840
the cabin modules

668
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,640
that they've used on other ships

669
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,799
or at the very least to use the uh

670
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:47,200
the 3d digital models that they've got

671
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:48,960
so

672
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,279
what's in the paper

673
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,799
it's really

674
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,158
around this um

675
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,799
it's it's down here

676
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,720
because then

677
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,000
that's the

678
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,600
so rather so to start with something

679
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,400
that's quite a concrete

680
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,440
and highly transferable

681
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,480
before

682
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,720
then as i do later in the manuscript in

683
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,919
the paper

684
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:24,880
um

685
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,120
getting into the project

686
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,399
processes

687
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:29,520
and

688
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,880
the way finding and so on

689
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,960
does that answer the question

690
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,039
can i just do a quick follow-up just so

691
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,840
it's clear in my mind um

692
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,840
so what i'm seeing here what you put up

693
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,600
on the screen is

694
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,520
and i don't i don't i want to be

695
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,360
corrected if i if i haven't got this

696
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,640
right is i see that i see

697
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,919
ways of laying out a a fabrication

698
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,200
series

699
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
and i guess what i was wondering is more

700
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
on a philosophical level

701
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,919
as you're transferring from idea to

702
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:02,810
fabrication

703
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,640
[Music]

704
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,440
how do we use active inference there

705
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,960
how do we

706
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,799
turn the idea

707
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,799
and translate it into this

708
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,279
fabrication exercise is there

709
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,559
is it a is it

710
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,880
is it a planning effort is it a

711
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,320
is it a

712
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,080
getting our ideas

713
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,679
plural provisioned is it about

714
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:26,320
propositioning

715
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,440
the the garment maker before they

716
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,399
they go on to to do the construction is

717
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:33,760
it

718
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,159
you know i i i what i'm trying to do is

719
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,200
get in my head clear

720
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,039
what your focus was on because i could i

721
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,679
can tell now already

722
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,480
40 minutes into our conversation today

723
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,840
that

724
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,200
there was much more you could have

725
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,279
written about but i'm i'm sure basically

726
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,120
what you wanted to do was

727
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,000
was

728
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,360
get one

729
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,919
one thing clear in terms of this paper

730
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,799
but that for for people like me

731
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,799
that opens up a whole pandora's box so i

732
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,120
just want to be in my mind

733
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,279
certain that

734
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,520
the focus here is about the fabrication

735
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,399
piece

736
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,240
and not the stuff that comes before the

737
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,480
fabrication piece of my

738
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,760
am i leaning in the right direction

739
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,520
seems like he silently left actually

740
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,000
oh no sorry oh no

741
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,919
i was on mute oh continue then

742
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,919
yes

743
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,600
um

744
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,039
yeah so in the in the paper itself

745
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,720
um i think i'm using the term

746
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,039
it's mass production and project

747
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,520
production is it yeah

748
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,720
so

749
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,480
in

750
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,240
so yes other

751
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,720
the focus

752
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,200
on the paper of the paper is on this

753
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,200
mass production

754
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,480
to just to try to

755
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,120
what's the word i'm looking for i can't

756
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,799
think of anything better but just just

757
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,320
just to

758
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,200
sort that out just say okay

759
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,559
so

760
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,039
that's what happens in mass production

761
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,760
and here are these diagrams and these

762
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,799
explanations here and there's the the um

763
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,279
statistical process control charts and

764
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,880
things like that

765
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,120
that's what goes on there that's settled

766
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,080
now

767
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,840
we move on

768
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,520
to these project the project production

769
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,600
and why i'm focusing on physical

770
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,919
production is because

771
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,440
it's then

772
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,430
it's tied into um

773
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,880
[Music]

774
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,159
action

775
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,080
it's the there's a clear link between

776
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,760
action and energy

777
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,000
and of course energies in this is a

778
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,880
finite supply of it

779
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,880
uh for individuals and organizations

780
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,960
so

781
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,519
the mass production stuff

782
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,720
is to provide the

783
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,640
the platform

784
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,120
to go into more challenging areas

785
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,159
am i answering your question dean

786
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,519
yeah

787
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,279
tangential rambling

788
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,480
no no no no

789
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,760
like

790
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,519
it i guess it depends on how much you

791
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,000
desire decide to zoom out

792
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,960
um and so i i just want to be clear in

793
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,480
my head

794
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,080
what the focus is on because there is

795
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,600
absolutely active inference in

796
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,600
fabrication and manufacturing i have no

797
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,000
no quarrel with that whatsoever i just

798
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
want to be able to make sure that i

799
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,120
don't

800
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,200
overextend what i think is the act of

801
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,240
inference

802
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,919
potential

803
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,679
because as ever said when i was reading

804
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,760
the paper

805
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,519
where it got exciting for me was that

806
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,519
whole exploration

807
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,200
beyond the precision and on to the

808
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,399
provisioning or provisionings part so

809
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,760
thank you yes you

810
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,879
you cleared that up for me

811
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,159
awesome

812
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,440
uh

813
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,840
how about stephen with ray's hand and

814
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,639
then anyone else

815
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,640
yeah thank you um

816
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,279
i i'm i'm looking at this here and i see

817
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,159
some interesting um ways that you're

818
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,559
engaging

819
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,880
free energy in relation to

820
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,200
active inference because often we we

821
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,279
might see mathematical models

822
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,600
and then philosophical arguments and i

823
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,399
sense that this mid-round which may be

824
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,399
where a lot of the applied work happens

825
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,880
at scale is is heuristic

826
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,000
based

827
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,399
or principles based to sort of get a

828
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,480
sense of how to navigate

829
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,440
um

830
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,000
and may not be directly modelable

831
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,640
because there's so many dimensions so

832
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,480
that's kind of interesting so i wonder

833
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,080
you know where where people are talking

834
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,039
there about situated entropy or

835
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,720
the the the

836
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,919
um

837
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,000
it's it's a potential

838
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,279
um

839
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,600
so i'm wondering how you how you think

840
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,360
about the heuristic and how you think

841
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,320
about

842
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,559
um

843
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,679
how much someone could model this type

844
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,919
of thing or how much it's about

845
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,679
modelling and if so what type of

846
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:38,960
modeling

847
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,200
might be useful

848
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,159
in organizational industry contexts

849
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,159
um

850
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,360
well i think at the end of the the paper

851
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,799
i i raised this question i think about

852
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:55,919
um

853
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,279
well

854
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,679
there's uh

855
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,679
there's maths

856
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,880
and then there's modeling

857
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,120
and then there's uh

858
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,440
simple rules

859
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,800
and so in engineering design

860
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,000
uh

861
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
and not just engineering design uh

862
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,839
simple rules can be extremely

863
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:23,520
so designed for manufacturing assembly

864
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,159
the application of that has led to

865
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,639
90 reductions

866
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,719
in the assembly times of many products

867
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,320
so

868
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,199
you could

869
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,560
you could have just

870
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,480
kept modeling the

871
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,800
the former process

872
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,399
as people did

873
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,199
for

874
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,639
for many years with ever more

875
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,320
sophisticated

876
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,839
mathematical models and simulation tools

877
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,520
but it still

878
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,040
still wasn't very good

879
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,560
or you could just apply some simple

880
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,240
rules reduce assembly time by 90 percent

881
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,280
and then

882
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,640
well then it's a lot better isn't it so

883
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,680
i'm

884
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,960
i sat um in one of the uh

885
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,560
the meetings that um

886
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,280
professor fristen and

887
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,640
maxwell

888
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,920
ramstad i think we're

889
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,700
going through professors fristen's book

890
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,850
[Music]

891
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,640
the monograph the name of which escapes

892
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,640
me now a free energy principle for a

893
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,640
particular physics

894
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,520
yes

895
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,480
so

896
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,119
professor fristen and thomas parr were

897
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,240
in

898
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,480
discussion with

899
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,960
is it michael

900
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,880
bail who's

901
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,800
uh he works for a japanese ai firm uh

902
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,400
martin deal

903
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,240
yes money bill yeah

904
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,720
and um

905
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,760
at least one colleague of

906
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,359
martins

907
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,960
and they were discussing amongst

908
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,720
themselves

909
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,640
and

910
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,560
i don't think as far as i could tell

911
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,040
they weren't able to get

912
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,880
an intercepted

913
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,760
understanding between themselves even

914
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,640
and martin's published a paper

915
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,560
in entropy

916
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,200
where he's contesting some of the maths

917
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,359
and

918
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,359
so

919
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,400
my view is that

920
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,560
of course things develop and they have

921
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,800
to start somewhere and

922
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,839
no doubt that will lead to good things

923
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,920
but it would the more people that can

924
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,440
understand something the more likely it

925
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,640
is

926
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,160
that

927
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,720
opportunities for its development

928
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,760
and flaws in its current um

929
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,280
framing

930
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,400
can be identified

931
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,160
and progressed

932
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,440
so

933
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,440
i'm and i've sent him my email this

934
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,920
morning this quote from einstein didn't

935
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,119
know

936
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:03,920
from

937
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,839
from geometry and experience that

938
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:08,720
uh

939
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,959
what do you have it there now um

940
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,119
look at that quote from al einstein

941
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,680
it was in my email um i can look it up

942
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,760
in just one second but right now just on

943
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,720
the screen was the um guest stream

944
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,400
with martin

945
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,760
and so

946
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,560
totally agreed really fascinating there

947
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,079
um okay

948
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:32,960
so

949
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,800
answer the question i'm

950
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,400
i see of course there's

951
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,320
there's a place for maths there's a

952
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,960
place for computer simulation

953
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,160
but if so if we go for

954
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,000
so it may be

955
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,240
that some are engaged in positivistic

956
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,280
research

957
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,200
and they're they're seeking to establish

958
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,839
a correspondence truth

959
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:56,960
and others

960
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,240
you know anti-positivists interpretives

961
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,599
they are

962
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,040
engaged in

963
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,839
looking for constructivist truth

964
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,599
and what i'm doing is i suppose

965
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,480
it's critical realist pragmatic truth

966
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,520
so if it works it's true

967
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,400
so

968
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,200
what i'm doing is well

969
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
it's probably a bit rough

970
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,200
but maybe it's good enough to get

971
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,919
something done

972
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,599
yep very

973
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,520
interesting um

974
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,720
one

975
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,240
question i had was

976
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,440
you talked about that kind of

977
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,160
co-evolution with the iterations whether

978
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,040
it's the the craftsperson working with a

979
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,680
raw material with its imperfections or

980
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,599
its characteristics

981
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:46,960
and then all the way up to this more

982
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,560
social form which is like uh elton john

983
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,560
and the costume designers in in that

984
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,720
feedback so whether it's just

985
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,520
hands on object like drawing or whether

986
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,359
it's it's more extended to include all

987
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,119
these other aspects

988
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,320
how do we

989
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,280
hold space for that versioning and

990
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,440
co-evolving process

991
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,440
and for the material to allow it to

992
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,480
reveal its characteristics while also

993
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,760
having effective supply chains

994
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,599
you know that can make cpus and that

995
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,720
deliver

996
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,880
high precision materials

997
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,160
because it just sounded like you had

998
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,000
experience on on both sides with the

999
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,480
industrial engineering as well as the

1000
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,839
craft and artists inside

1001
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,000
yes so um

1002
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,040
well

1003
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,079
with uh

1004
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,520
automated engineering tools yeah as you

1005
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,160
i'm sure you know there are these

1006
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,240
communities um

1007
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,560
of makers

1008
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,480
and uh

1009
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,880
where people are sharing

1010
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,040
is instructable still going

1011
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,079
as a

1012
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,800
online community of giving instructions

1013
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,200
for projects and things so

1014
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,240
so one

1015
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,480
one big

1016
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,000
challenge

1017
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,720
is that it's skill so manual skill

1018
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,800
so if

1019
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,160
if

1020
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,040
work like carving

1021
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,800
it depends upon um

1022
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,359
quite a lot of manual skill to get a

1023
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,000
reasonable looking carving that

1024
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,280
somebody might be happy with

1025
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,319
um

1026
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,160
but if

1027
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,920
you're going to make something if you're

1028
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,400
going to 3d print something

1029
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,440
then

1030
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,280
the

1031
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,760
the manual skill required isn't so

1032
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:48,000
so high and that can be communicated

1033
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,400
so some of the uh work that i've been

1034
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,280
doing is in this virtual social physical

1035
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,599
convergence

1036
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,100
but

1037
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,680
[Music]

1038
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,839
through virtual technology

1039
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:04,799
you can share socially skill knowledge

1040
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,319
in doing physical work

1041
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,480
and

1042
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,960
if also um

1043
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,200
do you know the open ecology

1044
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,440
movement where there are engineering

1045
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,480
designs uh freely available

1046
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,240
on the internet

1047
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,560
so through virtual social physical

1048
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,359
convergence

1049
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,119
there's great potential to enabling more

1050
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,400
people

1051
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,000
to

1052
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,319
produce what they consume to become

1053
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,200
prosumers

1054
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,680
and as gandhi i paraphrase gandhi now he

1055
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,160
said prosperity can't come from mass

1056
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,599
production

1057
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,480
it can only come by from production by

1058
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,119
the masses

1059
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,200
interesting answer

1060
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,920
reminds me a lot of bucky fuller trying

1061
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,480
to pivot the supply chain from weaponry

1062
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,280
to livingry mass producing the aluminum

1063
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,760
sheets for housing but that was

1064
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,720
kind of

1065
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,359
only potentially a transient step

1066
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,400
in this supply chain in production and

1067
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,319
then eventually knowledge reimagining

1068
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,280
will we all have a silicon foundry in

1069
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,319
our house

1070
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,079
probably not

1071
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,160
could we all have

1072
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,119
a compost bin or could we all have

1073
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,040
a sewing kit

1074
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,119
that's something that's a totally

1075
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,440
different type of

1076
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,560
artifact so it can be

1077
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,640
mapped differently

1078
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,599
dean and then anyone else or any

1079
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,319
questions in live chat

1080
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,319
well i don't want to go off into into

1081
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,640
the woods here but i was curious uh

1082
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,760
stephen if

1083
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,599
if you've ever read any of this stuff

1084
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:54,880
from

1085
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,359
matthew crawford

1086
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:58,480
in particular

1087
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,560
um

1088
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,160
shopkraft title and then the other one

1089
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:02,800
is

1090
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,319
the world beyond your head and the

1091
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,960
reason why i'm asking is because in that

1092
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,200
in that second book which is one of my

1093
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,359
favorites he

1094
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,359
he talks about all of the distractions

1095
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,839
in the world that cause us to not be

1096
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,760
able to be focused

1097
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,760
and precise and do

1098
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,560
the the crafting never mind being able

1099
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,079
to do the

1100
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,200
the uh

1101
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,960
indus you know projection at an

1102
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,560
industrial scale

1103
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,280
and so i just i was just curious if

1104
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,160
if maybe there was um

1105
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,079
maybe that author was maybe whispering

1106
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,520
in your ear when you were putting this

1107
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,359
together because

1108
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:40,720
if you whether you're whether you're

1109
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,160
carving something out of a piece of wood

1110
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,079
and having a dialogue with it which i

1111
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,560
completely agree with or

1112
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,359
you're just making sure that there's no

1113
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,040
bugs in the

1114
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,319
in the command software for the for the

1115
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,000
making of the copies

1116
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,200
it's still an ability to

1117
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,200
be able to use things like active he

1118
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,119
wrote he wrote the beyond your head book

1119
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,119
in 2014 so i don't think he was

1120
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,720
looking at active inference but i think

1121
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,760
that

1122
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,240
how that is employed

1123
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,480
can sometimes be

1124
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,079
perceived as

1125
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,920
just the right amount of being able to

1126
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,000
give attention over to something and

1127
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,839
still remain open to

1128
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,520
possibility so i was just wondering if

1129
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,520
that was something

1130
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,680
that may have been uh

1131
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,359
adding some color to what you were doing

1132
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,520
here

1133
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,319
no i had not heard of that before

1134
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,160
but i shall i shall look into it with

1135
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,520
interest

1136
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,839
yeah it's fantastic stuff

1137
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,680
yeah thanks for the comment dean

1138
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,160
stephen

1139
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,359
yeah this um

1140
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:48,960
i hope this does again doesn't go in the

1141
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,480
weeds either but

1142
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,400
but i think this is like say this this

1143
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,720
touches on so many things is when you

1144
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,160
talk about the generative model

1145
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,920
um

1146
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,720
and you've got in body cognition sort of

1147
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,680
fitting into that um

1148
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,920
generative models

1149
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,079
often be thinking that it's an action

1150
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,160
orientated model so it's an act it's a

1151
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,920
model of how to act

1152
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,880
okay

1153
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,760
um

1154
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,400
and i'm curious how far for instance if

1155
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,400
you do welding you mentioned welding and

1156
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,839
stuff like that

1157
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,200
so

1158
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,240
with this skilled performance idea

1159
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,760
that can be

1160
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,800
the generative model of how to weld

1161
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,960
but at what point or this sort of maybe

1162
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,880
ties into something i've been exploring

1163
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,200
at what point do you think that

1164
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,800
the instructions to weld

1165
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,280
are in the niche

1166
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,280
and being used by someone's generative

1167
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,800
model of which they only have a certain

1168
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,119
sequence available you know

1169
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,040
um now welding it may be that someone

1170
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,119
just they get a skillful practice and go

1171
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,800
the whole way you know so it's all in

1172
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,560
there but i'm just wondering once you

1173
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,280
get to sort of this management level

1174
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,960
at what point it's

1175
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,240
a niche

1176
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,079
artifact as much as it is a generative

1177
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,040
model internally

1178
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,200
um

1179
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,280
well i think uh

1180
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,560
with craft skills

1181
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:20,720
it's

1182
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,160
being able to do it it's just at some

1183
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,880
point or other after as well as an

1184
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,240
apprentice i think most people are

1185
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,839
apprentices have had this feeling that

1186
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,680
you're struggling and then

1187
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,680
you wake up one morning and then

1188
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,000
suddenly you've you've got a feel for it

1189
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,480
you can do it

1190
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,400
and um

1191
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,119
exactly

1192
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,200
how that is

1193
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:47,590
um

1194
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:49,040
[Music]

1195
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,880
i don't think anybody really knows

1196
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,520
because somehow it's going into the

1197
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,480
the fascia system that's the thing

1198
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,960
the feel for it is embodied in the

1199
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,800
fascia system

1200
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,240
and most

1201
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,640
um

1202
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,640
to my reading as a craftsperson

1203
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,119
most literature about embodied cognition

1204
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,560
is just paying

1205
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,200
lip service to it being about embodied

1206
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,800
cognition

1207
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,920
and it's not really

1208
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,160
addressing the nature of embodied

1209
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,079
cognition about

1210
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,319
how much that depends upon the fascia

1211
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:29,599
system

1212
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,079
and body memory

1213
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,200
and

1214
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,480
in this 4e model

1215
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,280
about extended cognition

1216
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,040
you know put put your memories in your

1217
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,359
mobile phone type of thing

1218
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,920
but there's no way that

1219
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,599
you can put your

1220
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,040
your manual skill

1221
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,760
uh embodied cognition

1222
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,200
muscle memory

1223
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,800
in a mobile phone you can have many

1224
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,160
videos of

1225
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,160
people doing manual work from all kinds

1226
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,920
of different angles

1227
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,720
but

1228
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,599
so that can be informative

1229
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,520
but it's not

1230
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,680
uh as as you can have many videos of

1231
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,079
people riding bicycles

1232
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,040
that

1233
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,599
that's not the same as

1234
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,920
having your body memory of how to get on

1235
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,440
a bike and not fall off while you're

1236
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,079
pedaling it

1237
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,319
um yeah stephen go further than i ever

1238
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:27,760
thought

1239
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,079
yeah i think this is a good i i agree i

1240
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:31,680
mean there's so there's some transition

1241
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,200
that happens when

1242
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,960
it goes from presumably some

1243
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,079
instructional process which is being

1244
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,760
decoded in a in a kind of a

1245
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,839
cognitive way to something more embodied

1246
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,680
like you say and it becomes a practice

1247
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,200
but then there's also i suppose and i

1248
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,480
don't know if but when you start

1249
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,160
coordinating for instance you've got a

1250
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,920
whole group of welders working on the

1251
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,800
side

1252
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,839
of a

1253
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:56,799
oil tanker

1254
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,200
so there's there's kind of then it might

1255
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,280
start to move again

1256
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,680
there's a scale beyond the individual

1257
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,680
welder you know and at what point does

1258
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,078
it then

1259
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,160
get beyond what i've been thinking of as

1260
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,680
like an experiential

1261
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,119
ecosystemic kind of

1262
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,400
knowing

1263
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,359
something which has to be coordinated

1264
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,680
through some artifact like a plan or

1265
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,078
something

1266
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:25,760
cool

1267
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,160
um let's just go to blue first

1268
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,359
go ahead because your thought is

1269
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,359
probably my thought oh no

1270
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,839
you should go for it

1271
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,000
so i have a question that was kind of

1272
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,800
related to steven's question um in terms

1273
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,000
of

1274
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,960
the niche modification um as not as it

1275
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,000
relates to craftsmanship per se but to

1276
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,040
industrial engineering and and in the

1277
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,359
this paper that um was the topic of our

1278
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:54,559
discussion

1279
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,680
you said that um you know the

1280
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,760
the processes need to be carried out

1281
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,880
right the first time in like 99 of the

1282
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,599
cases so i remember this and and to what

1283
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,559
extent is that first time right i mean i

1284
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,800
i just remember as a business owner

1285
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,920
there's a lot of sop development right

1286
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,480
so you develop sops and kpis so that

1287
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,559
everybody knows exactly what their job

1288
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,160
is exactly what they're supposed to do

1289
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,400
and exactly the procedure for

1290
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,960
executing the job so that theoretically

1291
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,520
anyone can come in and be like subsumed

1292
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,359
under the markov blanket

1293
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,280
for the business and the niche has been

1294
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,520
modified maybe in such a way to make

1295
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,400
that happen correctly 99 of the time the

1296
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,440
first time

1297
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,040
so do you think that that process

1298
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,960
development in in the industrial

1299
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,720
engineering application is

1300
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,640
niche modification or perhaps something

1301
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,879
else

1302
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,720
um yeah so this the 99

1303
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,040
times out of a hundred that's so that's

1304
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,319
six sigma

1305
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,359
which is

1306
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,280
under the umbrella of total quality

1307
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,720
management

1308
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,599
and

1309
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:04,240
that is where

1310
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,800
uh so if you if you've made

1311
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,280
so this is all by the way are you still

1312
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,040
seeing my screen

1313
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,960
uh no uh maybe could you reshare it

1314
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,880
okay yeah hang on so

1315
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,480
let me just

1316
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,920
if i go back to um

1317
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:29,280
[Music]

1318
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,200
so if i go

1319
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,599
back to that point i was making about

1320
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:37,280
some embodied cognition

1321
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,520
so

1322
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,760
yep looks good this

1323
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,280
this can you see that certain amount of

1324
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,680
predictive processing yep

1325
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,800
okay

1326
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,839
so

1327
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:52,640
what i'm doing in this paper is i'm uh

1328
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,400
refer i'm making reference

1329
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,000
to the fascia system and body memory

1330
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,280
um

1331
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,760
and relating

1332
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,079
you know well predictive global neural

1333
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,240
weight workspace

1334
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,520
um

1335
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,800
so

1336
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,599
that's um as far as i've got with that

1337
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,480
now this 99

1338
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,359
now can you see the treadmill yeah

1339
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:25,440
okay there it is

1340
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,520
this this 99 uh

1341
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,200
at a time right this time this has come

1342
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,599
with the treadmill of production and

1343
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,040
consumption

1344
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,680
so if if an organization invests a

1345
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,359
billion dollars

1346
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,760
in building a factory and uh

1347
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,240
and then the tooling

1348
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,400
then

1349
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,800
it's got to mass produce and it's got to

1350
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,319
get people to

1351
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:55,200
to buy what it's selling

1352
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,760
and they can't be disgruntled customers

1353
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,839
because now there's global competition

1354
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:03,760
and

1355
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,400
that 99

1356
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,720
it can be measured to microns with car

1357
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,558
body panels and things like that

1358
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,200
but if if you're in uh the leather

1359
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,359
um

1360
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:21,200
the leather

1361
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,240
cluster in italy

1362
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,400
and you're making leather bags as has

1363
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,359
been going on for hundreds of years

1364
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:30,400
then

1365
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,720
the precision

1366
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,440
is not so desirable

1367
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,040
it's good

1368
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,280
if every one of the leather bags is made

1369
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,280
that is made

1370
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,280
is a little bit different

1371
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,640
to each other

1372
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,279
because that

1373
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,880
signals

1374
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,599
that it's handmade

1375
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,319
so the 99

1376
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:57,440
right first time

1377
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,000
he's all wrapped up

1378
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,559
in this um

1379
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:05,280
treadmill of production and consumption

1380
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,079
with varying levels of precision

1381
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,960
depending on what the niche is so if the

1382
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,400
niche is

1383
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,280
you're a global car maker

1384
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,480
well

1385
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,559
the door better close with the

1386
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,880
obligatory clunk

1387
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,680
and it better be a water tight

1388
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,119
airtight

1389
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:26,240
fit

1390
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,960
when you're driving at maximum speed

1391
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,800
otherwise customers will be lost

1392
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,599
so

1393
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:35,920
in different niches

1394
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,319
the level of vision that's required

1395
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,280
depends upon what customers

1396
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,240
are expecting

1397
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,720
and what the competition will tolerate

1398
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,079
did that did i answer the question at

1399
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,000
all

1400
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,119
thanks for the

1401
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,960
interesting answer i'll all give a

1402
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,640
thought and then we'll go to scott so

1403
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,119
first um it's almost like what about a

1404
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:06,319
semantic precision like a writer who is

1405
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:09,040
outputting um precision in terms at

1406
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,880
multiple levels like a typographical

1407
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,119
precision and also um like they don't

1408
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:14,559
just want to release you know their hand

1409
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:16,400
hitting the keyboard that's not what

1410
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,960
their writing product is so it's not

1411
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,960
just the mechanical precision that we

1412
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,280
can talk about and then that idea of

1413
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,000
waking up to skill and the way you

1414
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,880
connected it to embodiment is really

1415
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,880
interesting maybe people wouldn't expect

1416
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,280
that from an industrial designer but

1417
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,280
then when we think about craft in the

1418
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,359
continuum it makes more sense and then

1419
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:39,760
also that waking up aspect of it it's

1420
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,319
like during sleep when we're simplifying

1421
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:45,119
and pruning neural connections

1422
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,040
the more neural

1423
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,119
applications of free energy principle in

1424
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:51,599
active inference could help us see that

1425
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,119
as like a process of model

1426
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:54,880
simplification and unlearning the

1427
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,839
details and that is sort of where skill

1428
00:55:57,839 --> 00:55:59,200
and mastery

1429
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,440
uh comes in and that could be cognitive

1430
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,000
unlearnings and bodily

1431
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
updatings in terms of the morphogenesis

1432
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,839
of the tendons or

1433
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:10,160
the sensory receptors or

1434
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,000
all kinds of other

1435
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,040
changes and so it's just cool that we

1436
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,280
can like really

1437
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,920
telescope in on just wanting to apply it

1438
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,480
to as you did in the paper really

1439
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,400
partitioning out the biological systems

1440
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,960
partitioning out the flesh and bone

1441
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,880
but we know we can go there

1442
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,119
but there's there's so much that you can

1443
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,160
say about just the engineering side

1444
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,319
that it was just like it makes it very

1445
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:40,240
interpretable yet also clearly

1446
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,400
comprehensive which is what you pointed

1447
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,680
out was kind of lacking in the

1448
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,760
literature when you were learning

1449
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,559
so scott um go for the question i don't

1450
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,319
know if you watched the dot zero but we

1451
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:51,599
we we uh

1452
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,079
we we had a scott david alert with the

1453
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:57,839
markov blankets of contracts and

1454
00:56:57,839 --> 00:56:59,839
but yeah anyway just go for it

1455
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:01,520
yeah thank you sorry i was delayed i was

1456
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,760
on another call a couple of things that

1457
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,520
thank you a couple of interesting

1458
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,440
comments that um

1459
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,160
sparked some questions ahead so the

1460
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,000
talking about the fascia and the and

1461
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,520
your statement about the mobile phone

1462
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,280
can't record the fashion obviously

1463
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,680
that's true but it sparked three things

1464
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,520
to me i wanted to get your thoughts on

1465
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,880
one is

1466
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,440
what in the notion of the fascia and the

1467
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,359
embodiment

1468
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,440
is it possible to use active inference

1469
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,160
framings or is it fruitful in the

1470
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,640
opposition of various fascia elements so

1471
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,960
when you're learning diving or frisbee

1472
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,119
playing one muscle is pushing against a

1473
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:40,000
bone or whatever and so the fascia has

1474
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,079
multiple components as well

1475
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:44,720
and so are there learnings that happen

1476
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:48,079
among fascia elements themselves

1477
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:50,640
because they're building actin myosin

1478
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,599
you know

1479
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,119
bulk or whatever i guess those are the

1480
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:54,079
proteins but in any event they're

1481
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,240
building bulk that's one is the

1482
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,160
opposition among fashion

1483
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,480
elements the other one is it reminded me

1484
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,799
a little bit on the mobile phone thing

1485
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:05,440
sandy pentland at mit talks about i

1486
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,680
think he did some work on predicting if

1487
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,200
people are going to get alzheimer's by

1488
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,240
they have their mobile phone in their

1489
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,839
pocket and they start walking around

1490
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,760
their apartment differently and the

1491
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,200
mobile phone is able to track that

1492
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,760
there's a difference an anomaly and so i

1493
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,799
thought that was kind of interesting

1494
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:20,319
that although the mobile phone can't

1495
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:23,599
track your craft your but it can

1496
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,000
note anomalies based on picking up

1497
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,119
fascia

1498
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,839
histories and then the third thing it

1499
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,160
made me think a little bit about um

1500
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,440
robotic prosthesis and haptic sensors

1501
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,880
and so there again you have this

1502
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,440
feedback mechanisms that are bounded

1503
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,960
obviously again they're not storing

1504
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,960
craft but it seems like i just wondered

1505
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,440
if any of those sparked any um thoughts

1506
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,240
that

1507
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,400
relative that question of the

1508
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,000
i guess not just the mobile phone but

1509
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,359
that sensory apparatus and the

1510
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:53,760
information networks being

1511
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,720
responsive with elements of fascia in

1512
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,880
different direct and indirect ways and

1513
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,040
maybe an active inference framing a

1514
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:04,799
hybrid between the technology embodying

1515
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:05,839
a certain

1516
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:08,640
expectation let's say and the fascia

1517
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,720
embodying a certain expectation

1518
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,000
and that kind of

1519
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,559
harmonic coupling if that had any any

1520
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:18,440
thoughts on that thank you

1521
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,480
um i think

1522
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,200
one thing that i'd consider in all these

1523
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,760
things is

1524
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:28,640
uh

1525
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,559
what's the

1526
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:31,359
but

1527
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,839
i'm going to mention the r word now

1528
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:35,040
reward

1529
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,119
uh what's the uh

1530
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:41,440
what would be the effort to reward ratio

1531
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,319
of doing that so if

1532
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:46,720
if um like you said about learning to

1533
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,480
dive

1534
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,640
so i'd say that maybe there would be

1535
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,040
some uh

1536
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,720
rules

1537
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,559
um

1538
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,880
sort of like design rules for learning

1539
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,680
to dive that maybe could be

1540
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,359
formulated

1541
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:05,760
that might be useful for people to

1542
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,280
learning to dive

1543
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,640
but then going into

1544
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,520
very sophisticated

1545
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,599
modeling when individuals are so

1546
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,280
different

1547
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,280
that might require a huge amount of

1548
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,920
effort and the reward

1549
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,720
may be less so i don't think you're

1550
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,480
alone when i was saying before scott

1551
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,400
that uh

1552
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,599
that in

1553
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:32,079
industrial engineering

1554
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:33,680
um

1555
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,319
so up until 1980 people use the

1556
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:38,720
mathematical models and the simulation

1557
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,839
tools available

1558
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:46,880
to to to model uh industrial processes

1559
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:47,680
but

1560
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:48,559
then

1561
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,960
designed for manufacturing assembly was

1562
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,839
introduced and assembly times in many

1563
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:56,559
products was reduced by 90 percent

1564
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,799
with simple rules

1565
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:02,400
and so all the amount of there's

1566
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,480
there's a place for modeling but

1567
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:09,839
what i'm more interested in phase

1568
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:12,720
focusing on

1569
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:17,359
are there

1570
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:19,280
simple rules

1571
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,480
are there

1572
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,839
simple methodologies

1573
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:25,359
tables and diagrams

1574
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:26,160
that

1575
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,720
can provide insights as designed for

1576
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,119
manufacturing assembly did that can lead

1577
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:35,040
to very substantial improvements

1578
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,119
so that's

1579
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,079
that's what i think but

1580
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:42,160
but then like this gate tracking you

1581
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,559
were talking about about people are they

1582
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:46,640
are they getting out on is that

1583
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:47,440
if

1584
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,240
one thing that i think's very attractive

1585
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,440
about active inferences it can provide a

1586
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,079
starting point

1587
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,200
where

1588
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,640
humans

1589
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,200
and artificial intelligence can be

1590
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,240
starting from the same place

1591
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,480
that okay

1592
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,559
what what's going on here

1593
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,319
is we're trying to

1594
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:13,599
reduce this information gap

1595
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,280
between

1596
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,440
the internal generative model of the

1597
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,200
human being

1598
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,480
and

1599
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,280
the external state of the world

1600
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,079
that they're moving around in

1601
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:26,430
and

1602
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:27,680
[Music]

1603
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,920
both the human being trying to do the

1604
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,160
under and the artificial intelligence is

1605
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,599
trying to do that

1606
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:35,599
and how is that done it's done through

1607
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:37,280
active inference

1608
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,559
where

1609
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:40,240
we learn

1610
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,760
from

1611
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,599
either

1612
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:47,119
changing what we pay attention to and or

1613
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,599
changing the action we take

1614
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,000
so then there can be a common starting

1615
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,400
point and maybe this can make the human

1616
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,760
being feel

1617
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,920
much more comfortable

1618
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,440
around the artificial intelligence

1619
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,599
so i've got i'm working on a

1620
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:05,920
project at the moment that's this third

1621
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,920
wave of ai where there's some

1622
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,760
top down rules

1623
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:10,559
and

1624
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:13,359
bottom up sensory inputs

1625
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:15,520
combining

1626
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,440
and

1627
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:21,359
i see active inferences being

1628
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:24,240
well worth exploring as a starting point

1629
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,119
for

1630
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:26,400
human

1631
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,200
ai interaction

1632
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,440
where both the human and the ai have got

1633
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,520
these well this this generative model

1634
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,200
that's the humans

1635
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,680
it's it's it's understandable to the

1636
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,078
human

1637
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,559
awesome points about

1638
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,319
where active inference could come into

1639
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:51,280
play and also almost from a designer's

1640
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,880
perspective if they have a systems

1641
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,160
diagram

1642
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:57,520
uh or a digital twin of some type that

1643
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,880
includes

1644
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,119
active inference agents interacting

1645
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:03,280
first because they're all of a similar

1646
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,119
type of model they'll be increased

1647
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,920
interoperability and ease of computing

1648
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,839
these kinds of systems

1649
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:11,039
and then

1650
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:14,640
the system designer or perturber can

1651
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,480
simulating with counterfactuals or with

1652
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,640
any other technique can

1653
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,960
uh formalize what affordances they do

1654
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,960
and don't have so it's like if someone

1655
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,400
says the only way i'm going to get this

1656
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,200
marketing um you know to succeed is if i

1657
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,640
update their generative models so that

1658
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,160
they think that you know this isn't a

1659
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,559
ponzi scheme it's like if that can be

1660
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:36,000
formalized then we could have benevolent

1661
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,680
shapings of the niche

1662
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,440
and kinds of interjections like we're

1663
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,880
going to inject this much money with

1664
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,799
this much of an equation

1665
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:45,920
because we're doing kl optimal control

1666
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,160
on this parameter conditioned on these

1667
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,720
other parameters you know how do people

1668
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,520
feel about that versus

1669
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,520
we're gonna do an ad hoc strategy based

1670
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,440
upon conversations that you weren't part

1671
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,240
of

1672
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,200
so

1673
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,799
and then that just while you were saying

1674
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:03,200
about the generalized principles

1675
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,280
again really interesting because there

1676
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,680
was a lot of detail in the paper

1677
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,680
and a lot of

1678
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,400
really insightful comments but it wasn't

1679
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,119
um the same formalism-driven

1680
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,160
approach

1681
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,319
that we've seen in some other works

1682
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:20,640
directly of course cited a lot of the

1683
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,480
primary literature there

1684
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,400
so it's just cool how you pulled back to

1685
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,119
the level of the generalized principles

1686
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:29,680
and then we can dip down into more

1687
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,559
special mathematical framings

1688
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:35,760
but this last part of table 1.

1689
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,280
which were also all sections of the

1690
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,400
paper or like essential kind of

1691
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,839
principles

1692
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:43,200
that

1693
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,160
at least

1694
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,079
you and the reviewers agreed were

1695
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:48,559
important enough to define

1696
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:51,559
clearly

1697
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:58,160
yeah i found that that quote now so

1698
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,000
this is from

1699
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,240
[Music]

1700
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,799
albert einstein geometry and experience

1701
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:04,640
addressed to the prussian academy of

1702
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,799
sciences in berlin

1703
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:10,000
27th of january 1921

1704
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,319
as far as the law of mathematics refer

1705
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:13,760
to reality

1706
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,680
they are not certain

1707
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,160
and as far as they are certain they do

1708
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:21,680
not refer to reality

1709
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:27,039
nice that reminds me also the way that

1710
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:29,200
you again describe free energy as that

1711
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,799
information gap

1712
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:32,880
it's almost like we can have a

1713
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,319
description

1714
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:37,440
or an estimation of of a gap a negative

1715
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,400
space

1716
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,640
and so it's like well what is it what's

1717
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,000
what's in the gap it's like well if i

1718
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:42,799
knew

1719
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:44,400
or if we had any more precision then

1720
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,720
we'd tell you but all we know is how

1721
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,480
large

1722
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,799
the deviation is

1723
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:54,880
uh so it's sort of like a way of

1724
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,799
uh one way around it is like using a

1725
01:06:56,799 --> 01:06:58,839
positive definition of something that's

1726
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:01,200
lacking and then that's closely related

1727
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,640
to this idea of tractable minimization

1728
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,559
that is better suited to be calculated

1729
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:10,720
than an intractable maximization

1730
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,880
like maximization of reward or expected

1731
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:16,160
utility which is a totally different set

1732
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,359
of constraints and outcomes than

1733
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:20,400
a

1734
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,799
variational free energy gradient descent

1735
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:30,000
so scott and then anyone else

1736
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,520
i wanted to you know that got me

1737
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,599
thinking are they just the

1738
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:35,599
uh i guess the

1739
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:39,280
um library of opportunities for a system

1740
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,280
or i'm not sure how to characterize it

1741
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,039
but um one of the things i've been

1742
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:44,880
fussing with is the chris christopher

1743
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,359
alexander um for folks who haven't

1744
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:50,960
been in that space

1745
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,559
with i just learned that a few months

1746
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:54,079
ago about him but

1747
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:58,240
he's an architect who collected the idea

1748
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,359
um that he had had was the collector uh

1749
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:02,720
he was in in architecture and is

1750
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,400
collecting up different practices in

1751
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,400
architecture and different patterns

1752
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,000
and he came up with a pattern language

1753
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,680
the idea was if you want to create a

1754
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,440
portico and a

1755
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,039
place to negotiate

1756
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:14,640
private and public space for instance

1757
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,399
you had certain patterns that happen in

1758
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:18,158
different kinds of architecture and so

1759
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:20,080
if you wanted to do architecture you

1760
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,520
could look at a bunch of patterns and

1761
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,120
and stare at them for a while and see

1762
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,479
which one look best

1763
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,719
and it's interesting with these

1764
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:29,359
questions of filling gaps you know the

1765
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:31,679
easiest place to look is what other

1766
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:34,158
similarly situated parties have done in

1767
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:36,479
similar situations so if you have that

1768
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,520
crosstalk the peer-to-peer conversation

1769
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,839
um then you can discover without having

1770
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:44,880
to go through all the pain and the cost

1771
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,719
of discovering yourself and that's the

1772
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,880
notion of guilds right i heard reference

1773
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,560
earlier to apprenticeship

1774
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,560
learned by the masters not just

1775
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,279
reinventing the wheel kind of idea okay

1776
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:56,080
so

1777
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,279
and it's interesting when we talk about

1778
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:00,719
gap filling because in

1779
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,600
more static systems culturally static

1780
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,479
systems let's say historically quiescent

1781
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:08,399
syst periods

1782
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:11,439
then you can learn a lot from the guilds

1783
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:14,560
but in periods of high dynamic change

1784
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,319
environmental change

1785
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,479
the guilds are going to maybe under

1786
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:20,238
serve you because there may be so much

1787
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:22,799
change that the old practices just don't

1788
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:24,960
hold up the externalities are such they

1789
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,880
swamp things

1790
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,040
and so i wonder in that gap if there's

1791
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,920
an element of discovery

1792
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,520
both of the

1793
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,439
available what what are the ways to

1794
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:38,560
discover what's available

1795
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,319
and then discover the things that are

1796
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:42,399
not available a because they're in a

1797
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:43,920
different silo so they haven't been

1798
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,799
available but maybe because they haven't

1799
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:49,198
yet been tried in any silo right so

1800
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:51,279
they're just not they're emerging

1801
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:53,439
type of notions and maybe that's a bad

1802
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:54,960
question i don't know it just it felt

1803
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,400
like that gap

1804
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,239
there's there's an easy low-hanging

1805
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:00,719
fruit of practices chris alexander kind

1806
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:02,560
of stuff is relatively low hanging and

1807
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,760
then it seems like there's other

1808
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:06,719
mechanisms here of discovery

1809
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:08,480
and maybe that's randomness and maybe

1810
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,040
that has to do with evolution but anyway

1811
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,719
if that's commentable i'd like some

1812
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:14,480
comments on that yeah awesome question

1813
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,719
scott

1814
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:19,040
um are you are you still seeing my

1815
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:22,320
screen yes i'll make it big

1816
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:26,480
all right okay so now

1817
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:30,640
skills

1818
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,679
leapfrog skills yes there it is

1819
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:35,280
so um

1820
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,800
the thing is

1821
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,840
about manual skills

1822
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,400
as scott was just saying the guilds and

1823
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,960
everything so

1824
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,960
in the work that i do development

1825
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,560
projects that

1826
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,560
point out that

1827
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,760
industrial thinking is 300 years old it

1828
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,239
came from the english midlands 300 years

1829
01:10:56,239 --> 01:10:59,559
ago and

1830
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,840
and taking that as the uh there's the

1831
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,440
basis of um

1832
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,440
doing development work may not be a good

1833
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,760
idea because it's 300 years old and the

1834
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,120
world's change

1835
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:11,600
and so it is with skills

1836
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,840
that

1837
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,159
um

1838
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:18,320
it's good to be able to carve wooden

1839
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,920
pieces it can be very rewarding

1840
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,920
and maybe it can bring a few people some

1841
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:27,120
economic benefits but that can't uh

1842
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,120
address the poverty of billions of

1843
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,480
people

1844
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,280
and

1845
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,880
craft guilds

1846
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,719
as i

1847
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:36,800
say to people well when they say

1848
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,120
ministers when they say well we need to

1849
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,440
build training centers and give people

1850
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,920
apprenticeships and i point out well

1851
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,159
that's medieval thinking

1852
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:47,199
so

1853
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,480
that

1854
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,040
isn't good that's not very good

1855
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,560
so here there's explanation of leapfrog

1856
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,040
skills i'd take you down to

1857
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:00,400
some diagrams here

1858
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,199
oops

1859
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,400
just

1860
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,679
a simple example

1861
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:16,320
bear with me

1862
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,120
this is taking longer than were you were

1863
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:24,000
you what was your active inference

1864
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,679
uh stage or

1865
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:28,480
awareness at this time in 2016 or when

1866
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,520
you're writing it leading up to here

1867
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:32,719
zero

1868
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:33,679
i didn't

1869
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:36,080
well no but the thing is it looks it

1870
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,520
depends how you look at it doesn't it

1871
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,640
because

1872
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:39,360
i

1873
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,239
so if you're doing manual work then

1874
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,159
you're doing active inference

1875
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,320
because

1876
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,640
it what what oh what are we doing this

1877
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,199
uh right so information gap how am i

1878
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,800
going to do this

1879
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,080
because i need to do this because if i

1880
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,400
don't do this i'm not going to get paid

1881
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,000
if i don't get paid

1882
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,800
i can't buy food i can't pay the rent so

1883
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,239
how am i going to do that that's the

1884
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:03,760
information gap

1885
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:06,159
and then so i'm going to pay attention

1886
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:07,360
to

1887
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:08,800
my

1888
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,920
priors

1889
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,159
what have i done before

1890
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:13,840
i'm going to

1891
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,080
pay attention to

1892
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,840
this the sensory inputs from the

1893
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,480
external state and notice that

1894
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,440
oh

1895
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,480
that the not all the materials i need

1896
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:25,760
are here

1897
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,880
so i need to improvise

1898
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,520
adaptive expertise i need to

1899
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:32,800
not apply

1900
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,199
what i've done before

1901
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:37,920
where it's not gonna help and i'm gonna

1902
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,760
have to think of a bit of something to

1903
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,600
do it

1904
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:45,520
and uh so in my opinion i active

1905
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,360
inference is certainly

1906
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:50,560
what's going on in manual work

1907
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,640
and then you you give it a try

1908
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,400
it doesn't uh

1909
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,320
all right it works to some extent or not

1910
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,520
to another

1911
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,040
extent so then look back in the

1912
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,400
generative model

1913
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,080
hang on what have i done i've done

1914
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,880
something like this before look around

1915
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,880
oh look i see in the distance there's

1916
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,800
some bit of kit i can use over there

1917
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,920
i'll use that and so on

1918
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:16,800
um but to go back to this craft uh

1919
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:17,840
thing that

1920
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,960
can you see that figure five that yep

1921
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,159
the kind of stuff you put around the

1922
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:23,840
door so

1923
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,159
doing these joints

1924
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:29,120
the difficult form to fix

1925
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:29,920
and

1926
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,320
very often if you stare at such joints

1927
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,560
closely you you'll see they'll have been

1928
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,120
filled up with glue and dust or

1929
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,239
a bit of

1930
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:41,760
more paint being stuck in there

1931
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,159
but then if you do this instead

1932
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:46,640
it actually looks better

1933
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:47,760
and

1934
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,239
it doesn't no need for the craft gill

1935
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:53,199
guild it's just a kit

1936
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:54,880
it's just um

1937
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:57,199
these molds it's just a kit

1938
01:14:57,199 --> 01:15:00,960
so you've got the and these uh

1939
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,040
blocks here in the corner

1940
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,679
it makes it look more fancy

1941
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:08,840
and you can just assemble it

1942
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:14,080
so if i go back to this one

1943
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,159
okay so

1944
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,199
do you see now a diagram that says

1945
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:27,679
movable factories yep

1946
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:28,560
okay

1947
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:29,280
so

1948
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,199
movable factories on the job training

1949
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:34,400
product kits in the middle

1950
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,400
uh engineering design of capable

1951
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:40,719
processes for mistake proof production

1952
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:42,960
though

1953
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,599
this is

1954
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,280
as we know ikea spread around the world

1955
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,520
much more successful than any furniture

1956
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,040
company

1957
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,040
its competitors because they do

1958
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,199
engineering design of capable processes

1959
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:59,520
for mistake proof production

1960
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,480
and this can be applied to

1961
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,960
many things water towers

1962
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,840
solar arrays

1963
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,520
anything

1964
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,040
really

1965
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,480
so this

1966
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,320
in uh what scott was saying about the

1967
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,440
craft

1968
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,440
guilds that

1969
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,239
yes craft guilds although i'm a master

1970
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:21,920
craftsman myself

1971
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,840
it's medieval thinking

1972
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,920
and it's um

1973
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,360
it's just

1974
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,679
not scalable

1975
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:32,480
and it's very very wasteful hugely

1976
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:35,600
wasteful and really craft skills

1977
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:36,960
are

1978
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:37,920
good

1979
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,480
for coping with chaos

1980
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,159
but chaos is

1981
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:44,640
hugely wasteful

1982
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,640
awash with entropy that can't be

1983
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,239
resolved

1984
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:50,640
so in in when i'm doing development

1985
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,120
projects this is what i'm

1986
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,719
advocating

1987
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:57,920
what's in that diagram

1988
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,280
uh dean with a raised hand and then

1989
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:04,960
anyone else who raises their hand

1990
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,560
i'm just

1991
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,800
throwing down a couple of things here so

1992
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,360
it's kind of it's in

1993
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,600
this is a nice fit into the glove of

1994
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,679
what scott was asking and then what i

1995
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:18,000
saw in terms of the title of that paper

1996
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,120
so my question is this if we um

1997
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,280
using the same kind of triangular shape

1998
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,360
as the five why's

1999
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,560
if we start at the top with learning

2000
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,560
and that learning then breaking down

2001
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,520
into

2002
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,640
one aspect of which is updating

2003
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,360
and then that breaking down into

2004
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:41,600
one act of which is gap respecting

2005
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,880
that then breaking down into assessing

2006
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,679
what the step function is

2007
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:49,600
and then that breaking down finally into

2008
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,000
some sort of action taken which is the

2009
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,440
filling to follow or the gap closing

2010
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,840
is that medieval thinking or is that an

2011
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,840
invention gradient descent

2012
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,000
i know that's a lot of stuff but

2013
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,320
if if you want to take the best of what

2014
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:09,040
happened 300 years ago and not get

2015
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,679
locked into starting with i'm going to

2016
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:14,000
close a gap because i perceive a gap

2017
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,679
present

2018
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:17,840
is there a way that we can take the best

2019
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:18,640
of

2020
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,520
the past meld it with the current and

2021
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,679
come up with an inventive gradient

2022
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:25,040
descent

2023
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:28,320
which which doesn't sort of hold us

2024
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,400
to either the craft or the mass

2025
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,960
production

2026
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:36,560
i believe we can

2027
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:37,520
good

2028
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,840
we'll be good

2029
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:42,000
friends yes

2030
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
and in um

2031
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,520
in that

2032
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,520
paper

2033
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,480
let's see if we can get to this

2034
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:53,480
um

2035
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:58,640
there's yep uncertainty and stress

2036
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,920
nice questions

2037
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:07,199
[Music]

2038
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:09,440
what you said about the scalability of

2039
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,280
the mentorship

2040
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,199
in the guild model versus alternative

2041
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:15,280
models was really interesting because

2042
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:18,400
there's the uh sort of academia versus

2043
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,080
non-academia

2044
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,239
divide so with that sort of student

2045
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:24,320
through phd and that traditional

2046
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,679
mentorship system and how that's

2047
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,920
evolving then there's the traditional

2048
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,199
craft

2049
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:31,440
um trajectory the apprentice and the

2050
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,560
master

2051
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,800
and the way that that is also changing

2052
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,199
and the way that academia and research

2053
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:38,080
are

2054
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,520
reconnecting so there's just so many

2055
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,719
cool threads about how everybody will

2056
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:45,440
find guidance

2057
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:50,560
so are you are you seeing my screen yep

2058
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,719
mass imagineering mass customization

2059
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:55,040
mass production yep

2060
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,560
so i'm

2061
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,080
i'm looking at

2062
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,400
in this one i'm looking at it from the

2063
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:04,080
point of view of consumer culture

2064
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,320
and saying how these complement each

2065
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,440
other

2066
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,120
so

2067
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,800
uh

2068
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,520
it's in their deen about how these

2069
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:17,360
can all be complementing each other

2070
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:18,880
i'm definitely going to have a read of

2071
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,960
that

2072
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,040
remember to maintain firm downward

2073
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,639
pressure on the soles of your feet while

2074
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:26,880
you do

2075
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:32,239
and pump to the tempo of staying alive

2076
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:33,760
no no no you've got to keep your feet on

2077
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,040
the ground otherwise it'll blow your

2078
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,520
socks off

2079
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,920
scott

2080
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:42,960
yeah i want to get back to um that was

2081
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,520
you struck me with that statement before

2082
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,760
the craft skills are very wasteful

2083
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,760
and they're useful with chaotic

2084
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,639
situations but chaos is really wasteful

2085
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,560
that's really that struck me and i

2086
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,280
wanted to ask you i

2087
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,960
thought well that's interesting because

2088
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:02,639
inefficiency is resilient

2089
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:04,239
and distributed makes me think about

2090
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:05,920
distributed agriculture distributed

2091
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:08,880
manufacturing a lot of the resilience

2092
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,800
discussions that are going on now i work

2093
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,320
with a group called all fed that's

2094
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,440
trying to figure out how to feed

2095
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,800
everyone in the world and things like

2096
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:15,840
that and

2097
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,560
then also the notions of monoculture and

2098
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,320
the production of cheap industrial

2099
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,600
calories

2100
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,840
but then there's no variety

2101
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,960
and again getting back to this

2102
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:29,360
the notion in active inference i keep

2103
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,520
coming back to carnot's characterization

2104
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,960
in the second law of thermodynamics and

2105
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,719
you need the hot and cold differentials

2106
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:37,280
to perform work with a heat engine

2107
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,120
and i feel like you need the

2108
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,040
differentials and information to have

2109
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,960
active inference bayesian

2110
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,239
occurrence

2111
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:44,960
so

2112
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,520
that inefficiency feels like it's laden

2113
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,920
with value because of the differentials

2114
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:52,880
that are in there the chaos and the

2115
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,560
it feels like there's

2116
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:57,520
lots of value to be derived from chaos

2117
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:59,199
and inefficiency

2118
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:01,520
and maybe that's part of what it was

2119
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,800
well i guess it was being done in the

2120
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,800
industrial revolution notions as you

2121
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,280
took craft skills and reduced the

2122
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,239
inefficiencies and derived value and it

2123
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:12,560
feels like as we have more chaos in the

2124
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,880
information sphere

2125
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,080
are we how might we release those

2126
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,360
that value

2127
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:21,679
but but still recognizing that maybe

2128
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:23,840
it's a there's a font of inefficiency

2129
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,120
that keeps coming at us because

2130
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,199
interaction volumes are going up so we

2131
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:29,080
don't have to worry about

2132
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:31,360
inexhaustible supply of inefficiency

2133
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,440
that awaits us but if we mine the

2134
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:35,679
inefficiency and bring it into the

2135
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:39,760
system where it's known then um it seems

2136
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,760
like it creates value i wonder is any of

2137
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,840
that commentable

2138
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,600
i hope that

2139
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,679
made some sense

2140
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:49,760
yes yeah yeah

2141
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,400
um but before i go on to that also dean

2142
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,560
there's this paper

2143
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:58,080
domesticating artificial intelligence

2144
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:01,040
can you is that on the screen yeah

2145
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:03,600
okay so expanding human self expression

2146
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,440
through applications of artificial

2147
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:08,719
intelligence in prosumption

2148
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:11,040
so that's another um

2149
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,880
another one about

2150
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,080
this combining different

2151
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:19,199
different uh paradigms of

2152
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:20,960
production and presumption and

2153
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,320
consumption

2154
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,239
okay so

2155
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:28,320
yes so what i was saying about um

2156
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,080
inefficiency

2157
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,120
so

2158
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:34,760
perhaps i should

2159
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:38,000
explain better what i mean

2160
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,120
but

2161
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,600
redundant variation

2162
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,800
so redundant variation doesn't add it

2163
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,639
consumes energy

2164
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:49,280
and it doesn't add any value

2165
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,440
so that

2166
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,920
that is the the thing that with this

2167
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,400
leapfrog skills i'm pointing that out

2168
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,600
that well it serves no useful purpose to

2169
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,080
have redundant variation

2170
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,840
variation

2171
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,840
can have value but not not redundant

2172
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:08,880
variation so

2173
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,960
that's what i mean and also it depends

2174
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:13,840
on what people's circumstances are so

2175
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,690
if people are

2176
01:24:15,690 --> 01:24:18,080
[Music]

2177
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,679
living on the edge

2178
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:21,040
as

2179
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,440
many people are

2180
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:24,400
then

2181
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,000
there's just no

2182
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,199
they don't have any spare

2183
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:30,719
energy

2184
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:34,320
and redundant variation can

2185
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,000
uh well we know

2186
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,800
do you know this term the prokaryote

2187
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,760
that people in in the west that uh

2188
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,239
that people don't have they have zero

2189
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:46,480
hours contracts and

2190
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,639
and things like that and they're

2191
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:51,600
in the precarious but the real procare

2192
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,719
in the world

2193
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:55,600
are the people who were

2194
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,280
living on the edge

2195
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,600
in developing countries

2196
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:00,560
because

2197
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,159
you know they're they're pretty they're

2198
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:03,920
they're staying alive it is literally

2199
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:05,520
precarious

2200
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:08,239
that they they very don't

2201
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:10,320
getting water's difficult and when they

2202
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:13,360
get water it's dirty so they've got a

2203
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,840
choice they can drink it

2204
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:17,520
to keep living

2205
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:19,120
but if they drink it

2206
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,880
they're gonna get ill

2207
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:23,760
and maybe the illness is gonna kill them

2208
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:24,800
so

2209
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:28,000
there are um

2210
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,159
different scenarios and in in

2211
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:31,360
development

2212
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,239
work

2213
01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:35,679
it's uh redundant variation is just

2214
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:36,800
trapping

2215
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,960
can keep people trapped in desperate

2216
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,840
poverty

2217
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:44,000
could you just comment a little bit on

2218
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,840
as a follow-up on the

2219
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,760
expand on that redundant variation what

2220
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:50,000
that looks like in some examples

2221
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,679
and also just wanted to mention in one

2222
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:53,600
of the groups i'm working with all fed

2223
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,520
we're thinking of developing a how many

2224
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,760
days to starvation app

2225
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:00,080
for people and like the countdown clock

2226
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:01,600
and the bulletin of atomic scientists

2227
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,560
but how many days a person has in their

2228
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,719
food availability including what's in

2229
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:08,880
the refrigerator what's in their

2230
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:11,040
food desert etc but it's days to

2231
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,560
starvation because of that awareness

2232
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:14,320
that precariousness but anyway but if

2233
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:15,600
you could talk a little bit more about

2234
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,679
redundant variations i'm not quite sure

2235
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:20,840
the concept of what that looks like

2236
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,560
is

2237
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,560
can you see this diagram again on my

2238
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,239
screen this yes

2239
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:27,040
okay

2240
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:28,639
so in that um

2241
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:31,840
in the difficult to form fit and fix

2242
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,400
on the left hand side

2243
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,800
the shape if there's a little bit of a

2244
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,159
twist and um

2245
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:43,760
a little bit of poor machining

2246
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,080
in the

2247
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:48,480
timber sections there

2248
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,719
it can make forming that joint really

2249
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:52,080
difficult

2250
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,240
and then um

2251
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,560
[Music]

2252
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,320
uh

2253
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,080
those so those

2254
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:00,239
variations they're just they're just

2255
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:02,800
redundant they don't they don't add any

2256
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:05,600
value they lead to uh

2257
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:08,159
because there is this this

2258
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:10,560
the duality of entropy

2259
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,000
there's a little bit of physical

2260
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
disorder because maybe the wood's a bit

2261
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,280
twisted or the machining was a bit off

2262
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,760
so there's the information uncertainty

2263
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:22,480
how am i going to make that joint

2264
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:23,520
so

2265
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:24,960
then

2266
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,239
suppose

2267
01:27:26,239 --> 01:27:28,159
suppose there's six ways of forming that

2268
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:30,239
joint with equal probability just like a

2269
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:31,520
fair die

2270
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:32,800
and the uh

2271
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:36,719
the information entropy is 2.58 bits

2272
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:40,000
and that 2.58 bits it's just it's just

2273
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,560
not adding any value at all

2274
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:45,679
um that gap of 2.58 bit

2275
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:47,840
but with this alternative on the right

2276
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,360
hand side

2277
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:50,960
those uh

2278
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:53,360
the square pieces in the corners

2279
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:56,159
they can have a rebate formed in them in

2280
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:58,400
their in their thickness so there's

2281
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:01,120
quite a substantial overlap

2282
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:04,080
there's maybe uh

2283
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,719
nine millimeters

2284
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:10,000
or three eighths of an inch overlap so

2285
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,320
if if the joint isn't

2286
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,400
perfect it just covers it up and it

2287
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,320
doesn't matter

2288
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:19,220
so that's a pr a practical example

2289
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:20,880
[Music]

2290
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,679
and then if we scale that up to

2291
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:26,159
all the

2292
01:28:26,239 --> 01:28:29,840
the many many things that can be so

2293
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:32,159
why uh design management factor and

2294
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:33,920
assembly reduce products assembly times

2295
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:36,320
by 90 is because it just eliminated or

2296
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,360
redundant variation

2297
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:42,800
does that help

2298
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,400
you know what what that

2299
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,239
reminds me of is almost like we talk

2300
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:48,480
about aberrant precision we've talked

2301
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,719
about that on the neuro psychiatry side

2302
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:53,600
delusional beliefs um failure modes of

2303
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,520
decision making algorithms

2304
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:58,480
it's okay to not be latched on to the

2305
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,719
perfect strategy as long as there's this

2306
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:03,520
healthy uncertainty about strategic

2307
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,360
decision making because it's that

2308
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,360
uncertainty that's getting kind of

2309
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,280
coasted on that should the system

2310
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:11,199
persist ends up finding an appropriate

2311
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:13,520
or an adequate strategy but aberrant

2312
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:14,800
precision when there's like high

2313
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:18,159
precision um confidence but then also

2314
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:20,560
it's off target with its mean estimation

2315
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,480
things can go awry and so it's like that

2316
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,560
door frame on the left the mass produced

2317
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:25,520
one

2318
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:26,400
then

2319
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,320
as you've pointed out it's kind of like

2320
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,920
a false sense of precision because if

2321
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,600
you look at it it looks like the more

2322
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,199
precise one it looks like oh it's

2323
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:35,199
sharper or it was machined such and such

2324
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:37,360
angle at exactly this angle but then

2325
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:39,199
that one degree tolerance which sounds

2326
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:41,199
like really accurate on the machining

2327
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:42,239
wheel

2328
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:45,040
now that plays out on the door frame and

2329
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:47,280
now it's actually less precise in

2330
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,320
practice

2331
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:49,840
and also like you pointed out the

2332
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,440
example with the cupboard or the

2333
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,360
bookshelf being attached to the wall

2334
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:54,960
like you can design

2335
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:57,520
for internal precision really well

2336
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:00,080
but then it's hard to take a step back

2337
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:02,560
and have latitude for like the wiggle

2338
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:05,040
room of real life but that's actually

2339
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:07,280
where the success or the failure of the

2340
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,679
product in use is going to be

2341
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:10,960
so that's very

2342
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:14,960
interesting topics that you brought up

2343
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:16,800
you know just just a quick follow-up my

2344
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,560
happiest one of my happiest days in my

2345
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:20,159
life is when i discovered that you can

2346
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:23,520
mix sawdust with epoxy and then do gap

2347
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,360
filling and i actually completed

2348
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:27,840
projects a lot faster as a result

2349
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:30,000
one other comment on that is contracts

2350
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:30,960
you know

2351
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:32,880
mass contracts we had a lot of

2352
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,560
negotiations i used to work with banks

2353
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,239
and software companies and things doing

2354
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:38,159
contracts and it was funny because in

2355
01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:40,320
negotiations a mass contract has that

2356
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,480
you get rid of redundant variation right

2357
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:44,320
you just get there's no reason to have a

2358
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:45,920
different contract for all these things

2359
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,239
but it constrains the people who have

2360
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:50,159
less power in the negotiation but it's

2361
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:51,520
funny because people say to you when

2362
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,120
you're in the negotiation with someone

2363
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,280
who has a mass contract they'll say

2364
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:56,800
well

2365
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,560
well you can't change it this is the way

2366
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,719
we we always have done it

2367
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:02,239
and that right they're saying this is

2368
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:04,239
just it and then the answer back to that

2369
01:31:04,239 --> 01:31:05,280
is well let me show you how we're going

2370
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,960
to do it for the next 20 years you know

2371
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,199
because it's a world changes around

2372
01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:12,159
these things that have insufficient

2373
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:14,400
variation in them

2374
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:17,040
and so it's interesting when what seems

2375
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,560
like a system that has eliminated

2376
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:19,920
redundant variation becomes

2377
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:22,639
anachronistic

2378
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:24,880
um

2379
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,400
are you seeing my screen though are you

2380
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:28,800
seeing three circles yes

2381
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,600
okay so scott you were talking about uh

2382
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,600
distributed

2383
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,120
and

2384
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:37,600
so what

2385
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,480
i'm

2386
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:41,199
working on is this it's this highly

2387
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:43,600
distributed prosumption

2388
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:46,800
highly distributed and highly efficient

2389
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:49,520
compared to distributed subsistence

2390
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,440
which is distributed but not efficient

2391
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:53,360
and centralized which is efficient but

2392
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:55,920
not distributed

2393
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:59,280
so that's the thing and here is the dark

2394
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:00,880
picture of what happens with

2395
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:03,679
centralization

2396
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:06,080
okay

2397
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,520
that looks like the fovea

2398
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,280
and retina

2399
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,840
the focus all the attention

2400
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,679
is on the uh

2401
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:17,840
the heart of the empire

2402
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:21,199
and then it's all dark

2403
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:25,600
so nice images and also that distributed

2404
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,480
model is very cool

2405
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:31,760
so steven with a raised hand and then

2406
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:33,600
anyone else who wants to raise their

2407
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:37,199
hand or a question in the chat

2408
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:39,920
i'd like to bring in a bit more on that

2409
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:42,080
aesthetics and embodiment i put a couple

2410
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:44,639
of notes actually in the in the in the

2411
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:46,560
youtube chat as well just uh with the

2412
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,320
link i i don't know if you've heard of

2413
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:50,719
the william morris and philip webb

2414
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:54,239
red house in bexley heath ken um it

2415
01:32:54,239 --> 01:32:55,760
talks a lot about the crafts because

2416
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:56,800
they actually

2417
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,560
um they had this whole thing in the

2418
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,400
1800s where they were

2419
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,639
wanting to redo

2420
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:04,480
the crafts in the in the house and

2421
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:06,000
actually had little holes in the ceiling

2422
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,800
so they could redesign the ceilings

2423
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,080
in a craft way for different events

2424
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,520
so there's this push against

2425
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,360
industrialization so i'm wondering when

2426
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:16,560
you mention about

2427
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,960
the better aesthetics by putting the

2428
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,639
corners i mean

2429
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:24,000
in some ways you you you you gain what

2430
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,400
could be seen at one level of aesthetic

2431
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,719
but there again with a craft and seeing

2432
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:30,880
some of the variation

2433
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,280
the the the reach

2434
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,719
and i wonder how you feel about this the

2435
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:37,120
reach of the embodied

2436
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:38,480
inference

2437
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:40,719
of the person making it

2438
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:43,199
is is lessened so the ability to i

2439
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:44,320
wonder what your thoughts are about the

2440
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,880
ability to infer from the other

2441
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,239
direction

2442
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:51,360
what the process of creation was and how

2443
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:55,199
that aesthetic creates more soul how

2444
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:57,679
that is in a way what the soul of

2445
01:33:57,679 --> 01:34:00,480
objects are

2446
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:05,839
um

2447
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:07,760
so if

2448
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:08,090
let me

2449
01:34:08,090 --> 01:34:10,000
[Music]

2450
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,320
try to sum up what

2451
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,400
my understanding is of what you what you

2452
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:15,840
were saying

2453
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,360
so my understanding of what you're

2454
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,159
saying correct me if i'm wrong is that

2455
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:22,320
if something is

2456
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,239
crafted

2457
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:27,600
then it has more

2458
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,639
um

2459
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:30,960
inherent

2460
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:34,639
value at least to the person doing the

2461
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:39,520
who crafted it so if somebody carves a

2462
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:42,960
carves a sculpture

2463
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,000
then

2464
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,520
that has

2465
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:48,080
more inherent value to them

2466
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,560
than if they

2467
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,960
downloaded a model of a sculpture and 3d

2468
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,400
printed it

2469
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:55,840
is that

2470
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:59,119
yeah there's and and on top of that the

2471
01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:04,320
ability for their embodiment of creation

2472
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,800
their process of creation or their

2473
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,639
active inference or an active inference

2474
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:11,520
process of creation extends further out

2475
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:14,239
into that distributed network because

2476
01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:15,920
someone who's further removed from that

2477
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:18,159
person could see that sculpture

2478
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:19,520
and they could

2479
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:22,080
get closer to being them than being

2480
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,639
closer to being a cdc

2481
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:28,159
routing machine operator

2482
01:35:30,410 --> 01:35:33,529
[Music]

2483
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,520
well i don't know because if i see it if

2484
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:44,159
i see a sculpture

2485
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:45,040
then

2486
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:48,320
i can appreciate it hopefully

2487
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:51,920
but i'm far from

2488
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:53,520
being able to

2489
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:55,360
do it myself

2490
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:58,400
and uh so let me give you a more mundane

2491
01:35:58,400 --> 01:35:59,679
example

2492
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:00,480
that

2493
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:03,280
in many parts of the world walls used to

2494
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:05,760
have walls and ceilings used to have

2495
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,400
wet plaster applied to them to make them

2496
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,400
smooth

2497
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:11,600
and

2498
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,719
so

2499
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:16,080
plastering a ceiling

2500
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:19,199
getting the plaster on the ceiling the

2501
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:20,719
wet plaster

2502
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:24,480
on the ceiling and it's smooth

2503
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:27,520
it's a very difficult thing to do

2504
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,840
and uh so people will do apprenticeships

2505
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,480
as plasterers and so on

2506
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:33,520
and

2507
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:36,000
so i can see that i can see oh yeah that

2508
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,080
looks and maybe i could try to do it

2509
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:39,920
myself as well and all the plaster would

2510
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:42,000
end up on the floor and on me

2511
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,760
and then i'd realize that oh this is

2512
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,520
really difficult

2513
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:46,480
but

2514
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:49,679
it doesn't get me any closer to being a

2515
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:52,480
plasterer with the skill to to get the

2516
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,400
plaster on the ceiling

2517
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:57,679
and if all dwellings depend upon the

2518
01:36:57,679 --> 01:36:59,520
construction of all dwellings depends

2519
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:01,920
upon such processes

2520
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:03,040
then

2521
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:05,440
billions of people are going to remain

2522
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,280
main in

2523
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,440
uh

2524
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:11,759
bad

2525
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:16,239
dwellings or no dwellings so

2526
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:18,480
that's the so if i understood you

2527
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,480
correctly i don't think it makes me but

2528
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:23,920
if if i see somebody

2529
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:25,520
putting up um

2530
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,520
some boards on a ceiling that i've

2531
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:30,400
designed to give a

2532
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,560
a functionally um

2533
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:35,760
adequate and aesthetically adequate

2534
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,520
ceiling

2535
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:41,840
and i see them do that then i can do it

2536
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:45,760
cool thanks just one just just one just

2537
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:47,360
one follow-up just very very quickly i

2538
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,520
think i suppose i could also i'm not

2539
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:50,960
necessarily disagreeing with what you're

2540
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:53,040
saying at all i think but i would also

2541
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:53,920
just

2542
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:56,320
in terms of this distributed

2543
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:59,280
um like if you go into a medieval house

2544
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:00,400
and you see

2545
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:02,400
a more rough and ready plastering you

2546
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:04,480
may not know how to do it but

2547
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:07,199
you could imagine the process of someone

2548
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:09,440
in bodies that did it even if you

2549
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:11,199
couldn't do it yourself and so i was

2550
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:12,960
wondering about that

2551
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,760
those kind of those removals as things

2552
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:17,679
get industrialized

2553
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:19,679
which may be you know

2554
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:21,280
maybe that's why sometimes we add

2555
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:22,880
texture back in

2556
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:24,560
and sometimes more expensive stuff that

2557
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,960
we buy in the shops actually has texture

2558
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:28,239
put back in that can be actually

2559
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:31,600
expensive to produce

2560
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,159
it reminds me of graffiti like when you

2561
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:36,159
see graffiti you can imagine an

2562
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:37,679
affordance that would lead to you having

2563
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:39,199
done that art

2564
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:41,600
versus like a you know an apple

2565
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:43,840
phone it's delivered like in the conch

2566
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,800
shell

2567
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,719
with smooth and you know it's sort of

2568
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:49,360
the extreme case uh where at the very

2569
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:50,880
least it's more cognitive to understand

2570
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:53,040
how it was built and it definitely makes

2571
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,840
sense and things that are well worn they

2572
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,119
uh it doesn't make them like better or

2573
01:38:57,119 --> 01:38:59,840
more valuable just makes them

2574
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:01,520
more able to play a part of a story in

2575
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,199
someone's life like putting up a kid's

2576
01:39:03,199 --> 01:39:04,560
drawing

2577
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,880
it becomes about the person and latching

2578
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,360
on to a broader network of connections

2579
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,840
versus the very

2580
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:13,840
parsimonious and ruthless efficiency of

2581
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,920
an industrial design process that kind

2582
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:17,199
of seeks to

2583
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:18,880
um remove

2584
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:20,400
the human touch and like you know if it

2585
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,080
was a craft beer it has a little dirt

2586
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,280
its character

2587
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:24,960
it's a mass-produced one has a little

2588
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:26,880
dirt it's dirty

2589
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:29,760
so we tolerate um different types of

2590
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:31,040
imprecision

2591
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:32,239
when we know that we're dealing with

2592
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:34,000
like our neighbor versus when we're

2593
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,360
expecting some

2594
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:36,560
international

2595
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:39,360
shipment of uh food

2596
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:41,600
um so scott with a question and then

2597
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:42,880
looks like you want to share something

2598
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,880
else stephen

2599
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,080
you know it's a it's interesting it's

2600
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,320
kind of the disgust reaction is invoked

2601
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:50,880
there too and that idea of um

2602
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:52,719
that rejection and

2603
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:54,639
anyway the um

2604
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:57,600
that reminded me of that last bit was in

2605
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:59,840
uh there's a black box of ai that we

2606
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:01,440
talk about now well in way we have a

2607
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:03,920
black box of industrialization

2608
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:05,760
right the thing was made but we don't

2609
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:06,960
know how

2610
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:08,480
and it used to be that if you look at

2611
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,080
this if you look at a shoe you can say i

2612
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:11,840
see the stitches and i see there's a cow

2613
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,199
over there i can see how you get leather

2614
01:40:13,199 --> 01:40:14,800
and i get it then you look at a nike

2615
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,639
shoe and you're like i have no idea

2616
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:18,320
where that came from how it was made if

2617
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:19,920
it was glued what was put together right

2618
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:21,679
it's just so in a way

2619
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:24,239
we have that black box now me when marx

2620
01:40:24,239 --> 01:40:27,520
was talking about alienation

2621
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,320
and industrialization maybe part of our

2622
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,159
alienation is not

2623
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:34,480
knowing our connection to craft

2624
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:36,000
one of the things i talk to people about

2625
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,239
is in europe they have these rights

2626
01:40:38,239 --> 01:40:40,239
called drop morale they're moral rights

2627
01:40:40,239 --> 01:40:42,960
it's a copyright right overlay

2628
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:45,119
so if i sell you a painting in europe

2629
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:47,600
you can't destroy it i still have rights

2630
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:50,000
as an artist moral rights in the art is

2631
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,080
a form of expression i think it has a

2632
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:53,920
hegelian and kantian background but

2633
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:56,400
let's put that aside and then

2634
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:57,679
in the united states if i sell you a

2635
01:40:57,679 --> 01:40:59,600
painting you do anything you want to it

2636
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:02,639
we have a lock and utilitarian notion of

2637
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:03,600
these

2638
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:05,280
expression and rights and individual

2639
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:08,000
rights so it feels like there's

2640
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,639
indifference here philosophically in

2641
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:12,719
terms of connection to expressive

2642
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:14,080
content

2643
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:15,440
in the drought morale context you're not

2644
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:16,560
talking about industrial production

2645
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:17,920
you're talking about copyright which

2646
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:20,560
gets towards industrialization of

2647
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,080
guild type production right because it's

2648
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:24,639
a work of original authorship

2649
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:27,119
again maybe not directly related but i

2650
01:41:27,119 --> 01:41:28,239
just thought it was really interesting

2651
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:30,639
that in a way we're looking at that

2652
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:32,960
black box question again and humans

2653
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:35,360
being alienated from production

2654
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:37,840
and i wonder if there's some aspects in

2655
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:40,239
in the work that we're seeing here of

2656
01:41:40,239 --> 01:41:41,719
that

2657
01:41:41,719 --> 01:41:44,320
de-alienating production i wouldn't

2658
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:46,719
comment on that nice question scott

2659
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:48,400
thank you

2660
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,320
can you know can you see a diagram it's

2661
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:53,280
sort of got a slopey line and some black

2662
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,880
boxes all right

2663
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:56,239
so

2664
01:41:56,239 --> 01:41:57,760
it says here

2665
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:59,760
increasing geographical and social

2666
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:02,400
distribution of production

2667
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:03,840
so

2668
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:06,320
d growth now d growth centralized

2669
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,239
industrial production this is happening

2670
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:11,520
with premature deindustrialization

2671
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,440
in in many countries in the world they

2672
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:16,400
had some industrialization and now it's

2673
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,400
it's going

2674
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,239
and we see that

2675
01:42:20,239 --> 01:42:23,280
what's coming on is there's a

2676
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:25,199
distributed industrial distributed

2677
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:27,360
artisanal and distributed

2678
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:30,000
diy that's growing

2679
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
and

2680
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,920
what but probably what's still going to

2681
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:35,600
come from centralized industrial

2682
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:39,199
production is materials form materials

2683
01:42:39,199 --> 01:42:41,760
and then components

2684
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:42,719
and then

2685
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:44,880
local goods is becoming more distributed

2686
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:47,280
then distributed infrastructure

2687
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:50,280
and then down here

2688
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:52,719
[Music]

2689
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:55,199
this so

2690
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:57,679
industrial production

2691
01:42:57,679 --> 01:42:59,520
so this requires massive capital

2692
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:00,960
investment in fixed industrial

2693
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:02,880
manufacturing assets

2694
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:06,639
then you get industrial mass production

2695
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:09,119
and this is all based upon that you get

2696
01:43:09,119 --> 01:43:11,760
higher productivity from that massive

2697
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:14,400
capital investment

2698
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:16,960
but can this produce higher wages more

2699
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:19,679
goods purchased is there still scope for

2700
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:20,480
that

2701
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:23,040
will this lead to increased

2702
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:24,960
a production employment evidence

2703
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,800
suggests not

2704
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:31,360
so this is non-industrial production

2705
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:33,920
for one of a better term

2706
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,320
so with this there's minimal capital

2707
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:38,320
investment in flexible

2708
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:41,280
non-industrial production assets

2709
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:43,119
more industrial production then there's

2710
01:43:43,119 --> 01:43:46,000
higher productivity

2711
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,440
and that's

2712
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:48,639
coming

2713
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:50,480
and all the options here is you can have

2714
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:54,400
higher value artisanal production

2715
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:55,920
so if you

2716
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:59,600
you know if if shoes are handmade

2717
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,679
to some extent

2718
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:02,560
uh

2719
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,960
as they are the company doing that those

2720
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:06,020
in ethiopia

2721
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:07,679
[Music]

2722
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:10,560
that can lead to higher wages

2723
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:12,719
and that's more goods and infrastructure

2724
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:15,840
made with personal commitment

2725
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:17,920
leading to increased paid and personal

2726
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,760
production employment

2727
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:21,360
and then down

2728
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:23,840
lower price diy production lower

2729
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,360
expenditure

2730
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:27,440
so with

2731
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:29,840
prosumption there are you could for

2732
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:30,880
example

2733
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:34,560
do produce something with some degree

2734
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:37,679
of craft in it

2735
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:42,239
and that could produce a higher

2736
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:44,800
sales price higher wages and then at the

2737
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,159
same time

2738
01:44:46,159 --> 01:44:49,280
your costs can be reduced so if you

2739
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:52,159
fabricate your own solar panels and you

2740
01:44:52,159 --> 01:44:54,239
install them yourselves

2741
01:44:54,239 --> 01:44:55,679
and suppose you can get all your

2742
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:58,320
electricity from that well then your

2743
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:01,360
energy costs go down so i'm seeing this

2744
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:04,080
has been um is that diagram

2745
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:05,840
very visible in your

2746
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:08,080
yep i made it large

2747
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:10,159
it's what you see on jitsi is not what

2748
01:45:10,159 --> 01:45:11,679
the live stream is

2749
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:12,719
okay

2750
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:16,400
all right so so that diagram i think is

2751
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:17,920
addressing

2752
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:19,760
um

2753
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:23,119
both sides of this that on the one hand

2754
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:24,159
you're

2755
01:45:24,159 --> 01:45:27,520
reducing the this lower price diy

2756
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:30,719
so there the idea is to

2757
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:33,230
eliminate all redundant variation

2758
01:45:33,230 --> 01:45:34,639
[Music]

2759
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:37,679
to drive down costs of

2760
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:39,600
essential goods

2761
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:42,159
as low as possible so as many people can

2762
01:45:42,159 --> 01:45:46,320
access them as possible so they can um

2763
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:47,760
fabricate

2764
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:50,719
and install themselves

2765
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:51,679
and

2766
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:53,920
the higher value artisanal production

2767
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,040
this

2768
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:57,840
this is this using uh

2769
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:59,840
automated engineering this mass

2770
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:03,440
imagineering type of thing

2771
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:08,400
pretty so cool reminds me of doing more

2772
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:11,679
with less and also bucky um

2773
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:15,119
so maybe we can just each have a final

2774
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:17,600
thought or a final area that we want to

2775
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:19,119
explore a little bit

2776
01:46:19,119 --> 01:46:20,239
next week

2777
01:46:20,239 --> 01:46:21,679
and then otherwise this has been an

2778
01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:22,880
awesome

2779
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:24,159
discussion

2780
01:46:24,159 --> 01:46:27,159
so

2781
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:29,119
um

2782
01:46:29,119 --> 01:46:30,560
you just think for a few seconds for

2783
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:32,639
what would what would be our what was

2784
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:33,760
something that will stick with us from

2785
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:36,080
today or where do we want to take it in

2786
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:41,119
our dot two so um scott first then dean

2787
01:46:41,119 --> 01:46:42,800
i really like that

2788
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:44,719
concluding thought on that really feels

2789
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:46,320
like that

2790
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:49,440
conversion of labor and attention and

2791
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:50,719
skills

2792
01:46:50,719 --> 01:46:53,920
and the into embodied our embodied world

2793
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:55,600
and that feels like that dynamic is

2794
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:57,040
going to be very interesting to continue

2795
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:59,360
to explore in that last diagram there

2796
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:01,040
those pathways and the complementary

2797
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,520
pathways are fascinating and thank you

2798
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:07,639
for fantastic discussion

2799
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:09,679
thank you scott dean

2800
01:47:09,679 --> 01:47:11,440
yeah i just wanted to i have to read

2801
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:13,440
this because i was listening and

2802
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:14,880
thinking about what i wanted to close

2803
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:17,360
with um my takeaway today

2804
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:19,440
besides the fact that i've got a new

2805
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,520
reference with embedded jet boots that

2806
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,679
i'm gonna have to go and and try to hold

2807
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:25,760
myself down with um

2808
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:27,360
is that perhaps life is an

2809
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,960
apprenticeship

2810
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:32,320
uh in wayfinding across scales um

2811
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,159
so one of the things that i think that

2812
01:47:34,159 --> 01:47:35,760
we're trying to do in these live streams

2813
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:36,560
is

2814
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:39,360
popularize active inference we're trying

2815
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:42,080
to drive down the costs per se

2816
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:44,800
of that entry

2817
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:46,080
barrier

2818
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:47,360
and so

2819
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:49,199
these kind of interaction processes like

2820
01:47:49,199 --> 01:47:51,440
we're having today in this point one

2821
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:53,600
i think are giving us more of a sense of

2822
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:54,639
how that

2823
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:55,600
cost

2824
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:58,000
factor can be addressed

2825
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,520
um

2826
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:01,760
beyond a room full of academics which i

2827
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,440
think we all agree is kind of a small

2828
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:04,719
niche

2829
01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:06,320
and i think that's something that we're

2830
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:08,800
all trying to make available to more

2831
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:10,320
people so

2832
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:12,639
that last reference that you made

2833
01:48:12,639 --> 01:48:14,719
scott was actually pretty

2834
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:16,080
pretty helpful

2835
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:18,560
um i think one of the things that we try

2836
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:21,679
to do in terms of an interactionist

2837
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:24,000
uh forward approach is in the point

2838
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,639
zeros we deconstruct

2839
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:29,040
and the point ones we reconstruct and

2840
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:31,040
then in the point twos which is next

2841
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:32,560
tuesday which i'm unfortunately going to

2842
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:33,280
be

2843
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:34,400
on a

2844
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:36,080
i'm going to be away from but that's

2845
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:40,159
where the new or next superordinates

2846
01:48:40,159 --> 01:48:42,320
sort of emerge and so that i think the

2847
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:44,480
way that we're trying to set this up

2848
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:46,480
whether it's going to

2849
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:48,159
i don't know when when it's going to

2850
01:48:48,159 --> 01:48:49,440
sort of

2851
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:51,440
take off like when the jet boots will

2852
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:54,000
really be fired up but i think we're

2853
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,400
putting things in place for that

2854
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:59,119
to happen so i think on the one hand i

2855
01:48:59,119 --> 01:49:01,199
can i can kind of laugh about the fact

2856
01:49:01,199 --> 01:49:03,280
that i'm going to have to anchor myself

2857
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:05,840
but on the other half vladimir says

2858
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:07,600
anytime we can get creative with this

2859
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:08,560
stuff

2860
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:11,040
it's it's worthy it's it's enthusiasm

2861
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:13,360
worthy so thank you for sharing with us

2862
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:15,679
today i really appreciate it

2863
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:16,960
thank you dean

2864
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:20,400
um stephen and then blue

2865
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:22,159
thank you again yeah i really enjoyed it

2866
01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:25,599
today is a great great call and um

2867
01:49:25,599 --> 01:49:27,040
i'm going to take away the idea of

2868
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:30,239
situated entropy i think that's really

2869
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:31,920
useful

2870
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:33,920
and has a bit more a lot of legs to it

2871
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:36,159
and i'm really interested in more about

2872
01:49:36,159 --> 01:49:38,480
talking about pragmatic approaches to

2873
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:41,119
using the variation expected free energy

2874
01:49:41,119 --> 01:49:43,040
i think that goes beyond what was often

2875
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,000
maybe

2876
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,480
pragmatism which we've had here as a

2877
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:48,639
kind of philosophical thing but maybe

2878
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:51,280
pragmatics in terms of design and

2879
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:54,480
application so thank you brilliant

2880
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:57,920
more than just my closing thought is uh

2881

01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:04,000
this

2884
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,560
the past and present and future of that

2885
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:09,119
continuum or multi-dimensional space

2886
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:10,960
between craft and artisanship the

2887
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:12,880
boutique the bespoke

2888
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:14,639
