1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,719
three two one

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,800
hello and welcome to active inference

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,920
lab live stream number 27.0

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,800
it's august 23 2021 and we're going to

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,279
be discussing the paper active inference

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,960
applicability to different types of

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,960
social organization explained through

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,960
reference to industrial engineering and

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,119
quality management

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,359
so welcome to the active inference lab

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,760
we are a participatory online lab that

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,760
is communicating learning and practicing

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,920
applied active inference you can find us

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,760
at the links here on this slide

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,920
this is a recorded and archived live

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,600
stream so please provide us with

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,120
feedback so that we can improve on our

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,399
work

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,840
all backgrounds and perspectives are

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,320
welcome and we'll be following video

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,520
etiquette for lifestreams

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,520
at the short link you can find the

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,440
roadmap of the upcoming discussions that

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,199
we're going to be having and these are

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,960
going to be group discussions on august

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,480
24th tomorrow and then august 31st for

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,799
number 27.1 and 2

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,400
and hopefully the author will be joining

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,159
us for both discussions and we have some

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,640
openings in the coming weeks if you want

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,439
to

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,600
join for a session or if you want to

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,280
recommend somebody who should join

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,840
today in active stream 27.0 we're going

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,840
to be learning and discussing about this

36
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,040
paper with the aforementioned long title

37
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,000
by stephen fox and the link is here

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,520
and just like a lot of

39
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,079
um the other zero videos all of them

40
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,840
this video is just an introduction for

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,600
some of the ideas it's not a review or a

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,400
final word it's kind of always this

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,920
assemblage of

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,520
all of the participants here just

45
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,759
modifying the slides and going down a

46
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,439
few avenues that we thought were

47
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,960
interesting and

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,640
setting up some questions to discuss in

49
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,640
the dot one and dot two

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,640
so we'll go over the aims and the claims

51
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,240
of the paper and the abstract and

52
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,479
roadmap and then talk about keywords

53
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,560
then go through the figures and tables

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,520
so if you want to participate in these

55
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,000
group discussions tomorrow or

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,959
the following week then just let us know

57
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,280
or save and submit your questions

58
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,560
and get in touch with us if you want to

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,400
participate

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,640
so we can just start with

61
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,480
hello and then it will be cool to hear

62
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,080
from both of you what

63
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,640
drew you to the paper or what made you

64
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,480
interested in talking about it

65
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,120
i'm daniel and i'm in california

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,480
so whoever wants to go first

67
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,599
i'm blue and i'm a independent research

68
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,720
consultant in new mexico and um i liked

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,640
this paper it was a really like

70
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,040
refreshing kind of interesting um and

71
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,760
very readable perspective compared to a

72
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,800
lot of the other papers and um it made

73
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,160
some links with

74
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,599
industrial engineering which i thought

75
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,480
was

76
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,280
were interesting and um kind of like a a

77
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,840
new take on active inference and fep

78
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,440
dean i'm i'm up here in calgary and

79
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,040
what i found interesting about the paper

80
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,640
is just looking at it through the lens

81
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,319
of

82
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,480
engineering's uh

83
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,319
engineering's

84
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,720
priors i guess in terms of

85
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,800
what they would hold up as active

86
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
inference just because of what they do

87
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,239
every single day

88
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,040
um and again

89
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,360
that kind of juxtaposed with the social

90
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,040
piece was really interesting to me

91
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,000
because

92
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,080
not to over generalize but when you're

93
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,159
focusing on how to break something down

94
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,519
you don't tend to tend to look at the

95
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,120
holes so i thought that was really

96
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,440
interesting uh to try to pull those two

97
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,319
things together and make them coherent

98
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,400
i agree there's that discussion of the

99
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,720
interfaces between the engineered system

100
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,440
and

101
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,680
the actual way it's used in the niche

102
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,959
which i think we're going to return to

103
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,159
when we're talking about like a

104
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,720
bookshelf

105
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,959
so the paper is

106
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,439
the title the link are shown here

107
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,799
and uh

108
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,360
i guess uh maybe

109
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,040
do either if you want to just read the

110
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,080
first uh two aims and claims

111
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,439
sure

112
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,519
so the principal contribution of this

113
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,519
paper is to relate active inference

114
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,840
theory to everyday practice in social

115
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,279
organization

116
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,600
active inference is a cult

117
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,918
corollary of the free energy principle

118
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,759
which formalizes cognition in the

119
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,759
autopolitic organization of living

120
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,680
systems that resist the second law of

121
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,400
thermodynamics by occupying a limit

122
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,639
limited repertoire of states thus

123
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,800
persisting as bounded self-organizing

124
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,919
systems over time

125
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,880
okay and then i'll read the

126
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,520
last two then anyone can give a thought

127
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,280
it is explained throughout the paper how

128
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,280
industrial engineering and quality

129
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,360
management better enable social

130
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,520
organization to occupy a limited number

131
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,000
of states in order to persist as a

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,880
bounded self-organizing systems over

133
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,199
time rather than dissipating into their

134
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,880
surrounding environment

135
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,039
although previous papers by others have

136
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,960
encompassed active inference up to the

137
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,840
levels of sociocultural cognition this

138
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,759
is the first paper to address active

139
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,840
inference in everyday organizational

140
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
practice including industrial

141
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,440
engineering and quality management

142
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,880
so the paper is setting up to be just

143
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,039
like one more plank towards applying

144
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,960
active inference bridging some of the

145
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,240
practices that are already in use in

146
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,600
the fields that we're going to be

147
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,199
exploring like the quality management

148
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,280
and industrial engineering and then sort

149
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,199
of the adjacent possible for what kinds

150
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,759
of systems could exist in those domains

151
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,639
so

152
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,360
sometimes we have a more mathematical

153
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,039
paper or more

154
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,720
philosophical paper this one's going to

155
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,560
use a lot more of the jargon

156
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,720
and like dean said the priors of

157
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,479
engineering so that's why it's kind of

158
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,840
cool to hear about it

159
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,039
daniel can i add something to that yep

160
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,880
yeah i just think it's interesting that

161
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,360
i think we

162
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,240
to use a bridging metaphor is seems just

163
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,800
to be a really easy thing to do

164
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,240
and then i think what what the paper

165
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,160
in terms of the aims and the claims does

166
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,680
is tries to point out where that

167
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,080
that connection might exist

168
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,960
and we can always argue whether or not

169
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,039
it exists in all

170
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,759
situations at all times but i i do think

171
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,639
that there are some times again when

172
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,280
we can hold a static

173
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,120
connection between

174
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,280
an idea of one scale and an idea at

175
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,520
another scale and so

176
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,199
not all scales

177
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,280
allow for that or have those affordances

178
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,360
but sometimes they do so i mean that

179
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,039
part of it

180
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,280
maybe what we need to do is separate the

181
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,960
times when

182
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,719
the metaphor works and when it doesn't

183
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,599
agree being utilitarian implies some

184
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,960
sort of utility metric

185
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,599
having a preference for reward or for

186
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,759
preferred states implies those being

187
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,599
defined maybe and also i think this will

188
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,880
come up

189
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,479
in this paper

190
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,160
because it's all about which are the

191
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,400
useful metrics to check up on useful

192
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,000
policies to pursue

193
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,960
okay

194
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,000
so

195
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,919
does anyone want to read abstract one

196
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,280
i'll read it

197
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,039
active inference is a physics of life

198
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,039
process theory of perception action and

199
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,520
learning that's applicable to natural

200
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,000
and artificial agents in the paper

201
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,520
active inference theories related to

202
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,360
different types of practice

203
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,440
in social organization here the term

204
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,120
social organization

205
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,199
is used to clarify that this paper does

206
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,400
not encompass organization in biological

207
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,319
systems

208
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,759
rather the paper addresses active

209
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,160
inference and social organization that

210
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,879
utilizes industrial engineering

211
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,400
quality management and artificial

212
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,479
intelligence alongside human

213
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,840
intelligence

214
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,840
social organization referred to in this

215
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,120
paper

216
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,199
can be in private companies public

217
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,879
institutions other for-profit or

218
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,720
not-for-profit organizations and any

219
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,879
combination of them the relevance of

220
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,879
active inference theory is explained in

221
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,560
terms of variation free energy

222
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,000
prediction errors

223
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,520
generative models

224
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,560
and markup blankets

225
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,199
pretty interesting i think usually when

226
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,039
we talk about these multi-scale

227
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,199
perspectives on institutions cities

228
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,400
societies

229
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,599
it's always like

230
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,159
the entire edifice all of the niche and

231
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,839
everything that's moving in it is part

232
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,559
of this one biological organism

233
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,519
and

234
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,599
or at least biological co-regulating

235
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,958
system and here it's very explicit that

236
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,000
it's trimming the biological component

237
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,480
from the engineered component it's kind

238
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,279
of like the car and then the passenger

239
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,800
so then instead of just saying well the

240
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,080
car and the passengers are part of the

241
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,399
same extended cognitive niche because

242
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,040
that's one way to look at that situation

243
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,120
like it's a extended affordance that the

244
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,040
driver has

245
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,959
another way to think of it is by making

246
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,959
a very clean partitioning

247
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,160
recognizing that there's still this

248
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,760
immersion function like cars don't drive

249
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,240
themselves but you can still parse out

250
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,320
the individual who's using the car from

251
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,760
the design process of making the car

252
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
and one one thing that's added to that

253
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,279
if you haven't read

254
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,440
lucy and i'll always kill her last name

255
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,080
lucy suckman s-u-c-h-m-a

256
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,160
she's got a book out many years ago that

257
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,839
i think has still got some

258
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,120
incredible shelf life it's called um

259
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,120
it's reconfiguring the human machine

260
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,480
interface

261
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,640
and if you haven't read it it's a

262
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,880
fantastic book in terms of

263
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,480
looking at how

264
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
her case study is how people

265
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,040
walk up to a photocopying machine for

266
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,120
the first time where the engineers

267
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,760
are trying to make it intuitive and how

268
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,160
the human interface with that isn't

269
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,080
always necessarily something that you

270
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,959
can

271
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,399
engineer for

272
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,240
so something to consider if you're

273
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,760
looking at this

274
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,839
this

275
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,600
if i could just give another thought i

276
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,560
think that um the uncoupling of social

277
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,560
organization from biological

278
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,200
organization is kind of a really like

279
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,760
unique and fresh perspective

280
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,600
compared to some of the other papers

281
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,200
that we've looked at i mean especially

282
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,880
considering that like

283
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,720
i mean it is biological organization

284
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,560
because it's happening in in biological

285
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,800
creatures but it's it's an interesting

286
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,760
like partition that the author creates

287
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,040
to um

288
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,399
make it

289
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,079
known that it's not talking about

290
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,360
hierarchical

291
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,959
organization in structures or societies

292
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,959
yep so we don't need to worry about

293
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,519
what's inside of the tissues and go into

294
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,880
the biological

295
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,040
organization okay i'll read the second

296
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,480
abstract and then anyone can give a

297
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,519
thought

298
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,079
active inference theory is most relevant

299
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,920
to the social organization of work that

300
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,680
is highly repetitive

301
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,160
by contrast there are more challenges

302
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,839
involved in applying active inference

303
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,920
theory for social organization of less

304
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,760
repetitive endeavors such as

305
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
one-of-a-kind projects

306
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,240
these challenges need to be addressed in

307
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,160
order for active inference to provide a

308
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,560
unifying framework for different types

309
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,640
of social organization employing human

310
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,000
and artificial intelligence

311
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,560
so i have a thought on that

312
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,320
it might be somewhat controversial but

313
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,360
um

314
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,320
you know

315
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,120
so

316
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,839
i think that um the highly repetitive so

317
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,360
i mean i think about active inference in

318
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,320
terms of exploration and exploitation

319
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,480
and i think like it really depends on on

320
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,800
where your generative model rests right

321
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,399
so like is the generative model like the

322
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,399
model of the organization or is it the

323
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,079
model of the individual because i i

324
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,240
think that um doing a highly repetitive

325
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,279
project that reminds me of exploitation

326
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,160
where like a one-off project can be like

327
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,399
exploration like so so you can still

328
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,120
like update your model depending on on

329
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,360
exploring some new avenue by this little

330
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,760
side project but like you come back to

331
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,200
updating your model the model of your

332
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,120
business yourself the way that you work

333
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,480
your organization

334
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,800
with knowledge about about how to do

335
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,160
processes in a one-off kind of process

336
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,320
i agree

337
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,680
especially because we talk about it a

338
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,320
lot in the context of generating

339
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,959
strategic novelties perhaps

340
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,000
and those are seemingly less repetitive

341
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,079
um but

342
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,000
i think there's gonna be um some further

343
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,600
clarification on that

344
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,800
and also this points to this uh yeah

345
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,279
exciting areas like one shot learning or

346
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,519
like true structural novelty and active

347
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,120
inference models that's something that

348
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,680
we've talked about in other areas like

349
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,040
how do you know when to be tweaking the

350
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,880
knobs of the parameters as you currently

351
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,680
have them set up versus expand a hidden

352
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,160
state into two types of hidden state or

353
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,440
something like that

354
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,440
again thinking about what the system is

355
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,120
realistically or from this

356
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,720
instrumentalist way okay

357
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,320
the roadmap

358
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,880
is written out here

359
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,800
and it's a

360
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,360
we're gonna go through it in rough order

361
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,000
it introduces in each of these sections

362
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,839
one of the kind of key ideas or

363
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,160
principles the variational free energy

364
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,000
prediction errors generative models

365
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,440
markov blankets

366
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,639
and survival

367
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,240
and then in section seven active

368
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,320
inference is proposed as a unifying

369
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,079
framework so this is kind of one of

370
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,040
those classic paper layouts with some

371
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,680
disciplinary sections one through n

372
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,360
disciplinary sections

373
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,320
and then

374
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,560
uh the next section is active inference

375
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,720
as a unifying framework and then the

376
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,800
next section is like challenges or

377
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,199
current research directions and then a

378
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,399
concluding section maybe with a more um

379
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,360
call to action or more philosophical

380
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,320
uh liftoff

381
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,320
there were a bunch of keywords and i

382
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,199
think we're going to get to all of them

383
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,880
um so two columns of keywords

384
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,279
uh let me shrink the video

385
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,839
two columns secured okay

386
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:04,560
so

387
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,760
first

388
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,040
active inference

389
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,360
uh it's in the title of the paper and

390
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,360
here's how it's written in the paper who

391
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,279
wants to read the large text here

392
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,800
i got it

393
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,040
uh active inference is the physics of

394
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,440
life process theory of perception action

395
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,720
and learning

396
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,959
active inference generates predictions

397
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,720
active inference predictions are based

398
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,240
on knowledge learned from past

399
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,480
situations and perceptions of present

400
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,040
situations active inference minimizes

401
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,880
errors between actions that are planned

402
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,480
through the inference of predictions and

403
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
what happens when the planned actions

404
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,399
are taken

405
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,600
so this is the first lines of the paper

406
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,760
right in the introduction that's how it

407
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,360
begins with no

408
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,360
active inference is the first word so

409
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,079
that's sort of the opening shot and

410
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,360
it's just a cool

411
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,600
framing

412
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,199
to bring it out as a physics of life

413
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,199
process theory

414
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,040
yet this isn't about biological

415
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,519
organization so it's almost like

416
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,600
recognizing the origins

417
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,440
and some of the motivations for the kind

418
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,120
of modeling that active inference

419
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,160
provides

420
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,040
yet making another later decision to

421
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,959
partition the system of interest a

422
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,360
certain way so cool framing and then the

423
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,720
uh next

424
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,240
lines so kind of shrinking that

425
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,399
definition of active inference

426
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,600
um

427
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,560
this is because prediction errors

428
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,399
cause unwanted surprise

429
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,720
surprises which individually or

430
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,199
accumulatively can threaten survival by

431
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,720
going beyond the limited number of

432
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,040
states in which survival is possible by

433
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,759
contrast minimizing prediction errors

434
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,680
facilitates survival through least

435
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,680
action

436
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,759
so this is also linking up several of

437
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,320
those key terms that are going to be

438
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,360
section headers later but it's just this

439
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,480
idea that um

440
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,959
predictions about the external world

441
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,399
especially if they incorporate

442
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,040
preferences that are optimistic

443
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,199
help reduce the complexity of deciding

444
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,440
which actions to take and then the way

445
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,279
that that gets operationalized is with

446
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,839
the process theory of prediction error

447
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,759
minimization which is

448
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,600
a real-time estimate of how good the

449
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,040
generative model is performing

450
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,399
and then just

451
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,639
add anything or

452
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,639
say more here but

453
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,240
it's just an interesting

454
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,959
topic how it's described as the

455
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,639
principle of survival through least

456
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,320
action

457
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,199
so

458
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,399
what is this principle of least action

459
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,199
and

460
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,959
how do we reconcile

461
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,079
active biological agents

462
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,040
as being in one way participating under

463
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,120
this survival through least action even

464
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,399
if it's just a misnomer what does that

465
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,920
really mean

466
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,000
and then how does survival through least

467
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,040
action

468
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,240
contrast or overlap with

469
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,720
more familiar phrasing probably survival

470
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,400
of the fittest like

471
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,640
is the survival of the fittest the

472
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,480
survival of the least

473
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,199
active or how should we read this

474
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,959
relationship between

475
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,679
uh maybe darwinian conceptions of

476
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,959
fitness and which individuals survive

477
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,919
versus this physics based

478
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,520
framing of survival through at least

479
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,799
action under the

480
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,199
principles of least action

481
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,039
stationary action principle that's

482
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,200
something daniel yeah

483
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,640
yeah so i think it's interesting that

484
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,440
you

485
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,880
depending on how you define each of

486
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,400
these terms

487
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,880
that you can you can sort of

488
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,000
transfer or oscillate across frame what

489
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,880
a frame is which to me is

490
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,120
identifying a focal point maybe a margin

491
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,760
or a limit and what if it is what goes

492
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,440
inside the other like

493
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,520
glove and hand or hand and glove and i

494
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,520
think sometimes we talk about

495
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,280
a niche fit

496
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,520
but that's that's different than a what

497
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,919
the frame of the niche is

498
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,320
so the fact that we're we're sort of

499
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,640
ping-ponging back and forth

500
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,039
between the two i just wonder whether or

501
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,640
not

502
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,320
we're looking at the same thing or if we

503
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,080
realize we're looking at two things at

504
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,320
once

505
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,760
nice

506
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,240
continuing on with the introduction

507
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,760
it's written

508
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,679
active inference is a corollary of the

509
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,760
free energy principle fep which

510
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,720
formalizes cognition of the autopoetic

511
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,880
organization of living systems

512
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,840
within fep active systems must occupy a

513
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,160
limited repertoire of states this

514
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,919
requires minimizing the long-term

515
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,679
average of surprise associated with

516
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,840
sensory exchanges with the world

517
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,679
minimizing surprise enables them to

518
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,480
resist a natural tendency toward

519
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,240
two disorder

520
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,120
so

521
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,520
this just kind of relates to some

522
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,880
questions like

523
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,280
how do framings for this sort of active

524
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,880
intelligent behavior

525
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
what other framings exist

526
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,400
and how do we think about

527
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,720
broad concepts like reward preference

528
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,840
and curiosity and surprise in active

529
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,320
inference

530
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,559
um and then the last paragraph then any

531
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,640
thoughts or not surprise rests on

532
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,720
predictions about sensations

533
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,799
which depend on an internal generative

534
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,480
model of the world

535
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,320
in particular although surprise cannot

536
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,799
be measured directly a free energy bound

537
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,120
on surprise can be suggesting that

538
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,440
agents minimize free energy by changing

539
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,280
their predictions about what sensory

540
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,440
inputs will come from actions or by

541
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,200
changing the predicted sensory inputs

542
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,160
through changing action

543
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,120
this just reminds me of the kind of

544
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,039
fundamental uh

545
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,799
pairing in active inference where the

546
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,480
ways that you can go down that free

547
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,720
energy gradient are either by updating

548
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,360
parameters of your internal model

549
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,440
learning development or

550
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,679
by updating action states

551
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,360
which is through action because you

552
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,760
can't control external states directly

553
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,440
and you can't control the incoming

554
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,600
sensory data directly

555
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,640
then all you can do is control those two

556
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,000
states that are under your control the

557
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,039
internal states and action states

558
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,919
all right another term was the markov

559
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:24,880
blanket

560
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,600
so anyone want to just like

561
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,400
give what what's what's the markov uh

562
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,640
101 or what's

563
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,960
what's the way in which mark-up blankets

564
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,640
came into play in this paper or in

565
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,760
another context

566
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,360
so

567
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,679
um marco blankets are essentially the

568
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,440
the boundary or or how how a system

569
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,280
creates a boundary and how you can

570
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,600
define essentially like a

571
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,880
non-equilibrium steady state system with

572
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,960
a martal blanket um i thought it was an

573
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,080
interesting

574
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,720
um play in this paper and i think maybe

575
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,679
we'll unpack it here in later on in the

576
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,559
in the intro video

577
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,400
we just in number 26 talked a bunch

578
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,520
about markov blankets so suffice to say

579
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,280
that there's um

580
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,000
it's still open exactly which cases

581
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,760
which sense of the markov blanket is

582
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,240
meant on this continuum from analytical

583
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,080
and mathematical with markov og blanket

584
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,240
the bayesian statistical generalization

585
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,559
by pearl and others and then this

586
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,880
partitioning into incoming sensory and

587
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
outgoing active states of the blanket by

588
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,120
fristen and others and then how that

589
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,640
exactly relates to all these other

590
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,159
topics that we're

591
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,640
discussing

592
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,159
okay i'll play the video at um 46

593
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,480
seconds blue what was exciting to you

594
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,000
about this

595
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,640
uh so this is the video um from the

596
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,520
tesla ai day that just happened last

597
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,440
week and this is um

598
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,080
it's a humanoid um

599
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,320
robot that uh tesla is going to attempt

600
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,600
to design

601
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,360
um and so i just pulled this definition

602
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,159
of artificial intelligence from um

603
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,760
like google and it said the theory and

604
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,520
development of computer systems able to

605
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,000
perform tasks that normally require

606
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,520
human intelligence such as visual

607
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,919
perception speech recognition decision

608
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,640
making and translation between languages

609
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,799
and and so spoiler alert uh this is

610
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,720
actually not uh not a robot this is

611
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,640
actually like a person um but but he

612
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,159
made it you know look like a robot that

613
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,000
was getting up and then like bam i'm

614
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,600
gonna dance but i think like that kind

615
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,000
of movement and perception about about

616
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,159
space that kind of spatial awareness is

617
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,679
something that's still

618
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,799
very much a challenge for um ai so so

619
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,158
that's why i threw this video in there

620
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,799
agreed will be interesting to see how

621
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,320
they do

622
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,159
processing and what kinds of algorithms

623
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,320
and hardware and software end up being

624
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,360
used for real-time robotics systems

625
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,280
any comments on

626
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,360
artificial intelligence or or

627
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,158
anything dean

628
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,480
again i

629
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
don't spend a whole lot of time on this

630
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,480
because to me artificial intelligence is

631
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,360
always a it's always a post-hoc domain

632
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,000
even this example um

633
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,080
can we create a copy of this

634
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,159
so i mean it's already been done by

635
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,400
something and now we're trying to

636
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,520
re-engineer it or

637
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,200
re-develop it as opposed to what active

638
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,799
inference is which is

639
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,799
the inclusion of ad-hoc the what if so

640
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,400
i mean if they can get artificial

641
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,360
intelligence to a place that it's

642
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,240
it's including what if in that in the

643
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,200
truest sense of all possibilities then

644
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,960
i'll probably

645
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,360
be quite excited or scared i'm not sure

646
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,000
which

647
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,960
nice

648
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,559
so

649
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,480
some other keywords were social and

650
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,080
organization

651
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,600
and one of the

652
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,480
goal statements of the paper was

653
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,559
this paper is intended to contribute to

654
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,240
bridging the gap between theoretical

655
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,559
papers in active inference theory which

656
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,640
have been reported to be too opaque to

657
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,480
be understood widely

658
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,799
and potential application opportunities

659
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,799
in the multi-intelligence social

660
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,159
organization

661
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,919
that being social organization that

662
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,000
employs human intelligence and different

663
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,240
types of artificial intelligence

664
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,039
so

665
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,440
and whoever put this image what did it

666
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,120
mean or represent in the context of the

667
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,720
paper

668
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,120
so i i just looked so i didn't

669
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,400
i don't know that it's necessarily

670
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,919
really in the context of the paper but i

671
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,480
i started to look into like how are

672
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,120
societies organized right and so this is

673
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,480
like i just was doing some googling and

674
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,320
i thought that this was an interesting

675
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,880
um paper and the title and the author

676
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,320
there in the small print if you're able

677
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,600
to read them but

678
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,919
this uh is like a um a state

679
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,159
organization right and and it's you know

680
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,039
describes the fascist media model model

681
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,240
as focusing on community and culture

682
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,120
and it describes the communist uh media

683
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,840
model as focusing on state bureaucracy

684
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,080
and the liberal media model as focusing

685
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,159
on market exchange which i just i just

686
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,919
thought was interesting and just kind of

687
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,400
an interesting way to um

688
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,279
to

689
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,039
i don't know reflect on societal

690
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,720
organization and what what is the

691
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,840
central

692
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,799
theme there

693
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,840
and it's uh kind of in line with that

694
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,400
partitioning of the kind of the car from

695
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,440
the user because not included here are

696
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,520
like the human users this is kind of

697
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,640
everything but the eyes on the tv this

698
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,400
is just partitioning the the structure

699
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
of the organization as an engineered

700
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,520
object

701
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,360
so that's a cool um

702
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,120
similarity

703
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,720
yeah

704
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,640
so we just had a guest stream and and

705
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,960
pranav and raphael

706
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,640
even they were debating

707
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,120
can we can we say that something that's

708
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,240
an emergent property in an individual

709
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,080
which is then something that we can test

710
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,480
as an emerging property within a dyad

711
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,559
can also become an emerging property

712
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,600
within these high variability states and

713
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,719
even they couldn't agree

714
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,919
that there's there's some sort of a

715
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,440
a parallel

716
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,880
i think we know that on these high

717
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,240
variability states like a social

718
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,000
organization

719
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,320
afterwards again we can

720
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,799
we can take an account of what it became

721
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,039
but we it's really hard to know

722
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,720
where it's going even if you break it

723
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,640
down into a

724
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,440
communist or or a fascist

725
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,840
direction it's telling us like you say

726
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,760
what what direction the high down the

727
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,559
highway the car is going but that but

728
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,720
beyond that it's still a lot of guessing

729
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,960
yep

730
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,600
so i guess that's where industrial

731
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,840
engineering comes into play for that

732
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,799
designing for that car on the highway

733
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,039
industrial engineering involves applying

734
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,919
methods such as task analysis and job

735
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:58,880
design

736
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,960
in order to predict results evaluate

737
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,480
results and improve results from

738
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,880
processes during their development

739
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,400
the application of industrial

740
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,240
engineering has been progressing around

741
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,039
the world since the 1900s

742
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,640
so

743
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,520
wasn't an area i was too familiar with i

744
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,760
saw a lot of mention of the 99 out of

745
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,399
100 and the three standard deviations

746
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,640
and then halt the process

747
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,960
so that kind of just was an interesting

748
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,919
uh thing to hear about

749
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,640
any thoughts or we can continue on

750
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,480
okay as i guess a related field of

751
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,480
industrial engineering is quality

752
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,840
management

753
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,279
and so this is a type of system

754
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,200
that involves i guess hardware and

755
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,240
software and behavioral protocols

756
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,399
quality management systems qms involve

757
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,159
documenting processes which have been

758
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,919
developed through industrial engineering

759
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,480
as process specifications work

760
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,320
procedures etc

761
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,480
monitoring processes for conformance to

762
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,799
specifications etc and using

763
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,720
observations of non-conformances to

764
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,480
inform the further development of

765
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,120
processes both industrial engineering

766
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,440
and qms are focused on the continuous

767
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,600
improvement of processes the application

768
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,039
of industrial engineering has been

769
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,480
progressing around the world since the

770
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,640
1900s in quality management since the

771
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,600
1950s

772
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,399
any thoughts on that

773
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,000
just having been a business owner it's

774
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,760
uh you know it's it's a process

775
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,000
yep definitely makes me think about uh

776
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,480
precision of measurement changing and

777
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,919
then

778
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,919
what can be measured and what can be

779
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,200
measured gets entrapped and then what

780
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,159
can be regulated becomes gamed and all

781
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,399
these sort of complex ways that

782
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,720
assessment of performance

783
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,799
fits one into local versus

784
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,679
global optima

785
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,720
you can also see how instructionalism

786
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,799
got systematized

787
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,720
yep if there's a way to do it and this

788
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,559
is the way that's approved

789
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,360
um even if the later becomes like a you

790
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,120
know an improvement in the protocol or

791
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,440
some sort of uh change in the context

792
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,200
maybe it can't be utilized because it's

793
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,440
not part of the approved version

794
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,480
and so

795
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,399
there's no simple answer there because

796
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,000
you can't just say well okay accept all

797
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,840
changes and then if you just say okay

798
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,240
we'll have a small bar for making edits

799
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,320
it's like there's no perfect trade-off

800
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,159
point with the false positives and the

801
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,520
false negatives

802
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,440
especially for situations that truly are

803
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,399
ambiguous

804
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,880
which is why we fall back to these

805
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,120
approaches that put us at

806
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,200
the kind of functional inflection point

807
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,520
of the pragmatic and epistemic outcomes

808
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,360
which is like active inference rather

809
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,279
than just pursuing reward

810
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,760
over short term or over some other time

811
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,000
frame

812
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,159
but common to all these different

813
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,799
frameworks for control theory is

814
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,760
basically statistical process control

815
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,880
so

816
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,960
maybe whoever made this slide was it

817
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,520
yeah blue go for it

818
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,760
so statistical process control is a

819
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,399
collection of tools and techniques used

820
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,360
to measure and analyze process data in

821
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,120
order to characterize the behavior of

822
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,679
our processes and achieve process

823
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,039
control

824
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,880
and so in the paper i don't know how

825
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,919
much

826
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,200
we'll get into it here but the paper

827
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,360
really describes statistical process

828
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,240
control and gives a figure similar to

829
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,000
this so you have normal process

830
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,799
variation which they described as six

831
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,760
sigma uh deviation from whatever is

832
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,440
optimal so there's the optimal which is

833
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,360
like the green line and then three sigma

834
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,360
to the up and three sigmas to the down

835
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,080
as to like an over or under estimate or

836
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,320
of your you know target

837
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,559
and then anytime that you have a process

838
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,600
that deviates from the six sigma range

839
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,399
you um have this special cause variation

840
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,880
and and so like in like

841
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,399
the business

842
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,000
schema that i'm familiar with at least

843
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,640
which is minimal but some um you know

844
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,880
you have you do this root cause analysis

845
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,679
like why is there this special cause

846
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,080
variation like what is what happened in

847
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,799
that um in that one circumstance we have

848
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,279
to go and analyze that instance to find

849
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,519
out why it was outside of the sigma

850
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,960
deviation because it's just like that's

851
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,320
an unacceptable data point at that point

852
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,360
nice good explanation

853
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,919
how about thermodynamic entropy

854
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,080
uh also um

855
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,399
this was also me but um it's a quantity

856
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,039
representing the unavailability of a

857
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,519
system's thermal energy for conversion

858
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,399
into mechanical work often interpreted

859
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,279
as the degree of disorder or randomness

860
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,120
in the system

861
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,039
and so you know there's the law of

862
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,120
thermodynamics that says that entropy in

863
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,679
the universe is always increasing so

864
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,039
um becoming going from

865
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,320
more ordered to less ordered or so from

866
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,080
highly ordered to more disordered which

867
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,080
this kind of shows in this example uh

868
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,159
things spreading apart and like it's

869
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,240
like you would if you left town for two

870
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,440
years and you came back and found that

871
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,960
your house was a mess that wouldn't

872
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,480
really be surprising like even if you

873
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,720
left it clean even if you know i mean

874
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,480
just things deteriorate and fall apart

875
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,120
and dust goes in and whatever rodents

876
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,840
creep around and stuff like that

877
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,159
and it's that apparent

878
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,399
and empirical local organization of

879
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,960
matter like into bones and flesh and

880
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,480
life and whatnot

881
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,880
and also the always and only

882
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,640
co-occurrence of that kind of local

883
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,760
organization of energy with cybernetic

884
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,159
or anticipatory behavior

885
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,080
that's what motivates a kind of

886
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,880
framework that is going to on one hand

887
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,840
work for particles but also work for

888
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,000
active particles and all of the

889
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,399
continuum between so that's why there's

890
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,320
all these different cognitive structures

891
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,480
as well as physical structures that are

892
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,399
being linked together through basically

893
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:53,440
physics

894
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,919
and by hooking to free energy principle

895
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,840
and variational methods and all these

896
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,640
other areas of math and physics then it

897
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,799
puts active inference just like one step

898
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,960
closer towards embodiment on some of

899
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,720
those different

900
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,720
pathways

901
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,440
okay

902
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,960
information theoretic entropy

903
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,000
uh so this is the the shannon entropy as

904
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,600
it's often referred to because it was i

905
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,840
think first described by claude shannon

906
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,720
um but i always put uh maxwell's demon

907
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,200
here when i'm thinking about relating

908
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,760
thermodynamic energy and informational

909
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,320
entropy and i think was it alex kiefer

910
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,080
wrote a paper that really

911
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,919
we did in one of the live streams that

912
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,080
really kind of outlined how these are

913
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,600
connected with the helmholtz

914
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,279
distribution and so if you really want

915
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,919
to dig deeper into these relationships

916
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,200
um that's a good way to do it but i

917
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,720
always think about you know so maxwell's

918
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,200
demon is is the idea that you know if

919
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,279
you have molecules like shown on the

920
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,360
left here in you know this box and you

921
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,799
have two sides of the box and there's a

922
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,000
partition

923
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,600
in the center and like the you know

924
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,000
they're cold and hot molecules

925
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,320
so if you knew which molecule was hot

926
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,799
and which molecule was cold so the demon

927
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,880
is sitting there who can see is the

928
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,440
molecule hot or cold and only lets the

929
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,440
hot ones go through to the right and

930
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,800
only lets the cold ones go through to

931
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,639
the left and every time he opens the

932
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,839
partition

933
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,719
effectively that is is work

934
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,679
and so just kind of conceptually um

935
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,079
that like shows that that the

936
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,079
relationship between information and

937
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,399
work the more information you have

938
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,040
the less work you have to do maybe so

939
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
that's kind of the relationship that i

940
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,040
think about in my mind

941
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,800
and then there's a formal definition of

942
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,679
shannon entropy um down below but it's

943
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,719
usually

944
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,800
given in informational context as a

945
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,239
measure of surprise as we've talked

946
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,960
about on the live stream many times and

947
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,280
they relate information as negative

948
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,760
entropy so it's the the reverse

949
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,719
surprises the reverse of uh surprise or

950
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,239
sorry information is the reverse of

951
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,560
surprise

952
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,359
cool thanks for the explanation dean any

953
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,040
thoughts on that

954
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,960
yeah one of the things i i mean i love

955
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,880
this thanks blue because thank you for

956
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,880
that explanation it's really it's really

957
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,720
good so one of the people i'm reading

958
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,400
right now is a

959
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,040
guy by the name of dan siegel and his

960
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,040
book about the mind and what he talks

961
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,640
about is

962
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,599
um when people are at dis ease so not in

963
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,520
an easy state but when they're when

964
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,880
they're struggling with something he

965
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,280
talks about the fact that there's one of

966
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,680
two ends of a continuum be it blue and

967
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,400
red

968
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,119
in this example one one end is chaos and

969
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,240
the other is

970
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,760
rigidity

971
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,960
and so from an information theoretic

972
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,320
entropy state are we stuck are we bored

973
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,960
are we feeling trapped or are we being

974
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,520
overwhelmed or underwhelmed

975
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,000
meaning we're we're

976
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
we're not in that in between state and

977
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,760
so i think that

978
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,760
i think there's a lot there's a lot that

979
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,800
can be done if we get a basic understand

980
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,280
understanding of maxwell's demon without

981
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,640
sort of getting

982
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,598
scared off by it

983
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,880
cool it's almost like um yeah what would

984
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,480
these particles and their temperature

985
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,720
represent if they were i don't know

986
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,720
ideas or something more related to

987
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,240
inference rather than just particles

988
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,920
because we're always looking at that

989
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,359
intersection between the physical

990
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:23,440
systems and the informational systems

991
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,440
all right

992
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,680
variational free energy

993
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,960
so this keyword was defined in the paper

994
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,400
as the difference between predicted

995
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,040
sensory inputs and actual sensory inputs

996
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,760
when monitoring processes

997
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,440
um

998
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,119
vfe increases as the difference

999
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,640
increases between what is predicted to

1000
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,400
happen if actions are taken and what

1001
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,160
does not hap what does happen when those

1002
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,240
actions are taken the more prediction

1003
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,160
errors there are the more thermodynamic

1004
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,320
energy will be consumed amidst the

1005
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,400
thermodynamic entropy of remedial

1006
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,640
actions corrective actions restorative

1007
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,040
actions and firefighting this will leave

1008
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,359
less thermodynamic energy available for

1009
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,520
doing productive work comprising

1010
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,040
productive actions

1011
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,119
thus if the variational free energy is

1012
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,160
high then thermodynamic entropy eg

1013
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,760
energy not available for doing

1014
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,920
productive work will be high and the

1015
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,839
thermodynamic free energy

1016
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,000
eg energy available for doing productive

1017
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
work will be low

1018
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,760
hence variational free energy can have

1019
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,440
an inverse relationship

1020
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,520
to thermodynamic free energy

1021
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,280
this is because the bigger a prediction

1022
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,440
error which can be considered in terms

1023
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,000
of bigger vfe the smaller can be the

1024
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,160
thermodynamic free energy available to

1025
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,440
do productive work so this is a pretty

1026
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,119
interesting

1027
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,800
passage did either of you have a thought

1028
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,040
on it

1029
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,480
um

1030
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,440
it's exploring this thermo thermo info

1031
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,560
nexus in a little bit of a different way

1032
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,599
and

1033
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,599
on one hand it's kind of confusing that

1034
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,240
the variational free energy

1035
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,079
is going to be the opposite of the

1036
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,320
thermodynamic free energy but it's

1037
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,280
almost like

1038
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,040
what is happening here and um it just

1039
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,880
to see that they have a negative

1040
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,880
relationship it's like if the engine

1041
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,680
were perfectly anticipatory and super

1042
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,280
efficient it would be carrying out a ton

1043
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,920
of work if it's moving in a super

1044
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,560
spurious heat producing way

1045
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,400
then the product a lot of variational

1046
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,760
free energy a lot of surprising

1047
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,200
observations

1048
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,839
relative to functional uh operation of

1049
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,480
the motor then your capacity to perform

1050
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,280
work

1051
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,599
to capture those very noisy vibrations

1052
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,000
is low and so a lot of the

1053
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,680
underlying

1054
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,400
uh potential becomes dissipated rather

1055
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,640
than used to perform kind of useful

1056
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,880
inference useful action so not sure if

1057
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,320
that's a correct

1058
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,839
mapping but i think it'll be cool to

1059
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,520
talk to the author because this is a

1060
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,440
very fascinating idea about how

1061
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,400
different

1062
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,720
formalizations of free energy um

1063
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
actually relate to modeling processes

1064
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,160
yeah blue

1065
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,320
so it's like i i really thought this was

1066
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,920
kind of what made me think of maxwell's

1067
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,359
demon right so

1068
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,000
it was interesting because you know the

1069
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,680
variational free energy when we talk

1070
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,240
about minimizing free energy we always

1071
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,760
think about like as minimizing surprise

1072
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,240
right so if we if we minimize surprise

1073
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,240
then then we don't have to do all this

1074
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,760
thermodynamic energy like the

1075
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,119
firefighting that they talked about and

1076
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,560
i think that the paper when we get into

1077
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,320
the five wise and that figure i think

1078
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,320
we'll elaborate a little bit more on

1079
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,000
that but um

1080
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,800
the

1081
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,160
it's just interesting because we don't

1082
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,839
have to output as much work and that's

1083
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,280
kind of what made me think about about

1084
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,520
maxwell's demon and kind of why i snuck

1085
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,599
that in there um but yeah you're right i

1086
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,520
don't know like you know i think that

1087
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,839
the relationship between

1088
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:40,720
um

1089
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,280
info dynamics and thermodynamics is

1090
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,440
still very much being defined there's a

1091
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,359
lot of very recent research um that's

1092
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,920
looking closely at how those two uh

1093
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,920
relate to one another

1094
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,680
nice dean

1095
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,040
yeah i just

1096
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,640
i immediately

1097
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,160
said to myself

1098
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,000
i really want my autonomic nervous

1099
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,520
system to work and i don't want to have

1100
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,440
to think about it because

1101
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,520
a lot of the mechanical things

1102
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,760
are dependent on that so

1103
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,200
i'm not

1104
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,000
i'm not sort of pulling apart what the

1105
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,280
claim is here

1106
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,800
but i think

1107
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,640
if you read that you're kind of saying

1108
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,599
okay

1109
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:17,840
um

1110
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,119
[Music]

1111
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,119
a lot of the surprise you're not even

1112
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,079
aware of because you're on an autonomic

1113
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,240
nervous system is functioning correctly

1114
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,000
great

1115
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,200
point there it's almost like a surprise

1116
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,480
variational surprise does not equate to

1117
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,880
attention or even especially the

1118
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,119
conscious awareness of

1119
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,200
attention in a human

1120
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,200
psychological situation

1121
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,760
so it's totally possible that like the

1122
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,240
difference in pressure sensing depending

1123
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,359
on your body's posture that's

1124
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,680
completely normalized out that's

1125
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,760
recalibrated for the expectations of

1126
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,920
body position

1127
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,839
without coming to our attention unless

1128
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,920
we bring it to our attention so that and

1129
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,400
many other similar examples

1130
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,800
so dean i love how you're like not able

1131
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,119
to to stay outside of the biological

1132
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,119
partition

1133
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:13,839
right

1134
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,040
well i i just i'm not again i'm not

1135
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,640
i want to be able to create with this

1136
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,839
stuff

1137
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:22,560
i mentioned that and so

1138
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,480
to me

1139
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,520
to willfully ignore that is hard for me

1140
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,920
to do i'm not saying it's not possible

1141
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,319
i'm not saying it's it's the right thing

1142
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:35,280
to do here i'm just struggling to let go

1143
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,119
of it i want to let go of it but i'm

1144
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,960
having a hard time with it well and i

1145
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,280
think for all of us you know the urge to

1146
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,240
apply

1147
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,160
to every system is very strong

1148
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,319
right here's table one so here's the

1149
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:51,920
mapping

1150
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,760
of a bunch of different sets of terms

1151
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,319
from active inference constructs

1152
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:57,599
and then thinking about how they're

1153
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,920
applied in industrial engineering and

1154
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,319
quality management practice so

1155
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,720
variational free energy which we just

1156
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,000
we're talking about

1157
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,599
is the difference between the predicted

1158
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,119
sensory inputs and actual sensory inputs

1159
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,920
the variational free energy upper bound

1160
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,240
as well as its lower bound is basically

1161
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,319
the range in which that system is

1162
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,079
working well it's like the loaves of

1163
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,319
bread are within the calibration range

1164
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,119
and we can just keep on pumping them out

1165
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:26,960
precision waiting

1166
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,560
has to do with which aspects of the

1167
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,480
process are monitored with which what

1168
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,160
level of precision

1169
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,640
for example which width of a part has to

1170
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,359
be machined in fractions of a millimeter

1171
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,839
versus other tolerances

1172
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,000
and then the expected free energy is the

1173
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,520
expected energy

1174
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,440
between the preferred sensory inputs

1175
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,200
from process operation

1176
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,920
and the actual sensory inputs

1177
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,920
so the variational free energy is the

1178
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,200
difference between the prediction and

1179
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,200
the actual so you have some generative

1180
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,040
model of your data center and then you

1181
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,319
have the generative model of the

1182
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:59,920
temperature through time

1183
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,240
and then the comparison with the actual

1184
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,599
but here it's about the preferred

1185
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,599
versus the actual

1186
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,160
so that's like we we we recognize that

1187
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,560
it is warmer than we would like it to be

1188
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,560
which is why we're conditioning our

1189
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,560
policy in the long range towards getting

1190
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,359
back to that zone but for now we need to

1191
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,760
also have an accurate sensor measurement

1192
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,920
so that's also a nice juxtaposition

1193
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,800
that's not always finessed in other

1194
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,200
papers

1195
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,520
the next and all these keywords the

1196
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,920
first set were about free energy and

1197
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,760
precision and how these terms are

1198
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,880
calculated relative to one another

1199
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,359
the second set of terms in table one

1200
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:42,960
is some of the

1201
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,359
key terms of bayesian statistics

1202
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,480
so just to read only the constructs um

1203
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,680
and these are also really helpful

1204
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,640
because

1205
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,040
we're as a lab thinking about what are

1206
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,200
the core terms of active inference what

1207
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,119
are the definitions that are general

1208
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:58,319
enough to be

1209
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,599
really

1210
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,400
educational but also not too limiting or

1211
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,319
prioritize one sense over another for

1212
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:08,000
example so the bayesian terms that would

1213
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,839
be found in any other course or textbook

1214
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,520
on bayesian statistics

1215
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,319
prior expected posterior actual

1216
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,040
posterior preferred posterior and

1217
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,359
prediction error

1218
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:20,839
so that kind of puts the predictive

1219
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:22,960
processing as a

1220
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,560
under the umbrella of bayesian

1221
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,560
statistics

1222
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,480
okay

1223
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,520
the next set of terms in the table

1224
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,760
was related to this dichotomy of two

1225
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,160
different types of inference so

1226
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,640
epistemic inference was defined as

1227
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,119
updating the definitions of process

1228
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,040
during process improvement based upon

1229
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,839
analysis of non-conformance reports

1230
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,920
whereas instrumental inference is

1231
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,839
updating which actions will be included

1232
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:51,520
in the process during process

1233
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,800
improvement

1234
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,040
so this is sort of like epistemic

1235
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,839
knowledge based this is about updating

1236
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,359
the knowledge

1237
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:02,000
based upon especially the times where

1238
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,599
things don't go right

1239
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,520
and then this is like

1240
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,240
policy inference action planning as

1241
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,920
inference because it's like

1242
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,440
instrumentally is actually like about

1243
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,599
what the instrument is going to do

1244
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,319
so

1245
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:15,680
and then the last

1246
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,839
okay any thoughts on these terms

1247
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,200
okay then the next set of terms in table

1248
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,480
one

1249
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,160
was

1250
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,520
mark hall blanket

1251
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,839
internal state and external state

1252
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:33,440
so definitely check out number 14

1253
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,839
number 26 a few of the other live

1254
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:37,359
streams to learn more about the markup

1255
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,520
blanket and this is the figure from

1256
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,240
uh decosta at all 2021.

1257
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,680
the blanket

1258
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,520
is here the boundary state between the

1259
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,880
internal state

1260
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,359
of the social organization

1261
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,119
so those are the ones

1262
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,640
and the and the external state of the

1263
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,880
environment when operating processes are

1264
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,280
defined in the quality

1265
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,119
management system

1266
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,280
then what are those internal states

1267
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,280
those are the social or organizational

1268
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,119
processes developed during industrial

1269
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,720
engineering for minimum risk in the

1270
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,319
process environment

1271
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:09,520
and then the external state is the

1272
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,720
environment

1273
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,440
so

1274
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,440
that's kind of mapping the markov

1275
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,280
blanket kind of the car

1276
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,280
the interfaces and outside the car or

1277
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,200
maybe that's not the perfect mapping but

1278
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,160
i think that's kind of what is being

1279
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,280
suggested

1280
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,720
and then the last

1281
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,800
few terms of table one

1282
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,680
are four of just the general constructs

1283
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,680
general principles that are also section

1284
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,839
headers and important topics risk

1285
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,240
ambiguity principle of least action and

1286
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,400
principle of survival

1287
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,640
dean

1288
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,880
yeah so i think all of this ties in

1289
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,920
to a

1290
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,720
a way of looking at the world through

1291
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,440
through rows and columns which is fine i

1292
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,200
mean it's it's a good it's a good place

1293
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,599
to try to look at things and analyze

1294
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,000
them but

1295
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,520
not everybody

1296
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,440
not everybody creates off of that

1297
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,960
because not everybody

1298
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,040
is necessarily looking for a precision

1299
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,520
forward view sometimes

1300
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,319
you're you're experimenting and you're

1301
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:09,599
making all kinds of mistakes and

1302
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:12,720
learning from that as well and so you

1303
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,960
again you just want to just want to see

1304
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,800
this for what it is it's it's nothing

1305
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,000
wrong with it but it's not

1306
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,680
it's not the only way

1307
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,000
that's all

1308
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,399
blue anything

1309
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,880
okay so then

1310
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,480
there's the figures

1311
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,400
and these will recall some of the key

1312
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,520
terms we talked about earlier

1313
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,400
uh the text says as shown in figure one

1314
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,640
spc charts these statistical process

1315
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,319
control charts

1316
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,200
have upper and lower control limits

1317
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,880
and processes need to remain within

1318
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,880
these limits processes that go outside

1319
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,960
the limits do not meet specifications

1320
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,760
that define intended states so left side

1321
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,319
good top of the drake meme right side

1322
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:03,119
bad bottom of the drake meme not working

1323
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,800
okay

1324
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,480
figure two is this five whys so it's

1325
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,200
written out here more textually if you

1326
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,920
wanna pause it and look at it and here

1327
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,720
it's more graphical so do either if you

1328
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,520
wanna

1329
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,839
give a thought on the five wise or

1330
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,240
okay well the scenario that's laid out

1331
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,760
is uh

1332
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,720
kind of working backwards

1333
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,200
from why there was a not reliable

1334
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,640
organization

1335
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,559
and the five wise it's actually not

1336
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,280
related to aristotle's four y's but that

1337
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,119
would have been a nice opportunity maybe

1338
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,160
there's a four by five matrix but these

1339
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,880
five y's are referring to

1340
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,680
um needing to go back kind of five

1341
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,640
layers

1342
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,319
or like five

1343
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,640
derivatives up the chain

1344
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,680
asking

1345
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,440
what led to a high reliability

1346
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,839
organization being unreliable

1347
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,640
so the general case of this sort of

1348
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,400
cascading failure

1349
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,160
in terms of variational free energy so

1350
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,400
the general phrasing is that there's

1351
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,440
high

1352
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,520
uncertainty high entropy in work

1353
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,280
instructions so the ikea instructions

1354
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,240
are not accessible enough to many people

1355
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,200
or the radio is really blurry so people

1356
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,760
can't hear what letters are being said

1357
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,559
and then that makes the variational free

1358
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:29,520
energy high because of prediction errors

1359
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,000
which then leads to unproductive actions

1360
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,520
so then you're you're scanning on the

1361
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,079
radio because you can't quite lock on

1362
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,079
and then that's consuming energy

1363
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,000
and then that ends up reducing your

1364
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,240
battery so that you can't do what you

1365
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,040
actually need to do and then the case in

1366
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,040
this truck driver incident

1367
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,640
is that the truck driver is getting

1368
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,400
ambiguous

1369
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,319
logistical data so this itself is a

1370
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:55,119
policy um communication from like you

1371
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,440
know some cloud mapping service or the

1372
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,160
company that's contracting the trucker

1373
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,319
and then this leads to

1374
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:05,520
the driver having increased spatial

1375
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,280
uncertainty getting lost

1376
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,400
which leads them to drive around

1377
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,559
unproductively so they don't have enough

1378
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,720
fuel to efficiently complete the

1379
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,119
deliveries that are important

1380
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:16,880
and so here's the graphical layout of

1381
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,559
the five wise

1382
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:21,040
showing with that example

1383
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,880
how on the bottom is the truck drivers

1384
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,079
getting the bad

1385
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:25,119
info

1386
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,440
and then that surfaces

1387
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,240
after sort of several repercussions in

1388
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,160
terms of the uh

1389
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,720
the um structure of multi-level decision

1390
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,680
making

1391
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,680
and active inference

1392
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,359
how we can

1393
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,440
use this framework which maybe is used

1394
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,800
in industry

1395
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,800
and map it onto the states of decision

1396
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,960
making from active inference perspective

1397
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,000
but notice that there's no reward here

1398
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,800
it's not well drivers

1399
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,640
minimize their reward about this or you

1400
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,640
know risk on this or maximize their

1401
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,200
reward on this so it just shows how this

1402
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,839
sort of um framework

1403
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:03,280
has a different framing than people

1404
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,720
might expect if the only machine

1405
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,079
learning model they were aware of was

1406
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:07,920
machine learning and

1407
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,359
specifically reward reinforcement

1408
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,680
learning dean

1409
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,079
yeah and it isn't just industrial you

1410
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:14,800
can

1411
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,960
you can be like me and

1412
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,960
jump in the car with two of my friends

1413
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,160
who are both

1414
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,079
emergency doctors and you're heading off

1415
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,079
to the ski hill and at some point the

1416
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,240
conversation comes around to there are

1417
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,400
no accidents in the world

1418
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,880
and of course being emergency doctors

1419
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,480
they see the the

1420
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,920
outcomes of

1421
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,520
of

1422
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,720
events

1423
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,400
happening to people and so their

1424
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,319
perspective is there's always a way of

1425
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,079
being able to go back and see

1426
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,359
all the

1427
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:45,839
parts of the decision branch and how it

1428
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,920
arrived in front of them and them having

1429
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,160
to sort of put the pieces back together

1430
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,760
again but

1431
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,160
again i don't

1432
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,880
i don't know that necessarily

1433
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,640
that that means that randomness doesn't

1434
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,960
come into play and there isn't a

1435
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,200
certain part of this where the variation

1436
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,800
simply can't be

1437
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,220
um

1438
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:06,400
[Music]

1439
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,079
calculated in but

1440
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:09,920
i still go skiing with them i don't i

1441
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,520
don't

1442
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,280
dislike them or defriend them so anyway

1443
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,800
yeah

1444
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,760
um

1445
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,440
it just reminds me of like

1446
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,960
when i dropped a hard drive then i

1447
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,960
thought well i guess this is the 100

1448
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,319
hard drives that fails every year

1449
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,400
yes but it was also the one time that i

1450
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,480
dropped it so there's always this sort

1451
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,359
of like n equals one way to uncouple

1452
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,680
uh cause and effect or potentially uh

1453
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,480
actionable consequence to the not

1454
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,400
reliability of your organization but

1455
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,240
then also there's this designing for the

1456
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,240
statistics when they decide to make a

1457
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,319
recall or not based upon you know the

1458
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:48,240
relative amount of failure

1459
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,359
versus

1460
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:52,319
the relative amount of you know legal uh

1461
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:55,040
changes needed something like that so

1462
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,640
that's where you talked earlier about

1463
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,440
including co-occurrence instead of just

1464
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,839
only giving time over to the sequential

1465
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:03,599
aspect of this

1466
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:04,480
yep

1467
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,160
so figure 3

1468
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,839
frames the quality management systems

1469
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:10,960
the qms the quality manual as a

1470
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,800
generative model comprising beliefs

1471
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,559
about processes

1472
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,480
so it's interesting because it could be

1473
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,640
seen as just a cookbook recipe book

1474
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,559
instruction book

1475
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,160
but it's being

1476
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,839
at least deployed in a generative

1477
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,280
capacity

1478
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,800
and instead of just like saying you know

1479
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,800
whip the eggs for five minutes and then

1480
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,160
um until they're

1481
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,960
frothy or you know until they're this

1482
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,599
make peaks it's like we expect it to

1483
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:36,960
make peaks

1484
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,280
whip it until your expectation is

1485
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,640
achieved

1486
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,640
it's a different way to get to that same

1487
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,160
outcome now which one is going to be

1488
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,760
more resilient if it says five minutes

1489
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,000
and there's no peaks then what do you do

1490
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,599
do you add something do you keep on

1491
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:52,559
going whereas if you have a precision uh

1492
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:53,760
seeking

1493
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,920
process maybe you can be resilient to it

1494
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,040
if it only takes two minutes and you

1495
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,200
don't overdo it

1496
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,040
uh and the the example of something

1497
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,440
being correct like 99 out of 100 times

1498
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,200
is just used i think just repeatedly in

1499
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,240
the paper

1500
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,200
just

1501
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,119
it could be calibrated differently and

1502
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:10,720
i'm sure it's situational it's just sort

1503
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,359
of like shorthand 99 out of 100.

1504
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:14,640
um but yeah

1505
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,800
it is defining these qms

1506
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,119
in terms of uh the actual active states

1507
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,880
so what should be done you know pipette

1508
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,119
50 microliters of fluid into the little

1509
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:26,000
tube and then you monitor something

1510
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,680
about the process

1511
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,200
and then that

1512
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,160
leads to this feedback cycle between the

1513
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,280
uh the quality management review

1514
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,880
and then that

1515
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,680
being

1516
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,520
in kind of co-evolution

1517
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,400
with the industrial engineering itself

1518
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,280
and then that leads to the update of the

1519
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,200
process in the quality manual in step

1520
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,079
four

1521
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:50,400
so that then there's kind of like okay

1522
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,720
if it's too low after your first pipette

1523
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,359
then do a little bit more pipetting

1524
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:58,640
and then they keep on protecting that 99

1525
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,599
um

1526
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,839
functional outcome at each of those

1527
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:04,400
nodes that are bifurcating out

1528
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,839
okay any thoughts

1529
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:10,720
uh not gonna

1530
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,119
read this whole thing but

1531
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:15,760
the top part talks about this design for

1532
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,000
assembly and one of the principles is to

1533
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,480
make parts either symmetrical or clearly

1534
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,640
asymmetrical so nothing in the uncanny

1535
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,480
valley this is done so that it is

1536
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,319
immediately and unequivocally apparent

1537
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:28,880
how a part is to be put into subassembly

1538
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,559
and the this is the famous uh ikea

1539
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,119
catalog aesthetic

1540
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:38,000
and how that made uh furniture building

1541
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,920
like fun and accessible for some people

1542
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,280
i guess

1543
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,280
and then in this

1544
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,640
second quote

1545
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,880
it is kind of thinking about that ikea

1546
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,960
paradigm although furniture companies

1547
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,640
may not be considering their industrial

1548
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,319
engineering in terms of minimizing

1549
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,559
variational free energy it is apparent

1550
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,160
that its aim is to minimize errors

1551
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,720
between what it intends to people to see

1552
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,319
when looking at its furniture kits and

1553
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:01,920
what people do see when looking at its

1554
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,359
furniture kits

1555
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,520
so it's sort of like it's

1556
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,079
the goal should be to make it look like

1557
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:11,119
it looks on the sale room floor or like

1558
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,040
it looks like in your imagination after

1559
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,119
you see the advertising

1560
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,040
and then if you can see those flat

1561
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,599
pieces of wood and you can see that

1562
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,119
instruction booklet and you can see the

1563
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,400
policy

1564
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,040
then you're going to be not surprised

1565
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,799
you're going to be satisfied because

1566
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,160
your preference was to have like the

1567
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,520
couch there

1568
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,040
so just kind of a cool example that

1569
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,040
highlights how

1570
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,559
our preferences aren't just over

1571
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,599
temperature

1572
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:36,960
we often talk about those kinds of

1573
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,480
examples but we can also have

1574
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,240
preferences for

1575
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,559
having affordances or niche

1576
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,240
modifications like we can have a

1577
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,040
preference to have a handle on something

1578
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,119
and then that kind of relates us to this

1579
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,720
like behavioral economics under active

1580
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,480
inference like what makes somebody

1581
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,799
expect there to be a new couch in their

1582
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:57,440
living room and then what makes them

1583
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,040
drive out and pick it up on the weekend

1584
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,079
and everything

1585
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:01,119
and then

1586
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:02,160
um

1587
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,000
it's this kind of idea that the supply

1588
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,920
chain is

1589
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,480
this extended uncertainty reducer

1590
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,960
and it's like bringing stuff to you

1591
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,200
and then there's this notion in this

1592
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,680
computational industrial case and in the

1593
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,040
at home case

1594
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,079
where

1595
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,480
the assembly information that's provided

1596
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,400
is a policy decision from the people who

1597
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,680
are making the product and then that

1598
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,480
really relates to like participation

1599
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,480
in making that product if it's all

1600
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,799
pre-compiled then there's no affordance

1601
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:33,119
for participation versus having like a

1602
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,680
culture of people working through it

1603
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,400
from many different ways so

1604
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,400
and then this was just the funny example

1605
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,079
of the interface

1606
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:43,520
which said uh

1607
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,799
although there may be little risk in

1608
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,480
furniture assembly this can be followed

1609
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,079
by much ambiguity and furniture

1610
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:50,079
installation so in other words it's not

1611
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,280
just about what's on this brochure

1612
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,680
because pre-determining all the possible

1613
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,119
prediction errors in fixing the

1614
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,119
assembled furniture to walls

1615
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:00,240
in millions of different buildings

1616
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,559
around the world is very challenging

1617
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,559
and so there's this difference between

1618
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:07,440
the assembly information like how do you

1619
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,240
just assemble the system of interest

1620
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,760
uh which is just the internal and

1621
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,040
blanket states of the new uh shelf

1622
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,799
what's the difference between that

1623
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:18,799
information how to build the bookshelf

1624
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:20,319
and then the operations like oh well you

1625
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:21,599
didn't tell me that i couldn't kick it

1626
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,760
from the side it's like you just told me

1627
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,119
how to build it you didn't say that i

1628
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:26,559
couldn't use it this way

1629
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,480
and then so how do you

1630
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,040
design for internal coherence

1631
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,079
versus designing for interoperability

1632
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,799
with sort of unknown unknowns and all

1633
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:38,559
these different types of entities that

1634
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:40,480
the system's going to interact with

1635
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,799
on the blanket on the interface

1636
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:44,880
so it's not just the ikea

1637
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,480
booklet but i thought that was kind of

1638
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,720
an interesting notion that even just

1639
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,160
building it wasn't really the end of the

1640
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,680
story because then people take their

1641
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,440
perfectly built bookshelf and then just

1642
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,040
like staple it to the wall the wrong way

1643
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:59,040
like ruins both um so dean

1644
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,240
yeah and then

1645
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,839
and i don't know if you can see this but

1646
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:04,079
then how do you account for this how do

1647
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:05,599
you accomplish somebody who

1648
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,480
took a piece of olive wood

1649
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,079
any random piece of olive wood and

1650
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,400
turned it into something

1651
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,720
like this right so it's not there's no

1652
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,799
there's no billy there's no way of

1653
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:19,280
deconstructing this you just have to

1654
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,599
pick up

1655
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,200
you have to pick up something that is a

1656
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,440
mark off blanket it's it's it has it's

1657
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,880
pre-carved

1658
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,640
and then you have to be able to pull out

1659
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,319
what you think is in that and how do you

1660
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,480
how do you engineer that

1661
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,240
well it's it's a completely different

1662
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,520
process so

1663
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,440
i think i think we're i think as people

1664
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,680
were capable of doing both

1665
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,160
and i and i just i'd love to talk to the

1666
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,119
author

1667
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:47,440
about how how you

1668
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,480
how you

1669
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,280
do this kind of work when

1670
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,559
there's certain results that are

1671
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,559
are available and are part of the active

1672
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,160
inference model so

1673
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,480
it'll be a nice contrast tomorrow yeah

1674
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,520
yep nice good point like where's artisan

1675
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,359
ship and uh craft in this phrasing

1676
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:10,400
so uh here's an example using that uh

1677
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,040
case of the like bookshelf

1678
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,359
or the cupboard being bolted to a wall

1679
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:17,440
and this also gets at that partition

1680
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,839
between the part of the system that you

1681
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,200
can design

1682
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,720
and then the part of the system that is

1683
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,160
not being considered

1684
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,319
so

1685
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:28,880
here the internal states and this is

1686
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,400
kind of interesting

1687
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,799
it'll be cool to see who is there live

1688
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:34,480
to talk about this sort of embodiment

1689
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,640
aspect

1690
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,160
the internal state is the person's

1691
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,000
embodied prior knowledge of fixing

1692
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,720
assembled cupboards to walls and

1693
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,880
depending on what they know about you

1694
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,200
know carpentry if they're just totally

1695
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,599
watching the youtube video and then uh

1696
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:50,960
letting it rip versus if they're

1697
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,160
experienced

1698
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,599
they're gonna with different materials

1699
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,280
they're gonna take actions

1700
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,720
and that's going to modify the niche

1701
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,240
which is the external state the room to

1702
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,480
which the cupboard will be fixed

1703
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,920
and that's going to

1704
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,520
be reflected in what the person

1705
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,200
perceives

1706
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,680
and then it's just cool like the

1707
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,559
here

1708
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,319
maybe there's multiple ways to interpret

1709
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:11,359
the center

1710
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:13,680
it's like there's the wall blocking like

1711
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,760
external blocking state then there's

1712
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,760
like the affordance block where the

1713
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,680
tools are inadequate like you know you

1714
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,920
need the hex wrench of size seven and

1715
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,599
you only have the size four so you just

1716
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:25,839
can't do it even if you know how to do

1717
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:27,760
it and there's times where even if you

1718
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,760
have the right tool it's like it's too

1719
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,520
rusty to do it

1720
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,440
so there's like it's just a cool

1721
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,559
example

1722
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:35,440
and

1723
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,359
shows a little bit of that that

1724
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:38,799
horseshoe theory again between

1725
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:40,960
philosophy and engineering where they're

1726
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,520
both radically focused on embodiment and

1727
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,040
pragmatics

1728
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,559
okay

1729
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,000
then

1730
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,400
the next section after four is seven

1731
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,119
active inference as a unifying framework

1732
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:55,200
and so basically they write

1733
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,720
an important application of active

1734
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,799
inference theory can be as a unifying

1735
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,480
framework for a social organization

1736
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,400
framework summarized in figure five

1737
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,319
which we'll look at in a second

1738
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:05,920
operated through quality management

1739
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,640
systems qms via interoperability

1740
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,559
protocols at an upper level of

1741
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:13,280
multi-tier enterprise architecture so

1742
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,599
before we look at figure five

1743
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:16,640
it's just

1744
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,039
like how does active inference serve as

1745
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:21,280
a unifying framework in some of these

1746
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,760
areas that we've been talking about for

1747
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,000
the last months like

1748
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,079
we've heard people use this integrating

1749
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,880
word to talk about active in

1750
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,400
action and perception engineering

1751
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,599
biology

1752
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:35,520
communication cyber physical systems

1753
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,319
remote teams etc so just

1754
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,160
it's being used a little bit in a

1755
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,640
different way here so let's see figure

1756
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,799
five and then you can give any thoughts

1757
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:46,799
on it

1758
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:49,599
here organizational active inference

1759
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,039
is again being mapped onto this uh sense

1760
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:56,400
internal action external loop this kind

1761
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,280
of circular loop the internal states are

1762
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,280
the organization's belief just like in

1763
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,280
figure four it was the person's embodied

1764
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,200
beliefs here it's the organization's

1765
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,480
embodied beliefs embodied in the qms

1766
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,640
which is again being framed as beliefs

1767
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:11,520
over

1768
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,319
uh

1769
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:14,400
processes and states

1770
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,280
that

1771
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,039
results in human and artificial

1772
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:18,480
intelligence employed to fulfill

1773
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,960
specifications procedures etc so these

1774
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,520
can be actions that are taken by apis or

1775
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,280
bots or by people

1776
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,160
this

1777
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,799
acts upon the external states

1778
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:31,359
which lead to perceptions of sensory

1779
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:33,359
states which could be the temperature in

1780
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:34,799
the room

1781
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:37,440
it could be the um the ph of the wine it

1782
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,200
could be the number of sales on the

1783
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,160
course

1784
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,480
so then they do industrial engineering

1785
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,599
on this loop as an organization

1786
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:47,359
in relationship to integrating

1787
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:49,920
perception and action through internal

1788
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,079
state updating pretty much just like

1789
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,599
we've been talking about for all these

1790
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,119
other active inference systems any

1791
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:58,119
thoughts

1792
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:01,200
okay

1793
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,559
table two

1794
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,480
uh writes there are many there can be

1795
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,720
many reasons why pragmatic subsumes

1796
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,440
semantics and leads to prediction errors

1797
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,520
for example inept priors and inept

1798
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,079
preferred posteriors can come from

1799
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,720
lock-ins path dependencies and success

1800
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,200
traps which place emphasis on past

1801
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,839
experiences over new information

1802
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:23,520
individuals may seek to survive by

1803
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,440
learning from filtered information that

1804
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,760
supports the preconception of groups

1805
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,599
which they believe can support their

1806
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,760
individual survival rather than seek

1807
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,359
information that supports the efficient

1808
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:35,520
reduction of prediction errors in

1809
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,119
external states

1810
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,960
so it's almost like

1811
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,599
you can't prefer what you prefer so much

1812
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:43,599
otherwise you're gonna um i don't know

1813
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:46,799
maybe follow that local band all the way

1814
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,720
to a local end

1815
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,640
instead of sometimes

1816
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,960
coming out of that local

1817
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,039
uh local local attractor

1818
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,720
and uh any

1819
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,720
want to go for this blue yeah yeah just

1820
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,720
it seemed like just confirmation bias

1821
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,400
right you seek to survive by learning

1822
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,640
the the information that supports the

1823
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,480
preconceptions of groups right so that's

1824
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,039
like you know i believe this my my can

1825
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:10,799
can my group believe this like i don't

1826
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:13,760
know that's that yeah this is a cool

1827
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,079
table it's like okay so in the

1828
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:18,720
perception phase of active inference

1829
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,599
you can have a top-down error based upon

1830
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:23,039
inept priors

1831
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:24,480
so you can believe the wrong thing about

1832
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,559
what you should expect to see or

1833
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:29,359
you can have the sensor be influenced

1834
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,920
interesting about eg emotion but um

1835
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,200
that's i guess being phrased as a

1836
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,039
bottom-up way that

1837
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:37,440
perception can be modified

1838
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,839
and then in the intermediary

1839
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,319
intermediate it's bounded rationality so

1840
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:44,079
not that's it's kind of like a

1841
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:45,760
compromise between what you think is

1842
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,280
possible and

1843
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,280
magical realism

1844
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:53,200
then the action phase also can be uh run

1845
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,839
um a ground by inept

1846
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:56,880
uh

1847
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,680
focusing on basically poor

1848
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,599
outcomes like if you're

1849
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,520
aiming for five degrees off of shooting

1850
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,280
a free throw then you're gonna miss the

1851
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,799
free throws

1852
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:09,440
and then that also your attention

1853
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,039
could be affected by poor signal to

1854
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:12,640
noise ratio like if you couldn't see

1855
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,960
where the hoop was

1856
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,119
and just interesting how like it's being

1857
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:18,960
really methodically broken down the

1858
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,559
sources of where the error can come from

1859
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:23,920
and then also

1860
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,359
um in table three there's a nice

1861
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:27,440
distinction

1862
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,240
and it relates to that notion that

1863
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,720
active inference would be uh potentially

1864
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,680
very effective for repetitive processes

1865
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,119
but potentially not as effective for

1866
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:38,960
one-of-a-kind processes

1867
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,720
and so the repetitive processes are like

1868
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,160
mass production and then the

1869
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,760
one-of-a-kind processes are like the

1870
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,839
project production so right off the bat

1871
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:47,839
it's kind of like well how individual

1872
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:49,839
does a project need to be

1873
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,799
before it's not uh

1874
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:55,920
best modeled by active inference

1875
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,000
and then it just talks about how markup

1876
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,760
like it's generative models prediction

1877
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,240
error and variational free energy play

1878
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,079
out in both of these

1879
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:05,599
two areas

1880
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,280
so that would definitely be something

1881
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,720
for people to like read through the

1882
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,440
table and then

1883
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,200
mention it and give a specific example

1884
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,640
or question to the author because this

1885
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,119
is like super informative and a cool

1886
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,039
combinatoric way to look at how ideas

1887
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:23,039
are related so yeah dean and then blue

1888
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:24,960
so when i'm looking at this and i don't

1889
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,960
know if this is helpful or if this just

1890
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,680
makes it even more turbid but

1891
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,960
if if one hand of this is the ability to

1892
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,960
frame something so that we know what's

1893
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:35,839
in

1894
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:37,599
what we're looking at versus what we're

1895
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,000
not looking at and if the other hand is

1896
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,440
how we match

1897
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,839
essentially if you go back to

1898
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:45,920
table two and this table three and and

1899
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,559
the figure the matching is what's super

1900
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:50,880
ordinate and what's subordinate what's

1901
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,880
inside of what

1902
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,480
those are the two hands that still

1903
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,799
doesn't tell us what is going on in

1904
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:59,920
between which i think is the fit piece

1905
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,200
which from uh

1906
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,680
from a thinking standpoint is am i

1907
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:04,880
fitting now

1908
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,960
hand in glove meaning

1909
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:11,119
is is my is my glove size size large

1910
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:13,760
or is it glove in hand does that does

1911
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,760
the glove i need

1912
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,520
serve the purpose because i'm skiing or

1913
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,439
because i'm i'm

1914
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:23,120
i'm foraging or i'm or i'm water skiing

1915
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,719
right so

1916
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:25,920
between

1917
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,279
framing

1918
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:28,080
and

1919
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,439
and matching

1920
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,839
is this fit question there all three of

1921
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:34,399
them are different things the fit is in

1922
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:37,759
between these other two things and even

1923
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,120
if we

1924
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,960
make a great table

1925
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,799
and even if we make sure that we got the

1926
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:45,679
right headings and right definitions

1927
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:48,640
underneath it still doesn't talk about

1928
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:49,839
is it

1929
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:52,080
glove in hand or hand in glove and i

1930
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,319
think for people who want to actually

1931
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:56,238
use active inference

1932
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:58,799
they want to be able to not get stuck

1933
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:00,399
conflating

1934
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:01,920
fit with frame

1935
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:02,719
or

1936
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:05,359
complaining fit with match they want to

1937
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:07,920
put those two parameters the the frame

1938
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,479
and the match on the outside and then

1939
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,560
see what happens in the middle based on

1940
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,279
what those parameters are i think that's

1941
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:17,600
the struggle for most people

1942
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,560
trying to gain entree into well

1943
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,158
how does this active inference thing

1944
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,439
actually work

1945
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:25,439
it works different all the time that's

1946
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:27,839
the point of the markov blanket it's the

1947
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:29,040
potential

1948
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,880
to be able to invert

1949
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,600
at will that i think

1950
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,080
laying it out this way helps it gets you

1951
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,799
like 90 of the way there but it doesn't

1952
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:41,520
really tell you what you could do with

1953
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,439
it as opposed to

1954
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:46,318
what just happened

1955
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:48,719
very interesting dean

1956
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:50,960
blue

1957
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:51,920
so

1958
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,679
like just kind of this piggy backs right

1959
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:55,440
off of what what dean was saying like

1960
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,440
the markov blanket and even here in the

1961
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,880
first um

1962
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,800
the line of this table

1963
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:01,600
um

1964
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,440
you know the markup blankets are hard

1965
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,760
when they're shifting right and this is

1966
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,440
something that we've talked about in

1967
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:10,080
other um live streams in other contexts

1968
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,719
like shifting overlapping my markup

1969
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:14,320
blanket interacting with your marco

1970
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,480
blanket i think that um you know the

1971
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,960
underlying mathematics to support those

1972
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,159
kinds of

1973
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,560
um arguments are kind of missing still

1974
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,320
or or not not missing but still being

1975
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,440
worked out is probably more correct

1976
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,440
um but but i do think that markov

1977
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,760
blankets do change i mean even if i just

1978
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,000
think about like my brain as you know

1979
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,640
markov blanket like cells die cells are

1980
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,239
born and i know that that's very

1981
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:39,600
controversial in the neuroscience field

1982
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,080
but but cells are actually born

1983
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,719
so so i mean there's there's constantly

1984
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:47,600
this this turnover of who belongs inside

1985
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,679
the markov blanket and any kind of you

1986
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:52,400
know organizational structure has that

1987
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,640
shift it's not like the boundary of the

1988
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,880
markov blanket it has to be has to

1989
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,199
retain some kind of flexibility and and

1990
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:02,480
so that um you know is is seen here in

1991
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,640
this in this um

1992
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,600
first line um and also who's generative

1993
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:08,880
model is it

1994
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,199
like so this is kind of another

1995
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:13,120
something that that i was like

1996
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:16,560
so the quality management solution or or

1997
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,880
the qms right quality

1998
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,280
i maybe got the abbreviation wrong but

1999
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,159
um

2000
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:23,760
that that is the gen that is the

2001
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,760
generative model but like who does it

2002
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,920
belong to is that does it belong to the

2003
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,000
process does it belong to and this is

2004
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,560
maybe my like a deficiency in

2005
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,239
my understanding of

2006
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:35,520
industrial engineering because i'm just

2007
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,520
not familiar with the jargon but like is

2008
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,040
it the process that gets the quality

2009
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,480
management solution or is it the

2010
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,239
organization that has the quality

2011
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:43,520
management or is it like some kind of

2012
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:46,159
sub unit is it a team so i'm just kind

2013
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:48,880
of unsure about they talk about this is

2014
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,719
the generative model but like whose

2015
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:54,000
model is it and like so depending on on

2016
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,440
how that's answered and we'll have the

2017
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,679
author on so we can ask them but

2018
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:00,000
depending on how that's answered

2019
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,760
you know the these one-of-a-kind

2020
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:04,080
processes as i said earlier can maybe

2021
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,159
you be used to update the generative

2022
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:09,280
model in a very um explorative kind of

2023
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,120
way

2024
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,320
nice

2025
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,480
so here's just for a few

2026
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:17,760
uh implications and bigger questions

2027
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,920
so here's just a quote markov blankets

2028
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,920
are not features of real world systems

2029
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,920
rather they are an intuitive post-hoc

2030
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,440
ascriptions

2031
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,440
rather they are intuitive post-hoc

2032
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,199
scriptions made in order to model

2033
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:30,800
real-world systems

2034
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,320
hence any description of a markov

2035
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,080
blanket is subjective and can be changed

2036
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,800
over time as the modeler's focus changes

2037
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,719
and or as real-world systems change in

2038
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:40,800
the opinion of the modeler

2039
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,719
thus as summarized by phrases such as

2040
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:45,120
the map is not the territory markov

2041
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,719
blankets

2042
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:49,120
and then also it this is a funny line

2043
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,560
it has been already been argued in

2044
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,159
relation to markov blankets and other

2045
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:53,840
important constructs in active inference

2046
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,120
theory that the math is not the

2047
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,679
territory

2048
01:12:57,679 --> 01:12:59,920
wherever you heard that one before but

2049
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,600
this is like kind of the ultimate

2050
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:02,960
instrumental

2051
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,199
take it's it's making a clean

2052
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:07,040
distinction between map and territory

2053
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,400
between the the

2054
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,640
utility driven use of active inference

2055
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,560
and claims about what the system really

2056
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:13,760
is

2057
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,159
and then um

2058
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:17,920
uh this just the last line but it's an

2059
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,920
interesting quote but i'll just read the

2060
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,480
last line is um

2061
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:25,120
move to the slides

2062
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,040
hence the description of markov blankets

2063
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,480
could be a recurring challenge

2064
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,320
throughout project production which may

2065
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,000
only be resolved by reference to

2066
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,239
decisions made in courts of law long

2067
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:36,159
after the project is completed

2068
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:37,280
just maybe think about i don't know

2069
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,199
maybe like the bay bridge being built in

2070
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:41,360
the bay area in california and like you

2071
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:43,120
know years later and it happened

2072
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,960
differently and i'm sure some companies

2073
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,280
were bought and sold and

2074
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,000
all the morphing of the organization and

2075
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,159
the physical modification of the project

2076
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:54,640
and the personnel changing over

2077
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:57,199
all of that which is sort of this on one

2078
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:01,920
hand it's an n equals one unique enacted

2079
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,520
situation but then on the other hand

2080
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,120
there's principles for engineering it

2081
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,120
well and uh

2082
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,120
sometimes the process is itself

2083
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,800
wondering about how it's organized and

2084
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,320
then sometimes you can't even know until

2085
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,080
it's after it's done so that's just kind

2086
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,480
of cool and funny

2087
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,159
um

2088
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:20,000
another quote

2089
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,640
this is sort of taking a

2090
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,880
take on philosophy from the engineering

2091
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,239
perspective

2092
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:28,080
exactly how beliefs are updated in

2093
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,239
embodied cognition is a topic of ongoing

2094
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:32,000
research which involves specialist

2095
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,679
mathematics to describe relationships

2096
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:35,120
between prior probabilities and

2097
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,440
posterior probabilities

2098
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,280
by contrast updating beliefs through

2099
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,719
active inference in industrial

2100
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:42,400
engineering and quality management

2101
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,480
involves applying well-established

2102
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,000
practical methods

2103
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,600
in particular planning what should

2104
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,360
happen by active inference involves

2105
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,199
developing processes through applying

2106
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:53,520
industrial engineering techniques

2107
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,760
so it's sort of like we know what our

2108
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,800
policy affordances and um

2109
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,920
uh mechanism of updating our affordances

2110
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,239
are that's our discipline

2111
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:05,840
and so

2112
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,760
more broader question is what are the

2113
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:10,159
implications for generalized frameworks

2114
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:10,880
like

2115
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,600
embody cognition or active inference

2116
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,400
what

2117
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,920
are the implications when they interface

2118
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,239
with disciplinary or project specific

2119
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:19,600
like one-time

2120
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,719
work

2121
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:22,960
and then how does active inference uh

2122
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,199
gets simplified in the context of

2123
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:28,800
industrial engineering and how does work

2124
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,360
in the disciplines become linked in a

2125
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,040
bi-directional conversation to the

2126
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,840
broader body of knowledge

2127
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:36,640
just

2128
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,120
general questions any thoughts or okay

2129
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,920
dean yeah go for it

2130
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:52,960
dean you're muted yeah i can't hear you

2131
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:58,320
um

2132
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,679
whether we're talking about the bay

2133
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:02,640
bridge as

2134
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,520
do we have the proper glove in hand

2135
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,920
or whether we're talking about

2136
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,159
instrumentalism do i actually have a

2137
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:11,440
precise

2138
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:15,199
fit of glove for my hand yeah i think i

2139
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:17,679
think what what we have to be

2140
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:19,600
aware of is that

2141
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,920
both of those questions come up

2142
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,840
post hoc

2143
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,480
i tried on the glove and it worked or

2144
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,320
uh maybe the design of the bay bridge

2145
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,239
should have been different given the

2146
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:32,719
the contextual circumstances

2147
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:34,719
well i'm all i'm

2148
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:37,040
curious about is

2149
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,840
so before the bay bridge is built before

2150
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:42,239
i i fit

2151
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:44,880
one of two questions into that gloved

2152
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:48,800
hand relationship am i aware of how

2153
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,080
that can be seen post talk or ad hoc and

2154
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,600
am i am i

2155
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,600
am i

2156
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,400
conscious of the fact of where i'm

2157
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,320
taking this active inference model and

2158
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,960
as blue pointed out earlier whose is it

2159
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,360
and now just as importantly when

2160
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,679
is it

2161
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:10,480
when is that when is that question being

2162
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:13,040
asked in the context of what the product

2163
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,400
is because if we're going to talk about

2164
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:17,679
social organizations as the product

2165
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:19,360
active inference allows us to look on

2166
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:22,000
both sides of that so

2167
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,640
if as long as we're including the win in

2168
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,520
terms of discovering fit

2169
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:30,560
i think i think we're actually using

2170
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,440
active inference

2171
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,239
in terms of what its potential is that's

2172
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:37,760
all

2173
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,159
nice comments little philosophy like we

2174
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:42,320
i'm not not not like we need that but

2175
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,760
i'm just throwing it in there yeah

2176
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,199
that's cool

2177
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:48,640
so then here's another quote

2178
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:49,840
um

2179
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:52,560
in terms of the explore exploit dynamic

2180
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,480
project production involves much more

2181
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:57,360
exploration than exploitation hence more

2182
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,840
wayfinding than navigation is involved

2183
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,840
in particular wayfinding involves the

2184
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,000
ability to create novel routes which are

2185
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,120
based

2186
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,719
on understanding a wider frame of

2187
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:08,719
reference than navigating along a preset

2188
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:09,679
route

2189
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:11,520
wayfinding involves creating novel

2190
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,760
routes through changing situations by

2191
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,679
making non-conscious reference to

2192
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:18,239
subjective prior knowledge and conscious

2193
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:19,679
subjective reference to current

2194
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:22,560
situations and semantic information

2195
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,239
that's pretty dense but pretty

2196
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:26,640
fascinating because it does point at

2197
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,880
this kind of like repetitive

2198
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,239
then you can just write out the

2199
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:32,320
directions and follow them in a little

2200
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,320
bit more of a rule following way

2201
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,199
um

2202
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:36,880
and then the extreme case being like a

2203
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,560
train like the caltrain just went from

2204
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,400
san francisco to san jose just went and

2205
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,520
it was like it had you know the

2206
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,679
affordance to speed up or slow down but

2207
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:44,480
then

2208
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,719
when there's the bushwhacking um or the

2209
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:48,400
wayfinding here

2210
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,640
then there's almost like novelty of path

2211
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,560
and then there's higher novelties like

2212
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,640
introducing a new tool or climbing to

2213
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,640
the top of a tree to see further but

2214
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,760
there's just this path finding novelty

2215
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:02,719
that is uh really important for you know

2216
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:04,480
all kinds of these applications so it

2217
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,920
just

2218
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,360
raises the question that'll be cool to

2219
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,400
discuss

2220
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,520
about like

2221
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,520
how does active inference

2222
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,920
uh juxtapose or interface with sense

2223
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,320
making and wayfinding

2224
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:19,440
explore exploit the pragmatic epistemic

2225
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:20,560
distinction

2226
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,320
and then the way that the models are fit

2227
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,719
with accuracy minus complexity just how

2228
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:25,679
does that

2229
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,760
come together and active

2230
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,840
any thoughts or good

2231
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,280
yep dean

2232
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:33,600
yeah because because weight finding is

2233
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:34,400
my

2234
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,640
is my niche i was just so happy that he

2235
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:37,840
pulled these two

2236
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,600
reference like if you haven't read 90

2237
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:43,040
like work of 95 and 96 here i strongly

2238
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,199
recommend it because he's pulled out two

2239
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:47,360
fantastic references

2240
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:50,880
in terms of uh

2241
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,480
things you could look at in terms of

2242
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,480
what that exploration piece actually is

2243
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,040
that they're both fantastic especially

2244
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,800
the 95

2245
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,480
yeah i've read both of them and they're

2246
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:03,120
both they're both excellent examples

2247
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,560
within the context of what he's trying

2248
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,880
to talk about in terms of implications i

2249
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:09,040
just wanted to do a clap for that one

2250
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,239
because i thought

2251
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,840
glad glad he brought the wayfinding

2252
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,880
piece into this cool yeah the 95 is

2253
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,800
finding the way a critical discussion of

2254
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,239
anthropological theories of human

2255
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:20,239
spatial orientation with reference to

2256
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:22,639
reindeer herders of north eastern europe

2257
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:25,360
and western siberia 2009

2258
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,440
and then the second article is humans

2259
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,360
used predictive gay strategies to target

2260
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,920
waypoints for steering 2019. so it's

2261
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,400
kind of interesting because um

2262
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,199
and especially having adapted a visual

2263
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:38,800
foraging model

2264
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,679
to a stigma g pheromone deposition model

2265
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:43,840
in the active inference paper

2266
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,520
it has

2267
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,600
drawn out this contrast between two

2268
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,840
extremes of foraging

2269
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,520
um both which can have a pragmatic and

2270
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:53,120
an epistemic component there's like skin

2271
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,159
in the game

2272
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:55,760
ant body on the ground where you're

2273
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,080
physically moving you're hurting and you

2274
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,679
have to go somewhere to find out how it

2275
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:02,639
is there versus visual foraging or

2276
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:05,520
visual scanning is uh sort of like you

2277
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,040
have the cost of movement of course but

2278
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,679
it's not like um where your eye is is

2279
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:11,760
directly paying the cost um in most

2280
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,159
cases so it's kind of cool to see that

2281
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:16,320
the wayfinding and the sense making

2282
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,400
comes into play on these two extremes

2283
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,800
with a niche modifying body on the

2284
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,880
ground as well as with a scanning

2285
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,880
approach

2286
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,199
okay um another quote

2287
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:30,080
won't read the whole thing but basically

2288
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,239
we can imagine after hearing all this

2289
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:33,600
that the prediction error is something

2290
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,520
that you want to minimize for effective

2291
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,679
business operation so a large prediction

2292
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:38,880
error could lead to the company

2293
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,639
dissipating for example through its

2294
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:42,800
internal resources being scattered into

2295
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,040
an external state by being taken into

2296
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,719
the possession of its unplayed paid

2297
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:48,639
suppliers so that's um

2298
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:50,960
marcotte blanket dissolution via

2299
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:55,199
court-mediated bankruptcy proceeding

2300
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:57,040
alternatively the company could be

2301
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,800
acquired and merged into one of its

2302
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,800
large unpaid suppliers that seeks to

2303
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:03,199
move up the value chain from tier one to

2304
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:05,040
oem manufacturer

2305
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:07,360
in the case of acquisition and merger

2306
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:09,120
the description of markov blankets would

2307
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,760
need to be changed in legal documents

2308
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,639
so that just totally uh set off my scott

2309
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,880
david alarm

2310
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:17,679
and

2311
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:20,320
maybe think about um the ways that the

2312
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:23,600
markov blankets um can be designed the

2313
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:24,639
the

2314
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:27,199
managing synthetic externalities

2315
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:28,239
um

2316
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:30,639
seeing law as a niche modification and

2317
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:32,639
as a technology in and of itself but

2318
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:35,199
also one that uh can

2319
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:36,960
facilitate other technologies coming

2320
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,480
into existence or being hindered as we

2321
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:39,840
see all the time

2322
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:40,800
and then

2323
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,199
he uses the acronym bolts

2324
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:45,360
business operational legal technical

2325
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,560
social

2326
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,719
and then the bigger question is like how

2327
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:50,639
can we see active inference serve in a

2328
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:53,760
de-risking or recovery capacity

2329
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,280
and then how can we

2330
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,679
reframe existing or emerging practices

2331
01:22:57,679 --> 01:22:59,360
for resilience in terms of active

2332
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:02,080
inference so this is like a 1980 style

2333
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,840
merger and acquisition

2334
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,719
framed in the markham blanket framework

2335
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:07,440
but

2336
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,159
what does the d5

2337
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:11,760
active inference model look like what

2338
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,840
does the smart contract active inference

2339
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,760
model look like these will be like

2340
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,199
really interesting questions and how

2341
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:18,960
they're going to intersect with formal

2342
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:23,679
laws as well as the code is law

2343
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,960
any comments

2344
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,360
okay and then i think the last point was

2345
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:30,320
just

2346
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:33,040
in the further directions of the paper

2347
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,719
further refinement of active inference

2348
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:36,639
constructs is needed to enable wide

2349
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:39,120
application to social organization

2350
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,400
employing human and artificial

2351
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,520
intelligence

2352
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,840
apropos the practical examples in the

2353
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,520
paper can provide starting points for

2354
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,040
research into the challenges of

2355
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,120
ascribing markov blankets defining

2356
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,679
generative models handling pragmatics

2357
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:53,920
and modeling variational free energy in

2358
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,080
real world social organization and

2359
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:59,040
that's an idea that we touched on in our

2360
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,920
2020 paper active inference and behavior

2361
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,080
engineering for teams which is that in

2362
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:06,320
the case of remote teams

2363
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,600
then

2364
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:10,159
the entire structure can be observed

2365
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:12,239
through the sensory data that's sent to

2366
01:24:12,239 --> 01:24:14,239
a user and then the actions that are

2367
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:16,239
received for example on either side of

2368
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:18,400
an interface or either side of a

2369
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,440
blockchain wallet so for remote teams

2370
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,440
because they're defined digitally we

2371
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:26,000
have access to the entire state space so

2372
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,800
to speak of sensory and active states

2373
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,360
whereas for trying to do the um active

2374
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:34,000
inference model of people in a physical

2375
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,600
boardroom that's always going to be

2376
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,280
complicated even if you have a really

2377
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,920
effective way to get body position out

2378
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:42,159
of the cameras in the room for example

2379
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:44,400
so just kind of cool to think about

2380
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,520
uh industrial design or engineering

2381
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:48,880
all these different

2382
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,480
ideas we talked about

2383
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:53,840
in terms of online as well as physical

2384
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,679
engineering so not just like cars and

2385
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:56,960
stuff

2386
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:01,280
those are hardware and software as well

2387
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:03,440
so we kind of just closed by saying um

2388
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,960
what

2389
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,040
people can give their last thoughts blue

2390
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,480
and dean just what would a good

2391
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,360
understanding enable what are some good

2392
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:13,199
unique predictions or implications or

2393
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:14,719
areas that this

2394
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:17,679
line of research might be addressing

2395
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:19,040
what are the next steps for this kind of

2396
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,880
research the goals of the research and

2397
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,719
then also just what you're curious about

2398
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:24,400
asking the author tomorrow and in the

2399
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:27,799
following week

2400
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:30,480
yeah i think i've laid out some

2401
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,639
questions um today that i hope i don't

2402
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:35,440
forget for tomorrow but um

2403
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,679
i definitely think that uh

2404
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:40,480
active inference in

2405
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,560
systems and organizations and social

2406
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,080
structures is

2407
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,480
definitely important um along with like

2408
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,960
the validation of your model through

2409
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,960
other models like through the models of

2410
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,040
other people and through like this this

2411
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,880
confirmation bias like oh my model must

2412
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,239
be good because you have a model that's

2413
01:25:56,239 --> 01:25:58,560
like my model so so i think that this

2414
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,639
this existence um

2415
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:03,199
it can help to really set boundaries and

2416
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:04,719
definitions on

2417
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:06,320
on um

2418
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:09,120
how we really form social structures not

2419
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:11,120
just businesses and and i mean in

2420
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,520
business there's kind of a hierarchical

2421
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:16,400
component and um but i mean also like

2422
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:19,920
society as a whole we form these social

2423
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,600
structures and how does this social

2424
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,760
morphogenesis really take place so i

2425
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,159
think really the author puts out a good

2426
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:29,360
um you know way of of kind of delving

2427
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:32,159
into social morphogenesis uh even

2428
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:34,560
through like quality quality management

2429
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,880
and industrial engineering but it's it's

2430
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:39,760
definitely first steps

2431
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:44,560
any final comments

2432
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,159
well i'm really looking forward to

2433
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:48,080
talking to the author because

2434
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,760
i think at the end of the day rather

2435
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:50,960
than

2436
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:53,280
um

2437
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:55,520
what's the word here rather than

2438
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:56,880
exploring

2439
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:57,760
why

2440
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:00,719
why these these mappings have been put

2441
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:03,280
together in this paper i i'm kind of

2442
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,679
curious now about trying to figure out

2443
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,360
so when did

2444
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:10,159
when did these parallels sort of form in

2445
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:12,320
his mind and get to a place where he

2446
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,159
could take a lot of this background

2447
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:15,520
information because he's i mean he's

2448
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:16,320
really

2449
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:19,199
cleverly and and thoroughly sourced here

2450
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:21,520
when did he sort of put these two things

2451
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:24,000
together as a reflection of one another

2452
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,520
and where does he see that going forward

2453
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,000
totally agreed it's a single author

2454
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,440
paper that

2455
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:34,560
reflects a really deep understanding and

2456
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:37,280
probably a lot of experience presenting

2457
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,520
and thinking about this and maybe even

2458
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,320
applying it so those are all super

2459
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:45,040
interesting areas to find out about

2460
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,520
all right well blue dean thanks that was

2461
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,199
epic thanks for all the help on the

2462
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:51,520
slides and on the stream

2463
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,920
so that was great we'll uh talk to

2464
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:58,239
everybody in the dot 1.2 or later so bye

2465
01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:01,480
thanks dan
