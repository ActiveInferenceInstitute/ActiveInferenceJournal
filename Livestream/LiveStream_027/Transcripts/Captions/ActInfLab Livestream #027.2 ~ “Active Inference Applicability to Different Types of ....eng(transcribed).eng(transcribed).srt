00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,639
hello everyone and welcome to the active

2
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,720
inference lab this is active lab live

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,680
stream number 27.2 on august 31st 2021

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,160
we are a participatory online lab that

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,640
is communicating learning and practicing

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,560
applied active inference you can find us

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,238
at the links here

8
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,160
this is a recorded and an archived live

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,920
stream so please provide us with

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,120
feedback so that we can improve our work

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,640
all backgrounds and perspectives are

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,719
welcome here and we'll follow video

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,360
etiquette for live streams and see who

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,039
joins us

15
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,360
the short link is the calendar of live

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,559
streams

17
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,520
of the past and future and we did choose

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,520
28

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,480
paper

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,879
but didn't update this slide so check

21
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,920
the link for next week's paper

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,879
today in 27.2

23
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,479
welcome to

24
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,640
stephen greetings in 27.2 we're

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,640
joined by the two stevens as it were

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,960
and um we'll

27
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,119
have a few questions that we can

28
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,119
have slides for the figures to go

29
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,360
through the paper itself anything else

30
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,200
that anyone wants to add and then of

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,400
course

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,240
any questions that

33
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,880
people type into live chat as well if

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,040
they're watching live so

35
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,280
um we can just

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,320
say

37
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,190
hello and then we can

38
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,600
[Music]

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,759
leave it to the author last just to

40
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,880
maybe

41
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,680
open it up or just bring what they

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,360
were thinking about

43
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,759
our second discussion here today so i'm

44
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,720
daniel and i'm a postdoc in california

45
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,600
i'll pass to stephen celet

46
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,399
oh hello there i'm stephen i'm based in

47
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,719
toronto and uh

48
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,360
i'm working on social topographies and

49
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,159
other spatial meaning making and hoping

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,920
to find ways for active influence to

51
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,000
shed light and all of that

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,920
and i'll pass it shall pass it to the

53
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,519
other stephen is that okay

54
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,640
yeah good day to you i'm uh i'm in

55
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,840
finland southern

56
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,440
finland i'm based at the technical

57
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,720
research center of finland and i'm

58
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,160
ready to answer questions

59
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,879
cool so again

60
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,160
uh anyone who is watching can post a

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,319
question but then there's a few that we

62
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,518
have lined up a little bit

63
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,480
just one

64
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,360
theme that

65
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,640
stood out

66
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,720
as far as selecting this paper was that

67
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,440
it was applied it was applied to making

68
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,200
the kinds of objects and

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,790
supporting

70
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,040
[Music]

71
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,640
the ability to have the internet and

72
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,040
computers as well as just objects like

73
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,360
pens and things like that so

74
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,560
how

75
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,360
does this idea of helping us design

76
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,599
physical systems which ends up being our

77
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,599
niche modification

78
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,319
uh

79
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,200
activity as an economy

80
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,920
how do we help design maybe if we're not

81
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,920
an industrial engineer

82
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,680
but potentially people working on

83
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,000
different kinds of projects that end up

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,400
modifying the environment

85
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,319
maybe even influencing the same systems

86
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,480
that industrial engineers use

87
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,599
or um using some of the same techniques

88
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,040
but people who are just thinking along

89
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,799
these lines and want to take what you

90
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,799
translated one step towards application

91
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,720
in your paper and then think about how

92
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,239
it applies in their own

93
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,239
work

94
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,879
so cyber physical system so the latest

95
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,200
um

96
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,720
trend in this

97
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,959
is um

98
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,519
for example the in

99
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,680
in the usa i think it's called smart

100
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,200
manufacturing

101
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,120
and in europe industry 4.0

102
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,599
and a big thing in this is the idea of

103
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,959
having digital twins

104
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,519
or digital siblings

105
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,798
or even

106
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,120
avatars um

107
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,280
and the idea of this is is that

108
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,199
there's a

109
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,759
the physical

110
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,160
machine

111
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,320
the physical process has got um

112
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,120
sensors on it and actuators on it

113
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,720
and the sensors

114
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,000
bring live

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,800
uh

116
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,919
data

117
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,000
to the digital equivalent

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,720
of this physical process

119
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,120
and through

120
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,479
so uh

121
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,960
and then it seeks to optimize by seeing

122
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,680
what's going on

123
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,479
so

124
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,919
and a basic

125
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,520
um

126
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,080
basic level is although difficult to

127
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,800
achieve is predictive maintenance for

128
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,880
example so if nothing else at least to

129
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,520
stop the physical process from

130
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,000
malfunctioning or even worse stopping

131
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,680
and there's no um

132
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,600
[Music]

133
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,420
there's no

134
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,320
[Music]

135
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,199
theoretical

136
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,080
um

137
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,360
foundation for

138
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,360
for these industrial

139
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,600
innovations for things like digital

140
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,400
twins so of course there's a theoretical

141
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,039
and background of cyber physical systems

142
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,840
but there's nothing to

143
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,880
anchor it with in my opinion

144
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,160
that's very

145
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,000
straightforward

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,880
so if we look at

147
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,080
life sciences generally

148
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,520
we know that

149
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,799
evolution has had

150
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,720
millennia of

151
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,479
and millions of years to iterate

152
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,440
to

153
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,840
develop elegant solutions

154
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,440
so it seems sensible at least to me to

155
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,199
to look to the life sciences

156
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,759
to see how nature's evolved towards

157
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,160
least action

158
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,759
and

159
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,120
of course uh

160
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,600
free energy principle and active

161
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,720
inference

162
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,440
framework or theory

163
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:43,750
uh

164
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,600
[Music]

165
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,520
from the life sciences

166
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,840
and

167
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,080
are

168
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,720
in their essence i believe very

169
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,560
straightforward

170
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,960
as one would expect guiding principles

171
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,720
in nature to be

172
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,479
and applicable to

173
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,120
human and artificial intelligence to

174
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,160
artificial agents

175
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,960
so

176
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,240
i believe it's useful to start from that

177
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,599
basis

178
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:18,720
and with

179
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,039
the free energy principle

180
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,840
this very straightforward idea of that

181
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,639
of trying to minimize

182
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,039
the information gap

183
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,080
between

184
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,639
the generative model

185
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,039
and the world itself

186
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,280
so that's a very straight forward idea

187
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,840
and i know there's

188
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,440
um you know the

189
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,560
the mass behind it is evolving all the

190
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,960
time and there's some debate and

191
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,879
uh

192
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,280
courteous dispute about that but the

193
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,479
basic ideas seem straightforward so

194
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,639
i believe it's therefore a good place to

195
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,039
start

196
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,720
and

197
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,720
because this is such a basic idea isn't

198
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,599
it

199
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,800
minimizing the information gap between

200
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,280
the the generative model and the world

201
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,679
itself

202
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,800
is this what i've said helpful in any

203
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,039
way

204
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,280
thanks for this i wrote a lot of it down

205
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,080
stephen's let

206
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,039
yeah some really good points there

207
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,039
one thing i'd be interested in to to

208
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,719
know what your thoughts are is

209
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,479
you know we can end up kind of

210
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,039
adapting our niche through action as a

211
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,039
kind of consequence

212
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,640
of

213
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,279
like following a path and these types of

214
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,480
things

215
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,000
and then we've got this kind of more

216
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,800
constructed um

217
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,320
sort of uh

218
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,800
deliberative um

219
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,399
organizational work

220
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,959
um in which you know the in many ways

221
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,040
the point of that work can be to

222
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,680
construct the environment um

223
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
in which tools will operate you know so

224
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,440
in some ways we we use the tools of our

225
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,760
legs or the tools of being in

226
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,600
in the world and it can

227
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,920
sculpt that niche and also we can be

228
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,240
very much sculpting a

229
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,680
bounded niche

230
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,760
so i'm wondering my question is

231
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,120
thinking about

232
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,880
whether you see those that kind of

233
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,760
distinction as being significant and

234
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,000
how you see um

235
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,279
the

236
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,519
idea of like the free energy or the

237
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,200
implications of the free energy sort of

238
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,120
rolling out in the niche versus

239
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
the generative model for that niche

240
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,480
being embodied in some way so you know

241
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,279
so anyway so how much is there something

242
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,959
when it's embodied

243
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,640
for instance when you're talking about

244
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,920
these um

245
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,080
total quality management environments

246
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,880
where

247
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,279
someone is um

248
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,120
trying to maintain

249
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,120
i don't know iso standards of

250
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,160
manufacturing or whatever so

251
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,959
i wonder what your thoughts are about

252
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,120
that whether there's distinctions there

253
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,800
in terms of active influence being

254
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,360
particularly involved or

255
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,360
you know the free energy principle more

256
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,079
more generally

257
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,959
so um

258
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,240
so i believe that um

259
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,800
that that the core of quality management

260
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,079
is

261
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,440
just a

262
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,959
an instantiation of

263
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,839
free uh of

264
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,680
realizing the free energy principle

265
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,920
through active inference

266
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,519
and that's what i've you know put in the

267
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,120
paper

268
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,720
um but there's a bigger issue about um

269
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,789
[Music]

270
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,480
that in in nature things are evolving

271
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,480
and uh

272
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,720
as i put in another one of my papers in

273
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,040
entropy that uh

274
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,560
that

275
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,399
so

276
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,040
there are no

277
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,760
things are evolving to some degree

278
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,560
naturally and

279
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,040
so if you say predator and prey

280
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,680
they they just it's evolved and if

281
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,000
you're a beaver trying to get back to

282
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,120
the

283
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,880
lodge that you've built your niche

284
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,519
construction as a beaver

285
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,640
and there's a links in if you're if you

286
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,519
see in between

287
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,680
where you are and you'll be the lodge

288
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,440
and there's a links

289
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,800
a hungry link standing in your way

290
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,240
then it's clear that okay and this is a

291
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,920
predator and i should

292
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,079
this is not my as a as a beaver that's

293
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,760
not my preferred observation

294
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,440
whereas my uh beaver lodge is a

295
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,040
preferred observation

296
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,920
but what goes on in uh

297
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,639
human niche construction and uh because

298
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,880
it's the main area environmental

299
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,720
engineering

300
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,440
is not so straightforward so

301
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,399
um for example

302
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,680
highly refined food

303
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,600
it seems to be a

304
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,360
naturally to us like a preferred

305
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,240
observation because it tastes good and

306
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,880
so it makes life less strenuous and more

307
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,120
stimulating

308
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,600
so if they're quite if the if the if the

309
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,800
company

310
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,959
making

311
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,000
uh

312
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,920
highly processed food

313
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,680
ready meals

314
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,040
and so on

315
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,200
it's it's acting within

316
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,720
quality

317
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,760
assurance so it's doing in my opinion

318
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,440
active inference

319
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,680
to

320
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,360
realize the free energy principle

321
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,720
but

322
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,200
what its output

323
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,000
is

324
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,079
it subverts the free energy principle

325
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,639
the externality it subverts the free

326
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,920
energy principle because

327
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,240
what it's offering to us as consumers

328
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,000
it seems to be

329
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,720
consistent with

330
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,240
what revolved to do so it makes life

331
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,079
less strenuous

332
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,480
and more more stimulating

333
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,560
but actually

334
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,800
it's not good for our health in the long

335
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,720
term of course

336
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,800
now and then no problem

337
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,320
but if that's all you if you live in a

338
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,760
food desert

339
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,680
if you live in a food desert we know

340
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,399
there are lots of studies that show that

341
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,320
unfortunately

342
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,959
this isn't good for health

343
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,160
so if you take

344
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,040
one

345
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,360
um

346
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,560
entity at a time

347
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,079
it can be

348
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,000
conforming with the three energy

349
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,199
principle um through active inference

350
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,639
but

351
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,160
its output

352
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,880
subverts

353
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,639
the free energy principle because it

354
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,399
makes

355
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,240
our profit our

356
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,839
our preferred observations

357
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,480
instead of being good for us

358
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,279
are

359
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,199
not good for us but we only discover

360
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,399
that

361
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,920
20 30 years later

362
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,600
so that's quite a lot to i have a

363
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,880
diagram in um

364
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,160
uh

365
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,900
there's a simple diagram of this in

366
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,039
[Music]

367
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,720
get paper

368
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,880
so the paper's called

369
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,600
yeah it's called multi-scale free energy

370
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,839
and analysis of human ecosystem

371
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,480
engineering

372
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,639
okay

373
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,120
and there's uh

374
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,040
one diagram in it figure one

375
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,320
so it's an entropy as well yeah

376
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,399
shall i share my screen

377
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,560
sure

378
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,320
now remind me there it is isn't it

379
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,240
okay

380
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,600
all right

381
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,040
are you saying

382
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,440
multiscoping free energy analysis if you

383
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,320
make your system engineering yep

384
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,279
all right so

385
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,360
here's this diagram then um

386
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,440
there it is

387
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,759
so what

388
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,600
what the so what active inference is

389
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,079
leading us to is that

390
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,360
from nature

391
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,600
is that our preferred observation

392
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,920
supports survival

393
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,560
an unwanted surprise so

394
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,959
an unexpected difference

395
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,120
between

396
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,120
uh

397
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,800
a prediction

398
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,279
of what we're going to experience based

399
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,079
on our internal generative model so an

400
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,639
unwanted surprise so if the beaver's

401
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,320
going back to its lodge it's thinking

402
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,759
it's going to have an unhindered path

403
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,759
back to its lodge and there's the

404
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,399
unwanted surprise of the hungry lynx

405
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,560
standing in the way and it threatens

406
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,560
survival

407
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,519
so that's natural free energy principle

408
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,120
but

409
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,680
through um

410
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,079
human

411
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,120
environmental engineering

412
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,600
niche construction within that

413
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,679
preferred observations

414
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,760
can threaten survival

415
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,559
so if my preferred observation is

416
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,720
a comfy sofa

417
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,160
a large

418
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,480
tv screen

419
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,439
um

420
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,720
and a

421
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,039
device to change

422
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,640
channels and do uh gaming

423
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,600
and then i can just order some food in

424
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,840
it comes

425
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,919
uh very tasty but

426
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,520
perhaps not good for me i could be

427
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,679
sitting down for

428
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,760
16 hours and then go

429
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,600
go lie down for the remaining eight

430
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,200
hours

431
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,360
maybe all my preferred observations but

432
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,120
they're not good for me

433
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
whereas the unwanted surprise that

434
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,719
supports survival could be

435
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,000
messages that okay we should not sit

436
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,760
down for more than 20 minutes we should

437
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,960
take

438
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,600
lots of physical activity we should eat

439
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,480
um

440
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,640
make our own food

441
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,919
and so on

442
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,600
so

443
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,799
what's going on in human endeavors

444
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,840
which

445
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,840
may

446
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,640
individually

447
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,960
conform to realization the free energy

448
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,760
principle through

449
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,039
active inference can end up

450
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,559
subverting

451
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,520
the free energy principle

452
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,280
outside

453
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,799
of that productive act of that

454
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,840
production activity

455
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,760
and here there's

456
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,840
some numbers

457
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,440
okay so

458
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,080
so beaver could develop a new genitive

459
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,679
all right let's see here

460
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,120
all right so so in nature

461
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,600
for a beaver the

462
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,919
the um preference distribution for

463
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,640
sensory inputs is for example plus 10

464
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,880
for the protective pond the lodge

465
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,520
zero for woodland and minus 10 for a

466
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,760
hungry predator

467
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,679
but then if there's a bit of pollution

468
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,919
you change like okay so now it is

469
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,080
getting more complicated so there's

470
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,720
plus 10 productive bonding clear water

471
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,880
plus two predicted upon polluted water

472
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,120
woodland zero hungry predators still

473
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,200
minus 10

474
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,400
but then um

475
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,080
uh

476
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,880
or

477
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,720
the example in this paper is in um

478
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,480
some uh island nations very small island

479
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,640
nations where

480
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,840
there's um

481
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,919
a lot of important cheap calorie rich

482
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,200
nutrient poor food

483
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,200
and then the preference distribution

484
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,679
could be plus 10 imported food plus two

485
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,200
local food minus 10 no food

486
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,600
even though there's clear evidence that

487
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,919
the imported food is

488
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,640
not good

489
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,320
okay

490
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,460
so there it is

491
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,599
[Music]

492
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,280
okay so did that um

493
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,760
did that

494
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,679
lit up the hands

495
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,720
i i wrote down some stuff as well but

496
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,880
blue welcome um

497
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,720
go for it and then

498
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,080
afterwards we'll be stephen

499
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,280
thanks so i i was really curious about

500
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,600
that subverted um

501
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,559
model and like where

502
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,960
you're maybe not optimizing like where

503
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,360
where what your preference is is not

504
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,200
optimizing for survival

505
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,360
and i think that um you know you used it

506
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,120
in the human context but i can think of

507
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,919
many contexts where animals do a similar

508
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,880
thing like a moth will fly into a flame

509
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,440
and like a cat like i have these two

510
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,440
kittens now in my house and they're like

511
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,919
such trouble right like their curiosity

512
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,240
like had my cat trapped in a box earlier

513
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,080
today like i mean trapped like under

514
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,159
furniture in the box which was like so

515
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,480
bizarre so i mean i can think of of

516
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,480
models where it's always not optimal and

517
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,720
so is this something that you think

518
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,640
excuse me what was the last thing you

519
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,760
said

520
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,440
it just something that you frame as

521
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,039
uniquely human because i can think of

522
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,559
many instances of like non-human

523
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,720
uh creatures that also have less than

524
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,840
optimal preferences

525
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,400
um no i'm not framing is only human but

526
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,480
what i'm

527
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,880
pointing out is is that

528
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,880
so for example the moth flies towards

529
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,480
the flame

530
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,520
but where did the flame come from

531
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,640
and the cat's curiosity

532
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,799
luckily did not kill your cats that's

533
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,760
good

534
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,799
um

535
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,440
but they were going into boxes

536
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,360
but where did the boxes come from

537
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,880
so

538
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,960
are these things

539
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,120
um

540
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,840
of course there are misjudgments

541
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,200
so all living things can

542
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,880
they could be uh

543
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,720
and of course with predators and prey

544
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,799
that for sure the predators are trying

545
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,559
to get the prey aren't they

546
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,120
and people can have um and

547
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,440
living things can misjudge the how far

548
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,799
away the prey is and so on and signaling

549
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,960
systems can

550
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,159
can get messed up and things but

551
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,120
with

552
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,799
human beings the scale

553
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,440
and the determination

554
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,640
of

555
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,039
um

556
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,840
activities

557
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,679
is is much

558
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,919
larger so

559
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,039
there's a

560
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,280
there's an american author who's his

561
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,600
latest book i mean he's called hooked

562
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,200
um

563
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,320
but uh he's studied the the for example

564
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,159
the food industry for many years and um

565
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,520
he

566
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,400
his

567
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,480
view is that

568
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,960
there's nothing at all malicious going

569
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,080
on but it's just if you're

570
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,120
if you're in the in the uh

571
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,559
a certain

572
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,440
business

573
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,480
you want

574
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,400
you're trying to get as many customers

575
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,600
as possible

576
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,799
and you're trying to retain them

577
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,320
and

578
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,639
um

579
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,000
with no no bad intentions at all it's

580
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,159
all good intentions

581
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,440
but

582
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,320
then the effects

583
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,679
are

584
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,640
we discover it can be decades later that

585
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,480
okay

586
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,480
um

587
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,799
this is

588
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,480
what we thought was

589
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,760
good

590
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,240
is not so good

591
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,400
whereas in nature if the

592
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,480
the wherever the flame

593
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,400
suppose it was a flame from somewhere in

594
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,600
nature it was a natural fire

595
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,279
well the

596
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,840
the natural fire maybe came from bolt of

597
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,000
lightning or something

598
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,840
it

599
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,320
wasn't a determined effort over many

600
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,400
decades

601
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,600
of ever increasing refinement

602
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,719
of a market offering

603
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,400
but uh so

604
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,919
there's more

605
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,760
so what i'm showing in the paper that

606
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,120
you read

607
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,559
that diagram

608
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,799
about how the quality management system

609
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,360
is like a general it's like an active

610
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,520
inference system

611
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,279
to reduce

612
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,679
free free energy

613
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,640
so

614
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,480
it's optimum for the organization

615
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,080
but it can be sub-optimal

616
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,799
outside the organization so i think a

617
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,400
general word to them for this is

618
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,360
externalities

619
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,120
just

620
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,320
uh two quick things one was trying to

621
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,400
explore that distinction between what is

622
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,000
human other than the fact that we care

623
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,400
about us and each other

624
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,240
what is human and i was just thinking of

625
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,159
the ants foraging out there in the

626
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,120
desert

627
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,760
and they don't do margin trading

628
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,200
or um

629
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,440
staking of their seeds to try to get

630
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,159
fractional seeds and lending of seeds

631
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,679
it's like layer one seed gathering

632
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,039
versus

633
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,640
the higher order

634
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,320
symbolic risks that the humans engage in

635
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,159
so that and the niche modification and

636
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,480
the scale among other factors and then

637
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,400
also what you said about misjudgment and

638
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,960
the ability to misjudge because

639
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,480
a lot of people think oh well you know

640
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,039
if um let's just say

641
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,880
traditional understandings of evolution

642
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,400
are about fitness

643
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,440
then

644
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,080
why why do organisms fail

645
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,080
why do all organisms not just maximize

646
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,000
their fitness or if active inference is

647
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,400
about reduction of uncertainty or

648
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,320
using action and inference to reduce

649
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,600
uncertainty then why do organisms fail

650
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,520
and that's where the engineering

651
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,760
perspective comes into play like

652
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,200
things just do

653
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,720
fall apart and just because there is an

654
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,960
imperative whether to maximize fitness

655
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,360
or to minimize uncertainty the point is

656
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,320
of

657
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,840
the ensemble there's going to be a

658
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,760
distribution of performance like 100

659
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,039
engines they're going to have some range

660
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,000
of failure times the ld50 for some

661
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,600
pharmacological experiment so just

662
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,919
because the framework has sort of a um

663
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,159
imperative weather fitness or

664
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,760
uncertainty reduction

665
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,080
doesn't mean that it's utopian or like

666
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,240
pangolossian it means that every single

667
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,480
thing always works perfectly

668
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,240
so just

669
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,360
cool points that you raised

670
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,919
but it but also blue um my my uh

671
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,000
i have imperfect knowledge that's for

672
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,039
sure

673
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,360
and i wouldn't make um

674
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,399
i i i i don't know enough

675
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,039
and maybe nobody does um like

676
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:27,760
what

677
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,720
was just said about ants of course

678
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,480
those words were coming for an expert

679
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,559
and i don't i know next to nothing about

680
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,080
that and

681
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,640
many of the behavior of many of or

682
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,799
animals i don't know so for sure it's

683
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:41,679
not

684
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,520
it's not clear-cut it's not you know one

685
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,200
that humans doing this and all other

686
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,399
animals aren't doing it

687
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,000
thanks steven celet and then of course

688
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,200
anyone who's watching live

689
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,840
i think this raises some useful

690
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,240
areas where we have spaces where it's

691
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,640
very free energy minimizing as the main

692
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,080
kind of

693
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,760
way of getting a handle on things and

694
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,520
the broader active inference so for

695
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,640
instance

696
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,360
when we're dealing with equilibrium

697
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,279
chemistry we're dealing with

698
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,279
things which are

699
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,720
often boiled or heated or

700
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,000
made to be

701
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,240
effectively dead

702
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,440
which is what happens in most

703
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,600
engineering processes in most food

704
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,360
processes i mean the main thing that

705
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,039
coca-cola

706
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,279
does by putting sugar in is it makes a

707
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,880
preservative

708
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,399
someone's saying to me oh why can't they

709
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,000
just use water it's an awful lot easier

710
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,159
to distribute coca-cola than to

711
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,080
distribute bottled water because

712
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,840
coca-cola doesn't go off because it's

713
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,919
got so much acid and sugar in it it

714
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,600
won't go off right

715
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,840
so that what you've got is you've got

716
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,279
these processes like you're talking

717
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,880
about with tqm

718
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,320
and i worked in the pigment

719
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,559
manufacturing industry so we they were

720
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,240
bringing in the iso standards there

721
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,120
around

722
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,640
pigment manufacturing because they were

723
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,159
inheriting a lot of these formulas from

724
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,159
like 100 years previous

725
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,159
and it was all about

726
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,080
minimizing and to make things

727
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,360
reproducible and within tolerance

728
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,279
but you're always dealing with

729
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,840
you never want things to

730
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,760
be organic you don't want things to sort

731
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,559
of

732
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,080
to grow

733
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,320
in any place in the in the process you

734
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,760
want it to all be

735
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,240
i suppose you could say dead right but

736
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,679
then what's really interesting as you

737
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,120
point out is

738
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,799
okay that might be what happens within

739
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,919
the containment of the factory or the

740
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,840
industrial process but it will go back

741
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,080
into the world just like it will when

742
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,880
it's out now as a product

743
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,960
it will be used in

744
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,279
an ecological niche and it will not be a

745
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,399
dead niche you know that food that maybe

746
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,320
isn't even biologically feasible or some

747
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,520
of those chemicals are not there's no

748
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,360
biological route to create them there's

749
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,320
no way to create fluoride

750
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,320
compounds biologically it just can't be

751
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,440
done it has to only be done

752
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,880
synthetically

753
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,760
so what's your thoughts about that

754
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,520
sticking with minimizing free energy

755
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,520
more when you've only got dead

756
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,880
equilibrium systems and then when it and

757
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,039
what and how much active inference is

758
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,000
involved in in that i suppose a first

759
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,760
order is only a second or third order

760
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,559
and then

761
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,000
what how things pop out into the niche

762
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,520
in the community or whatever

763
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,480
um i think this is um

764
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,039
open question i mean at one level maybe

765
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,919
it's um in world systems theory this uh

766
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,640
the the framing is that there are so now

767
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,720
it's in about whole countries rather

768
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,039
than just um a company making something

769
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,679
in one factory that

770
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,000
there are inevitably

771
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
core i think the terminology is core

772
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,600
countries that

773
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,320
so it was the netherlands then britain

774
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,600
then the usa now going towards china

775
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,880
and then there are

776
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,080
peripheral

777
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,159
countries

778
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,399
two levels of those and um

779
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,240
the argument is that the the development

780
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,399
of the core countries is

781
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,360
dependent upon taking from the

782
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,879
the peripheral countries and

783
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,279
um

784
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,760
is this

785
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,600
entropy being shipped out of the uh

786
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,240
so if if you think of like a a factory

787
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,320
as a heat pump

788
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,080
and it's uh

789
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,919
you're getting all the entropy out of

790
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,080
the factory operations

791
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,279
but then it's

792
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,200
where's it going

793
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,120
is it being shipped out of the factory

794
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,399
and then

795
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,799
it is entry but you've been shipped out

796
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,320
of the

797
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,559
pumped out of the core

798
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,120
countries into the rest of the world

799
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,799
where things are confusing so

800
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,440
i don't know i mean that's a bit of a a

801
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,480
broad sweeping statement isn't it so but

802
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,440
maybe

803
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,360
maybe on one level that's what's going

804
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,960
on if there's

805
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,880
if you

806
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,240
if you have supply chains

807
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,159
value chains

808
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:19,600
and

809
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,799
you push all the physical disorder

810
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,120
out of those by eliminating all the

811
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,840
information

812
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,960
uncertainty then

813
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,120
does that mean that the physical

814
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,120
disorder has inevitably got to go

815
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,760
somewhere else

816
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,399
i don't i don't know

817
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,399
so uh but

818
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,080
maybe and then

819
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,480
but uh

820
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,159
with

821
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,320
but for sure there are externalities and

822
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,320
the interaction between levels is uh

823
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,559
because in inhuman endeavors it's uh

824
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,720
it's a shifting matrix it's not just a

825
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,919
simple hierarchy

826
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,519
can i just ask one thing just bouncing

827
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,519
back off that is i think it's an

828
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,760
interesting so in some ways

829
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,120
by

830
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,320
by things sort of being taken out of the

831
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,960
ecological niche effectively by putting

832
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,000
in a process a processing plant where

833
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,159
it's effectively dead you know

834
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,960
you you heat up your sugar your sugar

835
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,360
cane raw material in a vat with sulfuric

836
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,480
acid and it

837
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,760
you know it's all it's all dead it can't

838
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,440
it's basically a chemical process that

839
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,880
gets put into

840
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,799
whatever foods that someone's eating

841
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,919
the consequence of having that

842
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,360
dead

843
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,279
equilibrium based process rather

844
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,840
non-equilibrium steady state process is

845
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,080
that you're saying it puts a burden back

846
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,120
on

847
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,919
the ecosystem to try and reintegrate it

848
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,760
so in some ways

849
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,080
is it pushing entropy out or is it just

850
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,440
placing a burden on

851
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,600
system to try and find a way to cope

852
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,599
with something that it can't

853
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,239
naturally incorporate easily into its

854
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,560
niche

855
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,839
what do you think blue

856
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,918
yeah i'm not sure really i'm not um

857
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,918
i'm not uh entirely certain

858
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,079
on this

859
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,280
on this um

860
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,679
transfer of disorder

861
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,760
it's definitely very important like for

862
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,839
example when people say well look at the

863
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,079
miles per gallon of this car and then

864
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,560
okay but where did the metal come from

865
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,480
okay but you know everything is tied to

866
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,760
everything and how we evaluate

867
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,040
policies ultimately and choices are

868
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,359
critical and we do have to understand

869
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,000
the relationships of um

870
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,640
the world's supply chains but then i

871
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,440
thought well it's not like there's a

872
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,520
like we're in a bomb calorimeter or a

873
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,560
heat bath where there's a constant

874
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,880
um number or proportion of some kind of

875
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,040
uh negative activity like there could be

876
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,720
an ant colony with

877
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,280
of in a niche with very low

878
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,240
nest mate aggression or bodies like

879
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,320
there's organisms with low rates of

880
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,720
cancer or in certain niches you know

881
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,320
it's not like a statement of them across

882
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,119
all

883
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,880
patterns and times

884
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,599
but

885
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,920
um but then again it was like so things

886
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,280
do fail

887
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,359
and there's no perfect

888
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:38,320
state

889
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,160
but then at the same

890
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,760
time

891
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,320
it's not zero sum in the informational

892
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,480
game it's not like we're trying to

893
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,760
because we're getting energy coming in

894
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,079
so can we kind of transmute

895
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,440
physical

896
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,160
order with information disorder

897
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,480
do we have to like offload something to

898
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,400
another place physically

899
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,079
does it bump up against any of the

900
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,520
information

901
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,400
limits or calculations or density

902
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,280
of processing or storage

903
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,960
will we not be able to remember enough

904
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,880
and then there's a catastrophic failure

905
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,480
i mean there's so many

906
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,560
components to your questions so i hope

907
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,040
that we can all keep thinking about that

908
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,640
because it's important at the level of

909
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,240
like

910
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,440
human

911
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,839
activity with the supply chain and

912
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,760
that's also an important long range

913
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,720
question

914
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,440
and if we don't have a long uh range

915
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,359
preference

916
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,160
then we're not going to get there

917
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,560
can i have one more bit in there without

918
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,760
yeah

919
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,800
um

920
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,320
i think what's interesting as well is

921
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,560
there's this question of

922
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,079
because i don't really believe there is

923
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,520
strictly speaking neg entropy as such so

924
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,960
in terms of

925
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,520
um it's always kind of a relative thing

926
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,440
but it's a useful it can be useful to

927
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,520
think about it that way sometimes but

928
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,520
ultimately it's always a change so i

929
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,839
suppose the question

930
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,000
comes in in terms of

931
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
how much is it around the ability to

932
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,280
infer

933
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,079
using entropy

934
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,520
as much as it is about

935
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,119
how you know how much is it to be able

936
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,839
to use change in entropy or dynamics of

937
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,720
entropy which can be a complex jungle

938
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,000
niche you know it could be a lot of

939
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,599
entropy change and a lot of stuff going

940
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,160
on but it can be very healthy

941
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,880
how much is that ability

942
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,000
to

943
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,240
dynamically get at the variational free

944
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,599
energy really important for life

945
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,079
um whereas for us it's all about you

946
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,280
know at times in an engineering context

947
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,800
it's just reducing free energy per se

948
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,079
as a kind of an overall entropy term

949
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,760
which could be actually not so much

950
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,839
about variational change it's just an

951
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,680
overall general

952
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,880
reduction in entropy i wonder what

953
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,920
what your thoughts are on that

954
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,680
one thought on that on the biological

955
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,880
side is

956
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,040
what's an industrial engineering

957
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,200
relationship ecosystem engineering

958
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,680
relationship that has persisted

959
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,920
for billions of years or millions of

960
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,320
years or just long time however you want

961
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,280
to see it

962
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,640
the nitrogen cycle and some of the redox

963
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,119
cycles in the bacterial

964
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:47,839
uh

965
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,720
relationships biofilms the mitochondria

966
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,400
and the eukaryotes

967
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,480
now that's a shifting interface

968
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,560
but on the other hand eukaryotes can

969
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,119
totally count on that interface

970
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,240
the powerhouse of the cell as they say

971
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,839
to persist

972
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,000
but then there's this other sense

973
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,240
in which there is still a game theory

974
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,400
and a failure mode and uh probably an

975
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,800
interface of maximal uncertainty

976
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,280
and the requirement for active sensing

977
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,680
and trade-off costs

978
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,160
so it's again it's not like things i

979
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,200
think

980
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,520
work 99 of time or 100 or 20 percent of

981
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,400
the time

982
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,640
that is kind of how the chess board is

983
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,480
set up for the

984
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,359
for the

985
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,400
um

986
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,520
for it to even be a winning board at all

987
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,320
there's just niches where it can't work

988
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,079
like there's temperatures that just the

989
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,800
population will just die at period

990
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,200
so is our engineering condition such

991
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,720
that there is a path

992
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,400
that's going to lead to

993
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,240
what standard of life

994
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,880
with what precision and

995
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,400
uncertainty

996
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,480
for what distribution of people

997
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,119
like did we way way overshoot

998
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,800
and now it's going to change back down

999
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,640
to a different way or

1000
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,280
is there some critical path

1001
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,160
to

1002
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,359
changing

1003
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,760
the distribution of industry

1004
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,240
because it's not going to be

1005
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,240
any way it was from

1006
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,760
zero to

1007
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,000
2021 it's not going to be that way next

1008
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
year

1009
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,720
um

1010
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,680
are you

1011
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,560
do you

1012
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,240
are you still seeing my screen oh

1013
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,240
i'm not could you reshare it

1014
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,079
okay all right this is a

1015
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,680
can i reach

1016
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,560
you do that again

1017
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,800
this is a are you seeing now

1018
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,960
figure one better ecosystems in the

1019
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,640
anthropocene

1020
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,400
now i see it yep

1021
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,760
okay yes this is a paper i'll go to the

1022
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,200
title um

1023
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,960
so

1024
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,400
nearly awesome or anything but

1025
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,359
this is um

1026
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,560
uh not by me by others nothing to do

1027
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,200
with me i'm just the reader of it um

1028
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,880
i know one

1029
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,000
thing that they're saying that

1030
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,280
you can just

1031
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,720
so here this

1032
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,319
this is the same

1033
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,440
these are showing the same things but

1034
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,040
a is where human impacts on

1035
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,160
migration-based matter ecosystem

1036
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,200
it's

1037
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,640
it's just sort of implicit

1038
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,599
and on this framing of it they say that

1039
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,119
okay so we explicitly deal with

1040
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,720
the uh socio-ecological

1041
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,960
framework about okay so what

1042
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,680
are human beings

1043
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,760
what mental models of human beings got

1044
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,560
what regulations arise from that and

1045
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,680
then

1046
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,520
that inputs into it

1047
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,079
so let me go to the top so you see the

1048
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,720
title

1049
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,640
yeah embedding method

1050
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,160
on embedding meta ecosystems into a

1051
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,160
socio-ecological framework

1052
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,920
and this is a response this is just a

1053
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,480
short paper it's a response to somebody

1054
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,160
who

1055
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,960
replied to the no it isn't actually

1056
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,079
nope

1057
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,599
i'm mixing up with another one there it

1058
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,319
is that's the title anyway

1059
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,400
so i'm

1060
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,160
wondering if um

1061
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,440
that may be that

1062
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,680
each each way of um

1063
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,280
uh

1064
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,280
making things

1065
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,319
has got its own

1066
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,520
entropy dynamics

1067
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,599
and the in this entropy and dynamics

1068
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,760
that there's

1069
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,640
physical disorder is reduced

1070
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,440
information uncertainty is reduced

1071
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,119
but maybe that then pushes

1072
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,640
the entropy

1073
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,400
out

1074
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,560
elsewhere

1075
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,359
and then just doing more

1076
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,000
of the same thing it's just not possible

1077
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,520
there's a limit to it

1078
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,160
and with world um systems theory

1079
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,359
uh

1080
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,359
this is the breaking gist of it that

1081
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,040
there are these core countries and there

1082
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,119
are peripheral countries that serve them

1083
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,480
and

1084
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,200
maybe the if there's one

1085
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,680
way of doing things

1086
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,520
you can't address

1087
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,319
the entropy that's caused by that

1088
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,359
by trying to do more of the same

1089
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,599
or trying to tweak

1090
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,440
that way of doing things

1091
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,160
and maybe something

1092
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,359
quite different has to be done

1093
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,359
and maybe there's something about

1094
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:05,040
something to be learned from

1095
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,240
landscape restoration ecology

1096
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,319
in this about that

1097
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:14,319
about um habitat fragmentation

1098
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,200
that that

1099
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,760
okay so here are these habitats and

1100
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,760
they've grown and

1101
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,760
they're thriving but these ones over

1102
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,359
here they fragmented they split and this

1103
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:30,800
there's nothing from them but dispersal

1104
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,760
so as people are dispersing from

1105
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,680
um

1106
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,000
parts of the world that are

1107
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,359
suffering from premature

1108
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,160
deindustrialization

1109
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,000
that

1110
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,400
maybe there's something in

1111
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,800
entry by dynamics that

1112
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,400
could be that well

1113
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,400
that this

1114
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,119
doing this type of industrial production

1115
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,839
this it drives out the entropy but it's

1116
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:01,760
shipping it out it's going

1117
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,520
out elsewhere

1118
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,560
and the entropy that is then um

1119
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,640
in other places it can't be dealt with

1120
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,119
other than by some in

1121
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,800
another way

1122
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,599
of existing

1123
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:22,160
does that sound in any way sensible

1124
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,240
a very

1125
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,079
interesting area

1126
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,200
multiple

1127
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,560
levels of nested modeling and

1128
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,040
uncertainty and how informational and

1129
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,119
thermodynamic

1130
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,720
uh

1131
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,760
aspects

1132
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,480
transmute into one another and arbitrage

1133
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,359
with one another or

1134
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,680
relate to each other so it's really

1135
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,160
interesting area

1136
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,359
and

1137
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:48,240
uh

1138
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,400
one kind of thought on that and again to

1139
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,960
the fast food and things that might be

1140
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,440
unhealthy for us or policies that might

1141
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,680
be unhealthy in the long term for an

1142
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,599
organization

1143
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,760
it it made me think about

1144
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,920
being on a road trip

1145
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,000
and knowing that there was going to be

1146
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,920
not just the hyper stimulating

1147
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,119
experience

1148
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,839
which has been argued in many other

1149
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,680
frameworks like in reward based

1150
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,040
frameworks which is what you know

1151
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,760
dopamine the reward molecule

1152
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,319
reinforcement learning reward learning

1153
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,200
they'll

1154
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,280
already have a framing for how those

1155
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,440
products hyper stimulating lead to

1156
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,079
failure modes of complex societies via

1157
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,560
hyperstimulation okay so that is sort of

1158
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,280
a

1159
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,599
common stance

1160
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,440
with active inference we can also kind

1161
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,000
of highlight the fact that those

1162
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,800
products have lower variability

1163
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,720
and that there's actually very bland

1164
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,160
foods

1165
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,200
that for reason of blandness that people

1166
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,280
or like a tv show or something that for

1167
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,680
reasons of narrative or

1168
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,359
aesthetic

1169
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:56,319
just um similarity people will re-watch

1170
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,040
i mean even to videos that of types of

1171
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,480
people didn't expect

1172
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,319
why do people watch the log burning or

1173
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,240
the goop playing

1174
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,720
because they're sort of like the um

1175
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,040
frontier of optimal foraging is about

1176
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,040
like how it's going to sound which is a

1177
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,520
very small thing to be resolving

1178
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,000
relative to the more um

1179
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,040
deeper unsettling levels of information

1180
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,480
that could be revealed like someone

1181
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,440
else's

1182
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,880
perspective of you or something like

1183
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,559
that so it's just interesting how we can

1184
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,240
actually

1185
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,319
as you point out like the supply chains

1186
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,240
are modeled on one hand

1187
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,720
by these cyber physical

1188
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,400
digital twin

1189
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,280
um

1190
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,400
frameworks that

1191
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,480
need a unifying

1192
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,960
approach and so on one hand active

1193
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,520
inference does provide that but then

1194
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,960
looking at the other side of the

1195
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,200
equation so what you didn't discuss in

1196
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,160
our paper for these weeks but where you

1197
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,920
left off when you start introducing the

1198
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,200
biological

1199
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,680
and the survival imperatives

1200
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,839
then we can also have some new ways of

1201
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,280
thinking about how those industrial

1202
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,480
products

1203
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,640
through precision hacking rather than

1204
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,119
reward hacking end up leading to

1205
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,839
maladaptive behavior with or without

1206
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,520
reward incentivization

1207
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,359
are you um what are you seeing on are

1208
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,839
you seeing my screen now a different yep

1209
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,559
very different diagrams

1210
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,960
you see birds yeah generalist bird gap

1211
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,319
specialist butterfly

1212
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,760
interior habitat but especially

1213
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,880
speedless so this is another paper

1214
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,040
um i'll again i'll scroll up to the top

1215
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,559
you see this tile

1216
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,960
um and it's making this point that uh

1217
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,960
landscape composition and configuration

1218
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,400
go to different species perceptions

1219
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,240
and so the first one's a human and then

1220
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,440
it's

1221
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,280
different species

1222
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,760
and as it's neatly illustrated there

1223
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,480
that the same the same place looks

1224
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,640
different

1225
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,839
to different species and

1226
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,160
so what i'm

1227
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,599
and

1228
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,680
the the kind of

1229
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,000
the terminology here is that there are

1230
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,079
patches

1231
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,640
habitat patches and they can be

1232
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,559
corridors between them

1233
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:22,160
or stepping stones between them

1234
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,319
and the stuff the other stuff

1235
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:29,599
is called matrix

1236
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,599
and i personally can't

1237
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,000
ever see that word or say it without

1238
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,400
thinking about the movie so

1239
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,119
that is a bit of a problem but uh but in

1240
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:40,880
the landscape ecology is called the

1241
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,800
matrix so

1242
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,240
this i think this could be useful

1243
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,720
of illustrating that well

1244
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,319
okay that so

1245
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,760
here's the road to the mine these uh

1246
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,839
front country come

1247
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,440
companies built the road to the mine

1248
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,119
they built the mine and they're taking

1249
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:00,480
the

1250
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,880
stuff out and they're taking it back to

1251
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,470
their country to

1252
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:05,760
[Music]

1253
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,520
do highly efficient manufacturing with

1254
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,760
it and then they send their completed

1255
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,440
goods back and

1256
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,079
but then what's left

1257
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,400
um

1258
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,920
so if you just measure that in terms of

1259
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,040
gdp growth then the gdp goes up divided

1260
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,640
by the number of people and it appears

1261
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,000
that prosperity is

1262
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,680
rising but

1263
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,559
if

1264
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,720
if you look at it in this kind of view

1265
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,680
it shows that well there's a lot of

1266
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,440
blank spaces left to be left here

1267
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,680
and uh

1268
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,200
if we think about it in terms of this uh

1269
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,040
restoration or regeneration

1270
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,480
it

1271
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,640
it

1272
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,359
it's looking at it all of these because

1273
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,040
of course the the perspective of the

1274
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,640
human the generalist bird the gap

1275
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,400
specialist butterfly and

1276
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,680
the beetle they're all equally valid

1277
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,399
and um

1278
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,200
so

1279
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,040
you know what this paper's called

1280
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,960
landscape ecology and restoration

1281
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,680
processes

1282
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,079
and even within the same physical

1283
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,440
overlap

1284
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,640
one bug might be underground or in the

1285
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,599
roots or on the ground in the canopy so

1286
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,079
even the physical micro niche

1287
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,160
that different strategies or individuals

1288
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,079
experience in the same

1289
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:35,119
spot in the matrix can be very different

1290
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:36,559
so there's just such

1291
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,920
richness to this ecological thinking

1292
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,440
and

1293
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,960
it's just

1294
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,280
challenging to bring it into play in

1295
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,359
some of our cognitive endeavors but i

1296
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:51,558
think that is also changing rapidly

1297
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,670
so i've taken um

1298
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:58,400
[Music]

1299
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,520
an ecological perspective

1300
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,520
in

1301
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,680
we're doing one paper on meme ecosystems

1302
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,400
and rhetoric ecosystems

1303
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,000
by the end of this year

1304
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,319
but it's not active

1305
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:25,839
direct

1306
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:28,000
but

1307
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:30,839
maybe it'll have some

1308
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:34,079
relationships it could well do um

1309
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,559
are you now seeing a table to number one

1310
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:40,240
all right so what i've done here is i've

1311
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,400
done this from a uh ecological

1312
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,200
perspective and

1313
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,520
well you can see these terms but one

1314
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,119
thing in uh

1315
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,079
a

1316
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,480
restoration ecosystem restoration is

1317
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,000
mobile linking organisms

1318
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,879
but

1319
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,000
that like birds and animals that can

1320
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,160
travel quite a long way they can go so

1321
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,480
after this is a forest fire

1322
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,359
then

1323
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:09,760
animals that can travel quite a long way

1324
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,160
particularly birds they can come they

1325
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:16,160
can fly and drop seeds and and things

1326
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,760
like that so this is an established

1327
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,880
concept mobile linking organisms and i'm

1328
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,720
pointing out that this is something that

1329
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,119
we've done in mobile factories

1330
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,760
and then energetics another key issue is

1331
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,200
that if there's no

1332
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,839
if all the energy if all the matter and

1333
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,400
energy are flowing

1334
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,920
out

1335
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,160
then life

1336
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,480
isn't sustainable

1337
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,599
and uh of course there we are so i've

1338
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,559
i've done that

1339
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,760
relating to my uh

1340
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,240
favorite subject movable production

1341
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,240
technologies

1342
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:01,300
okay

1343
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,379
[Music]

1344
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,720
so

1345
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,839
um

1346
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:09,280
so that takes i think this is

1347
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,240
decentralized systems isn't it that

1348
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:12,880
uh

1349
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,480
the second point

1350
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,800
that was it that was the lead in the

1351
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,319
segway okay nice

1352
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,440
how about oh go for it um stephen

1353
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,319
yeah so i think this is the

1354
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,400
if everything's so at the moment there's

1355
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,839
this uh

1356
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:37,359
centralization oh let's have a look at

1357
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,480
this i've got um

1358
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,720
i go again so

1359
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,759
let's have a look here

1360
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,160
are you

1361
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,680
what do you see now do you see a

1362
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,119
taxonomy

1363
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:52,799
uh taxonomy and manufacturing

1364
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,720
distributions and their comparative

1365
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,359
relations to sustainability

1366
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:10,559
all right so

1367
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,240
here they are

1368
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,359
so

1369
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:16,240
there are distributed distributions

1370
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,040
and centralized

1371
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,480
um

1372
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,720
and as we see there's plenty of

1373
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,960
distributed options

1374
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,079
and uh then i compare them in

1375
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,799
terms of economic ecological social and

1376
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:34,599
institutional sustainability

1377
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,960
and where i think

1378
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,799
active inference i've just

1379
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:41,680
started to

1380
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,160
look into this

1381
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:52,720
that this agent environment systems

1382
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,119
and uh

1383
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,440
at framing is

1384
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,319
the the agent has a generative model

1385
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:04,079
but the world is a generative process

1386
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:05,680
the sensory inputs are coming from the

1387
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,640
generative process to the world

1388
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,240
and um

1389
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,040
i

1390
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:15,119
think that this enables um

1391
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,839
active inference to be

1392
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:20,720
linked to

1393
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,200
uh

1394
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,839
ecosystem dynamics

1395
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:26,240
and

1396
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,000
[Music]

1397
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,599
that

1398
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:32,160
that what we've been well what i've been

1399
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,440
saying before about this centralized

1400
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,079
distribution it um

1401
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:40,720
it's super

1402
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,640
efficient

1403
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,280
and it's getting uh engineering out

1404
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,440
physical disorder and information

1405
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,440
uncertainty but

1406
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,680
then

1407
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,760
maybe that entropy is going somewhere

1408
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,000
else and uh

1409
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
maybe

1410
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,240
new information is needed to activate

1411
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,520
the more distributed

1412
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,640
options

1413
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:16,319
so do you think do you think that um

1414
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,680
that

1415
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,559
if

1416
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:23,680
if the only if only a certain um

1417
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,760
so if

1418
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,319
if there's a predominant paradigm which

1419
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,920
in this case there is industrial

1420
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,839
manufacturing

1421
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:36,400
based on the 300 years old paradigm

1422
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,680
um

1423
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,839
that

1424
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:43,280
the information about how to make things

1425
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,359
is all about that and how to improve

1426
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:47,359
that

1427
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:49,200
and

1428
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,520
then

1429
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,880
then does it become a zero-sum game

1430
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,920
that

1431
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,599
if if

1432
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,640
so if it is shipping out um

1433
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,240
entropy like a heat pump

1434
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,200
out to the peripheral nations do you

1435
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,280
think it's a zero-sum game if there is

1436
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,680
an alternative information

1437
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,920
so if nobody knows

1438
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,540
or there hasn't yet been

1439
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:16,640
[Music]

1440
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,640
uh conceived

1441
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,520
an alternative

1442
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,960
then then is it like a closed system

1443
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,520
so in a closed system

1444
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,760
the entropy

1445
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,640
has

1446
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,000
it's

1447
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,359
if it's pushed out of one place

1448
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:38,079
it goes to the other places

1449
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:41,920
so is it is a cl is it a closed system

1450
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,559
is it a closed system

1451
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:47,200
if all the information

1452
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,839
is about one

1453
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:53,760
paradigm so is this like uh for example

1454
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:58,480
does am i in any way coherent here

1455
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,440
it's an extremely important

1456
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,640
question

1457
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,440
and um you know

1458
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,440
socio-technical systems political

1459
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,240
systems tokenomics that last forever

1460
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,319
are these the the perpetual motion

1461
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:13,520
machines

1462
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,280
of the 2020s

1463
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,640
and just a new

1464
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,680
level

1465
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:21,200
of uh computational

00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,440
uh detail and flourish

1467
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,040
but the same kinds of

1468
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:30,240
fallacies and then

1469
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,799
whatever the thermodynamics of the earth

1470
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:34,559
are

1471
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:38,079
our niche is finite and we've now made

1472
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:39,440
some potentially

1473
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:39,770
um

1474
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:41,119
[Music]

1475
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,119
whether or not the sum is zero or even

1476
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:44,400
negative

1477
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,119
or could be positive but is negative

1478
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:48,480
there may be

1479
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,640
informational and strategic

1480
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,040
games that um

1481
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,680
don't resolve like heat baths

1482
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,400
so

1483
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,880
they can't be understood

1484
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,280
with some of the

1485
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,359
at least most

1486
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:04,559
tangible

1487
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:05,760
physical

1488
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,440
metaphors that thankfully guide

the evolution of

1490
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:13,040
theories that our first principle like

1491
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,760
fep like carl

1492
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,680
fristen with the wood lice

1493
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,079
seeing the trajectory of a real thing

1494
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,119
and that's based upon health and um

1495
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,720
longevity

1496
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,720
blue

1497
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,319
yeah i had a question about the table

1498
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:35,119
that you pulled up earlier um

1499
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:38,240
specifically about ecosystem engineering

1500
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,280
and so i'm not sure if it's just like a

1501
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,200
term that i'm not familiar with or like

1502
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,799
in in terms of engineering i'm kind of

1503
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:45,760
naive

1504
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,480
so

1505
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,240
when you're thinking about ecosystem

1506
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,599
engineering um i i i equate that to

1507
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:54,480
niche modification or like designing a

1508
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,200
system like even you know you could

1509
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,280
design like a world system

1510
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,319
so

1511
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:02,160
here it says it does not require

1512
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,079
overriding the natural evolutionary

1513
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:06,400
balance of equal equal ecological

1514
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,480
fitness but like i think about like the

1515
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,440
human paradigm blue could i just could

1516
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,799
it just

1517
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:14,400
happen

1518
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,920
but that's movable production

1519
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,440
technologies

1520
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,359
so what i'm

1521
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:21,040
saying there is that

1522
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,960
if you've got

1523
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,440
a movable factory so a truck if you've

1524
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,359
got a secondhand truck

1525
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:29,839
with a secondhand container on the back

1526
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:30,799
of it

1527
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:32,799
it does not require overriding the

1528
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:36,400
natural evolutionary balance

1529
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:37,760
so

1530
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,960
it's it's specifically in relation to if

1531
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,480
you look at the top it says movable

1532
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,520
production technologies

1533
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,640
so so how is that ecosystem engineering

1534
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,640
though like i mean no no it isn't yet

1535
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,280
but the point uh obviously this table is

1536
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,960
not clear

1537
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,119
and it is my responsibility it's not

1538
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,720
clear

1539
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,280
i am responsible for this but

1540
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,400
so the the

1541
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,559
what this meant by this is because

1542
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,400
further up in the paper

1543
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,240
it's pointing out that if you have fixed

1544
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,240
production technologies

1545
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:15,119
so if you've got a big fixed factory

1546
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:17,680
you build a load of roads huge roads

1547
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,160
going to it and so on that involves a

1548
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,359
great deal of ecosystem engineering

1549
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:25,039
but

1550
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:27,839
a mob a mobile factory it can just go

1551
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,880
over rough terrain

1552
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:34,559
also to uh play devil's advocate against

1553
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:35,760
the author

1554
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,319
the enabling function

1555
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:39,119
of

1556
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,319
a uh realization of something something

1557
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:44,559
physical that can be an ecosystem

1558
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,880
engineering agent ak niche modifying

1559
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,160
agent um that it's gonna have to be a

1560
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,760
niche modifying agent so this is just

1561
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:52,960
sort of

1562
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,039
then connecting that to mobile organisms

1563
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:57,200
so you have quote plants

1564
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,680
aka factories that are planted

1565
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,680
and then those can be like

1566
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,640
they're not like trees simply but

1567
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,760
they're planted and so they have

1568
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:06,960
strategies

1569
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,720
not dissimilar from other rooted

1570
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,160
organisms

1571
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,319
but then you have mobile

1572
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:14,079
organ linking organisms so it sort of

1573
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:15,200
connects

1574
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,039
that all the things that mobile

1575
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:18,319
organisms

1576
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:21,520
like all animals do

1577
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:25,039
and can do with what a factory could do

1578
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:27,520
ecologically

1579
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,599
blue

1580
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,599
so it just kind of makes me think about

1581
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:34,799
like what kind of biological organisms

1582
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:37,119
take their niche with them

1583
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:40,400
like maybe a snail or a turtle like you

1584
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,559
know to take take a large component of

1585
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:45,119
like their habitat essentially

1586
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:46,799
with them wherever they go the mobile

1587
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:50,000
technology made me think of that

1588
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,680
yep some people like to travel with uh

1589
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,599
light

1590
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:57,440
you know just the keys or something

1591
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,839
other people full backpack

1592
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:02,240
every time

1593
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,720
stephen

1594
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,440
i like this idea of something coming out

1595
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,520
of the factory going into the space and

1596
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,599
then things being secondhand

1597
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:13,920
a third fourth fifth hand

1598
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,960
because there is something there

1599
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,880
that is delivered is this

1600
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,400
i mean if you're going to use entropy i

1601
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,000
suppose you could say

1602
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,920
low entropy

1603
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,160
kind of nuke new vehicle you know

1604
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,319
whatever it is and slowly it gets

1605
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:30,319
incorporated into the ecosystem it

1606
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:32,000
starts to get scratches it starts to get

1607
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,400
this and you see in india you know

1608
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,240
people start decorating the vehicle you

1609
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,200
know the

1610
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,680
all this sort of stuff will happen over

1611
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:40,480
time

1612
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,240
as

1613
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,079
it becomes

1614
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:46,240
somehow incorporated into the niche i

1615
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,000
suppose you could argue

1616
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,640
so i think it's quite quite interesting

1617
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,000
um

1618
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,440
how that maybe starts to

1619
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,799
change the dynamic i i'm still not sure

1620
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:02,640
whether entropy is so useful

1621
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,760
um

1622
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,240
term or whether it's

1623
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,520
some other way of looking at a metric

1624
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,599
maybe something to do with

1625
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:13,599
free energy minimization

1626
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:17,200
as a as a thing but um

1627
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,680
better yeah

1628
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,119
one other piece of that table that was

1629
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:24,000
interesting was there was multiple goals

1630
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,400
like sustainability and fitness

1631
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,280
uh

1632
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,880
so

1633
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,520
it uh is not a

1634
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,559
univariate optimization we're not just

1635
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:38,240
doing reward or utility maximization

1636
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,319
we can choose multiple goals and we can

1637
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:42,319
have multiple human goals which is

1638
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:44,480
especially important for

1639
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,559
things that you know we care about but

1640
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:48,160
then this one of mutualism is

1641
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,920
interesting because a lot of times

1642
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,359
mutualism could be seen as like an

1643
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,760
outcome like the outcome of these two

1644
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,760
bacteria's relationship in the niche is

1645
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,640
a commensalism or mutualism or symbiosis

1646
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,440
whatever it happens to be but actually

1647
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,200
using this idea of the

1648
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,760
the outputs like the observation states

1649
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,400
of a higher level bayesian model

1650
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,480
being like the priors on a lower level

1651
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,760
nested model

1652
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:17,039
having a goal of mutualism

1653
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,359
is implicit in the lower level model

1654
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:21,440
enacting that mutualism

1655
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,200
because you're not accidentally going to

1656
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,039
metabolically coordinate through

1657
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:27,119
millions of generations

1658
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,039
and so this is kind of an interesting

1659
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:30,400
way where

1660
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,960
uh like we have to want to

1661
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,400
make it work

1662
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,400
because we're not going to accidentally

1663
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,079
make it work and get along

1664
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:44,319
but that can be a hyper prior

1665
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:46,799
like a belief about how things ought to

1666
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:49,440
be or how we want or prefer things to be

1667
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,799
and then we enact policy along those

1668
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:55,799
lines

1669
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:03,599
and by the way

1670
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,839
i do um

1671
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:07,200
um

1672
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,119
other

1673
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:12,000
uh notes

1674
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,440
it's a by the way in um in another paper

1675
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,599
i do point out there are limitations to

1676
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:20,559
movable factories so

1677
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:23,520
i'm not uh

1678
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:28,039
saying that this is a panacea

1679
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:32,160
but it's sort of like

1680
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,880
like let's just say um cactus versus

1681
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,960
like a desert animal

1682
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,480
you know the desert animal they have

1683
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,559
different ways of getting water and so

1684
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:42,799
but when we can design the system we can

1685
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:43,920
do

1686
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,119
trade-offs

1687
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:46,640
like you could have something that's

1688
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:49,280
stationary but then isn't just holding

1689
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,720
all of its own money because its money

1690
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:53,440
can be like on a digital system

1691
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,119
so it can have some of the advantages of

1692
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:57,119
a stationary organism from an ecological

1693
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:58,480
perspective

1694
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,079
like a tree

1695
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:01,200
but then

1696
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:04,240
like the value of the tree

1697
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,400
um could be

1698
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,480
protected in some other way because we

1699
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,400
have some other affordance

1700
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,839
and or

1701
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:14,319
that forest could be de-risked at a

1702
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:16,319
higher level because it's like oh each

1703
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,238
one of these is we expect to fail this

1704
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:19,759
many percent of the time or we have

1705
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:24,279
these quality control checks on it

1706
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:32,319
yeah i think

1707
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,000
a lot of thought is required about about

1708
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,839
these things isn't it it's

1709
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:42,560
i don't think there's one big answer but

1710
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,238
um

1711
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:46,560
but at least i think one good thing

1712
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,799
about

1713
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:50,960
the energy principle active imprints

1714
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,600
that it ties

1715
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,960
into action and that ties into

1716
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,279
energy

1717
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:01,520
so

1718
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:04,560
this is good

1719
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,920
yep when you're doing the thought

1720
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,120
experiment

1721
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:11,759
pure uh gedenkin then it's like

1722
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:13,359
can be elucidating you know imagine

1723
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:14,880
you're going towards the speed of light

1724
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:17,359
or imagine you have a a

1725
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:20,319
physical mass of this size

1726
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:22,319
but then there's no constraint which is

1727
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:24,479
again double-edged sword on some of

1728
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:25,679
these

1729
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:28,399
attributes that require action

1730
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:28,899
and um

1731
01:09:28,899 --> 01:09:30,238
[Music]

1732
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:32,158
so that's that's an interesting idea

1733
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:35,279
that it ties us to

1734
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:38,319
active states which is pragmatic and

1735
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:40,399
useful but also

1736
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:42,319
interesting and then also one thing on

1737
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,399
the affective system and then blue you

1738
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:46,238
can ask anything was just

1739
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:48,399
we've talked also about higher order

1740
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:50,479
variables in organisms being kind of

1741
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:52,238
like affective states

1742
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:54,400
whether they were the valence like

1743
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,239
positive or negative or the anxiety or

1744
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:02,560
the relative beliefs of an organism um

1745
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,840
so just

1746
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,920
how do we design for when there's higher

1747
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,360
order

1748
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,480
states

1749
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,480
maybe even ones that could be considered

1750
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,320
affective either for

1751
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:15,199
people or for organisms or i mean

1752
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:17,120
organizations that have this kind of

1753
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:21,360
organismal structure but blue

1754
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,360
so interestingly like this is going to

1755
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,040
touch on what you just said but also

1756
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,719
going back to what you said about

1757
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:30,000
mutualism and the goal like has to be

1758
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,360
mutualism

1759
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:34,560
so so i don't know um i really have to

1760
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,679
uh contact the author of the um

1761
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:41,360
2020 paper uh sims is his name

1762
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,000
how to count biological minds symbiosis

1763
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,480
the fep and reciprocal multi-scale

1764
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,679
integration

1765
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:50,239
which i found um very fascinating but i

1766
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:51,280
would love to invite them on for a

1767
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,440
stream someday uh

1768
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,199
the the whole point of that is that

1769
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:57,120
there's like nested

1770
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,600
cognition happening at the biological

1771
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,520
scale and specifically that paper looked

1772
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,000
at the squid and the vibrio fisheries

1773
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
that like light up the squid in the in

1774
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,520
the light organ

1775
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,280
and um

1776
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,320
you know

1777
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:13,120
in that kind of context as in an

1778
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,960
industrial organization there's like

1779
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,159
this nested cognition happening

1780
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:20,320
um and where

1781
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,760
the point of that was the goal wasn't

1782
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,040
necessarily

1783
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:26,640
um mutualism or in that case symbiosis

1784
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,560
that that's not necessarily the goal but

1785
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,280
but

1786
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,360
a bigger grander

1787
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,120
organism was constructed out of the

1788
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,560
union between

1789
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,600
these two organisms and so

1790
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,920
perhaps in an industrial scale that's

1791
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,440
also something that happens right i mean

1792
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:42,560
there's different

1793
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,400
parts to the organization that'll keep

1794
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,080
it running and you factor in all the

1795
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,159
supply chain things and and so there's

1796
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:50,239
this nested hierarchical thing that

1797
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,400
happens and something bigger

1798
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,719
that has its own kind of cognition

1799
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:57,280
occurs as a result of this like mutual

1800
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,559
uh beneficial relationship

1801
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,800
we see the paper

1802
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,560
the paper we see the paper that stephen

1803
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,400
just put up

1804
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,199
yeah there's some

1805
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:14,600
these

1806
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:15,920
[Music]

1807
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,920
i thought it said in here so i thought

1808
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,600
it said in here somewhere about

1809
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:22,960
yeah these different types of

1810
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,400
relationships so

1811
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,840
mutualism is beneficial beneficial

1812
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:28,719
um

1813
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:29,480
and

1814
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,280
parasitism is

1815
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:35,440
beneficial harmful but in between those

1816
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:39,120
there's beneficial and neutral

1817
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,400
and

1818
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,760
there are several

1819
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,000
in between mutual and para

1820
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,080
parasitism there are

1821
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,480
several

1822
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,800
other states and i just remember that

1823
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,800
the one of them is beneficial and

1824
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,280
neutral

1825
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,280
if i could give a kind of random thought

1826
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,840
on that and why the informational sphere

1827
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,199
might have a different

1828
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:03,360
entropy dynamic than the physical

1829
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:04,400
like

1830
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,600
the electromagnetic spectrum

1831
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,280
that can have a lot of positive and

1832
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:12,000
neutral relationships like if someone's

1833
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,440
operating on two different wavelengths

1834
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,440
and one is only on one wavelength then

1835
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,120
they can be like of mutual service to

1836
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,440
each other or one could just be totally

1837
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,440
non-interacting

1838
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,760
because they can be overlapping

1839
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,000
in space and time

1840
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
at once and one person might not even

1841
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,520
have to be aware of it

1842
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,480
whereas in the tangible

1843
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,600
um

1844
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,520
i guess most embodied one can be

1845
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:41,199
you know only one thing per spot

1846
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:44,320
that's zero sum there just can't be two

1847
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,640
two atoms in the same spot

1848
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:47,520
or

1849
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,520
maybe you know two

1850
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:50,800
laws

1851
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,000
playing out

1852
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,239
in one territory

1853
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:56,080
but informationally there's probably a

1854
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,159
lot more multi-channeling

1855
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:02,159
and that might give enough room

1856
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:05,280
for practical success if not ultimate

1857
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:08,080
theoretical answerings

1858
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,600
stephen slit

1859
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,920
and then blue

1860
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,159
this brings up a lot of issues it's very

1861
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:18,800
fascinating um

1862
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,760
i'm i'm curious um

1863
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,480
so coming back to this idea and i i mean

1864
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,880
daniel mentioned hyper priors i things

1865
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:30,480
that we kind of have fixed um

1866
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,080
i actually looked that up actually to

1867
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,840
make sure i understood it but

1868
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,239
things that we have is very distinctive

1869
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:38,800
and i'm again trying to compare these

1870
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:39,760
um

1871
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,080
these types of um

1872
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,719
environments when one where you've got

1873
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:46,640
an agent wanting

1874
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,159
or being able to just

1875
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:51,040
calibrate in amongst the noise and ones

1876
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,800
where you want to just keep it as clean

1877
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,159
as possible

1878
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:55,679
you know so

1879
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:58,159
and and the challenge is sometimes when

1880
01:14:58,159 --> 01:14:59,360
you have a

1881
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,520
quality management system in those

1882
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,199
places so for instance i suppose one

1883
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,239
thing that comes to mind is the

1884
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:06,320
experiment with a rat that they used to

1885
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,760
have and they've had for years about

1886
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:10,880
having cocaine or addictive substances

1887
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:11,920
and how

1888
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,520
they would they only needed to have a

1889
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,640
couple of times and they would be

1890
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,719
addicted and it was seen as this kind of

1891
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:18,640
proof of principle about addiction and

1892
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,360
how it works and then the more recent

1893
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,719
work where they instead of putting them

1894
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:24,560
in a bare box

1895
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,800
and just having the cocaine or whatever

1896
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,159
they were being

1897
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:30,000
um sort of

1898
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,760
exposed to they were in a more

1899
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,440
ecological

1900
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,320
um

1901
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,080
boxed you know where there was things to

1902
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,280
do and they suddenly found that the

1903
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,560
behavior of the animal was very

1904
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,880
different they wouldn't necessarily

1905
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,199
become addicted in the same way

1906
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:44,880
because they would actually because they

1907
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,719
were in a better ecology

1908
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:48,480
now in theory the entropy's gone up

1909
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,560
there if you're looking entropically

1910
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,560
but for the animal they've been able to

1911
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:55,760
engage and and dynamically process that

1912
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,920
that's very different to

1913
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,920
how you would try and

1914
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,400
create you know a medical

1915
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,800
production line right you you want to

1916
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,159
keep it clean you want to keep it

1917
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:07,679
sterile

1918
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:09,679
um you want to have those sorts of

1919
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:10,640
things

1920
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,760
so i'm just curious about that that and

1921
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,400
then the danger maybe in the biological

1922
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,040
system of this hyper prior say the

1923
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,320
some sort of kick or something that

1924
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,080
comes from food

1925
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,560
not having any other compliments around

1926
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,320
like like as daniel you know so there

1927
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:27,520
isn't other things so that just

1928
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,520
naturally kicks in like the reward goal

1929
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,560
which may be always there as a default

1930
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,760
if there's not other things to

1931
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,159
complement it it just it starts running

1932
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:38,960
the show and that could be part of

1933
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,960
how we get into these maladjusted

1934
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,199
behaviors that you were talking about

1935
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:45,840
i wonder what your thoughts are on that

1936
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,280
just quick point of clarification that's

1937
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,199
not what a hyper priority is that's not

1938
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:52,159
a hyper-stimulating stimuli a hyperprior

1939
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:54,400
is a is a prior over another prior in a

1940
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,679
bayesian

1941
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:57,679
multi-level framework so it doesn't have

1942
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,080
to be accentuating or differentiating or

1943
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,400
extreme or maladaptive it's a general

1944
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,480
framework for the relationship between

1945
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:05,760
variables

1946
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,760
yeah well i was thinking it was more the

1947
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,480
hyper prior could give a it's a it's a

1948
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,080
fairly fixed priority and it's one which

1949
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,640
is a go-to solid prior and it's useful

1950
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,560
for being that does just saying having

1951
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,880
that present hyper fire could be fixed

1952
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,320
or learned

1953
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,000
or learned

1954
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
okay okay

1955
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,679
but it tends to be hyper prior means

1956
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:27,679
it's quite accurate isn't it it's quite

1957
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:30,320
it's not fuzzy hyper is i think a

1958
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:33,360
spatial designation like supra

1959
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,880
not

1960
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,600
not in the extreme case hyper is only

1961
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,560
referring to the fact that it's a a

1962
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,280
parameter about

1963
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,199
another parameter

1964
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:47,679
so it doesn't tend to be hot or cold or

1965
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:49,840
anything it's just the general phrasing

1966
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:53,040
okay got you yeah

1967
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:55,920
so but stephen fox if you want to add

1968
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,600
anything

1969
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:58,560
otherwise

1970
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,880
blue

1971
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,719
okay we see the head

1972
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:08,080
yeah so

1973
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:10,159
in

1974
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:15,199
now the effective system

1975
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:16,400
so

1976
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,799
here

1977
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:23,120
here's my diagram

1978
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,800
so in

1979
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,719
in this um

1980
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:32,400
saying that uh

1981
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:34,880
it's a little bit so small i can't see

1982
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,320
it myself

1983
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,159
um

1984
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:41,360
but if there's the same

1985
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:44,320
starting point

1986
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,760
but um

1987
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,800
of a generative model so if the human

1988
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:49,679
being

1989
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:52,880
in human robot

1990
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:57,040
interaction knows that um

1991
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:59,920
okay so i i'm i'm in the predictor i'm

1992
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:04,000
human i'm in the predictive processing

1993
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:08,880
business that's what i'm doing and um

1994
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:09,840
and

1995
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:13,280
um so i've got prior beliefs

1996
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:16,000
and i have got

1997
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,480
generative models

1998
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:19,440
then

1999
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:19,740
the

2000
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:20,880
[Music]

2001
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:23,120
robot

2002
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,800
can be

2003
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,880
um what does that say

2004
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:31,440
personas and scenarios for robot based

2005
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:34,560
on the humans uh

2006
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,719
well that's world view but generative

2007
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:37,520
model

2008
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,199
and human readable model of the robot

2009
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:42,560
mind that corresponds to that

2010
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:43,600
so

2011
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,320
that's um

2012
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:51,239
and this is in

2013
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:54,159
aligning human psychomotor

2014
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:57,199
characteristics with robot an augmented

2015
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:59,760
reality

2016
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:03,080
in this

2017
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:12,880
so

2018
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,120
there's a bit of a model there

2019
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,840
that's also very related to the felix

2020
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,280
shoulders paper

2021
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,280
trust us extended control active

2022
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,120
inference and user feedback during human

2023
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:26,159
robot collaboration

2024
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,239
ooh

2025
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:30,159
i'll put it in the youtube channel

2026
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:33,280
i'll put in youtube chat

2027
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,800
but brilliant go for this one

2028
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,679
so that's um

2029
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,239
it's all in the past experiences

2030
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:46,880
physiology so this is body memory in

2031
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,679
there personality gender culture emotion

2032
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:51,840
reasoning in biocybernetics

2033
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:57,639
so this paper i'm relating that to what

2034
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:02,880
how this can affect interact with robots

2035
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:07,520
exoskeletons and augmented reality

2036
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:11,959
there it is

2037
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:18,480
we got here a few equations

2038
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,960
there it is but

2039
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,400
here the two

2040
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,760
i point out in this that um

2041
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,159
you find

2042
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:40,159
yeah so

2043
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:42,320
in previous production literature the

2044
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:46,159
uncertainty of human behavior

2045
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,639
this is this is true

2046
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:50,480
so in previous production literature the

2047
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,120
uncertainty of human behavior has been

2048
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,360
recognized as a source of productivity

2049
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,679
quality and safety problems

2050
01:21:57,679 --> 01:21:59,679
however fundamental reasons for the

2051
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:01,760
uncertainty of human

2052
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,920
behavior have been framed

2053
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,679
previously

2054
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:08,080
as a black box

2055
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,080
so what i was trying to do there was

2056
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,480
relate it to

2057
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:15,199
to open up the black box

2058
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:15,460
and

2059
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:17,360
[Music]

2060
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,679
frame it as an open box

2061
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:20,560
and then

2062
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,239
fundamental reasons can be aligned with

2063
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:24,159
production technology to facilitate

2064
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:25,920
improved production

2065
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,560
performance

2066
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:32,800
so that's as far as i've got with that

2067
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:35,679
it's almost like for the

2068
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:37,760
reward utility driven person you can say

2069
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:38,880
there's going to be an increased

2070
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,719
expectation of performance

2071
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:43,120
for the uncertainty minded you can say

2072
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,760
there'll be a reduced variance

2073
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,600
for the resilience minded

2074
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:50,159
or for the reconfiguration minded that

2075
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:52,400
there'd be an increased capacity

2076
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,639
to rapidly reorganize

2077
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:56,480
so i think that

2078
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,239
we'll have all or none

2079
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:00,480
blue

2080
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,159
so my thoughts kind of dated at this

2081
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:07,280
point but just going back to um

2082
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:10,400
touching back on to mutualism and

2083
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,320
um you know these these the

2084
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,159
electromagnetic spectrum when you're

2085
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:15,600
talking about how like you know the

2086
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,679
signal can amplify

2087
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:18,480
um

2088
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,080
there's also like the possibility for

2089
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:22,560
the signal to cancel right if if the you

2090
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,320
know wavelengths are are the same and

2091
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:25,840
they're heading in opposite directions

2092
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,520
it they just directly cancel each other

2093
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,600
out and it kind of made me think of like

2094
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,239
cancel culture and also like the

2095
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:35,040
relationship between um

2096
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:38,080
you know the parasite is is also like a

2097
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:41,040
nested biological relationship um even

2098
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:43,520
though it's not necessarily beneficial

2099
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,679
but there's still this nested layer like

2100
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:47,600
the parasite is unable to function

2101
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,520
without the host of course

2102
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:50,960
but um

2103
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,520
the host embodying the parasite like is

2104
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,040
a completely different

2105
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,280
cognitive cognating creature and i think

2106
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:00,800
about like the zombie ants right that um

2107
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:01,760
i don't know if you guys have heard

2108
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,159
daniel can probably unpack the zombie a

2109
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:06,000
lot a lot better than i can but it's

2110
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,920
like a parasite that then drives the

2111
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:10,560
behavior of of the ant due to some like

2112
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:13,120
rewiring of the cognitive process

2113
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,600
so even in in the parasite instance

2114
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,159
there's still a greater cognizing

2115
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:20,638
structure

2116
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:25,360
and

2117
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,600
going back to neutralism again the

2118
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:33,040
the other terms are so commensalism

2119
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,480
is where

2120
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,960
one gains benefit

2121
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,440
while the others

2122
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,679
it hasn't there's a new neutral no

2123
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:43,679
benefit no harm

2124
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:46,320
and then there's a mentalism where one

2125
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:50,239
is harmed or the other is unaffected

2126
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,440
so they're in between so there's first

2127
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,800
mutualism

2128
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:58,400
benefit benefit then commensalism

2129
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:01,920
where there is uh benefit

2130
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,120
neutral

2131
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,880
and then there's a mentalism where

2132
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,719
there's um

2133
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:07,679
harm

2134
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:10,000
and neutral

2135
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,480
and then parasitism where there's one is

2136
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,840
harmed and the others benefits

2137
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,080
i i wonder if this has to do with the

2138
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:21,040
movement from maybe just its semantic

2139
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,600
but from sustainability to regenerative

2140
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,360
because sustainability it's like the

2141
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,560
sustain

2142
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,600
on the guitar sound of the bell like

2143
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,040
let's sustain

2144
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,280
let's have this car and sustain it or

2145
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,040
make it it

2146
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,560
can be meant to mean more than that but

2147
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:37,520
it's about

2148
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,440
sustaining something that exists

2149
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:41,280
versus regenerating

2150
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,719
uh

2151
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:44,159
means like we're gonna have to be doing

2152
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:45,520
more than just

2153
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,920
persisting or stabilizing it

2154
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:50,880
that it has to be also actively having

2155
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,400
this process

2156
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,239
of uh

2157
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:56,320
of regeneration which always involves

2158
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,080
like multiple parts like bucky fuller

2159
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:59,760
saying that unity is plural and at

2160
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:01,199
minimum two

2161
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:03,360
so then now thinking about how

2162
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,960
from polyculture of growing crops

2163
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,880
to monoculture

2164
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,960
the green revolution and everything

2165
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,040
and then now oh maybe there should be

2166
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,760
the fish in between the roots

2167
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,679
of the plants and then the birds and the

2168
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:19,520
mushrooms like this

2169
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:22,719
are these stable ecosystems that is what

2170
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:25,360
remains to be seen but some human

2171
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,280
modified

2172
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,679
niches like sourdough bread and things

2173
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:32,000
and beer have been really successful so

2174
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,840
maybe there's higher order combinations

2175
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,239
too that could be really successful and

2176
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:37,280
be

2177
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,360
very productive but

2178
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,800
um

2179
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,080
this is kind of a framework that helps

2180
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,239
us at least explore that so that's quite

2181
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:47,239
cool

2182
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:56,000
i was at um

2183
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,679
remotely of course it was there was a

2184
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:00,960
launch the south african um

2185
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:04,080
grassroots innovation programme they

2186
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,520
did um

2187
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:06,960
a launch

2188
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:09,760
yesterday with five

2189
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:10,719
uh

2190
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:12,960
lady innovators and one of them was

2191
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,679
doing um

2192
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:19,130
movable aquaponics

2193
01:27:19,130 --> 01:27:20,960
[Music]

2194
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:24,000
she seemed to have addressed

2195
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,639
it's quite a sophisticated system

2196
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:28,800
but it's all uh

2197
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:31,600
it's all set up in buckets that can be

2198
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:32,639
carried

2199
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:35,280
one person can carry the buckets that's

2200
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:36,800
the size they are

2201
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,560
and then you build up

2202
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:40,000
the

2203
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,920
the farm by different

2204
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:43,520
just having the

2205
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,520
number of the different the more buckets

2206
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:49,440
you get the bigger the aquaponic farm

2207
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,400
so that was interesting

2208
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:57,040
and then again with the physical zero

2209
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,679
sum and then the

2210
01:27:58,679 --> 01:28:01,040
electromagnetic or informational or

2211
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,600
financial non-zero sum

2212
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:04,639
um

2213
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:07,040
if the overlapping is just

2214
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,600
given the tools that already exist

2215
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,199
in the ecosystem that you find yourself

2216
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:14,000
in like your dropped on survivor island

2217
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,600
you still may be able to find some

2218
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,239
synergies most of them you won't know

2219
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:21,040
but they're over long time traditional

2220
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,199
ecological knowledge can learn about

2221
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:26,159
some medicinal combinations and

2222
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:28,159
oh these two should be combined for the

2223
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:29,120
boat

2224
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:32,000
and these kinds of things but

2225
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,199
design

2226
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:34,639
and this is related to what steven said

2227
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:36,080
about the

2228
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,159
product being plugged into

2229
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:39,920
another external niche and what you

2230
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,280
wrote about the cupboard being attached

2231
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:44,080
to the wall like we could design some

2232
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:46,480
pretty minimal pieces

2233
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:49,600
that might really scaffold

2234
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:50,960
you build a trellis and then something

2235
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,320
grows within it

2236
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:55,600
so the engineering might not be

2237
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,280
huge

2238
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,920
to connect a few pieces

2239
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,760
that have a

2240
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:06,520
latent capacity to work together

2241
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:13,760
they the word you use their scaffolding

2242
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,280
has that got any

2243
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,519
um

2244
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,480
of course i've heard it before but

2245
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:21,340
does that have any

2246
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:22,719
[Music]

2247
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:26,639
basis in nature to your knowledge

2248
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:30,560
i would certainly say so um from the

2249
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:33,840
spicule structures like in bones

2250
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:36,239
and the way that um physical structures

2251
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:38,639
are scaffolded to um

2252
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:41,040
embryogenesis and the developmental

2253
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,120
scaffold scaffolding of

2254
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,199
the uterus and

2255
01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:46,480
the

2256
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,560
core caretakers and

2257
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:50,880
different insects and humans

2258
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,880
and the family and so i think there's

2259
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,360
the cultural scaffolding

2260
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:57,440
and then all the way down to the

2261
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:59,520
microstructural

2262
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,719
cytoskeletal scaffold

2263
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:05,360
for scaffolding enzyme complexes that

2264
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:08,960
then can do very efficient things too

2265
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,679
yeah it's interesting because the

2266
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:12,800
problem with

2267
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,560
the the challenge

2268
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:17,880
with um so-called grassroots

2269
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:20,560
entrepreneurship and innovation

2270
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,719
is scaling it up

2271
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:25,199
that's the the challenge that's

2272
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:27,520
that's what was said yesterday

2273
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:30,239
but that's what said in india

2274
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:32,560
there's this problem that

2275
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,880
solutions are developed

2276
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,280
and they they work

2277
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:40,800
but they at best stay where they've been

2278
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,639
in the village where it's

2279
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:44,560
been developed it sort of just stays

2280
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,080
there

2281
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,040
and so

2282
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,440
scaling up and it's a um

2283
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:53,120
open source um

2284
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,719
would it's

2285
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:56,560
well there it is the technology is there

2286
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:59,120
isn't an open source ecology it's uh

2287
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,719
it's possible to put all engineering

2288
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:02,400
designs and builds and materials

2289
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:03,520
and

2290
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:03,800
um

2291
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:05,520
[Music]

2292
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:07,840
methods of work and

2293
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,280
all on the internet where anybody can

2294
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:12,480
access it but still

2295
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:17,559
things are not scaling up

2296
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:21,199
thanks blue

2297
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:24,480
so i think about scaffolding um in terms

2298
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,600
of

2299
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:28,159
like neural systems but also in societal

2300
01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:29,199
systems

2301
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:32,159
in the brain like my phd work was

2302
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:33,440
focused on

2303
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:36,159
finding a scaffold that will

2304
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:38,400
promote the growth of neurons

2305
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,480
across um

2306
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:41,920
across the lesion

2307
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,000
and so when you have a traumatic brain

2308
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,239
injury the glia which is like the

2309
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:49,040
natural scaffold like freak out and form

2310
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,960
a scar to prevent like the whole rest of

2311
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,719
the brain from dying because cell death

2312
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:54,320
can be like this kind of cascading

2313
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,960
process and so so the glia and and it

2314
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:59,040
literally results in like a hole in the

2315
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:00,960
brain where the injury was

2316
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,120
so i was looking at these bioengineered

2317
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:05,600
scaffolds that promote the growth of

2318
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,400
neurons across that hole so so like

2319
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,880
it'll it'll form a bridge or a structure

2320
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:14,239
scaffold for the neurons to grow

2321
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:16,880
um and then you know in terms of the the

2322
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:19,520
societal um setting

2323
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:21,760
i think about um scaffolding as

2324
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,360
infrastructure

2325
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,920
and and i mean even in an organization

2326
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,840
like you have to have

2327
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,239
bridges and roads and internet

2328
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:32,960
connections and utilities and you know

2329
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:34,880
these things are it's the the

2330
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:37,199
infrastructure that's necessary for

2331
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:38,400
kind of new

2332
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:39,280
um

2333
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:41,280
branches or systems start up and even in

2334
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:42,880
like the farming

2335
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,440
terms it's like you know the the um like

2336
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,560
i don't know here we just call them the

2337
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,480
ditches but like the irrigation canals i

2338
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,159
guess is probably the proper term like

2339
01:32:50,159 --> 01:32:52,880
that you know the um where you can

2340
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:55,760
get a river to flow off into different

2341
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,360
subsections and then irrigate the

2342
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:59,840
farmland with that water so so i think

2343
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:03,600
about that as as the scaffold

2344
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,840
awesome blue nice connection and sounds

2345
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:10,800
like cool phd research we see your

2346
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,199
screen stephen

2347
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:16,239
so you see grassroots innovation program

2348
01:33:16,239 --> 01:33:18,000
yes

2349
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,880
okay yeah so that was that was yesterday

2350
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:23,920
um although the press release was

2351
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:26,639
in july but it's not it's not detailing

2352
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:29,600
the book but there we are this is the um

2353
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:32,080
so in south africa there were

2354
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:34,400
the rate of unemployment is

2355
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,400
i think officially it's

2356
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,639
more than 30 percent

2357
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:41,040
but um unofficially it could be as high

2358
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:42,880
as 50

2359
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:44,880
and uh

2360
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:45,920
this is

2361
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:48,639
so they're now trying to address

2362
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:50,880
at least partly through this grassroots

2363
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,719
innovation problem

2364
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:53,760
program

2365
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:56,239
so one and there are there are similar

2366
01:33:56,239 --> 01:33:58,880
and we know that

2367
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,480
um

2368
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:03,120
the book decades ago small is beautiful

2369
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:04,639
and

2370
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:05,920
gandhi was

2371
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:08,960
before that was promoting this but

2372
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:12,080
it does it's not scaling

2373
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,639
and so there are these

2374
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:17,440
in between industrial production there's

2375
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:20,639
just this ever-increasing wasteland

2376
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:23,440
but efforts are going on around the

2377
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:25,120
world

2378
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,199
and grassroots is a good term because

2379
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:29,679
it's just growing from

2380
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:33,840
evolving naturally doesn't it

2381
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:35,840
sounds like really

2382
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:38,320
interesting work thanks for sharing it

2383
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:41,040
stephen celet

2384
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,840
yeah actually that ties in i actually

2385
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,679
was running a project in south africa

2386
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:46,960
funny enough

2387
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:49,920
um and working on

2388
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:51,840
looking at how to create community

2389
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:54,000
driven innovation through strategic

2390
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,159
strategic conversations at the community

2391
01:34:56,159 --> 01:34:58,080
level and there is there is an

2392
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:59,679
interesting difference between

2393
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:03,040
grassroots i think and community driven

2394
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:05,600
so i think that grassroots is often kind

2395
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,119
of um

2396
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:09,760
tied to

2397
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:11,920
it's like the base level

2398
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,760
of the organizational structures you

2399
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:15,520
often hear it with political campaigns

2400
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,760
and stuff is the grassroots but those

2401
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,360
grassroots are the grassroots of a

2402
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:21,760
campaign where people sort of get into

2403
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,600
there which is a little bit different to

2404
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,199
the kind of a community embedded

2405
01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:26,560
community driven

2406
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:28,719
scale and that comes back to the scaling

2407
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:31,199
question which is the same thing that

2408
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:33,280
had the problems that so they're scaling

2409
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:35,440
there's now when you talk about scaling

2410
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,280
up and that's a big

2411
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:39,040
challenge is how does stuff get scaled

2412
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:41,199
up and they're often now talking as well

2413
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:43,119
about

2414
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:45,280
scaling out

2415
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:48,400
if you have a program or scaling deep

2416
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:49,119
so

2417
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:50,639
you know some things might scale up

2418
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:52,480
because they go up to a higher level and

2419
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,320
then they basically get dropped down

2420
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:55,679
again

2421
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:58,239
but how do these things get scaled out

2422
01:35:58,239 --> 01:35:59,360
so

2423
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:01,440
there may be some i think you're you're

2424
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:03,360
you're tapping into a few

2425
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,199
multi-level issues which i think are

2426
01:36:05,199 --> 01:36:07,280
quite quite important so i wonder what

2427
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:09,040
your thoughts are about

2428
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:10,960
going at uh

2429
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:13,040
going into these kind of

2430
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:15,199
embedded local

2431
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:17,280
context to create

2432
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:20,000
new seeds so to speak for like

2433
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,320
adaptability

2434
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:25,480
and innovation

2435
01:36:36,239 --> 01:36:37,840
it's like a seed is a biological

2436
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:41,679
planting metaphor the scaffold is a um

2437
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:44,080
highlighting the industrial component of

2438
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:46,000
a biological process

2439
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,159
like you still need the tomato seed so

2440
01:36:48,159 --> 01:36:49,840
it's not saying it's not community

2441
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:52,000
driven it's just like a soil metaphor

2442
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,920
like how these

2443
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:56,400
communicate what our vision is and they

2444
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:57,840
really do matter

2445
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,920
and so they're really um

2446
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:01,360
important points

2447
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,440
actually here's a comment from kevin in

2448
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:05,119
the chat who wrote

2449
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:07,280
is the scaffolding a schema or is this

2450
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,679
supposed to be anatomical

2451
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:11,920
that is is there some physiological

2452
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:13,760
analog in the human nervous systems or

2453
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,040
genome that corresponds to the

2454
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:16,800
scaffolding i think blue made an awesome

2455
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,880
point about the glia and about

2456
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,960
connective tissue being

2457
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,560
an immune tissue being scaffolding

2458
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,159
physically for like the synapse and for

2459
01:37:24,159 --> 01:37:26,800
cells and then the genome oh yes

2460
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:29,199
the chromatin scaffolding goes deep in

2461
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:31,119
the nuclear pore structure

2462
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:35,360
and that's a whole cool area and

2463
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:36,480
maybe there'll be a day for

2464
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,159
transcription factor active inference

2465
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:40,719
soon enough

2466
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:50,480
so um what you're saying these hands

2467
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:54,959
this is a an organization um

2468
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:00,159
active in botswana

2469
01:38:00,159 --> 01:38:04,719
and everything they're doing there

2470
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:05,840
but

2471
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:08,960
there we are you can see

2472
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:10,850
yep

2473
01:38:10,850 --> 01:38:14,079
[Music]

2474
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:19,840
yeah

2475
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:21,920
so this is led by uh

2476
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:24,320
thurbison

2477
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:25,360
and

2478
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:30,639
he's um applying design methods in um

2479
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:33,760
uh communities in southern africa with

2480
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:36,080
great effect

2481
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:39,040
and this is all uh

2482
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:40,560
and

2483
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:44,000
so the idea is that people are

2484
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,719
with their own hands are

2485
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:48,159
developing

2486
01:38:48,159 --> 01:38:51,199
innovations and

2487
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:57,159
as you say you can be scaled out

2488
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:01,909
[Music]

2489
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:10,239
for example in

2490
01:39:10,239 --> 01:39:12,800
in that part of africa that

2491
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,159
there are many

2492
01:39:14,159 --> 01:39:17,519
movements like uh

2493
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:19,760
many initiatives going on

2494
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:21,920
but it would be very beneficial if there

2495
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:24,639
was um

2496
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:27,600
a

2497
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,040
framing

2498
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:32,080
a kind of unifying framing of what

2499
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:33,600
they're all doing

2500
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:35,760
which can be seen

2501
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:40,679
as an alternative an alternative

2502
01:39:41,199 --> 01:39:42,280
form of

2503
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:45,280
socio-economic development

2504
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:49,679
rather than just as something that's uh

2505
01:39:50,239 --> 01:39:51,840
well fundamentally

2506
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:54,400
inferior

2507
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,639
to industrialized to

2508
01:39:56,639 --> 01:39:58,800
to the conventional model of

2509
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:01,800
industrialization

2510
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:08,119
so all suggestions are welcome

2511
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:11,440
i just put in the youtube chat a volume

2512
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:12,480
uh

2513
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:15,840
by capparel grissomer and wimsat

2514
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,600
developing scaffolds in evolution

2515
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:19,520
culture and cognition

2516
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:22,480
and so the paradigm change as steven

2517
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:24,560
kind of hinted at very early is like

2518
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,639
from systems where we eradicate the life

2519
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:27,760
to where we

2520
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:30,880
welcome the life and all that it brings

2521
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,800
and we don't need to build that and we

2522
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,320
can't build it we're not going to be

2523
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,639
able to compose the lipids

2524
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:39,360
and the millions of years of fault

2525
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:41,920
tolerances into some sort of uh

2526
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:42,800
you know

2527
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:45,280
monster that

2528
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:47,280
helps our living systems

2529
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:48,960
we don't even have to though we just

2530
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,520
have to build an engineered scaffold and

2531
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:53,040
the scaffold can be

2532
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:55,119
radically different than what

2533
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:56,480
the final product looks like the

2534
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:58,639
scaffold can even disintegrate if it's

2535
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:00,159
biodegradable

2536
01:41:00,159 --> 01:41:01,199
so

2537
01:41:01,199 --> 01:41:04,080
it um it's a really interesting area

2538
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:05,920
that this discussion went which was like

2539
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:07,360
towards

2540
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:08,960
the engineering that

2541
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:11,520
makes us think of like foundries

2542
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:13,600
and some of the technical and precision

2543
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,600
processes

2544
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,600
tying them to some natural processes

2545
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:19,360
like this evolution culture cognition

2546
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:21,280
volume does

2547
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:24,080
and unifying frameworks

2548
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:25,920
those uh

2549
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:28,159
together almost point a way towards

2550
01:41:28,159 --> 01:41:30,320
engineering a scaffold not a booster

2551
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:31,360
rocket

2552
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:33,360
or just a bunker

2553
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,679
but bunkers might come into play of

2554
01:41:35,679 --> 01:41:37,440
doing some

2555
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:39,440
scaffold design

2556
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:41,040
so that there could be

2557
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,639
reduction of expected free energy

2558
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:44,480
through deep time

2559
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:47,119
so pretty interesting um point stephen

2560
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:49,040
thanks for sharing all these resources

2561
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:51,760
too blue

2562
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:53,520
just a quick comment um you were talking

2563
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:56,159
about the scaffolding disintegrating

2564
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:58,480
sometimes the scaffolding is designed to

2565
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:00,800
disintegrate like i think about in in

2566
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,960
biological you know terms we have like

2567
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:04,960
webbing between our fingers that enable

2568
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:06,800
like the growth of the digits and then

2569
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:09,679
you know it's designed to be eroded uh

2570
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:11,679
in in the developmental process um so

2571
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:13,360
sometimes that's that's part of it or

2572
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:15,760
even like when you get a wound sealed

2573
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:17,280
you know you have like the the stitches

2574
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,280
that scaffold that form the scaffolding

2575
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:21,440
so the healing process can occur but

2576
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:24,879
they dissolve inside the wound

2577
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:28,639
um

2578
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:30,960
actually that's a good that's quite cool

2579
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:32,960
to think about that as well in the

2580
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:35,440
processes

2581
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:37,840
and uh when when we

2582
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:40,880
whether in areas that we live in or

2583
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:42,639
areas that we don't live in when we plan

2584
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:44,480
to intervene are we planning to make

2585
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:47,119
something that sustains itself

2586
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:49,040
or are we planning to

2587
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:52,320
deliver or co-create a scaffold that

2588
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:54,560
is planned to disappear

2589
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:57,280
those are really different views on

2590
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:00,239
local and distal intervention

2591
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:03,759
steven with a screecher

2592
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:08,960
what's on the screen stephen fox yes

2593
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:11,520
so now this is um

2594
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,360
this is an initiative called connected

2595
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:15,119
hubs

2596
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:17,199
so this this is coming from the southern

2597
01:43:17,199 --> 01:43:21,600
african uh innovation support program

2598
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,400
and

2599
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:26,559
uh the idea is to

2600
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:28,320
um

2601
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:30,960
that there are

2602
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:32,800
hubs

2603
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:34,400
which support

2604
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:37,360
[Music]

2605
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:40,560
innovation and entrepreneurship

2606
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:42,880
and these are

2607
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:46,000
this particular

2608
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:48,400
one is um

2609
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:50,560
so as you can see the connectivity is

2610
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:52,080
here

2611
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:55,440
in this part of africa

2612
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:59,119
and what we do is build capacities and

2613
01:43:59,119 --> 01:44:00,560
support

2614
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:04,040
and uh

2615
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:11,360
so it's connecting uh different

2616
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,199
hubs together

2617
01:44:13,199 --> 01:44:15,040
and so a hub it's just

2618
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:17,199
what that means is it's just

2619
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:19,440
that usually they've got a physical

2620
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:21,440
location

2621
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:23,679
and they

2622
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:24,880
uh

2623
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:27,440
there are people you can contact there

2624
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:29,600
remotely and physically

2625
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:30,800
you've got

2626
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:35,440
can help with developing um

2627
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:38,159
ideas for entrepreneurship and social

2628
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:40,159
entrepreneurship so this is something

2629
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:43,040
that's going on

2630
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:47,480
it's connecting hub

2631
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:50,800
so maybe there's

2632
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,159
well

2633
01:44:52,159 --> 01:44:54,559
this is

2634
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:56,719
hopefully this is the intention is this

2635
01:44:56,719 --> 01:44:58,960
persists after the southern african

2636
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:00,719
innovation support program is on the

2637
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:04,400
second phase now after it finishes

2638
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:07,360
so this is one

2639
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,280
i suppose it's summed up in this uh

2640
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:13,280
diagram here this idea that there are

2641
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:14,880
more and more

2642
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:17,119
hubs herbsing

2643
01:45:17,119 --> 01:45:21,440
and the european commission is um

2644
01:45:22,719 --> 01:45:25,760
trying this uh

2645
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,840
africa

2646
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:31,840
eu digital

2647
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:34,960
innovation

2648
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:47,360
hubs oh we'll see this and then

2649
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:50,639
there we are so this is kind of things

2650
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:52,560
that are going on so i'm involved in

2651
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:54,480
this project sustainable

2652
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:58,159
um network of digital innovation hubs

2653
01:45:58,159 --> 01:46:00,719
so that's something that's uh

2654
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:03,119
coming down from the african union and

2655
01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:06,560
the european union

2656
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:10,159
and the hope the aim is that

2657
01:46:10,159 --> 01:46:14,080
this is an uh a somewhat new

2658
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:16,480
way of

2659
01:46:17,119 --> 01:46:19,280
facilitating socioeconomic development

2660
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:21,040
and the idea is to try to get auto

2661
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:23,440
catalytic effects by you know more

2662
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,040
connections

2663
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:28,000
more um

2664
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,040
more dynamism

2665
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:34,080
well they're always welcome to

2666
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:35,600
come talk about active inference at

2667
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:37,360
whatever stage

2668
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:39,920
in the last few minutes we'll just have

2669
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:42,719
steven and then blue

2670
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:44,000
and

2671
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,400
yeah just give kind of last

2672
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,880
thought or question here as we close out

2673
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:50,960
okay yeah no thanks very interesting and

2674
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:52,320
um

2675
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:55,280
i suppose with active inference i think

2676
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:56,960
very interested in these these

2677
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:58,480
developments it's actually how i ended

2678
01:46:58,480 --> 01:46:59,679
up getting into this because i was

2679
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:01,600
trying to develop community-based hubs

2680
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:04,320
in south africa funny enough in rural

2681
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,239
rural maputo land

2682
01:47:06,239 --> 01:47:09,199
um and i think what's quite interesting

2683
01:47:09,199 --> 01:47:11,920
is daniel's this this idea of a unifying

2684
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:13,440
framework rather than trying to reduce

2685
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:14,960
down all the complexity which is what i

2686
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:17,199
was doing for far too many years

2687
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:19,119
is really amazing and the other thing

2688
01:47:19,119 --> 01:47:21,040
that all of these

2689
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:22,560
aspects that you're taught you've just

2690
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:25,040
shared and that ties in with this lab is

2691
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:27,600
it's it's about participation as soon as

2692
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:31,280
you bring in participatory processes

2693
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:32,320
you

2694
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,159
you bring in these active inference

2695
01:47:34,159 --> 01:47:36,000
dynamics you bring in this complexity

2696
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,280
you bring in this need

2697
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:41,440
but also the ability

2698
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,199
to do what

2699
01:47:43,199 --> 01:47:44,719
mass

2700
01:47:44,719 --> 01:47:46,719
manufacturing can't do

2701
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:48,800
but like i thought you said it's it's

2702
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:50,480
seen as being

2703
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:54,560
inferior or in our culture and i think

2704
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:56,000
seeing it as being

2705
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,719
vital but also challenging is really

2706
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:00,560
cool so i think that's something i'm

2707
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:01,840
going to take away because i can't i

2708
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:02,960
won't actually get to stay too much

2709
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:04,239
longer i've got to jump on another call

2710
01:48:04,239 --> 01:48:05,840
but that's something i'd like to take

2711
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:07,760
away so thanks very much brilliant

2712
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:09,360
really really enjoyed today thank you so

2713
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:10,320
much

2714
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:11,760
thank you steven

2715
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:14,320
see you later

2716
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:16,239
blue

2717
01:48:16,239 --> 01:48:19,040
um so just a couple final thoughts uh

2718
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:23,199
john boyk and his idea of connected hubs

2719
01:48:23,199 --> 01:48:25,520
i mean he was on like probably six

2720
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:28,000
different um live streams

2721
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,560
and uh he gave a very good overview of

2722
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:34,320
sustainability um and the you know

2723
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:36,159
how to build an architecture toward a

2724
01:48:36,159 --> 01:48:37,920
sustainable future

2725
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:39,280
um so the connected hubs kind of

2726
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:41,280
reminded me of that and then

2727
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:44,719
um the one other thing was um just about

2728
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:46,400
scaffolding and

2729
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:48,320
you know how do we build kind of a

2730
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:50,320
scaffolding for our cognitive

2731
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:53,600
architecture and is this a scaffolding

2732
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,920
that's maybe designed to dissolve and so

2733
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:57,920
i think about you know scaffolding for

2734
01:48:57,920 --> 01:48:59,600
our cognitive architecture as as

2735
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:02,320
education right like we send the kids to

2736
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:04,719
k-12 and they you know form this like

2737
01:49:04,719 --> 01:49:07,840
shared understanding of reality and and

2738
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:09,440
two plus two is for and how to read

2739
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:11,840
books and so forth and

2740
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:14,560
this kind of um education maybe daniel

2741
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:17,119
will remember at least in college when i

2742
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:19,440
started college um in biology many

2743
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:22,159
things are so complicated that they just

2744
01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:24,960
give you like a very broad overview that

2745
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:26,880
doesn't make sense or i was always

2746
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:28,480
searching for like but that doesn't make

2747
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:29,679
sense but that doesn't make sense like

2748
01:49:29,679 --> 01:49:32,000
in your entry-level classes and and then

2749
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,639
as you get like deeper and deeper into

2750
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:36,480
studying biology or biochemistry you

2751
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:38,480
start to kind of understand electron

2752
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:40,960
transport and these different like

2753
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:44,560
things that are are very like micro but

2754
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:46,159
the macro level doesn't make sense

2755
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:48,000
without understanding that that micro

2756
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,920
and in my mind this this kind of

2757
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:52,080
educational or that way that i was

2758
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:53,920
taught in college was kind of like

2759
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:55,599
building a scaffold that was designed to

2760
01:49:55,599 --> 01:49:56,719
disappear

2761
01:49:56,719 --> 01:49:58,560
anyway

2762
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:00,320
um but anyway yeah thanks for the for

2763
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:02,960
the talks today and for coming on it was

2764
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:05,199
good

2765
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:07,360
if i can get my last comment and then to

2766
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,280
the author for the final comment

2767
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:10,880
i just love this idea of the

2768
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:14,000
biochemistry education as the removable

2769
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,480
scaffold like you learn it once that

2770
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:18,239
there's the essential amino acids and

2771
01:50:18,239 --> 01:50:20,080
then you never wonder like why on the

2772
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:21,679
nutrition label is there essential and

2773
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:24,000
non-essential you forget the details the

2774
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,880
side chains you know the c minus on the

2775
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:29,920
test that all disappears

2776
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:31,679
with something that's generalized but

2777
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:34,080
otherwise we would look at macroscopic

2778
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:36,000
phenomena like why can't i swim when

2779
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,880
there's this algae in the lake

2780
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:41,360
well there's some molecular answer we

2781
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:43,360
could know at least how to sense make in

2782
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:44,960
that area might even know the specific

2783
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:48,480
details but also it can be removed in a

2784
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:49,440
way

2785
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:50,880
but can it be removed

2786
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:53,040
intergenerationally

2787
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:55,760
a chemistry to alchemy reversion

2788
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:57,840
with similar or different tools

2789
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:00,000
that would be quite something

2790
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,599
so stephen

2791
01:51:01,599 --> 01:51:04,320
with the um final notes but just wanted

2792
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:06,080
to say thanks for coming on these

2793
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:08,719
streams and it was just like super

2794
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:11,840
interesting discussions

2795
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:15,760
well thank you very much it was

2796
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:17,679
my pleasure and

2797
01:51:17,679 --> 01:51:19,520
i look forward to

2798
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:21,400

01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:24,159
cooperation with you all

2800
01:51:24,159 --> 01:51:26,400
great if you or any of your

2801
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:28,400
collaborators on these

2802
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:31,199
projects or your contacts these hubs

2803
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:32,800
wanted to

2804
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:34,400
present on this or

2805
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:36,639
facilitate in any way then we can talk

2806
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:39,520
um another time

2807
01:51:41,199 --> 01:51:43,040
very good thank you very much

2808
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:47,960
thanks again steven thank you blue bye

2809
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:05,519
you
