1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,760
i'm ready

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,360
okay

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,280
hope that this

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,440
is working well and i guess this is

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,920
where we can begin the conversation

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,800
this is a twitter spaces on september 14

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,600
2022.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,400
it is called can web 3 survive without

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,480
cognitive modeling and i know there's

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,558
something they say about headlines that

11
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,160
end in a question mark something like

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,719
always their yes answers or no answers

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,559
or

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,800
in this conversation we're going to be

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,440
talking about web 3 and about cognitive

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,120
modeling and

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,520
it will be less than an hour long

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,360
hopefully will serve as a nice

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,440
introduction to those who have

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,239
little or some familiarity with web3 and

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,600
cognitive modeling

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,399
alone or together but it's also meant to

23
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,120
be kind of a broad ranging discussion

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,120
and hopefully we'll have some other

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,000
voices come up and add in some thoughts

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,920
and questions

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,159
let's start with just a description of

28
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,520
web3

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,479
surely elsewhere you'll be able to find

30
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,400
audio and other kinds of content

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,880
describing web3 so

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,799
i'll just describe what's relevant about

33
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,799
it as we

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,439
talk about cognitive modeling web3

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,920
web 3 is an ongoing movements that is

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,680
applying blockchain and other

37
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,000
distributed technologies to a wide

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,960
ranging

39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,240
areas

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,960
and we can think of web 3 as creating

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,520
critical infrastructure of the public

42
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,840
goods type or not necessarily public

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,320
goods in a wide

44
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,439
range of areas so in finance there's

45
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,640
decentralized finance or d5

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,280
and d5 requires the engineering of token

47
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,119
schemes which is sometimes called token

48
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,360
engineering or tokenomics

49
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,719
such that those token-based systems are

50
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,560
able to be designed effectively and

51
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,640
operate effectively and there's a lot of

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,038
other areas outside of the financial

53
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,840
that are important for web3 for example

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,560
community governance and meta governance

55
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,160
like what people may have heard about

56
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,400
dao's decentralized autonomous

57
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,040
organizations as well as all other kinds

58
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,879
of organizations

59
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,680
and

60
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,160
of particular interest for

61
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,239
our institute and for many others is

62
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,200
decentralized science or doosan

63
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,640
and in many ways desai will succeed

64
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,000
if it can have a balanced and coherent

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,040
approach

66
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,280
to tackle all the challenges

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
that face

68
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,879
the research and education stack ranging

69
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,800
from the who what why where when etc

70
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,440
our question that we'll return to

71
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,640
is how can any of these areas finance

72
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,120
community research science and education

73
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,440
how can any of these areas

74
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,519
be successfully navigated or designed

75
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,879
for without taking agents into account

76
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,000
so this is

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,640
very related to agent-based modeling and

78
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,120
we're going to explore how there are

79
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,879
several approaches to modeling these

80
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,480
complex systems

81
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,959
and we're going to suggest that

82
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,200
complementing top-down structural

83
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
modeling of these systems there's a

84
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,519
really important role for agentic or

85
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,319
what we can consider cognitive modeling

86
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,080
of the actors in these systems

87
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,200
themselves

88
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,959
and we believe that without this kind of

89
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,640
like a bottom-up

90
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,519
individual driven account

91
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,480
taken

92
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,239
conceptually

93
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,879
in to the design process but also more

94
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,680
formally into the specification and

95
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,440
evaluation of these critical

96
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,120
infrastructure systems

97
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,360
that there are going to be a lot of

98
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,920
blind spots and a lot of failure modes

99
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,760
that just simply will not be addressed

100
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,360
by the structural analysis alone

101
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,840
blue wanna add on that or we can

102
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,480
continue talking about this

103
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,720
yeah so i can say a couple things so i

104
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,080
think

105
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,480
agent-based modeling is

106
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,519
a super useful approach when you are

107
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,560
getting into systems that that are

108
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,399
multi-agent that

109
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,279
like are maybe predictive of any kind of

110
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,238
outcome

111
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,880
so like if this then that like how many

112
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,199
agents does it take to defect

113
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,800
um for a system to fail like you know if

114
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,680
if

115
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,639
um

116
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,960
everybody unloads their nfts all at once

117
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,280
then the system collapses right

118
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,040
so it's these kinds of things and and

119
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,400
what is the the cognitive

120
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,919
underpinnings what are the cognitive

121
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,199
underpinnings of the decision making in

122
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,720
an agent and because everybody's

123
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,840
influenced by a variety of factors uh

124
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,479
personal and environmental so agents can

125
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,520
start off

126
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,840
with like more of a of a different

127
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,960
disposition like than others

128
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,120
which is how we are in the real world

129
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,080
and um you know can have different

130
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,240
reactions to environmental cues

131
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,160
um and i think that that's all i'll say

132
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,639
about that

133
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,039
great point agent-based modeling is

134
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,360
really helpful for counter factual

135
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,840
analyses because we can ask well what

136
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,160
would be different if we had this many

137
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,680
instead of that many of this kind of

138
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,520
entity or if they could do this instead

139
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,440
of that

140
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,039
going back to the critical

141
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,240
infrastructure

142
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,639
and the need to design them reliably and

143
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,880
also de-risk against a variety of

144
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,400
failure modes

145
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,120
web 3 has some failure modes and threat

146
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,520
surfaces that are very similar to what

147
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,880
is seen in

148
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,479
web 2 and just other technological areas

149
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,800
and there's also some unique

150
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,800
and partially modeled scenarios in web 3

151
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,720
relating to blockchain and distributed

152
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,880
technologies specifically

153
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,039
and a lot of the complexities come from

154
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,520
the nested scales of decision making and

155
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,400
modeling that come into play in web3 so

156
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,639
just speaking coarsely there are

157
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,440
decisions and discourse at the level of

158
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,840
layer one chains themself like

159
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,720
blockchains or among blockchains as

160
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,680
we're observing in this uh current day

161
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,600
around the ethereum

162
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,199
changes that are happening known as the

163
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,720
merge but even within a layer one chain

164
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,960
there are multiple tokens and other

165
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,039
kinds of entities on that chain and

166
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,479
different communities that might be

167
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,319
using the same or different tokens or

168
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,960
their own tokens and teams and projects

169
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
that might be on chain or off chain so

170
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,560
there's a lot of interacting and nested

171
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,600
layers of analysis so considering how

172
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,560
different effects greetings jakob

173
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,240
how different effects of different

174
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,319
actors percolate through that kind of a

175
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,600
complex system is a key question

176
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,759
and we can talk about a few different

177
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,080
yaakov i'm going to make you

178
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,000
invited to speak

179
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,599
we can talk about a few different

180
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,479
modeling paradigms and approaches

181
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,479
and talk about what is state-of-the-art

182
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,680
and used wisely widely and wisely today

183
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,360
and then how cognitive modeling

184
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,599
specifically might be complementary and

185
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,520
empowering those methods

186
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,400
so

187
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,639
just speaking broadly i'm going to

188
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,360
mention smart contract auditing and then

189
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,680
top-down structural approaches and then

190
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,759
lastly bottom-up agentic approaches

191
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,160
which is the cognitive modeling approach

192
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,880
so first just speaking to smart contract

193
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,720
auditing smart contracts are familiar in

194
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,400
financial areas

195
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,720
and in kind of on-chain defy

196
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,160
applications

197
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,319
although smart contracts also underlie

198
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,280
technologies like dao and desai and

199
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,919
citations identity intellectual property

200
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,560
all kinds of aspects of society and

201
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,440
culture may be occurring through broadly

202
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,840
what are known as smart contracts

203
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,479
and the computational details of smart

204
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,680
contracts

205
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,080
can be audited along the lines of

206
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,840
security audits for other kinds of

207
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,160
computational programs for example a

208
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,800
hacker noon article describes that smart

209
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,960
contract auditing identifies any errors

210
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,199
in the code and ensures that the code is

211
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,599
safe to use when transferring funds

212
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,759
and so that kind of smart contract

213
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,800
auditing

214
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,759
is able to assess whether for example a

215
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,759
given reservoir of funds can be

216
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,879
extracted by an unauthorized user uh

217
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,120
that is absolutely valuable and we're

218
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,960
not suggesting that cognitive modeling

219
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,958
replaces that

220
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,919
we have two modes of systems modeling

221
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,159
beyond simple smart contract auditing

222
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,360
that are relevant and that's the

223
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,519
top-down structural modeling and the

224
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,320
bottom-up modeling perhaps jakob you

225
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,240
could describe

226
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,080
top-down and bottom-up approaches to

227
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,440
modeling here

228
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,200
yeah sure um

229
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,480
by the way i'm

230
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,760
on my phone right now because uh i uh

231
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,480
i'm just walking in the middle of uh the

232
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,640
city so if the background noise is too

233
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,240
loud just let me know

234
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,000
yeah on the so on the top down versus

235
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,360
bottom up approach i think the main um

236
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,399
the main

237
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,279
i guess

238
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,320
in classical cat cat modeling

239
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,279
the

240
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,959
one of the main approaches

241
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,160
is to

242
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,720
um identify the structure of the

243
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,320
of the system that's being studied in

244
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,600
this case it could be a decentralized

245
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,240
protocol that uh

246
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,560
enforces certain behaviors by smart

247
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,760
contracts

248
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,800
and

249
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,320
then this

250
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,320
kind of uh top-down structural modeling

251
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,560
is

252
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,399
diameter sweeps where we try to identify

253
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,760
all the different

254
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,080
um

255
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,920
all the different states that the system

256
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,040
can reach

257
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,920
and

258
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,519
but that doesn't really tell us anything

259
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,000
about what state the system will

260
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,560
actually reach and how it performs from

261
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,800
the perspective of its users

262
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,800
so the bottom up cognitive

263
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,000
sweeps

264
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,800
but

265
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,599
on the

266
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,120
okay lock up your audios a little bit

267
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,560
and now

268
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,480
more rigorous cognitive analysis from

269
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,000
the perspective of the

270
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,480
of the participants within that system

271
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,920
um

272
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,959
so

273
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,399
the idea behind

274
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,839
active block friends is to kind of

275
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,560
balance these two approaches and to take

276
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,240
insights from

277
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,120
um

278
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,959
from both

279
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,160
i hope that provides a brief overview

280
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,240
yep thank you i'll just kind of

281
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,519
summarize that because there was a

282
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,519
little bit of cutting in and out but the

283
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,600
top down in the structural approach to

284
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,320
modeling which is commonly used in

285
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,360
tokenomic suites like cad cad that was

286
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,279
mentioned by yakub

287
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,440
it describes system states

288
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,040
like the yield return percentage on some

289
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,040
kind of a smart contract and other

290
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,640
system parameters

291
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,440
and then it specifies the state spaces

292
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,600
which those parameters can exist in and

293
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,680
these tools also enable parameter

294
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,079
sweeping across those system parameters

295
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,920
and that's like a macro economic

296
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,200
analysis

297
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,680
that can be said to be taking like a

298
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,760
population level

299
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,079
approach to modeling the behaviors of

300
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,560
these complex systems so that would be

301
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,320
equivalent to like modeling a

302
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,519
macroeconomic sector with systems of

303
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,360
equations and then exploring how those

304
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,680
equations influence each other

305
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,560
and in contrast there is a bottom-up

306
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,200
agentic approach which entails a

307
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,000
cognitive model of the agents because

308
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,160
the cognitive model is

309
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,560
which we're using uh in the active

310
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,160
inference sense

311
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,640
of the generative model that provides

312
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,360
that agent with the ability to engage in

313
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,399
perception

314
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,040
cognition and action where cognition is

315
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,360
describing various

316
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,480
functionalities like memory preference

317
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,519
and action selection anticipation and so

318
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,800
on

319
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,600
so

320
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
we've been thinking about this angle of

321
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,720
cognitive modeling in web 3 a lot

322
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,240
because our project active block friends

323
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,560
is an open source package that is

324
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,399
explicitly addressing

325
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,639
and trying to enable this kind of

326
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,519
cognitive modeling in web 3.

327
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,399
um

328
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,480
and we're going to

329
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
have a bunch of time

330
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,079
to discuss

331
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,399
aspects of where cognitive modeling

332
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,399
could apply in web3

333
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,279
and i'm going to highlight um

334
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,240
three

335
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,360
areas

336
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,120
but we'll discuss them one by one and

337
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,920
also if anyone listening wants to join

338
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,360
they can absolutely feel welcome

339
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,240
and there's going to be three areas

340
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,040
or points of contact to explore so this

341
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,519
should be pretty fun and uh blue and

342
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,519
yuck up after each one of them like

343
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,519
please feel free to share how you see it

344
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,279
playing out or what you think is useful

345
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,800
about it so

346
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,680
here's reason one for why we'll argue

347
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,959
that web 3 needs cognitive modeling

348
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,480
it is that we need to understand the

349
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,079
consequences of single actions taken by

350
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,399
single actors

351
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,279
there are also singular events that

352
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,680
happen at the system level that we might

353
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,880
want to model like rare or really

354
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,200
important cascade type events like a

355
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,560
flipping

356
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,639
and that might be able to be modeled or

357
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,880
detected or designed around using

358
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,440
top-down structural approaches again

359
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,760
thinking about macroeconomics one could

360
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,600
imagine they have some dynamical

361
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,200
equations describing different

362
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,920
currencies and then they could identify

363
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,000
like a change point when one currency

364
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,279
flipped another that's the flipping

365
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,040
we're also interested in the potentially

366
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,120
cascading consequences

367
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,560
of single actions by single actors

368
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,440
so

369
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,160
this one specific transaction that this

370
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,560
one address sends to this one smart

371
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,440
contract is possibly able to induce

372
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,000
widespread consequences for the whole

373
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,040
system

374
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,560
and that level of atomic granularity in

375
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,639
terms of which entity did which

376
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,120
affordance which action

377
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,199
towards which entity

378
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,199
and then understanding the consequences

379
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,240
of that action at that granularity it

380
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,320
simply is inexpressible

381
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,040
within the structural or top-down mode

382
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,399
of modeling

383
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,959
which really can be said to abstract

384
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:41,839
over

385
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,600
individual entities and actions so we're

386
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,240
not denying that the structural the top

387
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,120
down

388
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,839
can provide an immensely

389
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,720
coarse-grained useful representation of

390
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,920
systems during design and implementation

391
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,800
but also we in this first point argue

392
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,959
that web 3 needs cognitive modeling

393
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,120
because we do want to model and

394
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,040
understand the consequences of single

395
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,519
actions that single actors take

396
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,079
blue or jacob

397
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,800
go ahead jacob if you have anything

398
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,279
there i will defect and wait until we

399
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,880
talk about multi-agent systems i think

400
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,519
yeah i think uh

401
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,480
i might add that

402
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,760
also there's also a lot of um

403
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,839
interesting overlap with um

404
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,199
the work on

405
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,560
computational

406
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,959
psychiatry or

407
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,639
other

408
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,760
kind of psychology oriented uh

409
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,639
models in the sense that these

410
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,880
um by analog by analyzing the cognitive

411
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,000
states

412
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,320
of agents

413
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,279
things like

414
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,320
how

415
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,480
uh what what are their levels of

416
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,079
curiosity within

417
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,320
within within a system or

418
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,199
um

419
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,480
is it

420
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,440
is

421
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,240
um

422
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,600
is the distribution of beliefs more

423
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,320
skewed towards uh

424
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,000
higher levels of uncertainty or

425
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,800
okay

426
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,800
your audio is just not too good yeah so

427
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,519
yeah but let me try to pick up with what

428
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,279
you mentioned about computational

429
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,720
psychiatry though

430
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,519
so

431
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,480
a top-down structural analysis of

432
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,880
computational psychiatry might be able

433
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,399
to say 10 percent of such and such group

434
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,839
have this

435
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,880
condition and of them then one percent

436
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,959
go on to do this and one percent of that

437
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,399
goes on to be this way

438
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,959
and so one could develop estimates like

439
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,639
per thousand people

440
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,639
with this characteristic

441
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,360
we can expect these outcomes as a health

442
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,959
care system or as an educational system

443
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,520
but again the level of expressivity or

444
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,679
granularity to describe

445
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,439
measurements coming from a given

446
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,640
individual like self-report or

447
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,240
measurements made of their brain and

448
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,359
their body

449
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,799
these kinds of measurements just don't

450
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,280
have a place in structural top-down

451
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,880
modeling so

452
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,959
it may be absolutely useful to take this

453
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,359
macroeconomic structural top-down

454
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,919
perspective to have population level

455
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,440
descriptives

456
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,480
however

457
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,799
the view from the inside the bottom up

458
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,720
in the agentic perspective

459
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
and to incorporate the kinds of data and

460
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,120
information which we have in the

461
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,440
blockchain case like individual

462
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,000
addresses making transactions

463
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,120
we need to have agent level modeling to

464
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,480
be able to

465
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,480
have that kind of a um

466
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,840
personalized clinical relationship

467
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,400
a personalized education relationship

468
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,200
or

469
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
making systems that account for what

470
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,000
individual actors expect prefer and can

471
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,440
do

472
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,480
rather than just designing systems only

473
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,320
at the level of system state space

474
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,240
parameters and then expecting that

475
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,400
somehow whatever it is that agents

476
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,320
expect or prefer preferrer can do will

477
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,200
simply work within that framework

478
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,039
okay so that was the first

479
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,000
point

480
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,640
about why web3 needs cognitive modeling

481
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,480
because again it's important to model

482
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
and understand the consequences of

483
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,400
single actions that single actors take

484
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,880
which might be extraordinarily rare or

485
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,320
improbable

486
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,960
and so we won't be able to have useful

487
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,799
top-down modeling of those kinds of

488
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,559
actions

489
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,039
here's a second point

490
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,280
we believe that web 3 needs cognitive

491
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,559
modeling because we want to consider

492
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,960
the function of web3 systems that are

493
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,840
not simply quantitative or financial for

494
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,880
example

495
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,559
science research education governance

496
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,600
all of these areas are not strictly

497
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,280
about number crunching

498
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,280
and so in these settings

499
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,080
knowledge and meaning which are based

500
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,480
around context and we could even say

501
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,799
that they're non-fungible

502
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,720
knowledge and meaning making of

503
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
epistemic entities

504
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,440
will not be engaged with by top-down

505
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,080
structural structural modeling or smart

506
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,160
contract auditing

507
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,400
because quite literally it is about the

508
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,160
situated entity

509
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,600
and their epistemic experience like the

510
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,880
kinds of

511
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,640
observations that they're making and how

512
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,400
that's updating their generative model

513
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,240
and then what that is

514
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,720
helping them to do so the way that that

515
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,280
would get shoehorned into a structural

516
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,080
model would be assume that

517
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,520
some percentage

518
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,320
of uh individuals are going to listen to

519
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,440
this podcast and then that makes some of

520
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,960
them

521
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,360
more likely to engage in this action so

522
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,080
that is again that view from the top

523
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,200
just like we explored in the

524
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,039
computational psychiatry case that view

525
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,919
from the top or a probabilistic way to

526
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,799
talk about the actions of groups

527
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,440
and this is the complementary view which

528
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,760
is the view from the bottom and this

529
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,240
second point is just to say that

530
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,799
especially if we're going to step beyond

531
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,679
quantitative and financial analyses

532
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,440
that these kinds of knowledge and

533
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,000
meeting meaning making behavior of

534
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,120
entities

535
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,080
are just doubly inaccessible unless we

536
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,480
have cognitive modeling so to design

537
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,760
appropriate

538
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,840
systems

539
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,559
for

540
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,360
science education governance

541
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,600
we will need to have models of what

542
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,320
individuals observe

543
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,000
believe prefer

544
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,880
and do rather than hoping that we can

545
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,200
simply specify the state space that the

546
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,039
system can exist in

547
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,080
and then let individuals run within that

548
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,480
framework

549
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,120
i'll follow up on that um i think that

550
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,720
like yes for

551
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,159
the um dsi but also systems like

552
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,120
regenerative finance will require

553
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,080
novel methods of accounting and so this

554
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,320
kind of cognitive modeling will enable

555
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,159
um i think what jakob was saying earlier

556
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,159
that maybe uh daniel you haven't touched

557
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,280
on yet but this parameter sweeping

558
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,039
so so like when

559
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:23,919
um

560
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,320
when a person values something whether

561
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,360
it's carbon credits or um you know

562
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,039
episodic knowledge

563
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:31,919
when

564
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,559
so when the value system differs from

565
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,120
dollars and cents

566
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,400
these kinds of

567
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,280
uh

568
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,600
ultimate accounting systems are enabled

569
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,000
or facilitated by this kind of cognitive

570
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,080
modeling like will these value systems

571
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,039
and structures work for these people and

572
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,120
you know multi-agent systems can have

573
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,840
variable value systems so i think that

574
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,640
these parameters will will greatly help

575
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,880
us to determine what kind of alternative

576
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,000
accounting structures would be

577
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,520
yes

578
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,559
and there's

579
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,840
many ways and it is by no means trivial

580
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,039
to incorporate these really rich and

581
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,760
expressive things that we want to say

582
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,120
about such systems into the model for

583
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,840
example even just in the example that

584
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,280
blue brought up with regenerative

585
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,640
finance

586
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,679
to describe how different individuals

587
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,600
are making different decisions that

588
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,440
might be a function of

589
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,520
differences in their capacities so their

590
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,919
affordances their capacities for action

591
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,600
it might also reflect different

592
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,640
attention

593
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,080
or different beliefs about the

594
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,480
consequences of different actions and so

595
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,039
there are vast combinations

596
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,080
of

597
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,720
cognitive models to explore and for that

598
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,520
reason being able to do parameter sweeps

599
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,240
across them which is what cad cad the

600
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,600
package enables is really valuable and

601
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,480
that's why active block for ins is

602
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,720
implementing active inference models in

603
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,440
cad cad because it provides a useful

604
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,559
and professional way to do some of these

605
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,120
functions that are just not part of

606
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,679
cognitive models in a narrow sense

607
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,240
like being able to do parameter sweeps

608
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,320
being able to specify the execution

609
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,200
orders

610
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,880
but that's a bit more on the technical

611
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,200
side of active block rinse which

612
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,440
definitely we encourage people to

613
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,600
learn more and get involved with and

614
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,520
help with

615
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,240
i'll just go to this third yes blue

616
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,240
ohio

617
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,600
yeah if i could just uh quickly follow

618
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,000
up on that on the notion of parameter

619
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,360
sweeps i think they also serve two kinds

620
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,679
of functions on the one hand

621
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,880
it's for um predictive purposes so

622
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,679
um

623
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,159
designing models and

624
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,559
of different organizational systems

625
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,880
and running multiple simulations to

626
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,520
evaluate the different consequences of

627
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,400
that system but on the on the other hand

628
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
we it can also serve an

629
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,360
explanatory purpose where by we want to

630
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,600
evaluate the state of an already

631
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,200
existing system

632
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,640
uh given

633
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,120
data on the blockchain so

634
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,960
what active

635
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,480
uh what the formalism of active

636
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,320
inference allows us to do is to take

637
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,159
data from the blockchain on the

638
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,720
different actions that different agents

639
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,440
take or actors within the system take

640
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,919
and then do a parameter sweep over their

641
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,520
beliefs to identify which set of beliefs

642
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,480
make their actions base optimal

643
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,960
and once we identify that set of beliefs

644
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,279
we can do further analysis

645
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,240
on

646
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,039
what

647
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,320
that means uh from a cognitive sense

648
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,400
in what what would that mean in

649
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,640
different different scenarios

650
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,919
and uh do this kind of more uh this

651
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,240
retrospective analysis of the system and

652
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,240
one more thing on the

653
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,799
on the voting mechanisms just to give an

654
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,240
example

655
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,080
i think there's

656
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,000
an increasing um

657
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,600
increasing uh or it is increasingly

658
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,720
mentioned that quadratic voting is

659
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,559
a more optimal

660
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,960
optimal paradigm for

661
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,440
for voting and governance in general

662
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,640
but

663
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,559
why why does it have

664
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,279
why is it quadratic why isn't there an

665
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,640
uh

666
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,600
um third exponent or fourth exponent

667
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,559
and

668
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,960
these kinds of questions i think can be

669
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,039
answered through cognitive modeling

670
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,039
where we can evaluate the trade-off

671
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,000
between

672
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,799
a

673
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,600
higher mathematical complexity where

674
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,360
the operation itself

675
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,159
uh

676
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,880
at more cognitive constraint and the

677
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,559
actual results

678
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,440
when

679
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,039
the agents act within that voting system

680
00:25:59,039 --> 00:25:59,919
so

681
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,840
um just wanted to give this

682
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,760
example of how can be used in a purely

683
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,279
non-monetary

684
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,400
governance type setting

685
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,360
nice points you laid out a lot of the

686
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,320
kind of modeling pipeline which is that

687
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,720
the blockchains themself

688
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,679
actually already contain the exact kind

689
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,640
of agent level empirical data that we

690
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,880
want and it's even structured in the way

691
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,279
that we want to take it in which is like

692
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,440
which entity which address

693
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,200
did what and then what was the

694
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,960
consequence of the action

695
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,919
so indeed that information is already on

696
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,159
chain and summarized in a way that's

697
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,360
amenable to fitting cognitive parameters

698
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,600
so the question of how to determine

699
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,919
which cognitive models are relevant is

700
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,520
it's indeed a challenge

701
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,400
but at the same time the data that is

702
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,600
input is of the right type to fit

703
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,679
various cognitive models

704
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,320
that could be useful for example some

705
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,960
hidden state that describes how somebody

706
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,039
uh how much attention somebody is paying

707
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,919
to a given given governance system as

708
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,159
overall and then also being able to sub

709
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,279
specify

710
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,520
um at a given time or changing through

711
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,400
time

712
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,440
their preferences on a variety of topics

713
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,360
and that's exactly what allows the

714
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,640
counter factual analysis or exploring

715
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,799
like alternate futures because we could

716
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,039
ask well what if people were paying more

717
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,279
attention is that an important area to

718
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,880
go or should it be

719
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,520
explored to modify not the attention

720
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,360
being paid to this issue but rather how

721
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,600
much they know about it so

722
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,120
nice um point there so for financial and

723
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,200
for non-financial systems

724
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,679
where entity level knowledge and meaning

725
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,720
making is relevant which it arguably

726
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,919
always is

727
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,760
that is an important opening for

728
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,919
cognitive modeling and this view from

729
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,320
the inside to complement the top-down

730
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,000
structural modeling

731
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,799
okay

732
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,240
um

733
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,200
i'm gonna just mention the third of the

734
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,760
points and then in the rest of the hour

735
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,919
we can hear some different questions

736
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,279
different thoughts so anyone who wants

737
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,679
to speak thanks for requesting

738
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:12,640
and

739
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,520
the uh third point

740
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,159
is that we argue that cognitive modeling

741
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,760
can complement

742
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,080
traditional computational security

743
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,399
analyses so that it's like static and

744
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,279
dynamic analysis of smart contracts

745
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,200
and those kinds of analyses can be

746
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,640
complemented

747
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,919
by

748
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,360
exploring in a test net or in a sandbox

749
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,320
setting

750
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,039
what happens when that smart contract is

751
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,919
deployed in realistic settings which is

752
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,799
to say interacting with other contracts

753
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,039
and interacting with individuals who

754
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,200
might differ in their capacities

755
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,240
preferences expectations and so on

756
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,120
so just to kind of give a example that

757
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,520
seems relevant here

758
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,480
smart contract analysis could determine

759
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,200
if there was a contract which was

760
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,399
supposed to hold funds securely and only

761
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,760
be able to take in one or two kinds of

762
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,600
tokens like a vending machine you can

763
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,480
put dollars in and then soda comes out

764
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,279
or you put soda in and dollars comes out

765
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,240
so potentially like a a liquidity pool

766
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,000
based swap

767
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,120
now

768
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,279
stand-alone analysis of that smart

769
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,840
contract could absolutely tell you

770
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,640
whether it was possible for somebody who

771
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,480
shouldn't be able to access those funds

772
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,679
was able to access those funds

773
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,480
there are also failure modes and risks

774
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,279
associated with that smart contract in

775
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,480
operation

776
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,640
that can't be said to be within the

777
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,880
smart contract rather they're in the

778
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,520
relationship of that smart contract with

779
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,520
others for example

780
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,799
other contracts or exchanges that are

781
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,679
handling that token might be engaged in

782
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,840
arbitrage relationships

783
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,240
once we think about social media and

784
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,600
information sharing that happens

785
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,399
off-came there might even be narrative

786
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,480
or news based events

787
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,320
which make it so that that smart

788
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,520
contract's ability to hold the funds

789
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,200
is great and enabling however still in

790
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,679
the realized application of the contract

791
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,159
it is functionally getting rugged as

792
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:22,960
well

793
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,279
and so these are all areas that we want

794
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:25,919
to

795
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,279
explore more

796
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,039
with the active block fence package as

797
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,880
we kind of build in these modules to

798
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,000
consider it

799
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,960
and do case study analysis but that is

800
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,480
just to

801
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,440
close

802
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,480
this

803
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,520
section of the discussion as we now open

804
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,840
up to more broader discussion and just

805
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,159
to restate that three of the key areas

806
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,279
we think

807
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,399
cognitive modeling uh can play a role in

808
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,799
web 3 are first understanding the

809
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,360
consequences of single actions by single

810
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,480
actors

811
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,600
second by expanding the scope of web 3

812
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,320
systems that we consider and design for

813
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,000
to be systems that aren't simply

814
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,760
quantitative and financial so

815
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,600
considering research education

816
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,200
governance and so on

817
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,760
and then lastly complementing

818
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,480
computational security analyses

819
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,880
with emulations and simulations

820
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,279
scenarios and counterfactuals

821
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,000
of how different aspects of cyber

822
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,880
physical systems might play out in

823
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,520
specific testable settings

824
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,880
so

825
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,080
thanks for

826
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,320
making it along this far and now we can

827
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,360
just

828
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,480
talk about whatever people would like to

829
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,440
go towards right

830
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,919
thank you so

831
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,519
one of the things that's on my mind is

832
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,000
that

833
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,799
this

834
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,320
is maybe abstracting away

835
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,440
um

836
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,120
an important

837
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,559
layer that

838
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,320
we're not really speaking about whether

839
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,600
we're doing

840
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,480
bottom up modeling or top down and that

841
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,279
is

842
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,519
you know that there are

843
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,080
miso or middle level

844
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,120
structures that are relevant

845
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,600
to cognitive

846
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,399
modeling in terms of you know

847
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,760
communities

848
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,600
cultures

849
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,519
organizations and they have an influence

850
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,120
on the mental model that a person has

851
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,559
very explicitly by just talking about

852
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,960
a wallet a wallet might belong to an

853
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,440
individual or it might belong

854
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,159
to an entity but their behaviors will

855
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,360
tend

856
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,399
to be

857
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,679
different might not even know

858
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,000
perhaps whether it is an individual or

859
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
some other sort of entity that's behind

860
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,519
a wallet

861
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,600
but i think it gets more tricky

862
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,360
to think about

863
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,960
well you know what is the environment in

864
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,720
which that entity that has the wallet

865
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,919
exists in

866
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,039
like

867
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,159
what

868
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,360
culture

869
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,519
what regulatory

870
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,640
regime like what communities are they

871
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,480
part of and i don't necessarily know how

872
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,399
that should be done but it seems like

873
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,720
that is an important part of

874
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,480
the context

875
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,480
that influences

876
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,440
the model that any agent

877
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,919
has in choosing whatever transactions

878
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,080
they make with their wallet and so

879
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,159
maybe we have to

880
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,640
think about how to address that or if

881
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,880
you have thoughts about how that should

882
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,279
work they haven't

883
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,360
thank you ray for this

884
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,320
comment

885
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,200
about the miso scale and i think there's

886
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,799
just a few points to add on that

887
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,640
structural specifications of systems

888
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,360
they identify really important system

889
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,880
level parameters

890
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,960
but then it can often be challenging to

891
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,320
add in

892
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,600
other parameters because the models are

893
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,960
composable only with macro aspects

894
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,679
so it becomes hard to compose models

895
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,239
that are taking a purely top down as

896
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,000
well as a purely bottom-up angle

897
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,480
where cognitive modeling might help us

898
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,399
explore that middle

899
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,359
is that it makes a specific distinction

900
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,239
between observed and unobserved aspects

901
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,719
of systems so hidden states are

902
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,320
unobserved states

903
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,960
the observed behavior in a blockchain

904
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,119
setting are like the transactions that

905
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,480
happen on chain

906
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,599
and then

907
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,879
you're right that there's so much

908
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,000
context that is unobserved in that one

909
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,960
data artifact that would be relevant to

910
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,440
know about and so we can think about two

911
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,239
cases where this context is either used

912
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,320
or not

913
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,239
the first case is where we actually have

914
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,320
no other context

915
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,880
in that situation we can still do

916
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,599
intentional stance modeling towards

917
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,160
unknown types of actors like we don't

918
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,480
know what is behind this address

919
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,320
but we know that they engage with this

920
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,480
kind of a pattern

921
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,480
and it's not enough just to take a

922
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,400
top-down perspective and say well this

923
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,520
many people interacted with this

924
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,680
contract or the average was two times

925
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,320
per day because that two times per day

926
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,280
might be

927
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,640
the average of

928
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,560
a small fraction that interact 100 times

929
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,000
per day and some that interact

930
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,640
infrequently so cognitive modeling first

931
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,560
would help us take an intentional and a

932
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,400
strategic stance

933
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,560
in the absence of context

934
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,320
and then

935
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,599
context as we add it in

936
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,920
can become useful so we might know that

937
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,000
multiple addresses are under the control

938
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,200
of a given team or individual or we

939
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,880
might have access to connecting

940
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,760
the social media profile of somebody who

941
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,440
puts it in their ens

942
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,480
profile

943
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,079
or page

944
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,040
that

945
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,320
could be composable at the agent level

946
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,760
and uh

947
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,520
i don't think that's an answer at all so

948
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,160
open to whatever else people add

949
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,040
um

950
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,160
because the meso is where the complexity

951
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,440
is

952
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,680
and we would just

953
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,359
expect and prefer

954
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,320
that the composability of specifying

955
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,400
different kinds of entities not just on

956
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,720
chain entities but also teams

957
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,720
organizations and so on

958
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,240
that that will

959
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,280
enable these kinds of models to do

960
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,760
exploration and parameter sweeps in that

961
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,480
exact space you described

962
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,880
thank you

963
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,839
i would maybe also add to that

964
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,680
that as

965
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,640
the

966
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,640
toolbox itself

967
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,359
uh gets expanded and different

968
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:54,560
um

969
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,119
different computational models um are

970
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,000
added

971
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,599
i think it's

972
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,520
the

973
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,079
the case where we want to distinguish

974
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,280
between an actor that's actually

975
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,200
a single single human versus a team of

976
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,760
people controlling a multi multi-sig

977
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,320
should technically be reflected

978
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,800
in the underlying data to some uh to

979
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,280
some extent say if uh if for instance

980
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,839
you want to analyze um

981
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,440
you want to use cognitive modeling to

982
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,040
analyze a certain dow and you have a

983
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,400
list of all the different addresses

984
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,599
as you

985
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,560
perform this kind of multi-agent

986
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,280
model or even try to

987
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,560
fit the

988
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,040
the belief states of each of the wallets

989
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,000
given

990
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,480
given the prior data

991
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,880
it should become evident that certain

992
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,839
that certain wallets perhaps are

993
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,359
operating at slightly different time

994
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,119
scales or

995
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,640
um

996
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,920
or are

997
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,400
or are maintained are uh are updating

998
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,240
their beliefs at uh

999
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,400
again at different time scales or in a

1000
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,760
slightly different way than the other

1001
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,640
agents and they're and then we might

1002
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,880
also do some cross-correlation between

1003
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,240
the belief states of the individual

1004
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,640
actors about which we perhaps know that

1005
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,480
they are individual actors

1006
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,960
and the agents that we are not sure

1007
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,240
whether they

1008
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,400
represent a single uh

1009
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,119
entity or a group of people

1010
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,440
uh so i think

1011
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,880
that

1012
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,400
a lot of it might

1013
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,520
already implicitly be available

1014
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,880
uh within within the current toolbox but

1015
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,119
as we add more algorithms that do more

1016
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,240
efficient

1017
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,880
uh computations and

1018
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,680
different schemes of performing uh

1019
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,400
belief updates and

1020
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,079
the leaf search

1021
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,359
i think

1022
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,680
that's a very interesting

1023
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,799
area to explore as well

1024
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,040
thanks jacob brock

1025
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,920
you want to add anything

1026
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,119
um yeah i think jacob's point here about

1027
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,720
you know having

1028
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,720
some

1029
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,119
verified data

1030
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,960
sources

1031
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,040
and having these kinds of generalities

1032
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,640
about how

1033
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,320
one kind of data source looks like for

1034
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,040
one kind of agent versus another kind

1035
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,880
it's you know

1036
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,520
more of an organization or a syndicate

1037
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,480
or some some other kind of non-singular

1038
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,520
individual

1039
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,280
um is

1040
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,320
uh

1041
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,480
correct um

1042
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,640
and i think that this idea of you know

1043
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,880
the meso scale

1044
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,960
being missed generally speaking and

1045
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,440
modeling is also correct

1046
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,240
um

1047
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,040
but i and i i think that

1048
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,680
cognitive modeling in general

1049
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,280
affords

1050
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,880
partially i guess a solution to really

1051
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,800
this meso both of these problems are

1052
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,640
really related to like the oracle

1053
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,520
problem

1054
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,200
of just where does data come from and

1055
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,480
who you trust and all this sort of stuff

1056
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,520
um

1057
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,520
because even if you get this culture

1058
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,280
data it's like

1059
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,040
you know what's what's in the water

1060
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,119
what's in the food what's

1061
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,440
this business doing with

1062
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,960
you know what are the externalities of

1063
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,880
this process or whatever yeah there's a

1064
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,800
lot of still

1065
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,560
unknown data and the only way

1066
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,320
that we currently have to kind of

1067
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,760
model that

1068
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,359
effectively

1069
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,160
is with essentially a cognitive sort of

1070
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,680
model that um like you mentioned daniel

1071
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,560
has this distinction between

1072
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,880
observed and unobserved or hidden states

1073
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,320
and

1074
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,359
um

1075
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:48,800
you know known

1076
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,040
uh states to the system and so um

1077
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,320
it's never

1078
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,359
i guess to frame it it's it's like

1079
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,640
security is this cat and mouse game

1080
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,400
really we're in this now in this

1081
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,960
cognitive security cat and mouse game

1082
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,400
and we're just going to go further into

1083
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,520
that but

1084
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,640
you know

1085
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,760
is a

1086
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,760
large corporation or

1087
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,400
whatever some some syndicate whatever

1088
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,920
trying to

1089
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,839
maybe obscure their

1090
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:18,800
you know

1091
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,319
behavior on chain like

1092
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,040
so that they're harder to

1093
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,119
predict for some reason

1094
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,160
um

1095
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,560
probably things like that will

1096
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,960
they already occur in the political

1097
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,520
context today

1098
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,599
i'm sure that it will continue and

1099
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,640
decentralize in that fashion and so

1100
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,839
it will

1101
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,400
just be

1102
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,920
a

1103
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,079
baseline this will just be table stakes

1104
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,720
to do cognitive modeling to have any

1105
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,160
kind of grip

1106
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,839
on something like prediction or

1107
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,000
discernibility of of these kinds of

1108
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
systems

1109
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,240
nice very

1110
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,680
interesting

1111
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,310
so in the last 10 minutes we can

1112
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,520
[Music]

1113
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,400
have any speakers join or people can ask

1114
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,079
questions

1115
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,920
this is happening during the ongoing

1116
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,960
git coin funding round gr15

1117
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,079
and

1118
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,520
we have a

1119
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,839
grant in for this project which is

1120
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,920
supportable as well as many other

1121
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,960
awesome

1122
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,920
public goods and produce projects that

1123
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,240
people can check out

1124
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,839
and

1125
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,319
on the grant page you'll see some

1126
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,640
recent discussions we've had with

1127
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,280
cadcad community and with the smart

1128
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,160
contract research forum where we talked

1129
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,280
about a few

1130
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,520
different ongoing steps

1131
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,160
the current status of the package is

1132
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,000
that it's it's available it's an open

1133
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,359
source package

1134
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,040
and it is framed as notebooks primarily

1135
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,480
made by jakob

1136
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,280
that are like the perception cognition

1137
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,480
and action

1138
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,839
of an entity in an abstract grid space

1139
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,720
which sounds and basically is

1140
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,480
general and abstract

1141
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,520
so some of our next steps are to bring

1142
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,119
that machinery

1143
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,560
and that approach

1144
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,760
to

1145
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,160
take in the kinds of empirical data that

1146
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,560
are relevant for blockchain systems

1147
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,800
so that's one key area

1148
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,200
as well as well as um improving the

1149
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,839
functionality of the package through

1150
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,440
various means like

1151
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,000
improved ability to visualize

1152
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,920
outcomes of models to specify models and

1153
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,440
sweep across them

1154
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,480
to have documentation and other

1155
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,560
integrations that will just make it a

1156
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,920
better package and more useful

1157
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,160
um

1158
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,640
i guess in the last 10 minutes there's a

1159
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,800
few other ways to go but i'll pause if

1160
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,560
anyone has any thoughts or questions

1161
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,480
the point i wanted to add in and then

1162
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,280
again

1163
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,520
anyone can feel free to add is that

1164
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,560
using active inference as a scale-free

1165
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,720
or skill-friendly framework as we

1166
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,160
sometimes say

1167
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,640
in advantage of it is that we can talk

1168
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,520
about

1169
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,920
perception cognition and action

1170
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,640
for different entities this is not

1171
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,760
creating a little brain for individuals

1172
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,520
only people

1173
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,720
this is about being able to look at how

1174
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,359
decisions are enacted

1175
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,560
in different kinds of organizations

1176
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,640
and those organizations could be

1177
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,520
cellular biological organizations like

1178
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,560
humans

1179
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,599
or it could be organizations

1180
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,920
that you suspect something complex is

1181
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,079
happening within but you're only seeing

1182
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,640
the tip of the iceberg on chain

1183
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,800
or it could be organizations that are

1184
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,480
entirely on chain

1185
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,760
and so that's one of the reasons why

1186
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,680
it's important to have

1187
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,640
a really flexible modeling framework

1188
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,560
like active inference for cognitive

1189
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,359
systems because it's not bound to for

1190
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,560
example only human emotions and sensory

1191
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,200
processing it enables us to describe a

1192
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,240
wide variety of systems in a cognitive

1193
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,560
fashion which is what we've explored in

1194
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,720
our eos work

1195
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,760
active entity ontology for science

1196
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,200
so that is where we see active inference

1197
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,040
as a leading cognitive modeling

1198
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,079
framework

1199
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,480
and natural fit for this cyber physical

1200
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,520
space

1201
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,560
and then the other pillar of the active

1202
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,480
block furnace project other than active

1203
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,680
inference is cad cad which was mentioned

1204
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,240
earlier and cad cad

1205
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,000
has been used in a wide range of token

1206
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,240
modeling and engineering settings

1207
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,800
you can see actually their

1208
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,760
ethereum validator models which have

1209
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,640
been publicly available for uh several

1210
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,319
years i don't know the exact date but

1211
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:07,359
the um

1212
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,760
work on cad cad modeling

1213
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,160
of the f proof of stake

1214
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,280
transition

1215
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,040
has been in the works for a really long

1216
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,640
time and that kind of gives a

1217
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,640
a taste of

1218
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,000
from the outside

1219
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,520
speaking personally

1220
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,319
of what it looks like to use

1221
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,640
formal system models

1222
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,520
over long time scales

1223
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,079
to strategize and de-risk

1224
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,119
really complex decisions that groups and

1225
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,119
individuals make

1226
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,160
and

1227
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,960
that is still at the structural level

1228
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,680
so it's one thing to be able to scan

1229
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,040
across different

1230
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,240
validator reward systems or percentages

1231
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,240
and ask what would happen

1232
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,359
if a certain parameter is set to three

1233
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:56,800
or two or one

1234
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,720
again it's quite a different thing to

1235
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,920
ask how

1236
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,079
entities with different attentions and

1237
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:03,359
preferences

1238
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,359
will make certain decisions

1239
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,599
and so it'd be like the equivalent of a

1240
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,160
macroeconomic change being induced like

1241
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,079
we raised the interest rate by one

1242
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,200
percent

1243
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,920
our macroeconomic curve intersection

1244
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,640
models show that that should increase

1245
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,880
consumer spending by this much

1246
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,680
but

1247
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,680
that consumer spending even if it is an

1248
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,680
accurate prediction from the structural

1249
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,800
modeling

1250
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,839
it is enacted by individuals making

1251
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,040
decisions

1252
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,960
in response to those common system

1253
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,240
parameters

1254
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,040
so that highlights that the agentic

1255
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,440
perspective is complementary to the

1256
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,079
systems and the structural description

1257
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,839
but we really think that it's going to

1258
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:46,400
bring a level of depth

1259
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,640
and also new challenges because the

1260
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,960
state space of all cognitive parameters

1261
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,920
and how they interact is truly vast

1262
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,880
so it will not be necessarily the the

1263
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,200
shortest or simplest road

1264
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,359
but we think it's going to be one of the

1265
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:02,640
most meaningful

1266
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,760
because it's going to bring new function

1267
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,520
to

1268
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,839
different web 3 ecosystems and

1269
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,359
subsystems

1270
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,760
that otherwise would have totally

1271
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,599
incommensurate models

1272
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,599
the d5 models are not going to apply to

1273
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,680
dow decision making and those are not

1274
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,720
going to apply to science and how that

1275
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,280
works and having some kind of an

1276
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,119
interoperable layer

1277
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,480
for what entities are doing what

1278
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,640
is going to be

1279
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,040
enabling really rich modeling of web 3

1280
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,480
ecosystems

1281
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,960
now can web 3 survive without cognitive

1282
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,880
modeling

1283
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,319
i don't know we could vote

1284
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,760
but we we provocatively raised the

1285
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,720
question i think um jakob and brock and

1286
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,000
others in some meetings with with this

1287
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,440
framing because

1288
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,520
we we do want to

1289
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,480
suggest or at least raise

1290
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,400
this notion

1291
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,240
that no amount

1292
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,839
of top level systems engineering

1293
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,240
unless it's complemented by a bottom-up

1294
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,440
perspective on what are the capacities

1295
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,960
attentions preferences and so on of

1296
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,800
entities in this world

1297
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,880
the embodied natural ones as well as

1298
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,359
like computational artifacts you know a

1299
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:26,079
runaway decision making ai with a

1300
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:27,760
trading balance

1301
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,480
all these kinds of systems that we have

1302
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,160
to model including systems that we don't

1303
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,040
even know what type they are necessarily

1304
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,079
we need

1305
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,880
interoperable and expressive ways to

1306
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,040
describe those systems so that's why we

1307
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,079
think that

1308
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,000
web3 with cognitive modeling can survive

1309
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,839
and without we just don't know

1310
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,240
i have another question

1311
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,960
i think it relates

1312
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,160
fundamentally to potential biases in a

1313
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,079
model given

1314
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,760
data availability

1315
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,040
so

1316
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,280
um it's very clear always what data is

1317
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,359
available like what transactions are on

1318
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:10,880
chain or what

1319
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,640
prices are

1320
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,000
paid

1321
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,319
in market for securities or commodity

1322
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,079
what have you but

1323
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,920
there is actually a lot that occurs

1324
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,960
in

1325
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,920
society which is not necessarily

1326
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,240
a market type

1327
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,839
activity with with hard data associated

1328
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:36,160
with it and

1329
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,760
how does

1330
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,680
a cognitive

1331
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,119
model

1332
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,440
account for the fact that that many

1333
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,920
things are missed and that we we simply

1334
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,920
overlook

1335
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,960
many aspects of things that for instance

1336
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,960
might be called the the gift economy

1337
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,440
where people just informally

1338
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,240
do things for each other and it's

1339
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,680
not really

1340
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,160
recorded anywhere i mean it is truly

1341
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,839
part of the representation of our

1342
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:06,480
individual cognitive models for how we

1343
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,640
exist in the world but where is this

1344
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,920
going to make it into any model that we

1345
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,400
try to do

1346
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,000
it's a great

1347
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,160
question and it's a thread i hope we

1348
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,640
keep alive even beyond this space ending

1349
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,559
in a few minutes so no answer we'll do

1350
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,960
it justice but i'll give some thoughts

1351
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,800
one is the difference between

1352
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,440
observables in our model empirical data

1353
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,880
that we're reading in

1354
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,520
and unobservables which are considered

1355
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,920
factors but not necessarily ones where

1356
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,319
we have data points either because we

1357
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:40,000
just haven't added those data points in

1358
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,440
or maybe they don't even exist in

1359
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,880
principle so

1360
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,800
various kinds of features can be

1361
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,760
observed and various can't be so it's

1362
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,280
important to have a framework that deals

1363
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,680
with both and then the second point is

1364
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,400
that it may be possible for some kind of

1365
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,440
like out in the open models to use some

1366
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,760
kinds of totally out in the open data

1367
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,359
but then let's just say that within the

1368
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:04,640
context of a given community of care

1369
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,040
people consented to having their

1370
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,200
information

1371
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,599
digested or summarized

1372
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,800
and used to augment a community-specific

1373
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,760
model

1374
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,680
so the provenance and the um

1375
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,760
use of that data

1376
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,920
that would be potentially speaking to

1377
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,440
these more authentic inorganic social

1378
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,040
interactions

1379
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,040
those kinds of data

1380
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,160
could be grafted or fused

1381
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,400
with more open source

1382
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,359
templates dealing with open data

1383
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,160
so there'd be a lot of opportunity for

1384
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,920
model templates

1385
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,559
and some precomputed public goods type

1386
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:47,839
data sets

1387
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:49,760
to then be enriched

1388
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,200
on the edges

1389
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,640
by different communities that we're

1390
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,200
going to be bringing in specific

1391
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,919
data types

1392
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,720
and the the path has been in a way

1393
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,119
blazed forward by cad cad

1394
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,359
where the package is open source

1395
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:08,000
and many of their models are open source

1396
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,200
yet

1397
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,520
they're also able to engage with clients

1398
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,200
in a consulting capacity using

1399
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,359
models that are not fully open source

1400
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,760
probably or data sets that aren't fully

1401
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,960
available

1402
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,200
so it's one reason why we

1403
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,960
are uh

1404
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,480
strongly open source with the package

1405
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,559
while also recognizing that a lot of the

1406
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,800
last mile use cases might bring in data

1407
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,640
that isn't strictly open source in the

1408
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,920
same way that this code should be

1409
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,880
okay well

1410
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,960
thanks for listening everyone

1411
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,599
please uh head over to

1412
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,400
i guess our twitter profile to learn

1413
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,280
more

1414
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,200
about our ongoing bitcoin grant

1415
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,319
you
