10
00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:09,442
KNIGHT: And I'm ready.

20
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:12,779
FRIEDMAN: Okay.

30
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,750
Hope that this is working well.

40
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,451
And I guess this is where we can begin

50
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,020
the conversation.

60
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,955
This is a Twitter spaces.

70
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:24,924
On September 14th, 2022,

80
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:26,893
it is called

90
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:28,194
"Can Web3 Survive

100
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,030
Without Cognitive Modeling?"

110
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,297
And I know there's something they say

120
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:32,432
about headlines

130
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:33,466
that end in a question

140
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:34,801
mark, something like always

150
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:37,003
they're yes answers or no answers or...

160
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:40,940
In this conversation, we're going to be

170
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,409
talking about Web3

180
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,177
and about cognitive modeling.

190
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:47,013
FRIEDMAN: And it will be less than an hour long,

200
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:48,715
hopefully will serve

210
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,416
as a nice

220
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,518
introduction to those who have

230
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,453
little or some familiarity

240
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:54,154
with Web3

250
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:54,754
and cognitive

260
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:56,823
modeling alone or together.

270
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,892
But it's also meant to be kind

280
00:00:58,892 --> 00:00:59,726
of a broad

290
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,127
ranging discussion,

300
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,462
and hopefully we'll have

310
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,663
some other voices

320
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,732
come up and add in some

330
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,733
thoughts and questions.

340
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:08,535
Let's start

350
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,904
with just a description of Web 3.

360
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:12,906
Surely elsewhere

370
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,541
you'll be able to find

380
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,509
audio and other kinds of content

390
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,011
describing Web3.

400
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,746
So I'll just describe

410
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,815
what's relevant about it as we

420
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,384
talk about cognitive modeling

430
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:25,285
Web3.

440
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,720
Web3 is an ongoing movements

450
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,255
that is applying blockchain

460
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:29,823
and other

470
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,224
distributed technologies

480
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,626
to a wide ranging areas.

490
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,096
And we can think of Web3

500
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,064
as creating critical infrastructure

510
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:41,101
either of the public goods type, or not

520
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,702
necessarily public goods

530
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:45,405
in a wide range of areas.

540
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,040
FRIEDMAN: So in finance,

550
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,043
there's decentralized finance or DEFI,

560
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,947
FRIEDMAN: and DEFI requires the engineering

570
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,949
of token schemes,

580
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:56,583
which is sometimes

590
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,718
called "token engineering" or "tokenomics,"

600
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,654
such that those token-based systems

610
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,990
are able to be designed

620
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,159
effectively and operate effectively.

630
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:06,993
And there's a lot of other

640
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:09,129
areas outside of the financial

650
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,964
that are important for Web3,

660
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,066
for example, community governance

670
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,667
and matter governance,

680
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:15,802
like what people may have heard

690
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,036
about daos

700
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,405
decentralized autonomous organizations,

710
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,174
as well as all other kinds

720
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,976
of organizations

730
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,645
and of particular interest for

740
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:26,980
our institute

750
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,014
and for many others

760
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,617
is decentralized science or design,

770
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:34,220
and in many ways deci will succeed

780
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:38,024
if it can have a balanced and coherence

790
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,192
approach

800
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:42,295
to tackle all the challenges that face

810
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:43,863
the research and education

820
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,665
stack ranging from the who,

830
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,734
what, why, where, when, etc..

840
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:49,903
Our question

850
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,871
that we'll return to is

860
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,107
how can any of these areas

870
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,475
finance, community

880
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,310
research, science and education?

890
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,546
How can any of these areas

900
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,080
be successfully navigated

910
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,015
or designed for

920
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,284
without taking agents into account?

930
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,753
So this is very related

940
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,521
to agent based modeling.

950
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,191
And we're going to explore how there are

960
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,192
several approaches

970
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,494
to modeling these complex systems.

980
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,696
FRIEDMAN: And we're going to suggest that

990
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,164
complementing

1000
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,299
top down structural

1010
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,034
FRIEDMAN: modeling of these systems,

1020
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,402
there's a really important role

1030
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,436
for Agent IC

1040
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,471
or what we can consider cognitive

1050
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,407
modeling of the actors

1060
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,342
in these systems themselves.

1070
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,610
And we believe that without this

1080
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,645
kind of like a bottom up,

1090
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,981
individual driven account

1100
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:38,251
taking conceptually

1110
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,086
into the design process,

1120
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,854
but also more formally

1130
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:44,657
into the specification and evaluation

1140
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,159
of these critical infrastructure

1150
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,160
or systems

1160
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,494
that there are going to be

1170
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:50,663
a lot of blind spots

1180
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:51,998
and a lot of failure modes

1190
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,933
that just simply will not be addressed

1200
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,868
by the structural analysis alone.

1210
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:58,638
FRIEDMAN: Bleu Want to

1220
00:03:58,638 --> 00:03:59,505
add on that

1230
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:02,609
we can continue talking about this.

1240
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,410
KNIGHT: Also, I can say a couple of things.

1250
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,979
So I think

1260
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:06,779
agent based

1270
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:10,316
modeling is a super useful approach

1280
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,486
when you are getting into systems

1290
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,622
that are multi-agent,

1300
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,291
that are maybe predictive

1310
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,260
of any kind of outcome.

1320
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,794
So like if this,

1330
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:22,562
then that, like

1340
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,864
how many agents does it take to defect

1350
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:27,834
for a system to fail?

1360
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,737
Like, you know, if if

1370
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,372
everybody unloads their nifty

1380
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,741
all at once, then the system collapses.

1390
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,843
KNIGHT: So so it's these kinds of things.

1400
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,112
And what is the cognitive

1410
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,247
underpinnings?

1420
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,015
KNIGHT: What are the cognitive

1430
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,317
underpinnings of the decision

1440
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,052
making in an agent?

1450
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:46,819
Because everybody's

1460
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,255
influenced by a variety of factors,

1470
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,557
personal and environmental.

1480
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,559
So agents can start off

1490
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,994
with like more of a

1500
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:57,063
of a different disposition,

1510
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,132
like than others,

1520
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,133
which is how we are

1530
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,601
in the real world and

1540
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:03,202
can have

1550
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,771
different reactions

1560
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,572
to environments with this.

1570
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,274
KNIGHT: And I think that that's all I'll say

1580
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:09,108
about that.

1590
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,611
FRIEDMAN: Great point.

1600
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:12,145
Agent based

1610
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,880
KNIGHT: modeling is really helpful

1620
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,349
for telling factual analysis

1630
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:17,817
because we can ask, well, what?

1640
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,618
What would be different

1650
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,253
if we had this many

1660
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:20,820
instead of that

1670
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,355
many of this kind of entity,

1680
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,356
or if they could do this

1690
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,558
instead of that,

1700
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:26,025
going back

1710
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,261
to the critical infrastructure

1720
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,996
and the need to design them

1730
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:30,596
reliably

1740
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:31,798
and also de-risk

1750
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,333
against a variety of failure

1760
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,736
modes, have three has some failure modes

1770
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:37,870
and threat services

1780
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,105
that are very similar

1790
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,940
to what is seen in

1800
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,708
Web two

1810
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,310
and just other technological areas.

1820
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,846
FRIEDMAN: And there's also some unique

1830
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,649
and partially modeled scenarios

1840
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:50,883
FRIEDMAN: in Web3

1850
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,118
relating to blockchain

1860
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:52,752
and distributed

1870
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,021
technologies specifically.

1880
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,189
And a lot of the complexity

1890
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:56,522
has come

1900
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,991
from the nested scales of decision

1910
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,360
making and modeling

1920
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,362
that come into play in Web3.

1930
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,097
So just speaking coarsely,

1940
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,366
there are decisions and discourse

1950
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,867
at the level of layer

1960
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,837
one chains themselves like blockchains

1970
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,572
or among blockchains

1980
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,508
as we're observing in this current day

1990
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,211
around the Ethereum changes

2000
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,346
that are happening known as the merge,

2010
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,782
but even within a layer, one chain,

2020
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,650
there are multiple tokens

2030
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,952
and other kinds of entities

2040
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:26,919
on that chain

2050
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,187
and different communities

2060
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:29,355
that might be using the same

2070
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,524
or different tokens or their own tokens

2080
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,092
and teams and projects

2090
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,927
that might be on chain or off chain.

2100
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,229
So there's a lot of interacting

2110
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,131
FRIEDMAN: in nested layers of analysis.

2120
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,700
So considering how different effects

2130
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,703
greetings, yogurt, how different effects

2140
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,037
of different actors,

2150
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:45,471
partly

2160
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:45,872
through that

2170
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:46,906
kind of a complex

2180
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,108
system is a key question.

2190
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,712
And we can talk about a few difference

2200
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,282
judgment, but I make you

2210
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,851
if I get to speak, we can talk about

2220
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,353
a few different modeling

2230
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,522
paradigms and approaches

2240
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,590
and talk about what is state of the art

2250
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,591
and used wisely,

2260
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,727
widely and wisely today,

2270
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,061
and then how cognitive

2280
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,163
modeling specifically

2290
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,497
might be complementary

2300
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,599
and empowering those methods.

2310
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,169
FRIEDMAN: So just speaking broadly,

2320
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,403
I'm going to mention smart

2330
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,905
contract auditing

2340
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,274
and then top down structural approaches.

2350
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,842
And then lastly, bottom up

2360
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:23,943
agent approaches,

2370
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:24,811
which is the cognitive

2380
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,312
modeling approach.

2390
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:26,779
So first,

2400
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,381
just speaking to smart

2410
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,116
contract auditing,

2420
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,351
smart contracts are familiar

2430
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,420
in financial areas

2440
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,255
and in kind of on chain

2450
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,257
DEFI applications,

2460
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,392
although smart contracts

2470
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,160
also underlie technologies

2480
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,061
like DAO

2490
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:42,895
design

2500
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,197
and citations,

2510
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,998
identity, intellectual property,

2520
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:48,534
all kinds of aspects of society

2530
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:49,502
and culture

2540
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,637
may be occurring through broadly

2550
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,940
what are known as smart contracts.

2560
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,008
FRIEDMAN: And the computational details

2570
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,945
of smart contracts can be audited

2580
00:07:59,178 --> 00:07:59,979
along the lines

2590
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,848
of security audits for other kinds

2600
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,516
of computational programs.

2610
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:04,250
For example,

2620
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:04,650
a Hacker

2630
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,419
Noon article describes

2640
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,521
that smart contract auditing identifies

2650
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:09,922
any errors in the code

2660
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,557
and ensures that the code is safe

2670
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,659
to use when transferring funds.

2680
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,828
And so that kind of smart contract

2690
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,231
auditing is able to assess

2700
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,699
whether, for example,

2710
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,501
a given reservoir of funds

2720
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,502
can be extracted

2730
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,906
by an unauthorized user.

2740
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,875
FRIEDMAN: That is absolutely valuable.

2750
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,909
And we're not suggesting

2760
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,811
that cognitive modeling replaces that.

2770
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,380
We have two modes

2780
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,883
of systems modeling beyond simple,

2790
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,251
smart contract auditing

2800
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,085
that are relevant,

2810
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,520
and that's the top down

2820
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,387
structural modeling

2830
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:42,188
and the bottom up

2840
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,323
modeling, perhaps, Jakub,

2850
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,292
you could describe

2860
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,728
top down and bottom up approaches to

2870
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,297
modeling here.

2880
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,899
JAKUB: Yeah, sure.

2890
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,635
By the way, I'm on my phone right now

2900
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,904
because I

2910
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,438
am just walking

2920
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:00,907
in the middle of the city.

2930
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,042
So if the background noise is too loud,

2940
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,343
just let me know.

2950
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:04,577
Yeah.

2960
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,144
On the

2970
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,145
on the top down versus

2980
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,346
bottom up approach.

2990
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,081
I think the main,

3000
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,350
main, I guess

3010
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,619
in classical cat kinds of modeling,

3020
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,757
the one of the main approaches is to

3030
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,826
identify the structure of the

3040
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,328
of the system that's being studied.

3050
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,563
JAKUB: In this case, it could be

3060
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,233
a decentralized protocol that

3070
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:29,969
enforces certain behaviors

3080
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,837
by smart contracts.

3090
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,941
And then this kind of

3100
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,878
top down structural modeling is

3110
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,249
amateur sweeps,

3120
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,483
where we try to identify

3130
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,218
all the different

3140
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,388
all the different states

3150
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,057
that the system can reach.

3160
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,692
And but that doesn't

3170
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:53,593
really tell us anything

3180
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,827
about what

3190
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,963
state this system will actually reach.

3200
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,497
JAKUB: And how it performs

3210
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,900
from the perspective of its users.

3220
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,369
So the bottom up cognitive

3230
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,007
suite,

3240
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:13,846
but on the.

3250
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:14,513
FRIEDMAN: Okay, yeah,

3260
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:17,283
I'll give your audience a little bit.

3270
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,017
JAKUB: About

3280
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,453
more rigorous cognitive analysis

3290
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,088
from the perspective of the

3300
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,958
of the participants within that system.

3310
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,861
So the idea behind active

3320
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,396
blockchains is to kind of balance

3330
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,797
these two approaches

3340
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,234
and to take insights from

3350
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,202
from both.

3360
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,271
I hope that provides a brief overview.

3370
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,207
FRIEDMAN: Yep. Thank you.

3380
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,142
I'll just kind of summarize that

3390
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:43,476
because there's

3400
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,244
a little bit of cutting in and out,

3410
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,278
but the top down

3420
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,314
in the structural approach to modeling,

3430
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,349
which is commonly used in

3440
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:53,085
tokenomics suites like card code

3450
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,354
that was mentioned by Jakub,

3460
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,522
it describes system

3470
00:10:56,522 --> 00:11:00,493
states like the yield return percentage

3480
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,728
on some kind of a smart contract

3490
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,697
and other system parameters.

3500
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:05,398
FRIEDMAN: And then

3510
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,432
it specifies

3520
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,533
the state spaces

3530
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,602
which those parameters can exist in.

3540
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:10,302
And these tools

3550
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,303
also enable

3560
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,204
FRIEDMAN: parameter sweeping

3570
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,206
across those system parameters.

3580
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,742
And that's like a macroeconomic analysis

3590
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,010
that can be

3600
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:18,778
said to be

3610
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,980
taking like a population level

3620
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:22,581
approach

3630
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,150
to modeling the behaviors

3640
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,618
of these complex systems.

3650
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,219
So that would be equivalent

3660
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:30,122
to like modeling a macroeconomic sector

3670
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,191
with systems of equations

3680
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,293
and then exploring how those equations

3690
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,761
influence each other.

3700
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,263
FRIEDMAN: And in contrast,

3710
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,932
there is a bottom up agent approach

3720
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,401
which entails a cognitive model

3730
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,769
FRIEDMAN: of the agents,

3740
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,172
because the cognitive model is

3750
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,641
which we're using in the active

3760
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,744
inference sense of the generative model

3770
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,379
that provides that agent

3780
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,380
with the ability

3790
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,482
to engage in perception,

3800
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,184
cognition and action,

3810
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,186
where cognition is describing

3820
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:03,956
various functionalities like memory,

3830
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,191
preference and action

3840
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,860
selection, anticipation and so on.

3850
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,663
FRIEDMAN: So we've been thinking about

3860
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:11,430
this angle

3870
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,300
of cognitive modeling in Web3 a lot

3880
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,103
because our project, Active

3890
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,270
BLOCK Friends

3900
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,872
is an open source package

3910
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,941
that is explicitly addressing

3920
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,310
and trying to enable this kind

3930
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,679
of cognitive modeling in web3.

3940
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,016
And we're going to have

3950
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,552
a bunch of time to discuss

3960
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,589
aspects of where cognitive modeling

3970
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,390
could apply in Web3.

3980
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,426
And I'm going to highlight

3990
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,462
three areas,

4000
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,030
but we'll discuss them one by one.

4010
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,631
FRIEDMAN: And also,

4020
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,833
FRIEDMAN: if anyone listening wants to join,

4030
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:51,470
they can absolutely feel welcome

4040
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,340
and there's going to be three areas

4050
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,575
or points of contact to explore.

4060
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,578
So this should be pretty fun and Bleu

4070
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,079
and Yaacov

4080
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:00,946
after each one of them,

4090
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:01,914
like, Please

4100
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,048
feel free to share

4110
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,550
how you see it playing out or what

4120
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,851
you think is useful about it.

4130
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,854
FRIEDMAN: So here's reason one for why

4140
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,022
we will argue that

4150
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,924
Web3 needs cognitive model

4160
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,460
is that we need to understand

4170
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,795
the consequences

4180
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,363
of single actions

4190
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,466
taken by single actors.

4200
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,234
There are also singular

4210
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,970
events that happen at the system level

4220
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,840
that we might want to model, like rare

4230
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,508
or really important

4240
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,811
cascade type events like a flipping,

4250
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,480
and that might be able to be modeled

4260
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,615
or detected or designed around

4270
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,751
using top down structural approaches.

4280
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,353
FRIEDMAN: Again, thinking about macroeconomics,

4290
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,321
one could imagine

4300
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,490
they have some dynamical equations

4310
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,358
describing different currencies,

4320
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,993
and then they could identify

4330
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,195
like a change point

4340
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,096
when one currency flipped another.

4350
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,832
That's the flipping.

4360
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,702
We're also interested in the potentially

4370
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,171
cascading consequences

4380
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,241
of single actions by single actors.

4390
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,744
So this one specific transaction

4400
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,314
that this one address sends to this one

4410
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,817
smart contract is possibly able

4420
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,485
to induce

4430
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,287
widespread consequences

4440
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,122
for the whole system

4450
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:20,292
and that level of atomic granularity

4460
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,494
in terms of which entity did

4470
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:23,662
which affordances,

4480
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,799
which action towards which entity

4490
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,301
and then understanding the consequences

4500
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:30,402
of that action.

4510
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,071
FRIEDMAN: At that granularity,

4520
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,373
it simply is inexpressible

4530
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,641
FRIEDMAN: within the structural

4540
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,843
or top down mode of modeling,

4550
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,980
which really can be said to abstract

4560
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,949
over individual entities and actions.

4570
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,820
So we're not denying that the structure

4580
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,357
or the top down can provide an immensely

4590
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,526
course grained, useful representation

4600
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:55,561
of systems

4610
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,063
during design and implementation,

4620
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:58,998
but also

4630
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,966
we in this first point argue

4640
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,102
that Web3 needs cognitive modeling

4650
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,004
because we do want to model

4660
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:05,804
and understand

4670
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,539
the consequences of single actions

4680
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,540
that single actors take

4690
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,843
blue or.

4700
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:16,148
KNIGHT: Gold walk up.

4710
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:16,348
If we

4720
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:17,583
have anything there,

4730
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,051
I will defect and wait

4740
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,719
until we talk about multi-agent systems.

4750
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,955
I think. Yeah.

4760
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:23,589
JAKUB: Yeah.

4770
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,790
JAKUB: I think

4780
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,560
I might add that

4790
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,664
also there's also a lot of

4800
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,832
interesting overlap with

4810
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,336
the work on

4820
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,738
computational psychiatry or

4830
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:41,907
other

4840
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,811
kind of psychology oriented

4850
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,247
models in the sense that this

4860
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:49,815
by analyzing,

4870
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:52,051
by analyzing the cognitive states

4880
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,852
of agents

4890
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:56,288
and

4900
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,693
things like how

4910
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,329
well what are their levels of curiosity

4920
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:06,031
within within, within a system, or

4930
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,401
is it is a

4940
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:13,138
is the distribution of beliefs

4950
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:16,475
more skewed towards

4960
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:22,081
higher levels of uncertainty or.

4970
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,849
FRIEDMAN: Okay, I'll give you your all details

4980
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,551
so it's not too good.

4990
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:25,818
Yeah.

5000
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:29,054
So yeah, but let me try to pick up

5010
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,322
with what you mentioned

5020
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,791
about computational literature, though.

5030
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,794
So a top down structural analysis

5040
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,430
of computational psychiatry

5050
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,765
might be able to say

5060
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,134
10% of such and such group

5070
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:46,338
have this condition, and of them, then

5080
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,973
1% go on to do this,

5090
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,075
and 1% of that goes on to be this way.

5100
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,510
FRIEDMAN: And so one could

5110
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,478
develop estimates

5120
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,312
like per

5130
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,747
thousand people

5140
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,715
FRIEDMAN: with this characteristic.

5150
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,751
We can expect these outcomes

5160
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,452
as a health care system

5170
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:03,088
or as an educational system.

5180
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,491
But again, the level of expressivity

5190
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,492
or granularity

5200
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,494
to describe measurements

5210
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,662
coming from a given individual

5220
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,197
like self-report

5230
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,232
or measurements

5240
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,467
made of their brain and their body,

5250
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,435
these kinds of measurements

5260
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,003
just don't have a place

5270
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:20,172
in structural, top down modeling.

5280
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,608
FRIEDMAN: So it may be absolutely useful

5290
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,376
to take this macroeconomic

5300
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,477
structural top down

5310
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,545
perspective,

5320
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,680
to have population level descriptors.

5330
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:30,649
However,

5340
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:31,083
the view

5350
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,251
from the inside,

5360
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,353
the bottom up in the agent perspective

5370
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,655
and to incorporate the kinds of data

5380
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:37,756
and information

5390
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,292
which we have in the blockchain case,

5400
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:41,527
like individual

5410
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,029
addresses, making transactions,

5420
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,932
we need to have agent level modeling

5430
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,868
to be able to have that kind of a

5440
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,072
personalized clinical relationship,

5450
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:56,475
a personalized education relationship,

5460
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,278
or making systems that account for what

5470
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,612
individual actors

5480
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,514
expect to prefer and can do,

5490
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,818
rather than just designing systems

5500
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,187
only at the level of system states

5510
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,321
based parameters,

5520
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,923
and then expecting that somehow,

5530
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,790
whatever it is

5540
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,425
that agents expect or prefer

5550
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,226
can do,

5560
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:17,296
FRIEDMAN: we'll simply work within that framework.

5570
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:17,830
Okay.

5580
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,099
So that was the first point

5590
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:20,999
about why

5600
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,734
Web3 needs cognitive modeling,

5610
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:23,368
because again,

5620
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,603
it's important to model

5630
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,170
and understand

5640
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,339
the consequences of single actions

5650
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:28,507
that single actors take,

5660
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,542
which might be extraordinarily rare

5670
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,311
or improbable.

5680
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,047
And so we won't be able to have useful

5690
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:35,547
top down

5700
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:38,784
modeling of those kinds of actions.

5710
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,120
FRIEDMAN: Here's the second point.

5720
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,888
We believe that Web3 needs

5730
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,323
cognitive modeling

5740
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,658
because we want to consider

5750
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,760
the function of Web3 systems

5760
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,596
that are not simply quantitative

5770
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:51,730
or financial.

5780
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,931
For example,

5790
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,433
science, research,

5800
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,635
education, governance,

5810
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,170
all of these areas

5820
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,839
are not strictly about number crunching.

5830
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,275
And so in these settings,

5840
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,310
knowledge and meaning,

5850
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,412
which are based around context

5860
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,580
and we could even say

5870
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,648
that they're non-fungible

5880
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,483
knowledge and

5890
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,153
meaning making of epistemic entities

5900
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,155
will not be engaged

5910
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,556
with by top down

5920
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:18,323
structure or

5930
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,591
structural modeling

5940
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:22,294
or smart contract auditing,

5950
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,595
because quite literally

5960
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,797
it is about the situated entity

5970
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,667
and they're epistemic experience

5980
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,737
like the kinds of observations

5990
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:32,471
that they're making

6000
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:33,505
and how that's updating

6010
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,540
their generative model

6020
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,275
FRIEDMAN: and then what that is

6030
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,943
helping them to do.

6040
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:38,677
So the way that

6050
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,078
that would get shoehorned

6060
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:43,448
into a structural model would be assume

6070
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:47,052
that some percentage of individuals

6080
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,388
are going to listen to this podcast

6090
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,924
and then that makes some of them

6100
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,294
more likely to engage in this action.

6110
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,128
So that is again,

6120
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,197
that view from the top,

6130
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,097
just like we explored

6140
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,532
in the computational psychiatry

6150
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,100
case, that view from the top

6160
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,835
or a probabilistic way

6170
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,872
to talk about the actions of groups.

6180
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,107
FRIEDMAN: And this is the complementary view,

6190
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,009
which is the view from the bottom.

6200
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,578
And this second point

6210
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,313
is just to say that

6220
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,448
FRIEDMAN: especially if we're going to step beyond

6230
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,318
quantitative and financial analysis,

6240
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,420
that these kinds of knowledge

6250
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:21,853
and meeting

6260
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:22,654
make meaning,

6270
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,991
making behavior of entities are just

6280
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,693
doubly inaccessible

6290
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,595
unless we have cognitive modeler.

6300
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:33,432
So to design appropriate systems for

6310
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,902
science, education, governance,

6320
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,271
we will need to have models

6330
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,506
of what individuals observe,

6340
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,344
believe, prefer and do, rather

6350
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,347
than hoping that we can simply specify

6360
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,114
the state space

6370
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,083
that the system can exist in

6380
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,085
and then let individuals

6390
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,554
run within that framework.

6400
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,291
KNIGHT: BLITZER I'll follow up on that.

6410
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:04,496
I think that's like yes, for did decide,

6420
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,031
but also systems

6430
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:06,932
like regenerative

6440
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,034
finance will require

6450
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,203
novel methods of accounting.

6460
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,971
And so this kind of cognitive

6470
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,773
modeling will enable,

6480
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,907
I think what Jakob was saying

6490
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,576
earlier, that maybe Daniel

6500
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:18,543
we haven't touched on yet,

6510
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,912
but this parameter sweeping.

6520
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,949
So so like when

6530
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,084
when a person values something,

6540
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,453
whether it's carbon credits or,

6550
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,456
you know, epistemic knowledge, when

6560
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,293
so when the value system differs

6570
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:38,130
from dollars and cents, these kinds of

6580
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:40,866
ultimate accounting systems

6590
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:41,700
are enabled

6600
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,868
or facilitated

6610
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,736
by this kind of cognitive modeling.

6620
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:45,237
KNIGHT: Like will

6630
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,738
these value systems and structures

6640
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,140
work for these people?

6650
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,041
And,

6660
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:49,441
you know,

6670
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,676
multi-agent systems

6680
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,844
can have variable value systems.

6690
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,913
So I think that these parameters

6700
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,549
will greatly help us to determine

6710
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:58,950
what kind of alternative

6720
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,688
accounting structures would.

6730
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,623
FRIEDMAN: Yes, and there's

6740
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,526
many ways, and it is by no means trivial

6750
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,896
to incorporate these really rich

6760
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:11,730
and expressive

6770
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,799
things that we want to say

6780
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,702
about such systems into the model.

6790
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:17,636
For example,

6800
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:18,870
even just in the example

6810
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,305
that Bleu

6820
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:22,741
brought up with regenerative finance

6830
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,344
to describe how different individuals

6840
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,479
are making different decisions

6850
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,082
that might be a function of differences

6860
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,183
in their capacities.

6870
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,417
FRIEDMAN: So they're affordances

6880
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,052
are capacities for action.

6890
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,220
It might also reflect

6900
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,722
different attention

6910
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:37,823
or different beliefs

6920
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:38,890
about the consequences

6930
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,225
of different actions.

6940
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,694
And so there are vast combinations

6950
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,897
of cognitive models to explore.

6960
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,632
And for that reason,

6970
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,167
being able to do parameter

6980
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,669
sweeps across them,

6990
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,104
which is what card card

7000
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:55,207
the package enables is really valuable.

7010
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,007
And that's

7020
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,576
why Active Conference

7030
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,511
is implementing active

7040
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,680
inference models in card code

7050
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,615
because it provides a useful

7060
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,417
and professional way

7070
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,219
to do some of these functions

7080
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,520
that are just not part

7090
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,323
of cognitive models in a narrow sense,

7100
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,059
like being able to do parameter sweeps,

7110
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:14,926
being able

7120
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:17,429
to specify the execution orders.

7130
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:17,863
FRIEDMAN: But that's a bit

7140
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,631
FRIEDMAN: more on the technical side of active

7150
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,333
block runs, which

7160
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,734
FRIEDMAN: definitely we encourage people

7170
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,737
to learn more and get involved with and

7180
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,671
help with.

7190
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,908
I'll just go to this third.

7200
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,010
Yes.

7210
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,912
All so.

7220
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,415
JAKUB: Okay, so

7230
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,151
yeah, if I could just

7240
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,452
quickly follow up on that.

7250
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,487
On the notion of parameter sweeps,

7260
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,756
I think they also serve

7270
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,425
two kinds of functions.

7280
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,760
On the one hand, it's for

7290
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,363
predictive purposes.

7300
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,197
So

7310
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,267
designing models

7320
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,203
and of different organizational systems

7330
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,872
and running multiple simulations

7340
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:03,542
to evaluate the different consequences

7350
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:04,576
of that system.

7360
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,746
But on the other hand, we can also serve

7370
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:10,816
an explanatory purpose where by

7380
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:11,349
we want

7390
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,551
to evaluate

7400
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,653
the state of an already existing system

7410
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,856
given data on the blockchain.

7420
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:20,392
JAKUB: So what active

7430
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,161
what the formalism of active inference

7440
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,297
allows us to do is to take

7450
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,966
data from the blockchain

7460
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,000
on the different actions

7470
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,137
that different agents take or active

7480
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:32,737
within the system.

7490
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:35,307
Take, and then do a parameter

7500
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,876
sweep over their beliefs to identify

7510
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,544
which set of beliefs

7520
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,613
make their actions base optimal

7530
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,049
and once we identify

7540
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,083
that set of beliefs,

7550
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:48,587
we can do further analysis on what

7560
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:51,923
that means from a cognitive sense.

7570
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,625
JAKUB: In what

7580
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,193
what would that mean in different,

7590
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:56,728
different scenarios

7600
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:59,030
and do this kind of more

7610
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:00,799
this retrospective

7620
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,100
analysis of the system.

7630
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,302
And one more thing on the

7640
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:05,871
on the voting mechanisms,

7650
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:09,474
just to give an example, I think there's

7660
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:11,009
an increasing

7670
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,678
increasing

7680
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,581
or it is increasingly mentioned that

7690
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:20,018
quadratic voting is a more optimal,

7700
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,053
optimal paradigm

7710
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:23,822
for for voting

7720
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,390
and governance in general.

7730
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,193
JAKUB: But why why does it have

7740
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:29,761
why is it quadratic?

7750
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:32,531
Why isn't there an

7760
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,700
exponent or fourth exponent?

7770
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,869
And these kinds of questions,

7780
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,504
I think, can be answered

7790
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:41,172
through cognitive modeling,

7800
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,541
where we can evaluate

7810
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,141
the tradeoff

7820
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:44,876
between a

7830
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,811
higher mathematical complexity,

7840
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:49,014
where the operation itself

7850
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,350
at more cognitive constraints

7860
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,519
and the actual results

7870
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,955
when the agents act within

7880
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,090
that voting system.

7890
00:25:59,090 --> 00:25:59,991
JAKUB: So

7900
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,928
just want to give this example of how

7910
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,330
it can be used in a purely non-monetary

7920
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,433
governance type setting.

7930
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,168
FRIEDMAN: Nice points.

7940
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:10,936
You laid out

7950
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:13,171
a lot of the kind of modeling pipeline,

7960
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:14,406
which is that

7970
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,741
the blockchains themselves

7980
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,610
actually already contain

7990
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,046
the exact kind of agent level

8000
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,380
empirical data

8010
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,281
that we want,

8020
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:24,549
and it's even structured

8030
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,484
in the way that we want to take it in,

8040
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,353
which is like which entity,

8050
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,522
which address did what

8060
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:30,989
and then

8070
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:33,024
what was the consequence of the action.

8080
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,893
FRIEDMAN: So indeed that information

8090
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,361
is already on chain

8100
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,128
and summarized

8110
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:38,063
in a way

8120
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,097
that's amenable

8130
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,433
to fitting cognitive parameters.

8140
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,768
So the question of how to determine

8150
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,737
which cognitive models are relevant

8160
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,639
is it's indeed a challenge,

8170
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,441
but at the same time

8180
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,109
the data that is input

8190
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,944
is of the right type

8200
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,180
to fit various cognitive models

8210
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,115
that could be useful.

8220
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:57,983
For example,

8230
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,051
some hidden state that describes

8240
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,419
how somebody

8250
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:02,153
how much attention

8260
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,022
somebody is paying to a given

8270
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,491
given governance system as overall

8280
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,060
and then also being able to sub specify

8290
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:10,929
at a given time

8300
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,464
or changing through time.

8310
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,465
FRIEDMAN: There are preferences

8320
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,600
on a variety of topics

8330
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,268
and that's exactly what allows

8340
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:19,437
FRIEDMAN: the counterfactual analysis

8350
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:22,107
or exploring like alternate futures,

8360
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:23,575
because we could ask, well,

8370
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:24,976
what if people were paying

8380
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:25,944
more attention?

8390
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,946
Is that an important area to go

8400
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,247
or should it be

8410
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,817
explored to modify

8420
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:33,284
not the

8430
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:34,719
attention being paid to this issue,

8440
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,855
but rather how much they know about it?

8450
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,324
FRIEDMAN: So nice point there.

8460
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,126
So for financial

8470
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,194
and for non financial systems

8480
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:45,296
where entity level knowledge

8490
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,432
and meaning making is relevant,

8500
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,134
which it arguably always

8510
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,102
is, that is an important

8520
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,104
opening for cognitive modeling

8530
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,873
and this view from the inside

8540
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,441
to complement the top down

8550
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,109
structural modeling.

8560
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,378
Okay.

8570
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:01,813
I'm going to just mention

8580
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,782
the third of the points.

8590
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,850
And then in the rest of the hour,

8600
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,053
we can hear some different questions,

8610
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:08,653
FRIEDMAN: different thoughts.

8620
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:09,821
FRIEDMAN: So anyone who wants to speak,

8630
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,756
thanks for requesting.

8640
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:14,759
And the third point

8650
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,162
is that we argue

8660
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,364
that cognitive modeling can complement

8670
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,466
traditional computational

8680
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,234
security analysis.

8690
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,369
So that looks like static

8700
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,771
and dynamic analysis of smart contracts

8710
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:29,007
and those kinds of analysis

8720
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,675
can be complemented

8730
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,812
by exploring in a testnet

8740
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:36,414
or in a sandbox setting.

8750
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:37,248
What happens

8760
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,784
when that smart contract is deployed

8770
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,720
in realistic settings,

8780
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,121
which is to say, interacting

8790
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,856
with other contracts

8800
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:46,991
and interacting with individuals

8810
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:47,892
who might differ

8820
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,294
in their capacities,

8830
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,596
preferences, expectations, and so on.

8840
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:55,033
FRIEDMAN: So just to kind of give an example

8850
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,468
that seems relevant here,

8860
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,238
smart contract analysis could determine

8870
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,841
if there was a contract

8880
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:03,742
which was supposed

8890
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,877
to hold funds securely

8900
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:08,680
and only be able to take in one

8910
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,381
or two kinds of tokens,

8920
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:11,416
like a vending machine

8930
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,418
you can put dollars in

8940
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,520
and then soda comes out or you put soda

8950
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,388
in and dollars comes out.

8960
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:18,256
FRIEDMAN: So potentially

8970
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:21,192
like a liquidity pool based swap.

8980
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:22,694
Now

8990
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:23,828
standalone

9000
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,064
analysis of that smart contract

9010
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:27,866
could absolutely tell you

9020
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,602
whether it was possible for somebody

9030
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,903
who shouldn't be able to access

9040
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:32,570
those funds,

9050
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,740
was able to access those funds.

9060
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,576
There are also failure modes and risks

9070
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:39,878
associated with that

9080
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,147
smart contract in operation

9090
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,915
that can't be said to be

9100
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,784
within the smart contract.

9110
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,852
FRIEDMAN: Rather, they're in the relationship

9120
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:50,088
of that smart contract with others.

9130
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,589
For example,

9140
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,858
other contracts or exchanges

9150
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,660
that are handling that

9160
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,495
token might be engaged

9170
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:59,964
in arbitrage relationships.

9180
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,900
Once we think about social media

9190
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,902
and information sharing that happens off

9200
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,204
chain, there might even be narrative

9210
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:08,540
or news based events

9220
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,340
which make it

9230
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,142
so that that smart contracts

9240
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,377
ability to hold

9250
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:15,580
the funds is great and enabling.

9260
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:16,948
FRIEDMAN: However, still

9270
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:19,050
in the realized application

9280
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:19,784
of a contract

9290
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:22,587
is functionally getting rugged as well.

9300
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,756
And so these are all areas

9310
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,958
that we want to explore more

9320
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,060
with the active block firms package

9330
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:29,828
as we kind of build

9340
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,030
in these modules to consider it

9350
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,932
and do case study analysis.

9360
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:37,468
But that is just too close.

9370
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:41,339
This section of the discussion as we now

9380
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,341
open up to more broader discussion.

9390
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:44,676
FRIEDMAN: And just to restate that,

9400
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,778
three of the key areas, we think

9410
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:48,479
cognitive modeling

9420
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,549
can play a role in Web3

9430
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,785
are first understanding the consequences

9440
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:56,487
of single actions by single actors.

9450
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:57,422
Second,

9460
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:00,225
by expanding the scope of web3 systems

9470
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,860
that we consider and designed

9480
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,127
for to be systems

9490
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:04,762
that aren't simply quantitative

9500
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:05,730
and financial.

9510
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,464
So considering

9520
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:08,199
research, education, governance

9530
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,300
and so on.

9540
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,735
FRIEDMAN: And then lastly,

9550
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:11,836
complementing

9560
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:14,138
computational security analysis

9570
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,741
with emulation and simulation

9580
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:20,144
scenarios and counterfactuals of how

9590
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,113
different aspects of cyber

9600
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:23,448
physical systems

9610
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:24,682
might play out

9620
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:27,685
in specific testable settings.

9630
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:28,286
So

9640
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:31,689
thanks for making it along this far.

9650
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,524
And now we can just

9660
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,760
talk about whatever people would like to

9670
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,564
go towards right.

9680
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,131
KNIGHT: Thank you.

9690
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:41,399
So

9700
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,434
one of the things that's on my mind

9710
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:44,335
is that

9720
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:47,972
this is maybe

9730
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:50,942
abstracting away

9740
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,711
an important layer

9750
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:56,180
that we're not really speaking about

9760
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,682
whether we're doing

9770
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,951
bottom up modeling or top down.

9780
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:02,387
And that is, you know, that there are

9790
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,689
miso or

9800
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,024
middle level

9810
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,192
structures that are relevant

9820
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:11,629
to cognitive

9830
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,965
modeling in terms of,

9840
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:14,365
you know,

9850
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:18,836
communities, cultures, organizations,

9860
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:21,606
and they have influence

9870
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,242
on the mental model that a person has

9880
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:28,046
very explicitly by just talking about

9890
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:29,514
the wallet.

9900
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:29,881
KNIGHT: Or while

9910
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,649
KNIGHT: it might belong to an individual

9920
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:34,819
or it might belong to an entity,

9930
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:37,422
but their behaviors will tend

9940
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:40,591
to be different, might not even know

9950
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,861
perhaps whether it is an individual

9960
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:45,396
or some other sort of entity

9970
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:47,565
that's behind a wallet.

9980
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,701
But I think it gets more tricky

9990
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,436
to think about,

10000
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:54,572
well, you know, what is the environment

10010
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:58,176
in which that entity that has the wallet

10020
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:02,914
exists in like what culture,

10030
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:06,351
what regulatory regime,

10040
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:09,387
like what communities are they part of

10050
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,789
and I don't necessarily know how

10060
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,491
that should be done,

10070
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,492
but it seems like

10080
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:18,162
that is an important part of the context

10090
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:22,667
that influences the model that any agent

10100
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:26,070
has in choosing whatever transactions

10110
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,071
KNIGHT: they make with their wallet.

10120
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:29,173
And so you really have to

10130
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,042
think about

10140
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,243
how to address

10150
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:32,577
that or

10160
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:33,611
if you have thoughts

10170
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:35,713
about how that should work, they have a.

10180
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:40,118
FRIEDMAN: Thank you

10190
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:44,255
for this comment about the MISO scale.

10200
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,123
And I think there's

10210
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:45,356
there's

10220
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,960
just a few points to add on that.

10230
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,796
Structural specifications of systems.

10240
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,533
They identify really important system

10250
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,035
level parameters,

10260
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:57,902
but then it can often

10270
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:58,703
be challenging

10280
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,606
to add in other parameters

10290
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:04,542
because the models are composable

10300
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:07,045
only with macro aspects.

10310
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,547
So it becomes harder to compose models

10320
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:12,216
that are taking a purely top down

10330
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,852
as well as a purely bottom up angle,

10340
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,523
where cognitive modeling might help us

10350
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:19,424
explore that.

10360
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,259
FRIEDMAN: Middle is that

10370
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,461
it makes a specific distinction

10380
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,763
FRIEDMAN: between observed and unobserved

10390
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:27,432
aspects of systems.

10400
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,834
So hidden states are unobserved states.

10410
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:33,071
The observed behavior in a blockchain

10420
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,073
setting are like the transactions

10430
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,574
that happen on chain.

10440
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,742
And then

10450
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,142
you're right

10460
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:39,977
that there's so much context

10470
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:41,312
that is unobserved

10480
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:42,180
in that one

10490
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,448
data artifact

10500
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,917
that would be relevant to know about.

10510
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,186
And so we can think about two cases

10520
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:50,088
where this context is either

10530
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:50,788
used or not.

10540
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,191
FRIEDMAN: The first case

10550
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:54,192
is where we actually have

10560
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,394
no other context.

10570
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:57,895
In that situation.

10580
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:00,098
We can still do intentional stance

10590
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,599
modeling towards

10600
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,468
unknown types of actors.

10610
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:06,637
Like We don't know what is behind this,

10620
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:07,972
but we know that they engage

10630
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:10,475
with this kind of a pattern.

10640
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:11,976
And it's not enough

10650
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,544
just to take a top down perspective

10660
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:14,345
and say, Well,

10670
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:15,413
this many people interacted

10680
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,247
with this contract

10690
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,483
or the average was two times per day

10700
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:19,617
because that two times

10710
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:20,384
per day

10720
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:23,588
might be the average of a small fraction

10730
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:24,155
that interact

10740
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:24,989
a hundred times per day

10750
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,824
and some that interact infrequently.

10760
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:28,292
FRIEDMAN: So cognitive modeling

10770
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,327
first would help us

10780
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:30,461
take in intentional

10790
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,463
in a strategic stance

10800
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,632
in the absence of context.

10810
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,766
And then

10820
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,936
context as we add it in,

10830
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,038
can become useful.

10840
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:43,074
So we might know that multiple addresses

10850
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,142
are under the control

10860
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,377
of a given team or individual,

10870
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:49,981
or we might have access to connecting

10880
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,784
the social media profile of somebody

10890
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,920
who puts it in their insights,

10900
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:00,091
profile or page

10910
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:00,925
that

10920
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:04,362
could be composable at the agent level.

10930
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:05,163
FRIEDMAN: And

10940
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,298
I don't think that's an answer at all.

10950
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,800
So open to whatever else people are

10960
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:12,170
because

10970
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,605
the miso is where the complexity is

10980
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:18,943
and we would just expect and prefer

10990
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,279
that the composability

11000
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:22,380
of specifying

11010
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,614
different kinds of entities

11020
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,349
not just on chain entities

11030
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:28,286
but also teams, organizations and so on,

11040
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,888
that that will enable

11050
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:32,089
these kinds of models

11060
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:33,357
to do

11070
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,359
exploration and parameter sweeps

11080
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,829
in that exact space you described.

11090
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:41,799
JAKUB: Thank you.

11100
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,236
I would maybe also add to that

11110
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:50,141
that as the toolbox itself

11120
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:54,612
gets expanded and different

11130
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:57,014
different computational models

11140
00:36:57,014 --> 00:37:00,351
are added, I think it's the

11150
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:04,255
the case where we want to distinguish

11160
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:06,624
between an actor that's actually

11170
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:10,528
a single, single human versus

11180
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,129
a team of people controlling.

11190
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:13,831
And also multisig

11200
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:16,400
should technically be reflected

11210
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,836
in the underlying data to some

11220
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,605
to some extent. So if

11230
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:22,006
if for

11240
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,609
instance, you want to analyze,

11250
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:27,044
you want to use cognitive

11260
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:28,679
modeling to analyze a certain DAO,

11270
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,547
and you have a list

11280
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:32,416
of all the different addresses

11290
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,751
as you

11300
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,154
perform this kind of multi agent model

11310
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:40,124
or even try to fit the,

11320
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,160
the belief states of each of the wallets

11330
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,396
given given the prior data

11340
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,765
it should become evident

11350
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:51,168
that certain that certain wallets

11360
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:52,470
perhaps are operating

11370
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:57,174
at slightly different timescales or, or,

11380
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,877
or maintain or

11390
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:02,947
are updating their beliefs as a

11400
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,083
in a different time scales

11410
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,351
or in a slightly different way

11420
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:08,619
than the other agents.

11430
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,153
JAKUB: And then

11440
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,422
and then we might also do

11450
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:12,690
some cross correlation

11460
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:13,624
between the beliefs states

11470
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,192
and the individual actors

11480
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:16,627
about whether you perhaps know

11490
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,496
that they are individual actors

11500
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,231
and the agents

11510
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,366
that we are not sure whether they

11520
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:23,367
represent a single

11530
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:27,605
entity or a group of people.

11540
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,240
So I think

11550
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:30,408
that

11560
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:31,509
a lot of it

11570
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:34,912
might already implicitly be available

11580
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,682
within within the current toolbox.

11590
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:39,650
JAKUB: But as we add

11600
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,819
more algorithms that do more efficient

11610
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,955
computations and

11620
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:47,858
different schemes of performing

11630
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:50,494
belief updates and

11640
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,464
belief search, I

11650
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:56,100
that's a very interesting area

11660
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,236
to explore as well.

11670
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:01,539
FRIEDMAN: Thanks. Jakub! Brock, You want to add

11680
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:04,442
anything?

11690
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:07,211
BROCK: You know, I think the point here about,

11700
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,380
you know, having some

11710
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:14,051
verified data sources

11720
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,154
and having these kinds of generalities

11730
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:18,289
about how

11740
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:19,890
one kind of data source

11750
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,193
looks like for one kind of agent versus

11760
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,527
another kind,

11770
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,464
you know, more of an organization or

11780
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:27,665
a syndicate

11790
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:30,067
or some some other kind of non

11800
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:32,970
singular individual is

11810
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,573
correct.

11820
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,743
And I think that this idea of

11830
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:41,412
the massive scale being

11840
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,447
missed, generally speaking, and modeling

11850
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:44,582
is also correct.

11860
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:48,252
BROCK: But and I think that

11870
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,757
cognitive modeling in general affords

11880
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:55,593
partially, I guess, a solution to

11890
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:57,294
really this.

11900
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:57,762

00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:58,562
Both of these problems

11920
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,364
are really related to like the.

11930
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:01,565
FRIEDMAN: Oracle problem.

11940
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,066
BROCK: Of just

11950
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,167
where does data come

11960
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,068
and the trust

11970
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,304
and all this sort of stuff.

11980
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:09,540
BROCK: Because even if you get this culture

11990
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,442
data, it's like,

12000
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,144
you know, what's what's in the water,

12010
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,178
what's in the food,

12020
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:16,847
BROCK: what's this business doing with,

12030
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:17,782
you know,

12040
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:18,949
what are the externalities

12050
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,151
of this process or whether,

12060
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:20,518
you know,

12070
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:23,821
there's a lot of still unknown data.

12080
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:26,524
And the only way

12090
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:28,926
that we currently have to kind of

12100
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:32,663
model that effectively

12110
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,433
is with essentially a cognitive

12120
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:39,270
sort of model that, like you mentioned,

12130
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,006
Daniel has this distinction between

12140
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:43,808
observed and unobserved

12150
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:47,445
or hidden states and,

12160
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,846
you know, known

12170
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:51,015
all states to the system. And so

12180
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,920
it's never a guess to frame it.

12190
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,122
It's it's like security

12200
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,225
is this cat and mouse game really.

12210
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:01,892
We're in this

12220
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:02,960
now in this cognitive

12230
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,095
and security cat and mouse game.

12240
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:06,163
And we're just going to go further

12250
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:06,831
into that.

12260
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:11,168
But, you know, as a large corporation

12270
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,369
or whatever,

12280
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:14,405
some some syndicate or whatever,

12290
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:17,408
trying to maybe obscure their,

12300
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:20,644
you know, behavior on chain like

12310
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:23,781
so that they're harder

12320
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,584
to predict for some reason.

12330
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,688
BROCK: Probably things like that, will

12340
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:31,956
they already occur

12350
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:34,258
in the political context today?

12360
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:37,394
I'm sure that it will continue

12370
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:39,230
and decentralize in that fashion.

12380
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,900
And so it will just be

12390
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:46,604
a baseline.

12400
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,405
This will just be table stakes

12410
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:49,940
to do cognitive modeling,

12420
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,142
to have any kind of

12430
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:54,712
on something like prediction or

12440
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,781
discern ability of of these

12450
00:41:57,781 --> 00:42:02,419
kinds of systems.

12460
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:03,254
FRIEDMAN: Nice. Very

12470
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,789
interesting.

12480
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:07,124
So in the last

12490
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:10,861
10 minutes, we can have any speakers

12500
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,097
join or people can ask questions.

12510
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:17,601
This is happening during the ongoing

12520
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:19,537
get coined funding round.

12530
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,005
You are 15

12540
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:25,709
and we have a grant in for this project

12550
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,610
which is supportable

12560
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,046
as well as many other awesome

12570
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,147
public goods

12580
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:31,682
and project projects

12590
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,684
that people can check out.

12600
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:35,352
FRIEDMAN: And

12610
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:37,154
on the grant page

12620
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:39,323
you'll see some recent discussions

12630
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:40,691
we've had with.

12640
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:41,492
KNIGHT: Cape Cod.

12650
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:42,526
FRIEDMAN: Community

12660
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:43,928
and with the Smart Contract

12670
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:45,229
Research Forum,

12680
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,798
where we talked about a few different

12690
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:49,667
ongoing steps.

12700
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:50,401
The current

12710
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,936
status of the package

12720
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:53,671
is that it's it's available.

12730
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:56,674
It's an open source package and it is

12740
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:58,509
framed as notebooks

12750
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,511
primarily made by Yucca

12760
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:03,380
that are like the perception, cognition

12770
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,582
and action

12780
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,318
of an entity in an abstract grid space,

12790
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:11,322
which sounds and basically is general

12800
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:12,590
and abstract.

12810
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,424
FRIEDMAN: So some of

12820
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,558
our next steps

12830
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:16,760
are to bring that machinery

12840
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,629
and that approach

12850
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:21,699
to take in the kinds of empirical data

12860
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:22,866
that are relevant

12870
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:24,702
for blockchain systems.

12880
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:27,404
So that's one key area as well,

12890
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:30,207
as well as improving the functionality

12900
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:31,742
of the package

12910
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:32,776
through various means,

12920
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,779
like improved ability to visualize

12930
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,883
outcomes of models, to specify models

12940
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:41,518
and sweep across them,

12950
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:43,787
to have documentation

12960
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,389
and other integrations

12970
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:47,825
that will just make it a better package

12980
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:53,030
and more useful.

12990
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,431
FRIEDMAN: I guess in the last term

13000
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:56,000
there's a few other ways to go,

13010
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,767
but I'll pause

13020
00:43:56,767 --> 00:44:06,477
if anyone has any thoughts or questions.

13030
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,912
The point I wanted to add in that again,

13040
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:11,849
anyone can feel free to add is that

13050
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:14,351
using active

13060
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:16,320
inference as a scale

13070
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,921
free or scale friendly

13080
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:20,290
framework, as we sometimes say,

13090
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,492
an advantage of it

13100
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,261
is that we can talk about perception,

13110
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:25,996
cognition and action

13120
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,731
for different entities.

13130
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:30,267
FRIEDMAN: This is not creating a little brain

13140
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:33,103
for individuals, only people.

13150
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,472
This is about being able

13160
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:38,876
to look at how decisions are enacted

13170
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:42,112
in different kinds of organizations.

13180
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,914
And those organizations

13190
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:44,648
could be

13200
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:46,984
cellular biological organizations

13210
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,652
like humans,

13220
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:51,321
or it could be organizations

13230
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:52,923
that you suspect

13240
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:55,225
something complex is happening within,

13250
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:56,193
but you're only seeing

13260
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,262
the tip of the iceberg on chain.

13270
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:00,497
FRIEDMAN: Or it could be organizations

13280
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,633
that are entirely on chain.

13290
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:03,734
And so that's one of the reasons

13300
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:04,468
why it's important

13310
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:07,271
to have a really flexible

13320
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:08,672
modeling framework

13330
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:10,007
like active inference

13340
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:11,508
for cognitive systems,

13350
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:12,910
because it's not bound

13360
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,779
to, for example, only human emotions

13370
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:17,614
and sensory processing.

13380
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:20,250
It enables us to describe a wide variety

13390
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:22,853
of systems in a cognitive fashion,

13400
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,421
which is what we've explored

13410
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:26,790
in our iOS work

13420
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,926
Active Entity Ontology for Science.

13430
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:32,496
FRIEDMAN: So that is where we see

13440
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:34,131
active inference as a leading

13450
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:36,100
cognitive modeling framework

13460
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,468
and natural fit

13470
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:39,603
FRIEDMAN: for this cyber physical space.

13480
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:41,205
And then the other

13490
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:43,073
pillar of the active blocker

13500
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:43,741
and project

13510
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,744
other than active inference is CAD CAD,

13520
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:47,811
which was mentioned

13530
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:51,849
earlier, and CAD CAD has been used in

13540
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:52,449
a wide

13550
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:53,984
range of token

13560
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:56,353
modeling and engineering settings.

13570
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:57,654
You can see actually

13580
00:45:57,654 --> 00:46:01,058
there is theorem validator models

13590
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:03,360
which have been publicly available

13600
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,162
for several years.

13610
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:06,196
FRIEDMAN: I don't know the exact date,

13620
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:09,366
but the work on CAD card modeling

13630
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:12,870
of the proof of stake transition

13640
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:14,238
has been in the works

13650
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:15,706
for a really long time

13660
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:17,674
and that kind of gives

13670
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:20,711
a taste of

13680
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,880
from the outside speaking virtually

13690
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:26,083
of what it looks like to use

13700
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:28,685
formal system models

13710
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:31,021
over long timescales

13720
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,091
to strategize and de-risk

13730
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:36,426
really complex decisions

13740
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:39,163
that groups and individuals make.

13750
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:41,064
FRIEDMAN: And that is still

13760
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:43,033
at the structural level.

13770
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:44,067
So it's

13780
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:45,302
one thing to be able

13790
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,838
to scan across different validator

13800
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:50,007
reward systems or percentages

13810
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,276
and ask what would happen

13820
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:55,012
if a certain parameter is set

13830
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:56,880
to three or two or one?

13840
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,649
Again, it's quite a different thing

13850
00:46:58,649 --> 00:46:59,216
to ask

13860
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:02,085
how entities with different attentions

13870
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:03,453
and preferences

13880
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:05,455
will make certain decisions.

13890
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:06,924
And so it'd be like the equivalent

13900
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:09,726
of a macroeconomic change being induced.

13910
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,663
FRIEDMAN: Like we raised the interest rate by 1%

13920
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,998
are macroeconomic

13930
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,667
curve intersection models

13940
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,702
so that that should increase

13950
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,971
FRIEDMAN: consumer spending by this much.

13960
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:22,940
But that consumer spending,

13970
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,875
even if it is an accurate prediction

13980
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,944
from the structural modeling,

13990
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:29,613
is enacted by individuals

14000
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,081
making decisions

14010
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:31,882
in response

14020
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:34,318
to those common system parameters.

14030
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,119
So that highlights

14040
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:37,721
that the objective perspective

14050
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:39,156
is complementary

14060
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:40,123
to the systems

14070
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:42,192
and the structural description.

14080
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,861
FRIEDMAN: But we really think that it's going

14090
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,496
to bring a level of depth

14100
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:48,298
and also new challenges

14110
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:49,399
because the deep space

14120
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:51,134
of all cognitive parameters

14130
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:53,470
and how they interact is truly vast.

14140
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,607
So it will not be necessarily

14150
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:59,643
the shortest or simplest road, but

14160
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,111
we think it's going to be

14170
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:02,746
one of the most meaningful

14180
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:04,014
because it's going to

14190
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,450
bring new function to

14200
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:07,985
different

14210
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:10,821
web3 ecosystems and subsystems

14220
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:12,856
that otherwise

14230
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:13,824
would have totally

14240
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:15,759
incommensurate models.

14250
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,594
FRIEDMAN: The defi models are not going to apply

14260
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:19,062
that to our decision making

14270
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,030
and those are not going

14280
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:23,233
to apply to science and how that works

14290
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,168
and having some kind

14300
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:27,170
of an interoperable layer

14310
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,039
for what entities are doing,

14320
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:31,675
what is going to be

14330
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:34,077
enabling really rich

14340
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,813
modeling of web3 ecosystems now?

14350
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:38,181
Can web3 survive

14360
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:40,951
without cognitive modeling?

14370
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:41,818
I don't know.

14380
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:44,521
FRIEDMAN: We could vote,

14390
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:47,557
but we we provocatively raised

14400
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,558
the question.

14410
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:49,259
I think

14420
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,194
FRIEDMAN: Jakub and Brock and others

14430
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:54,531
in some meetings with this framing,

14440
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:58,502
because we do want to suggest

14450
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:01,772
or at least raise this notion

14460
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:04,608
that no amount of

14470
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:06,843
top level systems engineering,

14480
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:10,347
unless it's complemented by a bottom up

14490
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:11,982
perspective on

14500
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:13,517
what are the capacities,

14510
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:15,052
attention, preferences

14520
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:18,355
and so on of entities in this world,

14530
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:20,457
the embodied natural ones

14540
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,793
as well as like computational artifacts,

14550
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:23,427
you know,

14560
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:24,561
a runaway

14570
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:25,595
decision making

14580
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:27,798
AI with a trading balance,

14590
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,033
all these kinds of systems

14600
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:31,134
that we have to model,

14610
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:31,935
including systems

14620
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:32,669
that we don't even know

14630
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:35,138
what type they are necessarily.

14640
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,106
FRIEDMAN: We need

14650
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,608
interoperable and expressive ways

14660
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:40,577
to describe those systems.

14670
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:42,212
So that's why we think that

14680
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:45,515
web3 with cognitive modeling can survive

14690
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:52,389
and without we just don't know.

14700
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:54,124
KNIGHT: I have another question.

14710
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:55,692
I think it relates

14720
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:59,963
fundamentally to potential biases

14730
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:03,433
in a model given data availability.

14740
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:04,935
So

14750
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:06,837
it's very clear always

14760
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:07,771
what data is available,

14770
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:09,906
like what transactions are on chain

14780
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:13,243
or what prices are paid

14790
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:17,681
in market for securities or commodity

14800
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:18,949
or what have you.

14810
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:23,453
But there is actually a lot that occurs

14820
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,290
in society, which is not necessarily

14830
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:30,994
a market type activity

14840
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:34,331
with with hard data associated with it.

14850
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:37,067
KNIGHT: And how does

14860
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:42,439
the cognitive model account for the fact

14870
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:44,775
that that many things are missed

14880
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:47,878
and that we simply overlook

14890
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,414
many aspects of things

14900
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:52,049
that, for instance, might be called

14910
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,016
the gift economy,

14920
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:56,186
where people just informally do things

14930
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:56,987
for each other.

14940
00:50:56,987 --> 00:51:00,791
And it's not really recorded anywhere.

14950
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:01,158
I mean,

14960
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:02,492
it is truly part

14970
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:03,627
of the representation

14980
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:05,896
of our individual cognitive models

14990
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,497
for how we exist in the world.

15000
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:07,964
KNIGHT: But

15010
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:10,200
where is this going to make it

15020
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,805
into any model that we try to do?

15030
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:17,307
FRIEDMAN: It's a great question and it's a thread

15040
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:17,574
I hope

15050
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:18,975
we keep alive

15060
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:20,544
even beyond this space

15070
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:21,445
ending in a few minutes.

15080
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,213
So no answer will do it justice.

15090
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:24,981
But I'll give some thoughts.

15100
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:26,283
One is the difference

15110
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:27,717
between observables

15120
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:29,553
in our model empirical data

15130
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:32,355
that we're reading in and on observables

15140
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:34,558
which are considered factors

15150
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:35,959
but not necessarily ones

15160
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:37,794
where we have data points

15170
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:38,161
either

15180
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:38,895
because we just haven't

15190
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:40,130
added those data points in,

15200
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:41,431
or maybe they don't even exist

15210
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,199
in principle.

15220
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:43,467
FRIEDMAN: So various

15230
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:45,535
kinds of features can be observed

15240
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:47,504
and various can't be.

15250
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:48,872
So it's important to have a framework

15260
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:50,273
that deals with those.

15270
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,541
And then the second point

15280
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:52,375
is that

15290
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:53,577
it may be possible

15300
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:55,745
for some kind of like out in the open

15310
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:56,646
models

15320
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:58,014
to use some kinds of

15330
00:51:58,014 --> 00:51:59,883
totally out in the open data.

15340
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:01,051
But then let's just say that

15350
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:02,052
within the context

15360
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:04,187
of a given community of care,

15370
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:05,822
people consented to

15380
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:08,024
having their information

15390
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,695
digested or summarized

15400
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:13,530
and used to augment

15410
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,832
a community specific model.

15420
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:18,535
FRIEDMAN: So the provenance and the

15430
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:21,872
use of that data

15440
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,473
that would be potentially

15450
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,876
FRIEDMAN: speaking to these more authentic

15460
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:28,345
in organic social interactions,

15470
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:32,449
those kinds of data could be grafted

15480
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:36,219
or fuzed out with more open source

15490
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:38,755
templates dealing with open data.

15500
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:39,990
So there'd

15510
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,525
be a lot of opportunity

15520
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:43,894
for model templates

15530
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:46,396
and some pre computed public goods

15540
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:47,964
type data sets

15550
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:50,867
to then be enriched on the edges

15560
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:52,502
by different communities

15570
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:53,203
that we're going to be

15580
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:58,441
bringing in specific data types.

15590
00:52:58,441 --> 00:52:59,109
FRIEDMAN: And the

15600
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:00,410
the path has been

15610
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,612
in a way placed forward by card CAD

15620
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:05,482
where the package is open source

15630
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:06,583
and many of their models

15640
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:08,018
are open source.

15650
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:08,818
Yet

15660
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:11,655
they're also able to engage with clients

15670
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:15,725
in a consulting capacity using models

15680
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:17,060
that are not fully open

15690
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,461
source probably,

15700
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:19,296
or data sets

15710
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:21,031
that aren't fully available.

15720
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,800
So it's one reason why we are

15730
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:27,704
strongly open source with the package,

15740
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,040
while also recognizing

15750
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,341
that a lot of the last mile

15760
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:32,943
use cases might bring in data

15770
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:34,578
that isn't strictly open source

15780
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:35,078
in the same way

15790
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:38,215
that this code should be.

15800
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:41,851
FRIEDMAN: Okay.

15810
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:44,354
FRIEDMAN: Well, thanks for listening, everyone.

15820
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:47,657
Please head over to,

15830
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:50,093
I guess, our Twitter profile

15840
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:53,096
to learn more about our ongoing get

15850
00:53:53,096 --> 00:54:01,638
going ramp.
