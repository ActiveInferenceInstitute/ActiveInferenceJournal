## Key artifacts

| --- | --- | --- |
| `README.md` | `doc` | Repository overview. |
| `AGENTS.md` | `doc` | Agent guidance. |
| `INDEX.json` | `data` | Machine entry point — every item, its videos, and paths. |

## Portable tasks

## Validation

```bash
python -m aii_platform.aii_sidecar.validate <repo> --completeness
python -m aii_platform.aii_sidecar docs <repo> --overwrite
python -m aii_platform.aii_sidecar.run <repo> --list
```

The sidecar is valid when `validate` prints `OK` and reports no missing artifact,
manifest, link, or declared-doc path. Completeness is a curation target, not a
runtime requirement.

## Data boundary

This sidecar carries metadata only. It does not grant execution permission, does not
replace the repository's own documentation, and must not be used to move private
content into a public repository. Task execution is limited to trusted checkouts.
