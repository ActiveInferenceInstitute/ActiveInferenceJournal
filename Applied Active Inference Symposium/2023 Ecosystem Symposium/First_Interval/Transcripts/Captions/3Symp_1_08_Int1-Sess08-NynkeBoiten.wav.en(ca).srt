1
00:00:02,008 --> 00:00:02,798
Daniel: All right.

2
00:00:04,926 --> 00:00:10,135
And on to the last session of the first

3
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,274
interval.

4
00:00:11,287 --> 00:00:13,429
Greetings, Nynke!

5
00:00:19,084 --> 00:00:20,194
Greetings.

6
00:00:21,235 --> 00:00:21,286
Nynke: Hello.

7
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:22,392
Good morning.

8
00:00:23,411 --> 00:00:24,574
Daniel: Yes, good morning.

9
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:27,886
How goes it?

10
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:31,233
Nynke: Yeah, I'm doing fine, thanks.

11
00:00:33,422 --> 00:00:35,647
Daniel: Would you like to present and

12
00:00:35,647 --> 00:00:36,769
then we'll discuss?

13
00:00:38,918 --> 00:00:40,114
Nynke: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

14
00:00:40,114 --> 00:00:40,114
.

15
00:00:40,134 --> 00:00:41,208
Great.

16
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:44,530
Let's see.

17
00:00:46,735 --> 00:00:58,915
Just going to share my screenplay.

18
00:00:58,929 --> 00:00:59,999
Yes.

19
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:07,225
Can you see the presentation?

20
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:09,470
Daniel: Not yet.

21
00:01:10,523 --> 00:01:11,607
Nynke: Okay.

22
00:01:11,627 --> 00:01:12,776
See flex.

23
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:15,061
Daniel: Yes.

24
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:16,165
Looks perfect.

25
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,367
Nynke: Okay, great.

26
00:01:21,643 --> 00:01:21,689
Yeah.

27
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:22,795
Should I just start?

28
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:24,983
Daniel: Yeah, go for as long as you want,

29
00:01:24,983 --> 00:01:26,157
and then anyone can ask questions in the

30
00:01:26,157 --> 00:01:28,309
live chat, and I'll write down some

31
00:01:28,309 --> 00:01:28,375
things, too.

32
00:01:28,384 --> 00:01:29,443
Thank you.

33
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,552
Nynke: Okay, great.

34
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:32,722
Yeah.

35
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:35,031
So my presentation today will be on

36
00:01:35,031 --> 00:01:38,358
advances in machine theory of mind and

37
00:01:38,358 --> 00:01:40,504
theory of mind.

38
00:01:40,508 --> 00:01:42,792
Sophistication I'm currently a student at

39
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:45,007
the University of Amsterdam and finishing

40
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:48,031
my master's thesis on this topic.

41
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,061
And I'll be giving a broad overview of

42
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:53,089
current machine theory of mind and an

43
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:56,118
idea or concept for an active inference

44
00:01:56,118 --> 00:01:59,148
approach based on previous work related

45
00:01:59,148 --> 00:02:02,118
to active inference theory of mind.

46
00:02:04,131 --> 00:02:11,203
So to start okay, sorry.

47
00:02:13,223 --> 00:02:15,249
So for a global overview, we'll start

48
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:18,277
with giving a short basic definition of

49
00:02:18,277 --> 00:02:21,305
what theory of mind is and how it's been

50
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:22,311
used.

51
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,350
Then I'll give you a global overview of

52
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,381
current approaches to designing machine

53
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:31,408
theory of mind, including evasion

54
00:02:31,408 --> 00:02:35,439
approaches, approaches using Biphysical

55
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,457
models, et cetera.

56
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:39,488
Then I'll zoom into active inference

57
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,512
models of theory of mind and social

58
00:02:42,512 --> 00:02:45,540
intelligence and collective intelligence

59
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,551
more broadly.

60
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:49,588
And I'll get into the issue of theory of

61
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:50,592
mind.

62
00:02:50,592 --> 00:02:53,627
Sophistication, which is basically the

63
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:57,664
depth of recursivity of beliefs that you

64
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:01,640
can have about another person's mental

65
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,676
states and their thoughts or beliefs or

66
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:06,694
goals about you.

67
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:10,738
And then we'll get into the issue of how

68
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:13,762
to implement recursive beliefs.

69
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:17,805
And as an example, we'll discuss Bayesian

70
00:03:17,805 --> 00:03:21,841
theory of mind with K levels of depth.

71
00:03:21,846 --> 00:03:25,881
And then we'll get into the more specific

72
00:03:25,881 --> 00:03:28,911
paradigm that I'm using right now to

73
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:31,943
build a theory of mind model, which is

74
00:03:31,943 --> 00:03:34,973
based on a very simple model of the

75
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:36,998
matching panning paradigm.

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,024
So we'll talk a little bit about that,

77
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:42,049
and then we'll get into the model itself

78
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:44,075
and current ideas for implementing theory

79
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:46,098
of mind sophistication using active

80
00:03:46,098 --> 00:03:47,107
inference.

81
00:03:48,117 --> 00:03:52,157
So first of all, what is theory of mind?

82
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:56,192
Theory of mind has been introduced by the

83
00:03:56,192 --> 00:03:59,223
very famous paper by Primac and Woodcherf

84
00:03:59,223 --> 00:04:02,193
in 1978, I think it was called does the

85
00:04:02,193 --> 00:04:05,220
Chimpanzee Have a Theory of Mind?

86
00:04:05,227 --> 00:04:09,261
And they define theory of mind as the

87
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:12,292
ability to impute mental states to

88
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:15,322
himself and others as a system of

89
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:16,335
inferences.

90
00:04:17,347 --> 00:04:20,374
And they say system of inferences of this

91
00:04:20,374 --> 00:04:22,398
kind is properly viewed as a theory,

92
00:04:22,398 --> 00:04:25,421
first, because such states are not

93
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:27,448
directly observable, and second, because

94
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:29,468
the system can be used to make

95
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:32,491
predictions specifically about the

96
00:04:32,491 --> 00:04:34,513
behavior of other organisms.

97
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,541
And I think there's already a lot in this

98
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:37,548
definition.

99
00:04:37,549 --> 00:04:41,580
And a lot of authors looking at theory of

100
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,611
mind right now still use the same view of

101
00:04:44,611 --> 00:04:47,641
theory of mind as a theory, a structured

102
00:04:47,641 --> 00:04:49,667
theory of different kinds of mental

103
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:52,698
states such as goals, beliefs and desires

104
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:55,723
that facilitate the prediction of

105
00:04:55,723 --> 00:04:58,753
observable behavior in other agents such

106
00:04:58,753 --> 00:05:01,725
as facial expressions, movement or speech.

107
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:02,731
.

108
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:07,788
And I find it very interesting how much

109
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:11,821
this aligns with maybe a predictive

110
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:14,858
processing view of social cognition, but

111
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:18,894
also how weird it is that this theory,

112
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:21,927
theory of theory of mind is still so

113
00:05:21,927 --> 00:05:24,957
widespread in the theory of mind

114
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:28,993
literature, modeling literature.

115
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,023
So there's been some discussion on

116
00:05:31,023 --> 00:05:34,055
whether you can properly regard theory of

117
00:05:34,055 --> 00:05:37,086
mind as a theory and if so, what kind of

118
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,099
theory it is.

119
00:05:39,102 --> 00:05:42,135
So within the philosophy of mind, there's

120
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:45,164
been basically two mainstreams or main

121
00:05:45,164 --> 00:05:48,190
perspectives on theory of mind.

122
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:50,217
According to the classic theory, theory

123
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:53,244
of Tom, theory of mind is a causal theory

124
00:05:53,244 --> 00:05:55,267
of how these internal mental states

125
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:58,290
generate other agents'behaviors.

126
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,258
So it's the same kind of view that we

127
00:06:00,258 --> 00:06:01,265
just saw.

128
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,304
And then the opposite side is called

129
00:06:05,304 --> 00:06:07,329
simulation theory of theory of mind,

130
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:10,358
which posits that we use the same kind of

131
00:06:10,358 --> 00:06:13,387
cognitive and neurological resources for

132
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:16,416
understanding and predicting other agents

133
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:19,443
as those that we use for understanding

134
00:06:19,443 --> 00:06:20,453
the self.

135
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:22,478
And simulation theory can also take on

136
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:23,488
different forms.

137
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,513
The sun is coming up next to them.

138
00:06:26,513 --> 00:06:29,546
So that's why I'm based in light at the

139
00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:30,552
moment.

140
00:06:31,561 --> 00:06:33,584
But basically there are lots of versions

141
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:34,590
of this.

142
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,610
Some posit that we use the same kind of

143
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,626
action prediction mechanisms for

144
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:38,639
ourselves as for others.

145
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:42,673
And there is this new version of

146
00:06:42,673 --> 00:06:45,707
simulation theory that Gordon proposes in

147
00:06:45,707 --> 00:06:49,742
2021 which very broadly says that we have

148
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,776
the same kind of theory for other agents

149
00:06:52,776 --> 00:06:54,791
for ourselves.

150
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,815
So there's this general theory for what

151
00:06:56,815 --> 00:06:59,839
it means to be an agent that is refined

152
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,805
at different stages to facilitate context

153
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:03,824
sensitive predictions in social

154
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:04,834
interactions.

155
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,893
So this is also interesting to look at

156
00:07:10,893 --> 00:07:12,917
when you model theory of mind, what you

157
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:14,939
think theory of mind is and how it is

158
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:16,956
specifically implemented.

159
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:20,991
So why would we be interested in creating

160
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:23,019
computational models of theory of mind?

161
00:07:23,021 --> 00:07:25,046
So I think there are three important

162
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:28,074
reasons why this is very relevant at the

163
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:29,081
moment.

164
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,105
First of all, there is a technical reason

165
00:07:31,105 --> 00:07:33,122
or the reason of technological

166
00:07:33,122 --> 00:07:34,130
advancement.

167
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:39,184
There's been some proposals that argue

168
00:07:39,184 --> 00:07:44,233
for the development of artificial social

169
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:46,251
intelligence.

170
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,283
Oh wait, yes.

171
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:53,320
So the technical reason for developing

172
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,355
computational models of theory of mind is

173
00:07:56,355 --> 00:08:00,332
to improve artificial social intelligence,

174
00:08:00,332 --> 00:08:03,363
, especially as we start to live in a

175
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:06,393
world in which research on human AI

176
00:08:06,393 --> 00:08:09,425
interaction becomes more relevant.

177
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,474
And that's been this paper Bob Williams,

178
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:18,511
for example, that's argued that improving

179
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:21,546
artificial social intelligence is needed

180
00:08:21,546 --> 00:08:25,581
for successful AI human cooperation and

181
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:28,617
it could improve communication, trust and

182
00:08:28,617 --> 00:08:31,646
maybe also value alignment.

183
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,683
By utilizing theory of mind for value

184
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:36,690
alignment.

185
00:08:36,691 --> 00:08:38,716
For example, there is a very strong

186
00:08:38,716 --> 00:08:41,740
foundational reason to study social

187
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,769
cognition generally and the evolution of

188
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:46,793
social cognition through in silica

189
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,819
hypothesis testing and clarifying the

190
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:52,851
conceptual boundaries of theory of mind.

191
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:57,901
One great example for this is research by

192
00:08:57,901 --> 00:09:00,873
Devane ETL, which used a computational

193
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,900
model of recursive theory of mind

194
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,931
compared to alternative models to study

195
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:09,962
different cognitive strategies in non

196
00:09:09,962 --> 00:09:10,978
human primates.

197
00:09:11,988 --> 00:09:13,008
And they find no evidence for the

198
00:09:13,008 --> 00:09:15,026
hypothesis that theory of mind

199
00:09:15,026 --> 00:09:17,049
sophistication involved with an increase

200
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:19,068
in herd size, but they do find a

201
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:22,091
correlation with, for example, neocortex

202
00:09:22,091 --> 00:09:22,098
ratio.

203
00:09:24,109 --> 00:09:26,138
So in this way, theory of mind models can

204
00:09:26,138 --> 00:09:29,165
give us some insight into the evolution

205
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:31,180
of social cognition.

206
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:34,219
On the clinical side, theory of mind

207
00:09:34,219 --> 00:09:38,254
models can be used to understand relevant

208
00:09:38,254 --> 00:09:42,289
social variations in clinical populations,

209
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:45,320
, for example, through computational

210
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,349
phenotyping and diagnostics and by

211
00:09:47,349 --> 00:09:51,382
studying social behavior in groups that

212
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,409
have some difficulty with social

213
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:55,424
interactions.

214
00:09:56,435 --> 00:09:59,462
And groups that show some kind of

215
00:09:59,462 --> 00:10:02,434
variation in social cognition, such as

216
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:05,465
people with autism spectrum, people in

217
00:10:05,465 --> 00:10:08,497
the autistic spectrum, people with ADHD

218
00:10:08,497 --> 00:10:10,514
or schizophrenia.

219
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,553
So I hope that with some of these reasons,

220
00:10:14,553 --> 00:10:17,585
, I convinced you that modeling theory of

221
00:10:17,585 --> 00:10:20,614
mind is very relevant at the moment.

222
00:10:20,616 --> 00:10:22,633
And there have been a lot of people

223
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:23,642
already on this.

224
00:10:24,652 --> 00:10:27,685
And I've created this very global

225
00:10:27,685 --> 00:10:31,720
overview of some approaches that are

226
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,757
representative or some models that are

227
00:10:34,757 --> 00:10:38,793
representative of their more general

228
00:10:38,793 --> 00:10:39,808
approaches.

229
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:45,859
There's this brain Tom model which aims

230
00:10:45,859 --> 00:10:47,888
to basically build up clear mind

231
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:51,919
abilities and abilities facilitating

232
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,952
social interaction from the bottom up

233
00:10:54,952 --> 00:10:58,989
using Biphysical models of neural firings.

234
00:10:58,989 --> 00:10:58,993
.

235
00:10:59,007 --> 00:11:02,970
That's why I've placed it on the dynamic

236
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:02,974
scale.

237
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:05,001
So I've tried to align these modeling

238
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:07,028
approaches along the axes of how they

239
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:10,056
treat time, how broad their description

240
00:11:10,056 --> 00:11:13,082
is from the individual level to maybe

241
00:11:13,082 --> 00:11:15,107
describing more broader social and

242
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:18,136
cultural processes and along the level of

243
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,157
description from the molecular

244
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:23,184
biophysical to the behavioral.

245
00:11:24,194 --> 00:11:27,223
And one thing you can see is that there

246
00:11:27,223 --> 00:11:29,248
is a lot of work based on invasion

247
00:11:29,248 --> 00:11:32,278
inference and active inference that moves

248
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:35,304
along that has relevant ties to the

249
00:11:35,304 --> 00:11:38,333
molecular and neurobiological level but

250
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,356
moves along the lines of making

251
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:43,388
behavioral and cognitive predictions.

252
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,438
And there are very little models that

253
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:52,473
really also formalize the concrete

254
00:11:52,473 --> 00:11:56,509
implementation of theory of mind.

255
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,494
And there is also, I think, this need for

256
00:12:00,494 --> 00:12:03,527
connecting this dynamic implementational

257
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:06,554
level to individual level social

258
00:12:06,554 --> 00:12:09,589
cognition and putting that in the context

259
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:13,623
of social interaction more generally.

260
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,654
So some of the representational

261
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:20,693
approaches that I selected are the TOMNET,

262
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:23,728
, which basically uses neural network

263
00:12:23,728 --> 00:12:26,758
embeddings to train reinforcement

264
00:12:26,758 --> 00:12:28,775
learning agents.

265
00:12:28,777 --> 00:12:31,805
We have Ktom, which is a Bayesian

266
00:12:31,805 --> 00:12:34,837
recursive model which I'll come back to

267
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,870
later, some or theory of mind with self

268
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,895
other modeling uses multiagent

269
00:12:40,895 --> 00:12:43,922
reinforcement learning with goal

270
00:12:43,922 --> 00:12:44,935
inference.

271
00:12:44,936 --> 00:12:47,963
And we have the more theoretical active

272
00:12:47,963 --> 00:12:49,989
inference model of implicit cultural

273
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:52,015
learning called thinking through other

274
00:12:52,015 --> 00:12:54,038
minds, which could be seen as an

275
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:57,065
alternative or a redefinition of theory

276
00:12:57,065 --> 00:12:58,074
of mind.

277
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:05,081
Okay, so to sum up, we have this stream

278
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:09,122
of biophysical models, most notably Brain

279
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:13,162
Tom, which was developed by Zhao et al.

280
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:17,206
And its strengths are its neurobiological

281
00:13:17,206 --> 00:13:20,233
plausibility at making dynamic

282
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:23,266
predictions about neural activation in

283
00:13:23,266 --> 00:13:26,298
populations that are associated with

284
00:13:26,298 --> 00:13:29,327
theory of mind abilities and its

285
00:13:29,327 --> 00:13:32,353
weaknesses is that it's quite

286
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,382
computational and costly and it's

287
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:38,415
probably difficult to implement in an

288
00:13:38,415 --> 00:13:41,442
interactional setting.

289
00:13:43,465 --> 00:13:46,497
There are some deep learning models such

290
00:13:46,497 --> 00:13:49,528
as Tomnets by Rabinovitz and Self other

291
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:53,560
modeling which I just mentioned that are

292
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,590
also quite neurobiologically plausible

293
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,624
and also make some dynamic predictions.

294
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:03,602
But there is this strong danger of

295
00:14:03,602 --> 00:14:06,636
shortcuts, which has been addressed in

296
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:10,672
deep learning models, that the task might

297
00:14:10,672 --> 00:14:13,706
not be solved by learning the relevant

298
00:14:13,706 --> 00:14:17,740
ability of being able to infer another

299
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,773
agent's goals or beliefs, but just by

300
00:14:20,773 --> 00:14:23,808
learning simple lower level associations

301
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:27,844
between, for example, the perspective or

302
00:14:27,844 --> 00:14:30,879
how another agent stands and where, for

303
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,915
example, a food reward would be.

304
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,945
So there are a lot of ways to solve the

305
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:40,973
task and there's this finding that deep

306
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:43,003
learning models sometimes use these kinds

307
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:46,032
of shortcuts so that's something that's

308
00:14:46,032 --> 00:14:48,052
needed to be addressed.

309
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:53,106
Then there are some Bayesian belief based

310
00:14:53,106 --> 00:14:57,148
models such as K Tom for Recursive theory

311
00:14:57,148 --> 00:15:01,122
of Mind and Beijing Tom which was

312
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:05,162
originally developed by Baker et al.

313
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:08,194
In 2011 and its strengths are that it's

314
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:11,221
quite efficient, it's very easy to

315
00:15:11,221 --> 00:15:14,254
interpret and its weaknesses are that the

316
00:15:14,254 --> 00:15:17,284
road to the implementational level is

317
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:20,314
longer and it requires many priors and

318
00:15:20,314 --> 00:15:23,346
there's this question about whether it's

319
00:15:23,346 --> 00:15:26,370
scalable because of the prior

320
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,405
specifications that you have to give.

321
00:15:32,434 --> 00:15:36,475
Okay, so as one of the I think the

322
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:40,517
interesting newer developments on a

323
00:15:40,517 --> 00:15:44,550
theory of mind wait, yes.

324
00:15:46,575 --> 00:15:49,606
Is Hierarchical active Inference for

325
00:15:49,606 --> 00:15:52,636
collaborative agents which has been

326
00:15:52,636 --> 00:15:56,671
recently published and Haika is based on

327
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,708
the Asian theory of mine by Baker et al.

328
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,686
But it adds this formalization of belief

329
00:16:03,686 --> 00:16:07,721
resonance which is the incorporation of

330
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:10,756
beliefs about another's intentions with

331
00:16:10,756 --> 00:16:14,792
top down predictions and this influence

332
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:17,821
of these other agents beliefs are

333
00:16:17,821 --> 00:16:20,855
modulated by susceptibility parameter

334
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,887
which controls this influence.

335
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,929
And what I find I think it's important to

336
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:30,958
note here that they use an approach based

337
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,984
on active inference but they don't use

338
00:16:33,984 --> 00:16:36,013
the free energy principle for example.

339
00:16:37,024 --> 00:16:39,047
So they do couple perception and action

340
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:42,071
but just in a different way using a karma

341
00:16:42,071 --> 00:16:42,076
filter.

342
00:16:42,077 --> 00:16:45,101
So the way they formalize this is

343
00:16:45,101 --> 00:16:47,127
slightly different but I think the

344
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:50,157
overall structure can still be informing

345
00:16:50,157 --> 00:16:53,188
or inspiring for active inference methods.

346
00:16:53,188 --> 00:16:54,190
.

347
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:58,236
So what is interesting about their

348
00:16:58,236 --> 00:17:01,209
simulation results is that they show that

349
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:04,235
agent that there is some emergent

350
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:07,267
collaboration on tasks for low values of

351
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:10,299
the susceptibility parameter without any

352
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:14,333
explicit planning or communication needed.

353
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:14,337
.

354
00:17:15,342 --> 00:17:18,373
And this means that they improve upon the

355
00:17:18,373 --> 00:17:21,402
original Bayesian model, which explored

356
00:17:21,402 --> 00:17:24,431
different sort of overall plans for all

357
00:17:24,431 --> 00:17:27,461
of the agents, which means that an agent

358
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:29,488
employing Bayesian Tom would need to

359
00:17:29,488 --> 00:17:32,515
reason about the roles of all of the

360
00:17:32,515 --> 00:17:35,547
other agents, which was very costly.

361
00:17:36,551 --> 00:17:39,581
And the authors wanted to improve on that

362
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:42,610
to model maybe on the fly coordination,

363
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,640
which is more spontaneous and takes less

364
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:45,645
time.

365
00:17:46,656 --> 00:17:48,676
And they also show that incorporating

366
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:50,695
belief resonance has a very positive

367
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,715
effect in scenarios in which there's

368
00:17:52,715 --> 00:17:53,729
unbalanced information.

369
00:17:54,736 --> 00:17:57,760
They did this simulation, the overcooked

370
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,778
domain in which agents have to

371
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:01,742
collaborate on different cooking tasks

372
00:18:01,742 --> 00:18:03,766
and the goal is basically the order, the

373
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:04,777
cooking order.

374
00:18:05,781 --> 00:18:07,802
And then the intention would be any kind

375
00:18:07,802 --> 00:18:09,822
of action that has to do with completing

376
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:09,829
the order.

377
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,866
And they show that incorporating the leaf

378
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:16,892
resonance seems to be especially useful

379
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:18,919
in situations with unbalanced information

380
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:21,945
which, for example, one agent knows the

381
00:18:21,945 --> 00:18:23,966
order and the other doesn't.

382
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:27,000
And these agents develop some kind of

383
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,003
leader follower dynamic in which one is

384
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:33,006
more susceptible to the other agent's

385
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:37,010
intentions and one agent attends more to

386
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,013
the evidence from the environment.

387
00:18:41,014 --> 00:18:44,017
And this also aligns with what we know

388
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:47,020
about your mind mainly being employed in

389
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,022
situations in which there is some

390
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:52,025
asymmetry in what the agents know about

391
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:53,026
the environment.

392
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:57,030
So I thought that was very insightful.

393
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:04,031
Okay, so I'm going to go into some active

394
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:07,034
inference approaches that I think are

395
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:10,037
relevant for developing active inference

396
00:19:10,037 --> 00:19:12,039
theory of mind.

397
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:15,042
First of all, there's this very broad

398
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:17,044
proposal on inculturation and non

399
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:20,047
development thinking for other minds, a

400
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:23,050
variational approach to cognition and

401
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,053
culture, which we'll go into a little bit.

402
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:26,053
.

403
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:29,056
We'll go into Castle and HAF's paper on

404
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:32,059
ideas for spreading a free energy

405
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:35,062
proposal for cumulative cultural dynamics.

406
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:35,062
.

407
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,065
We'll go into Kaufman et al's.

408
00:19:38,065 --> 00:19:42,069
Model on collective intelligence and

409
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:46,073
finally also the proposal by Mutusis et

410
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:46,073
al.

411
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:49,076
On Beijing inferences about the self and

412
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:50,077
others.

413
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,083
Okay, so first of all, I am starting with

414
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:59,086
beta inference about the self and others

415
00:19:59,086 --> 00:20:03,084
because it gives a very sort of broad

416
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:06,087
introduction to, I think, predictive

417
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:07,088
social cognition.

418
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:12,093
And that's also why I've added this

419
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:16,097
figure on the right that is from the Tam

420
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:19,100
Thoughts and paper in 2018, which

421
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,104
explores the predictive social brain and

422
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:28,109
what kind of features seem to be relevant

423
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:32,113
for categorizing and understanding others

424
00:20:32,113 --> 00:20:34,115
behaviors.

425
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:39,120
Some figure on the right, you see that

426
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,123
there is this space, this trade space,

427
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:45,126
which is ordered by power, sociality and

428
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:48,129
balance, and that constraints the state

429
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:51,132
space which seems to be ordered by

430
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:54,135
rationality, social impact and balance.

431
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:56,137
Of course, these are just correlations,

432
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:58,139
but these futures seem to be most

433
00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:00,135
predictive of what they're seeing in the

434
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:01,136
brain.

435
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:05,140
And you can see that there is this sort

436
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,144
of basically a very strong top down

437
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:12,147
constraint of the possibility space in

438
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:15,150
which you interpret other people's

439
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,151
actions.

440
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,154
And you can also see that based on

441
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:21,156
another agent's actions, you learn

442
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:24,159
something about where they fall within

443
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,161
that space in a given context and also

444
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:29,164
where they fall in that trade space.

445
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:32,167
What kind of so at the same time, you

446
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,169
might have already have some priorities

447
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:38,172
on what kind of a person this is, but you'

448
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,175
're also learning about it.

449
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:42,177
You might also have some priors on how

450
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:45,180
someone behaves when they're mad, for

451
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,182
example, or when they're sociable versus

452
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:48,183
unsociable.

453
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:50,185
And all these kinds of priors informative

454
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:51,186
priors.

455
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:53,188
They inform your predictions in the

456
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:56,191
context, and they make this task much

457
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:59,194
more manageable of predicting other

458
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,190
people's behaviors on the fly.

459
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:06,195
And I think that links very well back to

460
00:22:06,195 --> 00:22:09,198
Mutuses proposal, which is basically that

461
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:13,202
inferences about the self and others at

462
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:15,204
different timescales facilitates

463
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:19,207
interpersonal minimization of surprise

464
00:22:19,207 --> 00:22:22,210
and thereby optimal social decision

465
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,212
making.

466
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:30,219
And these self and other representations

467
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:34,222
that facilitate personal minimization of

468
00:22:34,222 --> 00:22:37,226
surprise could be seen as representations

469
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:40,229
that inform our inferences and

470
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:43,232
predictions on the fly.

471
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:49,238
I think it's also important to mention

472
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:53,242
that one of the main key points of their

473
00:22:53,242 --> 00:22:56,245
paper is that self representation, so

474
00:22:56,245 --> 00:22:59,248
beliefs about how beliefs about the self

475
00:22:59,248 --> 00:23:02,245
can facilitate interpersonal minimization

476
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:04,247
of surprise.

477
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:06,249
So even what I think about me and how I

478
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:09,252
represent that, while communicating, will

479
00:23:09,252 --> 00:23:11,254
facilitate the other person's optimal

480
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:14,257
decision making at that moment, maybe by

481
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:16,259
providing the right kind of information

482
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:19,262
that they need to optimize.

483
00:23:20,263 --> 00:23:22,265
Okay, so to the next two interesting

484
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:25,268
papers, ideas Worth spreading and an

485
00:23:25,268 --> 00:23:27,270
active inference model of collective

486
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,272
intelligence.

487
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:31,274
So the key idea, I think, for both of

488
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:34,277
these papers is the emergence of group

489
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:37,280
behaviors from local interactions.

490
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,284
For Caston Hess, this is the global group

491
00:23:41,284 --> 00:23:44,287
behaviors cultural transmission or

492
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:47,290
transmission of beliefs and norms.

493
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,293
And they describe this process as the

494
00:23:50,293 --> 00:23:53,295
mutual achievement of actively inferring

495
00:23:53,295 --> 00:23:54,297
agents through communication.

496
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:58,301
And theory of mind is one of the many

497
00:23:58,301 --> 00:24:00,297
mechanisms that facilitate this process

498
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:02,299
of achievement.

499
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:03,300
So that's the link.

500
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:07,304
And they show that the spread of certain

501
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:11,308
kinds of beliefs through a group can be

502
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:15,312
modeled just by making agents interact in

503
00:24:15,312 --> 00:24:18,315
diadic groups and stimuli.

504
00:24:19,316 --> 00:24:20,317
Kaufman et al.

505
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:23,320
Show that you can create a system of free

506
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,323
energy minimizing agents with some

507
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:29,326
minimal properties of social intelligence,

508
00:24:29,326 --> 00:24:33,330
, such as the ability to assess how self

509
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,333
similar another agent is to themselves,

510
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:39,336
the ability to infer another agent's

511
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:42,339
intentions, and the ability to align

512
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:45,342
their goals to another agent, more or

513
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:46,343
less.

514
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:49,346
And they show that if you put all of

515
00:24:49,346 --> 00:24:51,348
these agents together in those diets,

516
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:53,350
they don't only minimize free energy on

517
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:56,353
the dietic scale, but they also minimize

518
00:24:56,353 --> 00:24:58,355
free energy as a collective.

519
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:03,354
And thereby, this is a very simple model

520
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:07,358
of how adaptive behaviors, group adaptive

521
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:11,362
group behaviors, could emerge from agents

522
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:15,366
with very simple social abilities.

523
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,384
Okay, so now we get to thinking through

524
00:25:34,384 --> 00:25:38,388
other minds, which is not technically a

525
00:25:38,388 --> 00:25:41,392
proposal for theory of mind, but it's a

526
00:25:41,392 --> 00:25:46,397
proposal for how social cognition shapes

527
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:49,400
inculturation more generally and what

528
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,404
kind of abilities agents need to

529
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:57,408
facilitate this kind of normation.

530
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,407
And I think it's a very interesting

531
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:06,411
proposal because I think it highlights an

532
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:10,415
important function of social behavior

533
00:26:10,415 --> 00:26:12,417
more generally.

534
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:15,420
And you could even see it as a way to

535
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,422
redefine theory of mind as more of an

536
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:19,424
interactional concept than as an

537
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:21,426
individual level cognitive ability.

538
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:26,431
So, according to this proposal, thinking

539
00:26:26,431 --> 00:26:28,433
through other minds is a property of

540
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:31,436
multiple interacting minimizing agents

541
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:34,439
and a process by which agents infer other

542
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:36,441
agents expectations.

543
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:39,444
And based on this, the authors propose a

544
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:42,447
definition of enculturation as a process

545
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:44,449
of learning social expectations through

546
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:47,452
the selective patterning of attention

547
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:49,454
that guides agents towards relevant

548
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:51,456
affordances within their social and

549
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:53,458
cultural niche.

550
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:56,461
I'm not sure if you're all familiar with

551
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:59,464
the concept of affordances but it was

552
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:01,460
quite hyped up a couple of years ago.

553
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,463
In general it is defined as relational

554
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:06,465
construct denoting possibilities for

555
00:27:06,465 --> 00:27:08,467
action offered by an environment that are

556
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:11,470
code determined also by an agent's

557
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,472
interest, goals and abilities.

558
00:27:13,472 --> 00:27:16,475
So I think that the standard example for

559
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:19,478
this is when you are thirsty, a glass of

560
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:22,481
water might appear as an affordance or

561
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:25,484
you might not consciously or might also

562
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:27,486
tend to it otherwise.

563
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:31,490
And cultural affordances in this sense

564
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,492
are epistemic affordances.

565
00:27:34,493 --> 00:27:36,495
So affordances that give you some

566
00:27:36,495 --> 00:27:38,497
epistemic value that have come to stand

567
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:40,499
out as reliable and relevant based on a

568
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:42,501
history of culture information they

569
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:43,502
encode.

570
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:46,505
And good examples for this are different

571
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:48,507
kinds of signs of traffic signs.

572
00:27:48,507 --> 00:27:51,510
We learn what they mean from a young age

573
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,514
and we sort of inherited the symbolism of

574
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:57,516
the traffic signs and they guide our

575
00:27:57,516 --> 00:28:00,513
intention towards points in traffic and

576
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:03,516
they regulate our behaviors.

577
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:09,522
So when you look at the complete proposal,

578
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:12,525
, it sketches how the regulation of

579
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:15,528
social behavior depends on the learning

580
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:18,531
of shared norms and expectations and also

581
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:21,534
how this connects to utilizing cultural

582
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:24,537
affordances and thinking through other

583
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:25,538
minds.

584
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:28,541
As this profits interactional processing,

585
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:31,544
in which agents learn to infer each other'

586
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:34,547
's expectations to optimize collective

587
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:37,550
behavior and decision making.

588
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:41,554
Okay, so from these interesting active

589
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:43,556
inference and broader proposals of fear

590
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:46,559
of mind we get to the issue of form.

591
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,562
Sophistication in active inference so

592
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:50,563
what is fear of mind?

593
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:53,566
Sophistication a short recap it's the

594
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:56,569
depth of reclusivity that can be utilized

595
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:59,572
for fear of mind of the form.

596
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:03,570
I think that they think that I think, and

597
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:07,574
it has been found that agents generally

598
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:11,578
use a reclusivity of between zero and

599
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:15,582
four and that humans, humans ability for

600
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:19,586
recursive belief reasoning is generally

601
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:23,590
limiting but in principle, formally this

602
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,592
could go on forever.

603
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:31,598
And one way to implement this kind of

604
00:29:31,598 --> 00:29:35,602
sort of arbitrarily recursive belief

605
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:40,607
inference is proposed by Vada et al.

606
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:44,611
Uses a Bayesian model of sophisticated

607
00:29:44,611 --> 00:29:47,614
theory of minds with Ktom agents and

608
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:49,616
provides simulations in which K tom

609
00:29:49,616 --> 00:29:52,619
agents play against agents that are just

610
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:56,623
one level of recursivity under them.

611
00:29:56,623 --> 00:29:59,626
And this model has been used for a lot of

612
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:02,623
interesting simulation experiments.

613
00:30:02,623 --> 00:30:03,624
For example.

614
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:07,628
Devane Et Al Showed that in a trade based

615
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:10,631
analysis but with agents having a fixed

616
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:14,635
depth of theory of mind reclusivity there

617
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:17,638
is a specific distribution of agents with

618
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:20,641
level one tom and level two tom that

619
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:23,644
could provide an evolutionary advantage

620
00:30:23,644 --> 00:30:26,647
compared to populations with larger

621
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:30,651
proportions of serotonin three tom agents.

622
00:30:30,651 --> 00:30:30,651
.

623
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:35,656
So they look at the adaptive properties

624
00:30:35,656 --> 00:30:39,660
of systems with different kinds of ratios

625
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:43,664
of theory of my sophistication.

626
00:30:44,665 --> 00:30:50,671
And in another experiment, which is a

627
00:30:50,671 --> 00:30:57,678
state based analysis for Joe et al.

628
00:30:57,678 --> 00:31:00,675
Showed that if you use computational

629
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:03,678
phenotyping on autistic individuals, this

630
00:31:03,678 --> 00:31:06,681
shows reduced sensitivity to task framing

631
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:09,684
and strategy switching within the game

632
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:12,687
that they'll be using and theoretical

633
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:14,689
line sophistication.

634
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:19,694
So these are just some interesting

635
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:21,696
applications for theoretical mind

636
00:31:21,696 --> 00:31:23,698
sophistication.

637
00:31:23,698 --> 00:31:26,701
And the promise of modeling theoretical

638
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:29,704
mind sophistication would be that you

639
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:32,707
could investigate how people flexibly

640
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:35,710
switch between different social

641
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:38,713
strategies while solving a social task.

642
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:41,716
And one of them would be to increase the

643
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:44,719
depth of fear of my sophistication or

644
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:46,721
decrease it depending also on what you

645
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:49,724
think about the other agent's.

646
00:31:49,724 --> 00:31:50,725
Sophistication.

647
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:56,731
So what I've been working on at the

648
00:31:56,731 --> 00:31:58,733
moment is an active inference model of

649
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:00,729
social prediction during the Matching

650
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:01,730
pennies game.

651
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:08,737
The matching pennies game is a game farm

652
00:32:08,737 --> 00:32:13,742
economics with a very simple format.

653
00:32:13,742 --> 00:32:14,743
There are two rules.

654
00:32:14,743 --> 00:32:16,745
You have the guesser and the challenger.

655
00:32:16,745 --> 00:32:18,747
The challenger hides a penny in one of

656
00:32:18,747 --> 00:32:19,748
the two hands.

657
00:32:19,748 --> 00:32:22,751
The guesser needs to guess which hand, if

658
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:25,754
the guesser is correct, they win, if the

659
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:28,757
guesser is wrong, be challenger wins.

660
00:32:28,757 --> 00:32:32,761
This game has some logical equivalents.

661
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:36,765
One version of the game makes both of the

662
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:38,767
agents select heads or tails.

663
00:32:39,767 --> 00:32:41,770
So the challenger selects heads or tails

664
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:44,773
and the getter guesses the tests or tails.

665
00:32:44,773 --> 00:32:44,773
.

666
00:32:44,773 --> 00:32:47,776
But both have the same formal structure.

667
00:32:48,777 --> 00:32:51,780
And psychological experiments of subjects

668
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,782
performing this task have shown that

669
00:32:53,782 --> 00:32:55,784
there is a strong social framing effect

670
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:57,786
in the Matching Pennies game.

671
00:32:57,786 --> 00:33:00,783
So participants will behave and perform

672
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:03,786
differently depending on whether they're

673
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:05,788
seeing that they're playing against a

674
00:33:05,788 --> 00:33:08,791
human agent versus an AI for example.

675
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:14,797
Additionally, a comparison of Ketone and

676
00:33:14,797 --> 00:33:17,800
other computational strategies that were

677
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,803
fitted on experimental data of subjects

678
00:33:20,803 --> 00:33:22,805
playing the game revealed that

679
00:33:22,805 --> 00:33:25,808
participants seem to use fear of mind

680
00:33:25,808 --> 00:33:27,810
when playing the game.

681
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:30,813
So there is a strong indication that

682
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:33,816
theory of mind use does play a role in

683
00:33:33,816 --> 00:33:36,819
the Matching pennies game and that social

684
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:39,822
framing will influence the social

685
00:33:39,822 --> 00:33:42,825
strategy that's being employed by the

686
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:43,826
players.

687
00:33:45,828 --> 00:33:48,831
So this is the very simple zero sum

688
00:33:48,831 --> 00:33:51,834
architecture for the Matching pennies

689
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:51,834
game.

690
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:55,838
And I included beliefs about self choices

691
00:33:55,838 --> 00:33:58,841
as also kind of monetary self states

692
00:33:58,841 --> 00:34:02,839
beliefs about other agents choices on

693
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:05,842
whether the agent thinks the opposing

694
00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:09,846
agent has hidden the penny left or right.

695
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:09,846
.

696
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:12,849
And then the agent also tracks the war

697
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:13,850
dates.

698
00:34:15,852 --> 00:34:18,855
Since the game in this setting is devised

699
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:21,858
in a way in which the agents both make an

700
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:24,861
observation simultaneously and then all

701
00:34:24,861 --> 00:34:27,864
of the observations are revealed, this

702
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:31,868
set up made sense so just going to drink

703
00:34:31,868 --> 00:34:32,869
a little water.

704
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:41,878
The outcome modalities or observations

705
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:44,881
that the agents have are its own choice

706
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:47,884
observations, the choice observations of

707
00:34:47,884 --> 00:34:49,886
the opposite agent and the reward

708
00:34:49,886 --> 00:34:52,889
observations and the possibility the

709
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:55,892
action space is very limited.

710
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:57,894
The seeker can choose to seek left or

711
00:34:57,894 --> 00:35:00,891
right and the hider which is the same as

712
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:03,894
the challenger before, has the

713
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,896
possibility of hiding penny left or right

714
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:08,899
and the reward is uncontrollable since it

715
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:11,902
depends on both agents choices at the

716
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:12,903
same time.

717
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:16,907
Yeah.

718
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:20,911
So this is sort of a summary of the

719
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:24,915
architecture that I just described and

720
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:28,919
this is another visualization of this

721
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:29,920
setup.

722
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,924
And you can see here that if you look at

723
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:37,927
the likelihoods the reward mapping for

724
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,931
the seeker is just the opposite as for

725
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:41,932
the hider.

726
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:46,937
And I think that this simple setup is

727
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:50,941
very suited for studying fear of mind in

728
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,944
these kinds of simple competitive

729
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:55,946
interactions.

730
00:35:57,948 --> 00:36:02,947
Okay, so if you wanted to study the use

731
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:06,951
of theoretical bind sophistication in the

732
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:10,955
matching penny scheme using active

733
00:36:10,955 --> 00:36:14,959
inference, I ran into a couple of

734
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:18,963
challenges and one of them was how to

735
00:36:18,963 --> 00:36:22,967
steer the problem of recurring s.

736
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:26,971
So how can we make a difference between

737
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:29,974
the focal agent and the other agents?

738
00:36:29,974 --> 00:36:32,977
If we try to model the other agents

739
00:36:32,977 --> 00:36:35,980
within one agent, especially if you want

740
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,982
to introduce or formalize desperate cave

741
00:36:37,982 --> 00:36:40,985
reclusivity, you can't just make one

742
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:43,988
agent simulate the other agent simulating

743
00:36:43,988 --> 00:36:44,989
their self.

744
00:36:44,989 --> 00:36:47,992
There needs to be some kind of sort of

745
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:50,995
structure that distinguishes the self

746
00:36:50,995 --> 00:36:53,998
inferential mechanism, a self learning

747
00:36:53,998 --> 00:36:56,001
mechanism from what the agent focal agent

748
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:59,004
thinks the other agent is thinking and

749
00:36:59,004 --> 00:37:01,000
seeing and doing.

750
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:05,004
And I think the gentleman with the bowler

751
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:08,007
hat by firster in 2003 is a good example

752
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:09,008
for this problem.

753
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:13,012
So the basic setting is that our world is

754
00:37:13,012 --> 00:37:15,014
populated by beings like ourselves

755
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:18,017
experiencing themselves as a subject, as

756
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:21,020
the focal point of their world, with

757
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,023
their own thoughts and feelings.

758
00:37:24,023 --> 00:37:27,026
And they all think that they're the one

759
00:37:27,026 --> 00:37:28,027
and only subject.

760
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:32,031
But there can't all be.

761
00:37:32,031 --> 00:37:35,034
So there needs to be sort of either an

762
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:38,037
outside focal point or one ultimate main

763
00:37:38,037 --> 00:37:39,038
subject.

764
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,043
I think more practically, the questions

765
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:47,046
that arise from this example are how do

766
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:49,048
we distinguish between focal agents and

767
00:37:49,048 --> 00:37:52,051
simulated agents and how can we simulate

768
00:37:52,051 --> 00:37:54,053
other agents in a way that is

769
00:37:54,053 --> 00:37:57,056
computationally efficient and maybe uses

770
00:37:57,056 --> 00:38:00,053
the same kinds of resources that the

771
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:01,054
agent already has?

772
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,063
So I actually had a lab meeting at the

773
00:38:10,063 --> 00:38:13,066
Theoretical Neurobiology Lab a while ago

774
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:16,069
and we were brainstorming about this

775
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:20,073
issue and one of the ideas that came up

776
00:38:20,073 --> 00:38:23,076
was to use sophisticated inference for

777
00:38:23,076 --> 00:38:24,077
period mind.

778
00:38:24,077 --> 00:38:27,080
So in this case, an active inference

779
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,082
formulation of belief recursivity could

780
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:32,085
be used for modeling recursive period,

781
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:32,085
line.

782
00:38:35,088 --> 00:38:39,092
Basically, serious planning using

783
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:43,096
predictions about the other agents into

784
00:38:43,096 --> 00:38:47,100
account would consist of evaluating all

785
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:51,104
the kinds of hypothetical scenarios, all

786
00:38:51,104 --> 00:38:55,108
kinds of counterfactuals on how your

787
00:38:55,108 --> 00:38:59,112
actions might influence their beliefs and

788
00:38:59,112 --> 00:39:03,110
their actions and so on and so on.

789
00:39:05,112 --> 00:39:07,114
So this would be one road to go into.

790
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:10,117
But this would also mean that all these

791
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:12,119
counterfeituals would need to be

792
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,120
evaluated.

793
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,124
So I was thinking is there a sort of more

794
00:39:17,124 --> 00:39:21,128
efficient way to sort of use these kinds

795
00:39:21,128 --> 00:39:25,132
of either internal simulations or kind of

796
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:27,134
special evaluation?

797
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:33,140
And the current approach I'm working on,

798
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:38,145
which I'm also sort of still developing.

799
00:39:38,145 --> 00:39:41,148
So I'm very much open to feedback and

800
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:44,151
comments on how this could work and

801
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:48,155
possible alternative approaches at this

802
00:39:48,155 --> 00:39:48,155
point.

803
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:52,159
But the general idea would be to create a

804
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:55,162
partial internal simulation of the other

805
00:39:55,162 --> 00:39:58,165
agent's control mechanism.

806
00:39:58,165 --> 00:40:01,162
So taking the learning mechanism of an

807
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:04,165
active inference agent as sort of the

808
00:40:04,165 --> 00:40:08,169
definition of what the focal agent is,

809
00:40:08,169 --> 00:40:11,172
that is the agent that perceives and

810
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:14,175
learns and infers from the environment

811
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:17,178
and what the agent does when predicting

812
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:21,182
the observations of the other agent or

813
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:24,185
the predicting the other agent's behavior

814
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:27,188
is basically performing partial

815
00:40:27,188 --> 00:40:30,191
simulation about what it thinks the other

816
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:34,195
agent preferences are and what it thinks

817
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:37,198
that the other agent strategy is, which

818
00:40:37,198 --> 00:40:40,201
is encoded by the transition from state

819
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:42,203
to state.

820
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:48,209
And one of the potential ways in which

821
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:51,212
you could include reclusivity in this way

822
00:40:51,212 --> 00:40:54,215
is that you pretend that you have control

823
00:40:54,215 --> 00:40:57,218
over the other agent's actions and you

824
00:40:57,218 --> 00:40:59,220
predict the other states.

825
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:04,219
You predict self states, you evaluate the

826
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:09,224
state action probabilities, choose the

827
00:41:09,224 --> 00:41:13,228
most valuable action based on that

828
00:41:13,228 --> 00:41:18,233
distribution, simulate the other states

829
00:41:18,233 --> 00:41:22,237
that come forth and simulate the self

830
00:41:22,237 --> 00:41:26,241
states that come forth.

831
00:41:27,242 --> 00:41:31,246
And then you have a new and then this can

832
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:34,249
be used for the next round of action

833
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:37,252
selection by the other model.

834
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:42,257
So in this case, only the per preferences

835
00:41:42,257 --> 00:41:45,260
and the agent specific transition

836
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:49,264
probabilities would be needed as sort of

837
00:41:49,264 --> 00:41:52,267
information on the other agent.

838
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:55,270
And because you also want to include some

839
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:58,273
kind of learning about the other agent

840
00:41:58,273 --> 00:42:01,270
strategies, one of the things you could

841
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:04,273
implement would be learning also the Bay

842
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:05,274
metrics.

843
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:10,279
So having sort of the specific having the

844
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:14,283
agents accumulate as evidence about these

845
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:18,287
state transitions over time to also

846
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:22,291
better predict the other agents potential

847
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:24,293
actions.

848
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:29,298
The basic principle would be to simulate

849
00:42:29,298 --> 00:42:32,301
control from the perspective of the other

850
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:35,304
agents and the recusivity comes into play

851
00:42:35,304 --> 00:42:38,307
when you simulate the other when you've

852
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:41,310
already simulated the others predicted

853
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,312
actions and predicted other states and

854
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:46,315
you've simulated your own actions as a

855
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:50,318
consequence of those simulated actions.

856
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,322
You can feed that back into the other

857
00:42:53,322 --> 00:42:56,325
model to predict what they would do if

858
00:42:56,325 --> 00:43:00,323
they thought that you were in the state

859
00:43:00,323 --> 00:43:02,325
that you were in.

860
00:43:03,326 --> 00:43:06,329
And I think that could be a way to

861
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:10,333
develop repressivity in a way that does

862
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:15,338
not need complete simulations of parallel

863
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:18,341
agents within the same system.

864
00:43:20,343 --> 00:43:24,347
And of course there should be some kind

865
00:43:24,347 --> 00:43:27,350
of temporal discounting subparameter that

866
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:31,354
discounts evidence based on the simulated

867
00:43:31,354 --> 00:43:35,358
planning horizon that is defined by the K

868
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:37,360
number of steps.

869
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:41,364
So yeah, this is sort of a conceptual

870
00:43:41,364 --> 00:43:44,367
outline of how you could implement

871
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:47,370
because the fear of mind using active

872
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:51,374
inference we haven't been able to perform

873
00:43:51,374 --> 00:43:54,377
simulations using this yet, but we're

874
00:43:54,377 --> 00:43:57,380
working on that and we're very much open

875
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,377
to discussions on this and technical

876
00:44:00,377 --> 00:44:03,380
comments on how to improve on this

877
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,382
outline.

878
00:44:06,383 --> 00:44:09,386
And one of sort of the open questions

879
00:44:09,386 --> 00:44:11,388
that we are still thinking about is how

880
00:44:11,388 --> 00:44:14,391
to make the agent effectively infer the

881
00:44:14,391 --> 00:44:17,394
depth of reclusivity of the other agent

882
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:17,394
in.

883
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:18,395
A setting.

884
00:44:19,396 --> 00:44:19,396
Yeah.

885
00:44:19,396 --> 00:44:22,399
Special thanks to Guillaume Dumas, who

886
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:25,402
will also be there at a panel, I think,

887
00:44:25,402 --> 00:44:28,405
in session two, who's supervising me

888
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:30,407
during this project.

889
00:44:31,408 --> 00:44:34,411
Thanks to the PPSP labor, I'm doing my

890
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:37,414
internship to Rudy Said, who's also

891
00:44:37,414 --> 00:44:40,417
working on a related project, the Pi MDP

892
00:44:40,417 --> 00:44:43,420
team, for that great coding package that

893
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:46,423
I'm using, and for Kofristen for his

894
00:44:46,423 --> 00:44:49,426
feedback and ideas on my previous

895
00:44:49,426 --> 00:44:51,428
presentations.

896
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:57,434
Thank you very much for listening.

897
00:44:59,436 --> 00:45:00,431
Cool.

898
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:03,434
Daniel: Great presentation.

899
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:08,439
Very comprehensive review of a lot of the

900
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:12,443
different theory of mind options out

901
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:12,443
there.

902
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:17,448
Well, if anyone has questions, they can

903
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:19,449
write it in live chat.

904
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:20,451
What do you want to explore?

905
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:23,454
Or can I ask a question or what would be

906
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:24,455
fun for you?

907
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:31,462
Nynke: I'm blinded by the light at this

908
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:34,465
point, so I can't easily read from my

909
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:35,466
screen.

910
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:37,468
So maybe it would be nice if you could

911
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:40,471
read out the questions that are the live

912
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:41,472
chat.

913
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:41,472
Sure.

914
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:43,473
Daniel: Oh, yeah, sure.

915
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:46,476
Well, first one part I found interesting,

916
00:45:46,476 --> 00:45:47,478
you mentioned that people play

917
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:50,481
differently when they are playing a human

918
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,483
or when they believe that they're playing

919
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:53,484
a human.

920
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:57,488
So what is that like?

921
00:45:57,488 --> 00:46:00,485
What is the difference in play when we

922
00:46:00,485 --> 00:46:03,488
believe that we're playing another

923
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:04,489
person?

924
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,504
Nynke: If I look at the original paper,

925
00:46:19,504 --> 00:46:23,508
there is one study on this, and then they

926
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:27,512
did the computational phenotyping study

927
00:46:27,512 --> 00:46:31,516
using Ktom and alternative strategies,

928
00:46:31,516 --> 00:46:34,519
and they showed that if you use the

929
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:38,523
social framing condition, that subjects

930
00:46:38,523 --> 00:46:42,527
will more probably employ figure five

931
00:46:42,527 --> 00:46:45,530
strategies compared to other simple

932
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:48,533
reward based strategies.

933
00:46:49,534 --> 00:46:51,536
So maybe those strategies could better be

934
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:53,537
described using some kind of reward

935
00:46:53,537 --> 00:46:54,539
learning mechanism.

936
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:59,544
What the difference in their overall sort

937
00:46:59,544 --> 00:47:02,541
of trajectory of choices is, I don't know.

938
00:47:02,541 --> 00:47:02,541
.

939
00:47:05,544 --> 00:47:06,545
Daniel: Yeah.

940
00:47:06,545 --> 00:47:09,548
A few themes then that you brought up

941
00:47:09,548 --> 00:47:11,550
that came up earlier in the session.

942
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:15,554
So one was using Pymdp and sophisticated

943
00:47:15,554 --> 00:47:18,557
inference, which Aspen Paul gave a

944
00:47:18,557 --> 00:47:19,558
walkthrough on.

945
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,563
And this question about recursivity and

946
00:47:24,563 --> 00:47:29,568
about the way in which you can on one

947
00:47:29,568 --> 00:47:33,572
hand talk about abstractly like K

948
00:47:33,572 --> 00:47:37,576
Recursivity, yet the biological system

949
00:47:37,576 --> 00:47:42,581
doesn't implement that kind of a logic.

950
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:46,584
Could you maybe describe a little bit

951
00:47:46,584 --> 00:47:46,585
again?

952
00:47:46,585 --> 00:47:49,588
How does the structure that you laid out

953
00:47:49,588 --> 00:47:52,591
for the generative model capture some of

954
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:55,594
those features of recursivity without

955
00:47:55,594 --> 00:47:59,597
falling into the trap of just theory of

956
00:47:59,597 --> 00:48:01,594
mind all the way down?

957
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:03,596
Nynke: Yes.

958
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:08,601
So my general idea was to simulate the

959
00:48:08,601 --> 00:48:12,605
other agent's action prediction based on

960
00:48:12,605 --> 00:48:16,609
learning about the transition

961
00:48:16,609 --> 00:48:20,613
probabilities for what we think how the

962
00:48:20,613 --> 00:48:24,617
other agents face transition.

963
00:48:25,618 --> 00:48:29,622
And then if you've predicted what the

964
00:48:29,622 --> 00:48:34,627
other agent would do, you can use that as

965
00:48:34,627 --> 00:48:38,631
a prior for calculating action dependent

966
00:48:38,631 --> 00:48:40,633
expected states.

967
00:48:41,634 --> 00:48:44,637
And based on those evaluating those

968
00:48:44,637 --> 00:48:47,640
expected states, you simulate your own

969
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,641
choice mechanism.

970
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:55,648
And I think in principle, you could use

971
00:48:55,648 --> 00:49:00,647
this recursive simulation indefinitely.

972
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:07,654
But also, it's also devised in a way that

973
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:12,659
it uses the same kind of sort of just the

974
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:16,663
architecture of the focal agent.

975
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:19,666
So the other idea was to just use

976
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:23,670
internal simulations all the way down and

977
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:26,673
but that would be very cognitively

978
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:29,676
implausible and yeah, I think it's a very

979
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:33,680
good question, because why would you even

980
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,683
need to formalize belief?

981
00:49:36,683 --> 00:49:37,684
reclusivity all the way down.

982
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:41,688
If in end effect, people only use tom

983
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:44,691
with a set sort of maximal depth and the

984
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:47,694
fact that we use fear of mind with a

985
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:51,698
maximum depth might also be sort of a

986
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:54,701
hint that he might also use a different

987
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:58,704
or what we do might also be described by

988
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,701
a different strategy.

989
00:50:03,704 --> 00:50:05,706
So yeah, I'm not sure if that's an answer

990
00:50:05,706 --> 00:50:06,707
to your question.

991
00:50:08,709 --> 00:50:11,712
Daniel: Yeah, well when I saw this and

992
00:50:11,712 --> 00:50:14,715
some of the other generative models you

993
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:16,717
mentioned maybe here like you pretend

994
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:19,720
like you can control the other person's

995
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,723
mind and that's kind of the fundamental

996
00:50:22,723 --> 00:50:25,726
weaving of action into the inference

997
00:50:25,726 --> 00:50:28,729
challenge and then that uses expected

998
00:50:28,729 --> 00:50:31,731
free energy just like any other policy

999
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:32,733
selection.

1000
00:50:32,733 --> 00:50:36,736
So it's like pragmatic value would be

1001
00:50:36,736 --> 00:50:39,740
bringing that controllable state your

1002
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:43,744
social partner's mind or beliefs bringing

1003
00:50:43,744 --> 00:50:47,748
them into alignment with your preferences

1004
00:50:47,748 --> 00:50:51,752
is pragmatic and then learning more about

1005
00:50:51,752 --> 00:50:53,754
them is epistemic.

1006
00:50:53,754 --> 00:50:56,757
And so then that might enable some theory

1007
00:50:56,757 --> 00:50:59,760
of mind like behavior where it's like

1008
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,756
when you don't know enough to put the

1009
00:51:01,756 --> 00:51:04,759
squeeze on then you have a kind of open

1010
00:51:04,759 --> 00:51:07,762
ended learning and curiosity and question

1011
00:51:07,762 --> 00:51:09,764
driven theory of mind.

1012
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:13,767
But then once one has enough to kind of

1013
00:51:13,767 --> 00:51:16,771
exploit rather than explore then without

1014
00:51:16,771 --> 00:51:19,774
necessarily even updating the model or

1015
00:51:19,774 --> 00:51:22,777
engaging any deeper recursivity or

1016
00:51:22,777 --> 00:51:25,780
strategic shifting you could get social

1017
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:28,783
behavior that's oriented towards control

1018
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:32,786
and pragmatic value rather than just like

1019
00:51:32,786 --> 00:51:34,789
learning and questioning.

1020
00:51:36,791 --> 00:51:38,793
Nynke: Yeah, I think you're very right.

1021
00:51:38,793 --> 00:51:42,797
The idea was also to enable the agent to

1022
00:51:42,797 --> 00:51:46,801
maybe first use strategies that are more

1023
00:51:46,801 --> 00:51:49,804
useful in gathering evidence about the

1024
00:51:49,804 --> 00:51:53,808
kinds of strategies that the other agent

1025
00:51:53,808 --> 00:51:57,812
is using before exploiting thing what you'

1026
00:51:57,812 --> 00:52:00,809
've learned about the other agent and.
