00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,660
Hello and welcome,

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,216
everyone. This is the third applied

3
00:00:10,248 --> 00:00:12,584
active inference symposium enacting

4
00:00:12,632 --> 00:00:14,924
ecosystems of shared intelligence. It is

5
00:00:14,962 --> 00:00:18,620
August 22, 2023. We have a

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,932
lot of really awesome presentations and

7
00:00:21,986 --> 00:00:25,048
sessions coming up in the first interval

8
00:00:25,064 --> 00:00:27,144
and in the second interval. So let's

9
00:00:27,192 --> 00:00:29,892
just get right into it with our first

10
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,356
talk. This will be by Andre Bastos. So,

11
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:35,044
Andre, thank you for joining and looking

12
00:00:35,082 --> 00:00:38,324
forward to your talk. Thank you very

13
00:00:38,362 --> 00:00:39,988
well, Daniel. And thank you for the

14
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:42,352
other organizers of the Active Inference

15
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,076
Conference and Symposium here. I'm glad

16
00:00:45,108 --> 00:00:47,544
to be talking to you guys today about my

17
00:00:47,582 --> 00:00:50,056
work. The title of the presentation is

18
00:00:50,078 --> 00:00:52,456
multilaminar Multi Area Recordings and

19
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:54,344
the Non Human primate that's these guys

20
00:00:54,382 --> 00:00:56,984
right here, macaque monkeys, suggest

21
00:00:57,032 --> 00:00:58,696
that predictive coding is implemented

22
00:00:58,728 --> 00:01:01,836
via predictive routing. And so what do

23
00:01:01,858 --> 00:01:04,268
we mean by these things? Well, just as a

24
00:01:04,274 --> 00:01:07,440
point of introduction, I'd like to start

25
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:12,336
by just saying that I

26
00:01:12,358 --> 00:01:14,624
started out working with Karl Friston in

27
00:01:14,662 --> 00:01:17,184
about 2010, and we were really

28
00:01:17,222 --> 00:01:19,924
interested in trying to map the

29
00:01:19,962 --> 00:01:23,392
neurobiology of the predictive coding

30
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,636
circuits that have been theorized and

31
00:01:25,658 --> 00:01:28,736
hypothesized onto cortical laminar

32
00:01:28,768 --> 00:01:30,740
architecture, which you can see here.

33
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,132
And in that work with him, we proposed

34
00:01:34,196 --> 00:01:36,264
that different layers and different

35
00:01:36,382 --> 00:01:39,112
oscillations were involved in either

36
00:01:39,246 --> 00:01:41,204
capturing and calculating prediction

37
00:01:41,252 --> 00:01:45,464
error or predictions. And so what

38
00:01:45,502 --> 00:01:48,252
we do in my lab and I recently started

39
00:01:48,306 --> 00:01:49,964
as an assistant professor in the

40
00:01:50,002 --> 00:01:52,360
Department of Psychology at Vanderbilt.

41
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,096
And so what we do is we train rhesus

42
00:01:55,128 --> 00:01:58,316
macaque monkeys on tasks which are more

43
00:01:58,338 --> 00:02:00,544
or less predictable and that have

44
00:02:00,582 --> 00:02:02,288
different sensory elements that are more

45
00:02:02,294 --> 00:02:03,840
or less predictable, and we'll get into

46
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,848
what that looks like. And then we use

47
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:09,404
multilaminar probes, so high density

48
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:12,404
probes with dozens or hundreds of

49
00:02:12,442 --> 00:02:14,580
contacts that can record across

50
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,196
different layers. And so this is a

51
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:18,564
beautiful drawing here of what the

52
00:02:18,602 --> 00:02:21,696
layers look like of Cortex by Santiago

53
00:02:21,728 --> 00:02:24,136
Ramoni Cajal over 100 years ago. And you

54
00:02:24,158 --> 00:02:26,484
can see this really beautiful layered

55
00:02:26,532 --> 00:02:30,164
architecture. Layer 1234 is this dense

56
00:02:30,212 --> 00:02:31,752
one. In the middle five, you get these

57
00:02:31,806 --> 00:02:34,296
large pyramidal neurons, and then six on

58
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:36,876
the bottom. And so we're interested in

59
00:02:36,898 --> 00:02:39,356
my lab primarily at two levels of

60
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:42,124
explanation. The first is, what do these

61
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,972
neurons spike to? What makes them fire

62
00:02:45,026 --> 00:02:47,472
action potentials and excites them? And

63
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:49,084
do they get more or less excitable

64
00:02:49,132 --> 00:02:51,356
depending on how predictable stimuli

65
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:53,916
are? And second, how do they oscillate?

66
00:02:53,948 --> 00:02:56,556
In which frequency bands does rhythmic

67
00:02:56,588 --> 00:03:00,016
activity tend to cause them to fire more

68
00:03:00,038 --> 00:03:01,988
or less action potentials? And so we

69
00:03:02,074 --> 00:03:04,772
record across layers in one area over

70
00:03:04,826 --> 00:03:06,816
here, but we might put in our electrodes

71
00:03:06,848 --> 00:03:08,516
in several other areas so that we can

72
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:11,484
also capture aspects of cortical

73
00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:13,976
communication. And these oscillations in

74
00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:16,120
this communication, we think, is really

75
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,092
intimately linked to the interaction

76
00:03:19,156 --> 00:03:21,528
between inhibitory cells, these cells in

77
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,704
red here, and excitatory neurons, these

78
00:03:23,742 --> 00:03:25,784
cells in black that I've drawn. Okay,

79
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:28,296
so without further ado, let's just dive

80
00:03:28,328 --> 00:03:30,476
right into it here. So here's the

81
00:03:30,498 --> 00:03:32,616
outline of my talk in part one we're

82
00:03:32,648 --> 00:03:34,556
going to be talking about first an

83
00:03:34,578 --> 00:03:36,976
overview of what do we actually mean by

84
00:03:36,998 --> 00:03:39,568
this predictive coding model and how do

85
00:03:39,574 --> 00:03:42,972
we think it may be mapped onto cortex

86
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:44,768
and paying special attention to the

87
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:48,236
neurophysiology. So here's the bird's

88
00:03:48,268 --> 00:03:51,444
eye overview of predictive coding at the

89
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:53,668
level that maybe a neurobiologist or a

90
00:03:53,674 --> 00:03:56,864
cognitive scientist or a cognitive

91
00:03:56,912 --> 00:03:59,332
neuroscientist might need to know about

92
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:03,044
in order to be able to apply it to

93
00:04:03,082 --> 00:04:06,616
their own work. And so, here's what

94
00:04:06,638 --> 00:04:08,376
I mean by predictive coding, that

95
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:10,984
there's a hypothesized circuit that is

96
00:04:11,022 --> 00:04:12,676
especially rich in higher order areas.

97
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,372
So here's like the front of the brain,

98
00:04:14,516 --> 00:04:17,364
which learns about these statistical

99
00:04:17,412 --> 00:04:19,256
regularities of the world and creates

100
00:04:19,288 --> 00:04:21,212
predictions about what is going to be

101
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:24,316
seen and felt and touched and so on in

102
00:04:24,338 --> 00:04:25,804
the next moment in time and in this

103
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:27,724
moment in time, and sends those

104
00:04:27,762 --> 00:04:30,336
predictions to earlier parts of the

105
00:04:30,358 --> 00:04:32,396
brain. So, to lower order cortex receive

106
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:35,404
these predictions and sensory inputs,

107
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:37,148
the inputs coming from the eyes and ears

108
00:04:37,164 --> 00:04:38,784
and all of our sensorium is then

109
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:41,356
compared to this top down prediction.

110
00:04:41,468 --> 00:04:42,948
And if there's a mismatch, that's a

111
00:04:42,954 --> 00:04:44,256
prediction error and the prediction

112
00:04:44,288 --> 00:04:46,976
error is sped forward. It's a mismatch

113
00:04:47,008 --> 00:04:50,068
response and it can be used to drive

114
00:04:50,154 --> 00:04:51,676
models, drive these internal

115
00:04:51,728 --> 00:04:53,672
representations in order to be better

116
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,992
over time and to make better

117
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,090
predictions. And in particular,

118
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,892
these prediction errors are hypothesized

119
00:05:01,956 --> 00:05:04,296
to be housed in superficial layers of

120
00:05:04,318 --> 00:05:07,484
cortex. And so that's a hypothesis that

121
00:05:07,522 --> 00:05:09,164
we've been able to test now with these

122
00:05:09,202 --> 00:05:12,604
laminar electrodes. So let's see how our

123
00:05:12,642 --> 00:05:14,428
experimental design worked in order for

124
00:05:14,434 --> 00:05:17,352
us to be able to look at the difference

125
00:05:17,426 --> 00:05:19,404
between predictable and unpredictable

126
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:22,096
sensory stimuli. So we train monkeys on

127
00:05:22,118 --> 00:05:23,756
what's called a delayed match to sample

128
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:26,992
task. It's a classic task of working

129
00:05:27,046 --> 00:05:29,200
memory, where monkeys are trained to

130
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,424
fixate on the center of the screen.

131
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:33,236
Then there's a visual stimulus, in this

132
00:05:33,258 --> 00:05:35,040
case a car stimulus that's shown.

133
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,724
There's a brief delay in which that

134
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:38,292
stimulus has to be held in working

135
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:41,028
memory. Then the animal is tested on

136
00:05:41,114 --> 00:05:43,332
which of the three items was in working

137
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:46,100
memory. The animal makes a correct

138
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,784
response when they saka, in this case to

139
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:51,672
the upper left, to indicate that the car

140
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,956
stimulus was last shown. So we then

141
00:05:54,978 --> 00:05:57,852
manipulated the predictability of this

142
00:05:57,906 --> 00:05:59,772
information that was to enter working

143
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,964
memory in the following way. For 50

144
00:06:02,002 --> 00:06:04,220
trials in a row, we would either keep

145
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,748
the sample stimulus constant,

146
00:06:07,864 --> 00:06:10,156
so car, car, and that's being depicted

147
00:06:10,188 --> 00:06:13,244
by the a here, or in another context,

148
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:15,436
there would be an unpredictable sampling

149
00:06:15,468 --> 00:06:17,984
regime where either the car orange or

150
00:06:18,022 --> 00:06:20,304
green could be sampled at any moment in

151
00:06:20,342 --> 00:06:22,272
time. So the animals went back and forth

152
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,868
in being in a predictable context or an

153
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:26,596
unpredictable context. And then we asked

154
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:28,576
the question, what does brain activity

155
00:06:28,608 --> 00:06:30,656
look like when the exact same stimulus

156
00:06:30,688 --> 00:06:33,060
is processed in a predictable regime

157
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,248
versus an unpredictable regime. And in

158
00:06:36,254 --> 00:06:38,676
order to do this work, we implanted

159
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:41,796
these monkeys with multilaminar probes.

160
00:06:41,828 --> 00:06:44,296
So these are probes, again with these at

161
00:06:44,318 --> 00:06:46,796
that time that I did this work, about a

162
00:06:46,818 --> 00:06:49,784
dozen or so or maybe up to 32 contacts.

163
00:06:49,832 --> 00:06:51,656
Nowadays we can go into the several

164
00:06:51,688 --> 00:06:54,012
hundreds of contacts along a single

165
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:56,956
probe. We can use MRI guidance in order

166
00:06:56,978 --> 00:06:59,084
to position those probes perpendicular

167
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:01,248
to cortex such that they'll span each of

168
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,504
the six cortical layers, layer one

169
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:05,824
through six. Here you can see the white

170
00:07:05,862 --> 00:07:08,796
matter here below. And then we sampled

171
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,556
from different parts of both the visual

172
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:12,116
cortex because, remember, those are the

173
00:07:12,138 --> 00:07:14,416
areas that might issue prediction errors

174
00:07:14,448 --> 00:07:16,384
in the case of an unpredictable sample

175
00:07:16,512 --> 00:07:18,852
as well as higher order cortex which has

176
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:21,700
been hypothesized to create these

177
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,592
internal models that then issue

178
00:07:23,646 --> 00:07:26,248
predictions. So here's what we found.

179
00:07:26,414 --> 00:07:29,444
We first just analyzed the multiunit

180
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:31,476
activity which is a measure of the spike

181
00:07:31,508 --> 00:07:34,564
rate. So how many action potentials per

182
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:37,080
unit of time are these neurons firing?

183
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,164
And what's being shown here is the

184
00:07:39,282 --> 00:07:41,516
multiunit activity as a difference

185
00:07:41,618 --> 00:07:43,404
between when that sample was

186
00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:45,404
unpredictable minus predictable. So

187
00:07:45,442 --> 00:07:48,020
positive activity means more activity

188
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,960
during an unpredictable sample I-E-A

189
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,692
violation of a prediction or a putative

190
00:07:53,756 --> 00:07:55,936
prediction error signal. And all

191
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,744
throughout the brain from V four, the

192
00:07:57,782 --> 00:07:59,524
sensory area all the way to these higher

193
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:03,012
order frontal parietal regions we saw,

194
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,380
without any exception that neurons were

195
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,844
much more excitable when they were

196
00:08:07,882 --> 00:08:09,664
processing an unpredictable stimulus

197
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:11,924
compared to predictable stimulus. And

198
00:08:11,962 --> 00:08:14,048
also, not surprisingly, this started

199
00:08:14,154 --> 00:08:16,104
already at the feed forward sweep of

200
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:18,264
activity such that these red bars here

201
00:08:18,302 --> 00:08:20,200
indicate the start of significance. So

202
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,792
sure enough, area V four was the first

203
00:08:22,846 --> 00:08:25,896
to show significance. So more spiking to

204
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:27,520
the unpredictable, over predictable.

205
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,788
And this activity fed forward up the

206
00:08:29,794 --> 00:08:33,500
cortical hierarchy. Next, we looked

207
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,724
not only at the firing rate of these

208
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:37,472
neurons but also the local field

209
00:08:37,526 --> 00:08:39,856
potential which is informative about the

210
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:43,164
local oscillatory activity that's

211
00:08:43,212 --> 00:08:44,416
present. So you can think of these

212
00:08:44,438 --> 00:08:46,944
oscillations as massive waves of

213
00:08:46,982 --> 00:08:48,976
activity that are synchronous across a

214
00:08:48,998 --> 00:08:51,236
large population of neurons but of

215
00:08:51,258 --> 00:08:52,564
course, are produced through the

216
00:08:52,602 --> 00:08:55,104
interplay between these recurrent

217
00:08:55,152 --> 00:08:57,524
inhibitory bouts of activity. And so,

218
00:08:57,562 --> 00:08:59,364
here's what we found. We performed this

219
00:08:59,402 --> 00:09:02,160
power spectral analysis again comparing

220
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,612
power in the unpredictable case versus

221
00:09:04,676 --> 00:09:07,416
power in the predictable case. And we

222
00:09:07,438 --> 00:09:09,736
did a percent change metric. Very simple

223
00:09:09,918 --> 00:09:11,636
percent change metric. So again, what's

224
00:09:11,668 --> 00:09:15,012
shown here on the Y axis is in positive,

225
00:09:15,156 --> 00:09:17,964
more power to unpredictable samples and

226
00:09:18,002 --> 00:09:20,796
in the negative values, more power to

227
00:09:20,818 --> 00:09:23,116
the predictable samples. Now, what we

228
00:09:23,138 --> 00:09:24,648
saw in the gamma range so that's

229
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,924
everywhere above about 30 or 40 Hz again

230
00:09:26,962 --> 00:09:29,836
in all areas very strongly mirrored what

231
00:09:29,858 --> 00:09:32,168
we saw in the spiking activity. Namely,

232
00:09:32,264 --> 00:09:34,064
that there was more of this high

233
00:09:34,102 --> 00:09:37,196
frequency and also the classic low range

234
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:39,824
frequency in the gamma range. So in both

235
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:42,324
the low gamma and high gamma ranges an

236
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:44,388
enhancement of power during the

237
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:46,676
unpredictable cues. That was also the

238
00:09:46,698 --> 00:09:49,204
case in the theta band. And this makes

239
00:09:49,242 --> 00:09:51,252
somewhat sense from the point of view of

240
00:09:51,386 --> 00:09:54,132
neurophysiology that this theta

241
00:09:54,196 --> 00:09:55,892
frequency and this gamma frequency,

242
00:09:55,956 --> 00:09:58,776
they very often track one another and do

243
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,968
similar things in cortex. Why exactly

244
00:10:01,054 --> 00:10:03,210
that is the case? We actually don't know

245
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,400
what the reason for that is, but that's

246
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,884
an observation that we've seen in many

247
00:10:07,922 --> 00:10:10,332
other tasks. But what we saw in between

248
00:10:10,386 --> 00:10:13,404
the theta and the gamma bands was this

249
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:17,232
other band at between ten to about 20 or

250
00:10:17,286 --> 00:10:19,824
slightly higher in frequency, this

251
00:10:19,862 --> 00:10:22,828
classic alpha beta band. And this alpha

252
00:10:22,844 --> 00:10:26,560
beta band, this alpha beta band

253
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,504
acted in the exact opposite way.

254
00:10:29,622 --> 00:10:31,316
Namely, there was more power to

255
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:32,676
predictable samples than to

256
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,084
unpredictable samples. With one

257
00:10:34,122 --> 00:10:36,596
exception. Area seven A was an

258
00:10:36,618 --> 00:10:38,912
exception. It did have that canonical

259
00:10:38,976 --> 00:10:42,504
pattern in the alpha band, but in the

260
00:10:42,622 --> 00:10:45,960
low beta band, it was actually similar

261
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,864
to gamma. And we think that this might

262
00:10:47,902 --> 00:10:50,916
be a working memory update mechanism.

263
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:54,264
But for now, we are really stressing and

264
00:10:54,382 --> 00:10:56,188
emphasizing the fact that across all of

265
00:10:56,194 --> 00:10:58,408
these areas, you had this beta signal

266
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:00,792
that was stronger to the predictable

267
00:11:00,856 --> 00:11:04,220
case, to the predictable sample. Okay,

268
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,936
so next we had these laminar electrodes.

269
00:11:06,968 --> 00:11:09,344
So let's look at the difference between

270
00:11:09,462 --> 00:11:11,536
what these neurons are doing when you

271
00:11:11,558 --> 00:11:13,436
record from the so called superficial

272
00:11:13,468 --> 00:11:15,904
layers of cortex versus the so called

273
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,808
deep layers of cortex. So the

274
00:11:17,814 --> 00:11:19,264
superficial layers are layers two,

275
00:11:19,302 --> 00:11:21,632
three. The deep layers are these layers

276
00:11:21,696 --> 00:11:24,272
five and six. These superficial layers,

277
00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:25,940
they are the layers that feed forward.

278
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,256
So remember from that introductory slide

279
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:29,844
that these are the layers that were

280
00:11:29,882 --> 00:11:32,036
hypothesized based on predictive coding

281
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:34,788
theory to house the prediction error

282
00:11:34,884 --> 00:11:37,444
neurons, because according to theory,

283
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,464
those prediction error signals are sent

284
00:11:39,502 --> 00:11:42,264
in the feed forward direction. So we

285
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:45,416
then tested that in a second way, which

286
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,116
was to test whether or not those

287
00:11:47,218 --> 00:11:49,144
enhanced signals during unpredictable

288
00:11:49,192 --> 00:11:51,564
samples are more present in layer two,

289
00:11:51,602 --> 00:11:53,404
three. And that's exactly what we found

290
00:11:53,442 --> 00:11:55,804
in V four. So when we again take this

291
00:11:55,842 --> 00:11:58,092
spiking signal and subtract

292
00:11:58,156 --> 00:11:59,932
unpredictable, minus predictable

293
00:11:59,996 --> 00:12:03,104
spiking, we see that the signal is more

294
00:12:03,142 --> 00:12:05,344
enhanced in superficial layers of D

295
00:12:05,382 --> 00:12:07,216
four. There was a trend towards that in

296
00:12:07,238 --> 00:12:09,820
PFC as well, but in D four, it was a

297
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,100
significant observation. And

298
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,864
furthermore, when we now look at the LFP

299
00:12:14,912 --> 00:12:17,412
gamma power, this power in the 40 to 90

300
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:20,980
Hz band, again, we do the power change.

301
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,308
So these positive signals mean there's

302
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:25,128
an enhancement of gamma power to the

303
00:12:25,134 --> 00:12:27,256
unpredictable signal. And again, now in

304
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:29,432
both V four and PFC, it's the

305
00:12:29,486 --> 00:12:32,120
superficial layers that are having more

306
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,972
of this unpredictable signal again,

307
00:12:35,106 --> 00:12:38,952
and that's consistent with the theorized

308
00:12:39,096 --> 00:12:42,024
type of circuitry for these canonical

309
00:12:42,072 --> 00:12:45,676
circuits. Next, we were

310
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:48,240
interested in whether or not these power

311
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,072
changes were blankets across the board

312
00:12:51,126 --> 00:12:54,316
that just overall increase mu activity

313
00:12:54,348 --> 00:12:56,624
and GAM activity independent of the

314
00:12:56,662 --> 00:13:00,180
exact sample that was being shown or

315
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,388
whether these signals were actually

316
00:13:02,474 --> 00:13:04,932
specific to the actual item that was

317
00:13:04,986 --> 00:13:06,916
being predicted. Because remember, in

318
00:13:06,938 --> 00:13:10,276
our task design, animals were for a

319
00:13:10,298 --> 00:13:13,896
large portion of time predicting that

320
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,544
there should be a car stimulus or

321
00:13:15,582 --> 00:13:17,416
predicting an orange or predicting the

322
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:19,960
green stimulus. So in that particular

323
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,810
task requirement, it wouldn't make sense

324
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,264
if task representations for all three

325
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:28,424
stimuli all went up to an unpredictable

326
00:13:28,472 --> 00:13:30,456
stimuli that would be more consistent

327
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:32,680
with just an overall arousal signal.

328
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,556
But what we were next interested in is

329
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:36,172
whether or not neurons that actually

330
00:13:36,306 --> 00:13:38,704
were selective for the car, if it was

331
00:13:38,742 --> 00:13:41,216
those neurons in particular that had the

332
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:44,224
unpredictable signals. And what we found

333
00:13:44,262 --> 00:13:46,784
is that that was indeed the case. So we

334
00:13:46,822 --> 00:13:48,720
performed the same analysis as before,

335
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,204
LFP gamma power difference for

336
00:13:51,242 --> 00:13:53,332
unpredictable, minus, predictable, but

337
00:13:53,386 --> 00:13:55,956
now as a function of whether or not

338
00:13:56,058 --> 00:13:58,816
those neurons preferred the stimulus

339
00:13:58,848 --> 00:14:00,836
that was being predicted. And what we

340
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:02,664
found is that the preference actually

341
00:14:02,702 --> 00:14:05,432
modulated this gamma band activity very

342
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:09,092
strongly. And so this unpredictable

343
00:14:09,156 --> 00:14:11,784
signal change was more specific to

344
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:13,972
neurons that actually preferred that

345
00:14:14,046 --> 00:14:16,972
predicted stimulus, indicating that this

346
00:14:17,026 --> 00:14:19,580
prediction was not acting as a blanket

347
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,284
similar to an arousal mechanism, but was

348
00:14:22,322 --> 00:14:24,316
actually reaching down at the level of

349
00:14:24,338 --> 00:14:26,684
the representations that were specific

350
00:14:26,802 --> 00:14:28,496
to the thing that needed to be

351
00:14:28,598 --> 00:14:31,696
predicted. And that was even more the

352
00:14:31,718 --> 00:14:33,564
case in the beta frequency range

353
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:36,124
actually, where the neurons that didn't

354
00:14:36,172 --> 00:14:38,096
encode the predicted stimulus, they

355
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:39,524
couldn't care less whether or not that

356
00:14:39,562 --> 00:14:42,640
stimulus was predictable.

357
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,552
It was really only neurons that carried

358
00:14:45,616 --> 00:14:47,860
information about the stimulus that was

359
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,984
being predicted. Those were the neurons

360
00:14:50,032 --> 00:14:53,732
that were not enhancing

361
00:14:53,796 --> 00:14:56,232
but diminishing their beta during an

362
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:59,464
unpredictable signal or said another

363
00:14:59,502 --> 00:15:02,292
way, enhancing their beta to a predicted

364
00:15:02,356 --> 00:15:05,676
signal change. So here's what we think

365
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:07,724
is going on. We call this

366
00:15:07,762 --> 00:15:09,756
neurophysiological implementation that

367
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:11,836
we found of predictive coding. We call

368
00:15:11,858 --> 00:15:15,464
it predictive routing to make a semantic

369
00:15:15,512 --> 00:15:18,764
point, but also a slightly more

370
00:15:18,802 --> 00:15:20,760
neurophysiological and computational

371
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,916
argument that we don't actually find

372
00:15:24,018 --> 00:15:26,524
strong evidence for this mismatch and

373
00:15:26,562 --> 00:15:28,236
prediction signal at the level of

374
00:15:28,258 --> 00:15:30,884
neurons, but instead we think that this

375
00:15:30,922 --> 00:15:34,932
prediction circuit exists but

376
00:15:34,986 --> 00:15:37,044
uses these oscillations in order to

377
00:15:37,082 --> 00:15:39,648
implement what is predicted. So here's

378
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:40,948
how we think this works. So when a

379
00:15:40,954 --> 00:15:43,284
prediction matches a stimulus, as is

380
00:15:43,322 --> 00:15:45,604
being shown here, when you're predicting

381
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:48,712
A and you get a stimulus A, then the A

382
00:15:48,766 --> 00:15:51,016
column. In other words, it doesn't have

383
00:15:51,038 --> 00:15:53,656
to be a column, but the area of the

384
00:15:53,678 --> 00:15:57,404
brain or the neurons that encode A are

385
00:15:57,442 --> 00:16:00,364
going to become prepared to receive the

386
00:16:00,402 --> 00:16:03,596
stimulus A by enhancing the power of

387
00:16:03,618 --> 00:16:05,964
this alpha beta signal. So this top down

388
00:16:06,002 --> 00:16:08,216
beta from higher order areas we think

389
00:16:08,338 --> 00:16:11,056
prepares a cortical circuit to receive a

390
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:12,864
predicted stimulus and it prepares that

391
00:16:12,902 --> 00:16:15,616
stimulus by enhancing that's. This up

392
00:16:15,638 --> 00:16:17,312
arrow here, the alpha beta, especially

393
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:20,016
in the deep layers, which can inhibit

394
00:16:20,128 --> 00:16:22,756
both the gamma and the spiking signal in

395
00:16:22,778 --> 00:16:25,670
the superficial layers as a result.

396
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,164
So this top down signal inhibits the

397
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:33,672
superficial layers and as a result,

398
00:16:33,806 --> 00:16:36,136
there is decreased gamma and spiking and

399
00:16:36,158 --> 00:16:38,168
decreased feed forward output in the

400
00:16:38,174 --> 00:16:41,864
case of a predictable stimulus. The case

401
00:16:41,902 --> 00:16:44,940
of an unpredictable stimulus, well,

402
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,324
stimulus A, just like before, is still

403
00:16:47,362 --> 00:16:49,736
going to be coming in. But because it's

404
00:16:49,768 --> 00:16:53,084
not predictable, that column, that set

405
00:16:53,122 --> 00:16:56,700
of neurons that normally represents A,

406
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,836
was not previously prepared by an alpha

407
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:01,916
beta signal. And so the alpha beta

408
00:17:01,948 --> 00:17:03,664
signal is relatively low in an

409
00:17:03,702 --> 00:17:06,416
unpredictable context, releasing the

410
00:17:06,438 --> 00:17:08,816
inhibition that the deep layers exert on

411
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:10,240
superficial layers and as a result,

412
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,356
causing more gamma, more spiking and

413
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:14,484
more feed forward output. In other

414
00:17:14,522 --> 00:17:17,396
words, what we are hypothesizing here is

415
00:17:17,418 --> 00:17:19,344
that predictive coding and this error

416
00:17:19,392 --> 00:17:23,432
computation comes about as a failure in

417
00:17:23,486 --> 00:17:25,848
predictive inhibition. And as a result

418
00:17:25,934 --> 00:17:28,216
of the lack of these mechanisms being in

419
00:17:28,238 --> 00:17:31,284
place during an unpredictable stimulus,

420
00:17:31,412 --> 00:17:33,816
there is an enhanced gamma output. And

421
00:17:33,838 --> 00:17:35,588
that's what we call a prediction error,

422
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:36,988
or that's what we interpret as a

423
00:17:36,994 --> 00:17:39,036
prediction error. So here's the

424
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,196
predictive routing model one more time

425
00:17:41,378 --> 00:17:43,372
in a predictable stimulus, top down

426
00:17:43,426 --> 00:17:45,884
inputs prepare the column to receive a

427
00:17:45,922 --> 00:17:48,096
stimulus. That preparation leads to

428
00:17:48,118 --> 00:17:50,236
inhibition, less feed forward output.

429
00:17:50,348 --> 00:17:52,624
In an unpredictable case, those

430
00:17:52,662 --> 00:17:54,768
mechanisms aren't in place, as a result,

431
00:17:54,854 --> 00:17:58,064
more feed forward gamma output. So

432
00:17:58,102 --> 00:18:00,080
that's part one. That's our cortical

433
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,220
neurophysiological hypothesis then,

434
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,636
that we call predictive routing of how

435
00:18:05,658 --> 00:18:07,156
we believe predictive coding is

436
00:18:07,178 --> 00:18:10,036
implemented in the brain. And next I

437
00:18:10,058 --> 00:18:12,072
want to turn to a little bit more about

438
00:18:12,126 --> 00:18:14,644
how these rhythms are actually produced

439
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:16,552
in the brain, because one of the things

440
00:18:16,606 --> 00:18:19,832
that we noticed from just placing our

441
00:18:19,886 --> 00:18:22,872
laminar electrodes into cortex is that

442
00:18:22,926 --> 00:18:25,176
independent of where we put our probe.

443
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,016
So here's an example of prefrontal

444
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:30,204
cortex activity. We would see these high

445
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,136
frequency gamma waves and superficial

446
00:18:32,168 --> 00:18:34,728
layers and slower frequency alpha beta

447
00:18:34,744 --> 00:18:38,256
waves in these deep layers. And you

448
00:18:38,278 --> 00:18:40,864
can do this analysis very easily and

449
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:44,096
quickly to reveal this, what we call

450
00:18:44,198 --> 00:18:47,184
spectrolaminer pattern. And what this

451
00:18:47,222 --> 00:18:49,876
is, is simply dividing each contact on

452
00:18:49,898 --> 00:18:52,516
the probe, dividing the power that you

453
00:18:52,538 --> 00:18:55,940
observe at that contact by the maximum,

454
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,660
by the contact with the maximum power

455
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,868
along the probe. And what this does is

456
00:19:00,954 --> 00:19:03,284
it normalizes power such that a value of

457
00:19:03,322 --> 00:19:07,016
one is the layer that had the most power

458
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:09,256
at that particular frequency band. And

459
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:10,996
so, if you look here on the x axis,

460
00:19:11,028 --> 00:19:13,348
this is frequency. So these red colors

461
00:19:13,364 --> 00:19:16,072
are tracking which particular layer has

462
00:19:16,126 --> 00:19:18,364
more power at that frequency. So you see

463
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:21,996
more of this low and high gamma power in

464
00:19:22,018 --> 00:19:23,976
the superficial layers. So that's above

465
00:19:24,088 --> 00:19:26,576
zero on the y axis and more of this

466
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:29,324
alpha beta activity in the deeper layers

467
00:19:29,372 --> 00:19:36,656
of the cortex. And so in

468
00:19:36,678 --> 00:19:39,744
a large scale survey of

469
00:19:39,782 --> 00:19:43,216
cortex, together with Bob DeSimone's

470
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:46,084
Lab and Diego. And so I did this

471
00:19:46,122 --> 00:19:49,156
partially while I was at MIT, when I was

472
00:19:49,178 --> 00:19:50,596
a postdoc with Earl Miller. And I

473
00:19:50,618 --> 00:19:53,476
continued this. Now at Vanderbilt. So

474
00:19:53,578 --> 00:19:55,444
this was a really cross institutional

475
00:19:55,492 --> 00:19:58,484
study and involved multiple labs.

476
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:00,440
And the reason that that was important

477
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,336
is that most labs specialize in being a

478
00:20:03,358 --> 00:20:05,772
prefrontal cortex lab, or a V four lab,

479
00:20:05,826 --> 00:20:09,064
or an lip lab, et cetera. And relatively

480
00:20:09,112 --> 00:20:12,684
few investigators had actually done the

481
00:20:12,722 --> 00:20:14,716
necessary work to be able to record with

482
00:20:14,738 --> 00:20:16,596
these laminar probes in multiple areas

483
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:19,648
simultaneously. And so, therefore, by

484
00:20:19,814 --> 00:20:22,704
coordinating and pooling data from

485
00:20:22,742 --> 00:20:24,384
multiple experiments, we were able to

486
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:27,424
record from a total of 14 areas in this

487
00:20:27,462 --> 00:20:30,324
study that we have now in review.

488
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,328
And what we found was that independent

489
00:20:33,344 --> 00:20:35,584
of the area, we found a spectral laminar

490
00:20:35,632 --> 00:20:39,024
pattern that was highly conserved

491
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:42,212
across areas. And so here it is from

492
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:45,288
zero to 150 Hz for area V four in the

493
00:20:45,294 --> 00:20:47,188
sensory cortex, seven A in parietal

494
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,224
cortex, prefrontal cortex in the front

495
00:20:49,262 --> 00:20:51,304
of the brain. Everywhere we looked, we

496
00:20:51,342 --> 00:20:53,824
found that there was this enhanced gamma

497
00:20:53,892 --> 00:20:56,076
power in these red lines here in

498
00:20:56,098 --> 00:20:58,456
superficial layers, and enhanced alpha

499
00:20:58,488 --> 00:21:00,780
beta power in the deeper layers.

500
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,740
And what we then turn to next is,

501
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:08,400
first of all, well, let's really confirm

502
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,450
at a histological anatomical level that

503
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,156
it's really these layers. Is it layer

504
00:21:16,188 --> 00:21:18,272
one, is it layer two, is it four that

505
00:21:18,326 --> 00:21:20,804
expresses gamma? And the same question

506
00:21:20,842 --> 00:21:23,348
for beta. Let's really confirm that that

507
00:21:23,434 --> 00:21:25,616
is in fact the case, because it seemed

508
00:21:25,648 --> 00:21:29,268
like a very prominent hypothesis and a

509
00:21:29,274 --> 00:21:31,300
very prominent observation. We wanted to

510
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,376
really confirm it. So that's the first

511
00:21:34,478 --> 00:21:37,028
part of this, part two. And then we're

512
00:21:37,044 --> 00:21:39,848
going to get into which specific

513
00:21:39,934 --> 00:21:41,464
mechanisms might generate these

514
00:21:41,502 --> 00:21:43,892
oscillations and how does that inform

515
00:21:43,966 --> 00:21:46,428
computational modeling? And so then this

516
00:21:46,434 --> 00:21:48,152
was work done in my lab at Vanderbilt,

517
00:21:48,216 --> 00:21:51,224
led by a very talented undergraduate

518
00:21:51,272 --> 00:21:54,348
student, actually, Max Lichtenfeld. And

519
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:56,184
so we performed these histological

520
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,076
reconstructions. Here's the probe, an

521
00:21:58,098 --> 00:22:00,912
example probe where we performed these

522
00:22:00,966 --> 00:22:03,408
tiny electrolytic lesions in particular

523
00:22:03,494 --> 00:22:07,536
areas while we were recording here's the

524
00:22:07,718 --> 00:22:11,024
overlay of the laminar boundaries. So in

525
00:22:11,062 --> 00:22:13,540
red here, this is layer four. And then,

526
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,664
of course, we had the electrophysiology

527
00:22:15,712 --> 00:22:17,524
so we could look at the gamma power,

528
00:22:17,642 --> 00:22:20,112
gamma relative power, the beta relative

529
00:22:20,176 --> 00:22:22,372
power, and the point at which they cross

530
00:22:22,436 --> 00:22:26,072
over, actually, we determined was

531
00:22:26,206 --> 00:22:29,256
pretty consistent in layer four. And of

532
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:30,856
course, then we also mapped on the other

533
00:22:30,878 --> 00:22:32,920
features of these things to the layers.

534
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,376
And so here's what we found is that the

535
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:39,176
crossover, the point at which the gamma

536
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:41,308
profile in red and the beta profile in

537
00:22:41,314 --> 00:22:42,744
blue, the point at which they cross

538
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:44,984
over, at which their powers are equal,

539
00:22:45,112 --> 00:22:48,304
that tended to land in layer four. The

540
00:22:48,342 --> 00:22:51,116
peak gamma power tended to land in layer

541
00:22:51,148 --> 00:22:53,008
two or three, and the peak beta power

542
00:22:53,094 --> 00:22:55,970
tended to land in layer five or six.

543
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,972
And so we mapped these distances between

544
00:23:00,106 --> 00:23:02,580
these different electrophysiological

545
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,800
signatures or distinct

546
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,076
profiles to the different layers. And we

547
00:23:09,098 --> 00:23:11,376
did this for several different probes

548
00:23:11,408 --> 00:23:13,640
and for several different animals until

549
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,032
we were able to get a very nice

550
00:23:15,086 --> 00:23:18,152
distribution here, which confirmed that

551
00:23:18,286 --> 00:23:20,552
indeed, the gamma beta crossover is

552
00:23:20,606 --> 00:23:22,724
consistent with being at laminar

553
00:23:22,772 --> 00:23:25,516
position zero. We called the middle of

554
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:28,636
layer four, whereas this gamma is at the

555
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:30,460
boundary between layer two, three and

556
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,796
beta at the boundary between layer five

557
00:23:32,818 --> 00:23:36,516
and six. And so here is our current toy

558
00:23:36,568 --> 00:23:39,184
model of what we think is going on. So

559
00:23:39,222 --> 00:23:41,840
we think that there's different

560
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:45,564
inhibitory neurons that are interacting

561
00:23:45,612 --> 00:23:48,304
with their excitatory cell partners to

562
00:23:48,342 --> 00:23:50,976
generate fast frequency gamma activity

563
00:23:51,088 --> 00:23:53,812
in the superficial layers and in turn

564
00:23:53,946 --> 00:23:56,756
that there is another type of

565
00:23:56,778 --> 00:23:59,652
interneuron that is generating with

566
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:02,948
slower time constants this alpha beta

567
00:24:02,964 --> 00:24:06,376
rhythmic activity. So in order

568
00:24:06,398 --> 00:24:09,416
to examine this, we again turn to

569
00:24:09,438 --> 00:24:12,392
anatomy, we again turn to this question,

570
00:24:12,446 --> 00:24:14,664
well then, which exact inhibitory

571
00:24:14,712 --> 00:24:17,276
neurons are most prominent therefore in

572
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:19,084
the layers that express these different

573
00:24:19,122 --> 00:24:21,740
frequencies? And in order to perform

574
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,840
this work, what we did is we quantified

575
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,524
the laminar expression of three distinct

576
00:24:28,572 --> 00:24:30,752
interneuron subtypes that are known to

577
00:24:30,806 --> 00:24:34,364
account for over 90% of the inhibitory

578
00:24:34,412 --> 00:24:37,312
interneurons in the primate brain. And

579
00:24:37,366 --> 00:24:40,596
those inhibitory neuron subtypes are

580
00:24:40,698 --> 00:24:43,312
parvalbumin positive calretin,

581
00:24:43,376 --> 00:24:45,632
calbindin positive. And importantly,

582
00:24:45,696 --> 00:24:47,764
previous computational modeling work had

583
00:24:47,802 --> 00:24:50,884
really singled out the parvalbumin cell

584
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:53,304
class as the critical class for

585
00:24:53,342 --> 00:24:55,012
generating these gamma oscillations

586
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:58,120
because of their fast time constants and

587
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,536
strong synapses onto the cell bodies of

588
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:03,844
excitatory neurons. And so again we

589
00:25:03,982 --> 00:25:06,664
perform this painstaking histological

590
00:25:06,712 --> 00:25:10,172
analysis where you perform different

591
00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:13,128
stains, mounting cover, slipping

592
00:25:13,224 --> 00:25:16,788
microscopy, semiautomated thresholding

593
00:25:16,824 --> 00:25:19,664
and cell counting in order to be able to

594
00:25:19,702 --> 00:25:22,544
then really have a quantitative view on

595
00:25:22,582 --> 00:25:25,888
which layers have which cell types that

596
00:25:25,894 --> 00:25:28,144
are most associated with these

597
00:25:28,182 --> 00:25:30,564
frequencies. And so here's what this

598
00:25:30,602 --> 00:25:32,944
data then looks like. We have the gamma

599
00:25:32,992 --> 00:25:36,084
and alpha beta electrophysiology here,

600
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:39,764
and then at the same time we have the

601
00:25:39,802 --> 00:25:42,200
presence of different neuron types with

602
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,210
the three inhibitory cell classes here.

603
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,376
And then we can perform an analysis to

604
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:51,224
determine which of these cell classes is

605
00:25:51,262 --> 00:25:53,684
most strongly associated with the gamma.

606
00:25:53,812 --> 00:25:57,036
And here's what we found that in both

607
00:25:57,058 --> 00:25:59,596
the low gamma and the high gamma across

608
00:25:59,778 --> 00:26:03,276
over 14 regions, what we found quite

609
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:07,056
significantly was that it was really the

610
00:26:07,078 --> 00:26:10,224
parvalbumin cell counts shown here

611
00:26:10,342 --> 00:26:12,800
as a function of laminar depth that were

612
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,312
giving us the best explanation for the

613
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:18,284
laminar profile of the gamma rhythmic

614
00:26:18,332 --> 00:26:20,736
activity. Both when you take a very wide

615
00:26:20,768 --> 00:26:25,012
band as well as when you perform a low

616
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:27,156
versus high gamma split, it comes out in

617
00:26:27,178 --> 00:26:30,900
both ways. So how can this inform

618
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:33,428
computational models of oscillations?

619
00:26:33,524 --> 00:26:35,592
Well, here's what we think is going on

620
00:26:35,646 --> 00:26:38,772
then. We collaborated with several

621
00:26:38,836 --> 00:26:41,880
people here on this work, including

622
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,572
Sanchez Toto et al and

623
00:26:46,626 --> 00:26:49,356
computational modelers in Spain. And

624
00:26:49,378 --> 00:26:51,736
what we did was we performed an analysis

625
00:26:51,848 --> 00:26:54,892
where we took different

626
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,896
interneurons with different types of

627
00:26:56,918 --> 00:26:58,576
connectivity. So these PV, these

628
00:26:58,598 --> 00:27:00,864
parvalbumin interneurons were modeled as

629
00:27:00,982 --> 00:27:04,544
having strong inhibitory connections to

630
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:07,632
the pyramidal cell class and strong self

631
00:27:07,686 --> 00:27:09,684
inhibition, which has been important for

632
00:27:09,722 --> 00:27:12,324
gamma oscillations previously. And when

633
00:27:12,362 --> 00:27:13,988
you hook them up in these particular

634
00:27:14,074 --> 00:27:17,396
ways, sure enough, and you measure the

635
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:20,116
spectral output of these neurons, these

636
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,896
p two neurons, superficial parameter

637
00:27:22,928 --> 00:27:24,452
neurons, sure enough, they express

638
00:27:24,516 --> 00:27:27,080
gamma. And when you put in different

639
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,072
types of interneurons with slower time

640
00:27:30,126 --> 00:27:31,544
constants and different types of

641
00:27:31,582 --> 00:27:33,396
connections to these deep layer neurons,

642
00:27:33,428 --> 00:27:35,244
sure enough, they come out with more

643
00:27:35,282 --> 00:27:39,100
alpha beta oscillations. So indeed,

644
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,060
this anatomical work could produce even

645
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:47,160
more in the future, even more

646
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,976
accurate models of how these

647
00:27:48,998 --> 00:27:51,904
interneurons work together and with

648
00:27:51,942 --> 00:27:54,124
parameter cells across different layers

649
00:27:54,252 --> 00:27:56,524
in order to express these oscillations.

650
00:27:56,572 --> 00:27:59,170
So this is really a work in progress and

651
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,276
one of the first steps towards this and

652
00:28:02,298 --> 00:28:04,292
our ultimate aim is to really pull

653
00:28:04,346 --> 00:28:07,156
together this rich anatomical and

654
00:28:07,178 --> 00:28:09,524
neurophysiological data together with

655
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,944
computational models to be able to

656
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:14,056
approximate the laminar structure of

657
00:28:14,078 --> 00:28:16,120
cortex to a better and better degree.

658
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,016
This next part here, I'll talk a little

659
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:23,924
bit about a causal test now of the

660
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:27,336
predictive routing model with propofol

661
00:28:27,368 --> 00:28:28,732
anesthesia. So this will be the last

662
00:28:28,786 --> 00:28:32,076
part of the talk here. And so we

663
00:28:32,098 --> 00:28:34,124
were interested in anesthesia. I got

664
00:28:34,162 --> 00:28:35,870
interested in anesthesia actually

665
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,244
through my work and contact with Jake

666
00:28:39,292 --> 00:28:41,264
Donahue over here, who is a very

667
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:44,508
talented MD PhD student at MIT

668
00:28:44,604 --> 00:28:47,744
at the time and was

669
00:28:47,782 --> 00:28:50,304
being co mentored by Emory Brown and

670
00:28:50,422 --> 00:28:52,704
Earl Miller, who was also my mentor.

671
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:55,124
And so we became interested in this

672
00:28:55,162 --> 00:28:57,204
topic for the following reason. Well,

673
00:28:57,242 --> 00:29:00,132
first of all, as surprising as this may

674
00:29:00,186 --> 00:29:03,316
seem, if you go into a surgical clinic

675
00:29:03,348 --> 00:29:06,036
and you're administered an anesthetic

676
00:29:06,068 --> 00:29:08,184
such as propofol, well, it turns out

677
00:29:08,222 --> 00:29:11,848
that the anesthesiologist may not know

678
00:29:11,934 --> 00:29:15,476
exactly the cortical mechanisms and the

679
00:29:15,518 --> 00:29:17,804
systems level mechanisms for how that

680
00:29:17,842 --> 00:29:21,196
anesthetic is actually working in the

681
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,932
brain. And it's actually to this day

682
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:27,936
remains more often than

683
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:31,088
not the case that there's actually no

684
00:29:31,174 --> 00:29:33,324
intraoperative monitoring of brain

685
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:36,496
state. It's far and few between the

686
00:29:36,518 --> 00:29:38,304
anesthesiologists that are actually

687
00:29:38,342 --> 00:29:40,756
doing that. And so Emory Brown, who's an

688
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:42,436
anesthesiologist himself, is really

689
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:46,496
pushing for more and more adoption

690
00:29:46,688 --> 00:29:50,512
of simple tools like EEG and spectral

691
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:53,796
estimation methods by the clinic.

692
00:29:53,908 --> 00:29:56,164
And so our work was clinically

693
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:59,384
motivated, but it was also motivated by

694
00:29:59,582 --> 00:30:01,556
the ability to test this predictive

695
00:30:01,588 --> 00:30:04,872
routing model when activity,

696
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,904
especially in prefrontal cortex areas,

697
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:09,932
is relatively silenced. And so in these

698
00:30:09,986 --> 00:30:12,828
experiments, we administered propofol to

699
00:30:12,914 --> 00:30:15,324
again these rhesus macaques and we

700
00:30:15,362 --> 00:30:17,660
recorded brain activity there's, these

701
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,932
local field potentials and spiking

702
00:30:19,996 --> 00:30:22,272
activity in the awake state as well as

703
00:30:22,326 --> 00:30:25,264
in the unconscious state. And what we

704
00:30:25,302 --> 00:30:27,004
first noticed is that in the unconscious

705
00:30:27,052 --> 00:30:29,436
state, there were these slow rhythmic

706
00:30:29,468 --> 00:30:33,136
bouts of activity at about 1 cycle per

707
00:30:33,158 --> 00:30:35,428
second, or slightly little faster, a

708
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,876
little slower than that. Those are the

709
00:30:37,898 --> 00:30:39,424
slow frequencies. And these slow

710
00:30:39,472 --> 00:30:42,436
frequencies organize these massive bouts

711
00:30:42,468 --> 00:30:45,144
of spiking, which could sometimes be

712
00:30:45,182 --> 00:30:47,320
very synchronous across cortex,

713
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,064
but that there were long periods of

714
00:30:51,102 --> 00:30:53,176
silence in between these bouts of

715
00:30:53,198 --> 00:30:57,340
spiking in the unconscious state. And so

716
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,436
propofol anesthesia, we found is

717
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,452
accompanied by, again, these strong

718
00:31:01,506 --> 00:31:04,104
increases in slow frequency activity,

719
00:31:04,232 --> 00:31:06,044
which create alternating on and off

720
00:31:06,082 --> 00:31:08,684
periods for spiking. There's reduced

721
00:31:08,732 --> 00:31:10,892
spiking activity throughout the network,

722
00:31:10,956 --> 00:31:12,576
but the strongest reductions are in

723
00:31:12,598 --> 00:31:15,996
prefrontal cortex. And sensory areas

724
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:18,432
are relatively spared. So they're still

725
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:20,816
quite reduced in their excitability in

726
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:22,588
the unconscious state, but prefrontal

727
00:31:22,604 --> 00:31:25,972
cortex is more inhibited. There is also,

728
00:31:26,026 --> 00:31:27,972
we found reductions in cross area

729
00:31:28,026 --> 00:31:30,368
synchrony and very pronounced reductions

730
00:31:30,384 --> 00:31:33,200
in the alpha beta band. And so as a

731
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,672
result, we thought we could actually use

732
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:37,796
this model, this propofol anesthetic

733
00:31:37,828 --> 00:31:40,068
model, in order to test certain aspects

734
00:31:40,084 --> 00:31:42,420
of predictive routing. Because what's

735
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,124
going on here? We have lower order

736
00:31:44,162 --> 00:31:47,384
cortex that's hypothesized to feed

737
00:31:47,432 --> 00:31:48,924
forward prediction errors to higher

738
00:31:48,962 --> 00:31:52,748
order cortex. And in turn,

739
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:55,340
these higher order areas might feed back

740
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:58,016
their predictions. But as a result of

741
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:00,544
propofol, these higher order areas are

742
00:32:00,742 --> 00:32:04,236
profoundly impaired and very reduced

743
00:32:04,268 --> 00:32:06,428
in their spiking activity. And the alpha

744
00:32:06,444 --> 00:32:09,436
beta rhythm is also the synchrony

745
00:32:09,468 --> 00:32:11,900
between areas is highly reduced. So

746
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,620
what's going to happen in this case?

747
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,796
Well, if you think from the point of

748
00:32:15,818 --> 00:32:18,292
view of simply everything is going down,

749
00:32:18,426 --> 00:32:21,236
then sensory areas in a response to an

750
00:32:21,258 --> 00:32:22,836
unpredictable stimulus should also just

751
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,648
go down. But if you think from a

752
00:32:24,654 --> 00:32:26,164
predictive coding or a predictive

753
00:32:26,212 --> 00:32:28,328
routing point of view, the function of

754
00:32:28,334 --> 00:32:29,992
these higher order areas is to create

755
00:32:30,046 --> 00:32:32,596
feedback predictions that inhibit

756
00:32:32,628 --> 00:32:34,684
activity. So in the absence of those

757
00:32:34,722 --> 00:32:37,932
feedback inhibitory activities, you

758
00:32:37,986 --> 00:32:41,036
might actually hypothesize that there

759
00:32:41,058 --> 00:32:43,464
would be an enhancement of the feed

760
00:32:43,512 --> 00:32:45,340
forward response when that feed forward

761
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,936
response is characterized by an

762
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:50,156
unpredictable stimulus or prediction

763
00:32:50,188 --> 00:32:52,864
error. And so we sought to test this out

764
00:32:52,902 --> 00:32:54,396
using the simple sensory prediction

765
00:32:54,428 --> 00:32:58,952
paradigm where we have a tone stimuli.

766
00:32:59,116 --> 00:33:01,124
These tone stimuli could either be

767
00:33:01,162 --> 00:33:02,964
repeated or occasionally there could be

768
00:33:03,002 --> 00:33:04,580
an oddball stimulus.

769
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,196
And what we would expect is that there

770
00:33:10,218 --> 00:33:12,420
would be enhanced feedback predictions

771
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,944
when stimuli were repeatable and

772
00:33:16,142 --> 00:33:19,368
predicted, and that the occasion of an

773
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:21,524
oddball would signal an enhanced gamma

774
00:33:21,572 --> 00:33:25,592
feed forward signal. So we performed

775
00:33:25,656 --> 00:33:28,956
the auditory stimulation task, both in

776
00:33:28,978 --> 00:33:31,836
the awake state as well as after there

777
00:33:31,858 --> 00:33:34,024
was an administration of propofol

778
00:33:34,072 --> 00:33:36,604
leading to loss of consciousness. And

779
00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:38,960
here's what we found in the local state,

780
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,180
just as we found in the visual cortex

781
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,788
for an unpredictable visual stimulus,

782
00:33:43,964 --> 00:33:47,056
as in the visual cortex, so in the

783
00:33:47,078 --> 00:33:51,148
sensory cortex, my PhD student Sophie

784
00:33:51,324 --> 00:33:53,552
Shang, who performed this analysis,

785
00:33:53,696 --> 00:33:56,836
found an enhanced gamma. So right at the

786
00:33:56,858 --> 00:33:58,324
time of the local oddball. So we have

787
00:33:58,362 --> 00:34:00,788
time here on the x axis frequency on the

788
00:34:00,794 --> 00:34:04,116
y axis, and spectrogram hot colors

789
00:34:04,148 --> 00:34:07,252
mean more activity to an unpredictable

790
00:34:07,396 --> 00:34:09,396
stimulus. So there was an enhanced gamma

791
00:34:09,428 --> 00:34:11,668
response to this unpredictable stimulus,

792
00:34:11,844 --> 00:34:13,928
decreased alpha beta to the

793
00:34:13,934 --> 00:34:15,692
unpredictable stimulus. Or set another

794
00:34:15,746 --> 00:34:18,216
way, when the stimulus was predicted,

795
00:34:18,248 --> 00:34:20,616
there was more alpha beta. And here's

796
00:34:20,648 --> 00:34:23,276
what happened in the anesthetized state

797
00:34:23,378 --> 00:34:25,212
when we performed this exact same

798
00:34:25,266 --> 00:34:28,588
contrast, we lost the. Predictable alpha

799
00:34:28,604 --> 00:34:30,784
beta signal and instead everything was

800
00:34:30,822 --> 00:34:32,976
enhanced. So there was a decrease in

801
00:34:32,998 --> 00:34:36,316
frequency towards the low gamma

802
00:34:36,348 --> 00:34:39,952
range. So the cortex just essentially

803
00:34:40,016 --> 00:34:42,820
went into a constant ringing in the

804
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:45,652
gamma frequency range, which to our

805
00:34:45,706 --> 00:34:48,868
surprise was much stronger in power

806
00:34:49,034 --> 00:34:51,784
compared to the gamma that we saw being

807
00:34:51,822 --> 00:34:54,564
enhanced during an unpredictable

808
00:34:54,612 --> 00:34:56,856
stimulus in the awake state. And the way

809
00:34:56,878 --> 00:34:59,044
we interpret this is that in the absence

810
00:34:59,092 --> 00:35:02,676
of this inhibitory predictive alpha beta

811
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:04,776
signal, this gamma signal becomes

812
00:35:04,808 --> 00:35:08,844
uncontrolled and enhances itself in

813
00:35:08,882 --> 00:35:11,772
the local anesthetized state. Here in

814
00:35:11,826 --> 00:35:14,316
area TPT is a sensory area, should have

815
00:35:14,338 --> 00:35:17,244
mentioned that. So now to conclude,

816
00:35:17,372 --> 00:35:19,504
we propose predictive routing. So

817
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:20,528
predictive routing is a

818
00:35:20,534 --> 00:35:22,908
neurophysiologically inspired

819
00:35:23,004 --> 00:35:25,260
implementation of predictive coding,

820
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,792
which stresses the importance of these

821
00:35:27,846 --> 00:35:30,256
alpha beta signals for implementing

822
00:35:30,288 --> 00:35:33,184
predictions and inhibiting sensory areas

823
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:35,044
and areas of the brain that are

824
00:35:35,082 --> 00:35:38,036
experiencing a predictable stimulus. In

825
00:35:38,058 --> 00:35:40,784
the absence of that, you get an enhanced

826
00:35:40,832 --> 00:35:44,520
feed forward gamma output. And this

827
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:47,508
distinction between gamma and beta

828
00:35:47,684 --> 00:35:49,924
across layers we found was ubiquitous

829
00:35:49,972 --> 00:35:51,912
across cortex, really suggesting that

830
00:35:51,966 --> 00:35:55,416
something like this may in fact be truly

831
00:35:55,448 --> 00:35:57,896
a canonical circuit motif that's

832
00:35:57,928 --> 00:35:59,660
repeated across the brain.

833
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,136
And these alphabetarhmic predictive

834
00:36:04,168 --> 00:36:06,864
preparation or inhibition we found, we

835
00:36:06,902 --> 00:36:09,084
observed was lost in the unconscious

836
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:12,016
state, with unconsciousness being

837
00:36:12,118 --> 00:36:15,036
mediated by propofol. By the way, it's

838
00:36:15,068 --> 00:36:18,508
one of the most often used anesthetics,

839
00:36:18,684 --> 00:36:21,730
and that as a result of this loss of

840
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,676
predictive alpha beta, there was an

841
00:36:24,698 --> 00:36:26,436
enhanced gamma modulation to these

842
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:28,980
unpredictable inputs. In other words,

843
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:32,512
the sensory cortex was in a disinhibited

844
00:36:32,576 --> 00:36:34,616
state. And so with that, I'd like to

845
00:36:34,638 --> 00:36:36,904
thank my many collaborators and the

846
00:36:36,942 --> 00:36:39,096
Bostos lab at Vanderbilt, as well as

847
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:41,192
collaborators on the anatomy and

848
00:36:41,246 --> 00:36:44,412
collaborators at MIT, as well as my

849
00:36:44,466 --> 00:36:47,836
financial support. And lastly, we just

850
00:36:47,858 --> 00:36:49,692
started the lab about two years ago,

851
00:36:49,826 --> 00:36:52,908
we're still in recruiting stage, so you

852
00:36:52,914 --> 00:36:57,260
guys can check out my website, my ex

853
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:00,848
Twitter feed, and email me if interested

854
00:37:00,934 --> 00:37:03,104
in contributing to this line of

855
00:37:03,142 --> 00:37:05,616
research. And so with that, I'll turn it

856
00:37:05,638 --> 00:37:07,392
over in case there are any questions.

857
00:37:07,526 --> 00:37:08,880
Thank you for your attention.

858
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,980
Awesome. Thank you andre, I'll just ask

859
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,664
one quick question from the chat, dave

860
00:37:15,712 --> 00:37:18,896
Douglas asks, does propofol

861
00:37:19,008 --> 00:37:20,736
change the activity of neuronal

862
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:23,530
microtubules in any interesting way?

863
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,436
Thanks Andre. I'll just ask one question

864
00:37:32,538 --> 00:37:35,492
from the chat Dave Douglas asks, does

865
00:37:35,546 --> 00:37:38,276
propofol change the activity of neuronal

866
00:37:38,308 --> 00:37:40,730
microtubes in any interesting way?

867
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:46,740
I haven't looked into the microtube

868
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,176
kind of hypothesis, that's one of the

869
00:37:49,198 --> 00:37:52,412
hypotheses advocated for many years

870
00:37:52,466 --> 00:37:55,630
by people like Stuart Hammerhoff, and

871
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:01,420
there has been some recent work done by

872
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,576
George Masure, I believe, and so you

873
00:38:04,598 --> 00:38:06,700
should go check out some of his papers

874
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,824
on that topic, but I haven't looked into

875
00:38:09,862 --> 00:38:13,504
that. And I remain somewhat skeptical to

876
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:17,812
the quantal explanation for

877
00:38:17,866 --> 00:38:21,764
consciousness, but mostly because the

878
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:24,832
mechanism doesn't appear at first glance

879
00:38:24,896 --> 00:38:29,240
to be very biologically reasonable.

880
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,856
And also that there's essentially not

881
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:34,344
very much data on it, but that may

882
00:38:34,382 --> 00:38:38,552
change in the coming years. So something

883
00:38:38,606 --> 00:38:41,724
to look out for. Great. One other

884
00:38:41,762 --> 00:38:45,070
question more generally, how do you see

885
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,296
experimental work in the active

886
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:50,332
inference ecosystem, and how do you see

887
00:38:50,386 --> 00:38:53,856
the synthesis of theoretical and in

888
00:38:53,878 --> 00:38:56,256
principle, work with this kind of real

889
00:38:56,358 --> 00:38:59,696
wet lab and real recordings on the

890
00:38:59,718 --> 00:39:01,904
neurons type analysis that you're doing

891
00:39:01,942 --> 00:39:05,280
here? Yeah, so it's a great question.

892
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:07,316
I think that what we need to be doing as

893
00:39:07,338 --> 00:39:10,000
a community is having more interactions

894
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,088
between theorists and experimentalists.

895
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,996
And so we wouldn't have performed, for

896
00:39:15,018 --> 00:39:17,316
example, this experiment here if we

897
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:20,010
hadn't already been inspired by

898
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,304
biological and theoretical models of

899
00:39:23,342 --> 00:39:26,308
predictive coding and of active

900
00:39:26,324 --> 00:39:28,024
inference as well. And so that's really

901
00:39:28,062 --> 00:39:32,204
what we need, is to make not

902
00:39:32,242 --> 00:39:35,612
only hypotheses that are turned into

903
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:38,248
great theoretical and computational

904
00:39:38,424 --> 00:39:41,784
infrastructures and models,

905
00:39:41,832 --> 00:39:44,496
but we also need to be thinking about if

906
00:39:44,518 --> 00:39:46,592
we care about the biology and we care

907
00:39:46,646 --> 00:39:49,388
about trying to figure out the brain,

908
00:39:49,484 --> 00:39:51,676
then we should also be trying to map

909
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:54,672
those things onto neurobiology and

910
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,632
psychology. Right? And so that involves

911
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,756
them both considering the

912
00:40:00,778 --> 00:40:03,588
neurobiological elements that may

913
00:40:03,674 --> 00:40:06,816
implement and mediate active inference

914
00:40:06,848 --> 00:40:09,352
in the brain, as well as the

915
00:40:09,406 --> 00:40:11,924
psychological and cognitive constructs

916
00:40:11,972 --> 00:40:14,360
that we think are going to be

917
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:17,892
particularly sensitive to capture

918
00:40:18,036 --> 00:40:21,820
certain elements of the theory. And so

919
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:26,088
I remain very welcoming

920
00:40:26,264 --> 00:40:30,124
to that type of and in

921
00:40:30,162 --> 00:40:32,620
fact, there's going to be a postdoc

922
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,724
joining the lab soon, eli Sinesh,

923
00:40:35,852 --> 00:40:39,196
who has been working very deeply

924
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,136
in the active inference community. And

925
00:40:41,158 --> 00:40:43,184
so we'll have an opportunity there to

926
00:40:43,302 --> 00:40:45,732
both work on theory guided data

927
00:40:45,786 --> 00:40:47,812
analysis, but also perform more

928
00:40:47,866 --> 00:40:50,224
theoretically guided experimental

929
00:40:50,272 --> 00:40:55,092
designs that can go further into

930
00:40:55,146 --> 00:40:57,616
the neurobiological implementation. And

931
00:40:57,658 --> 00:41:00,120
so this was here what I've presented

932
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,888
really simply the first and small,

933
00:41:02,974 --> 00:41:06,664
somewhat step towards linking the

934
00:41:06,702 --> 00:41:09,160
neurobiological implementation level

935
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:11,860
with the algorithmic and computational

936
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,316
level of predictive coding and active

937
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:18,452
inference. And so the more interactions

938
00:41:18,516 --> 00:41:20,376
that we can have between the

939
00:41:20,398 --> 00:41:23,490
communities, the better that

940
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,856
will be. I think what would

941
00:41:27,878 --> 00:41:29,948
be somewhat of a shame is if the active

942
00:41:29,964 --> 00:41:32,880
inference community went way too far

943
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:37,524
into just pure theory and

944
00:41:37,562 --> 00:41:41,504
delved into increasing

945
00:41:41,552 --> 00:41:44,116
areas that were divorced from the

946
00:41:44,138 --> 00:41:46,676
biology. So that's, of course, one of

947
00:41:46,698 --> 00:41:50,456
the great critiques, right, of the

948
00:41:50,478 --> 00:41:52,520
deep learning and more machine learning,

949
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,356
purely machine learning driven

950
00:41:54,468 --> 00:41:58,824
approaches, is that they

951
00:41:58,862 --> 00:42:00,176
took a little bit of biological

952
00:42:00,228 --> 00:42:03,292
inspiration, but then started using

953
00:42:03,346 --> 00:42:05,564
algorithms like Backprop that were very

954
00:42:05,602 --> 00:42:08,636
biologically unrealistic. And so, of

955
00:42:08,658 --> 00:42:11,288
course, active inference is a response

956
00:42:11,304 --> 00:42:13,744
to that in certain ways. But in order to

957
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:16,976
continue being that, I think that there

958
00:42:16,998 --> 00:42:19,484
needs to be indeed a tight dialogue

959
00:42:19,612 --> 00:42:23,084
between experimentalists and theorists.

960
00:42:23,132 --> 00:42:25,080
And so if you have any particular ideas,

961
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,332
I'd be happy to hear them. Please reach

962
00:42:27,386 --> 00:42:32,260
out to me by email or

963
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:36,230
through X, which you can find here

964
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,680
on the slide. That's really cool.

965
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,344
That's awesome. You're going to be

966
00:42:42,382 --> 00:42:43,960
working with Eli. And one final

967
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:46,984
question. This is from Alexandra. Is it

968
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:49,384
possible to detect the contribution of

969
00:42:49,422 --> 00:42:52,476
Glia to the neural firing rate of the

970
00:42:52,498 --> 00:42:53,820
field potentials?

971
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,332
That is a question that I have not

972
00:42:58,386 --> 00:43:01,772
considered yet. So we normally do not

973
00:43:01,826 --> 00:43:05,324
consider Glia to be active

974
00:43:05,372 --> 00:43:08,592
in the network, but of course, that is

975
00:43:08,646 --> 00:43:10,704
likely to be an oversimplification. We

976
00:43:10,742 --> 00:43:12,044
know that they can have interactions

977
00:43:12,092 --> 00:43:14,272
with neurons. We know that they can also

978
00:43:14,326 --> 00:43:16,900
have different levels of excitability,

979
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,996
and of course, that's how they can

980
00:43:19,018 --> 00:43:22,644
regulate neurons metabolically. But as

981
00:43:22,682 --> 00:43:26,240
far as the contributions of Glia

982
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,380
directly to the local field potential,

983
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:33,284
I am not aware of how to determine

984
00:43:33,332 --> 00:43:35,124
whether or not they make a significant

985
00:43:35,172 --> 00:43:39,044
contribution. I actually haven't

986
00:43:39,092 --> 00:43:41,816
seen any work on that. But thank you for

987
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:45,050
the question. It's always good to

988
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,592
reconsider our core assumptions, right,

989
00:43:49,646 --> 00:43:52,768
about the cell types that

990
00:43:52,774 --> 00:43:56,448
are most important to capture. So

991
00:43:56,614 --> 00:43:57,952
certainly something to think about.

992
00:43:58,006 --> 00:44:00,416
Thank you. Thank you. All right. Thank

993
00:44:00,438 --> 00:44:02,656
you, Andre. Super cool work. And good

994
00:44:02,678 --> 00:44:09,580
luck with everything. Till next bye.
