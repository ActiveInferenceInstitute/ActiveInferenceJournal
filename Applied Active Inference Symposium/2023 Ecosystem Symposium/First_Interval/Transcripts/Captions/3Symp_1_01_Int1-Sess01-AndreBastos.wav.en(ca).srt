00:00:06,714 --> 00:00:08,342
Daniel: Hello and welcome, everyone.

2
00:00:08,712 --> 00:00:10,159
This is the third applied active

3
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:12,389
inference symposium enacting ecosystems

4
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:14,536
of shared intelligence.

5
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:17,854
It is August 22, 2023.

6
00:00:17,874 --> 00:00:20,102
We have a lot of really awesome

7
00:00:20,102 --> 00:00:22,389
presentations and sessions coming up in

8
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:25,654
the first interval and in the second

9
00:00:25,654 --> 00:00:26,743
interval.

10
00:00:26,754 --> 00:00:29,034
So let's just get right into it with our

11
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:30,118
first talk.

12
00:00:30,123 --> 00:00:32,308
This will be by Andre Bastos.

13
00:00:32,314 --> 00:00:34,535
So, Andre, thank you for joining and

14
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,719
looking forward to your talk.

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,011
Andre: Thank you very well, Daniel.

16
00:00:39,017 --> 00:00:41,242
And thank you for the other organizers of

17
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:43,434
the Active Inference Conference and

18
00:00:43,434 --> 00:00:44,528
Symposium here.

19
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:47,806
I'm glad to be talking to you guys today

20
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:48,907
about my work.

21
00:00:48,922 --> 00:00:50,106
The title of the presentation is

22
00:00:50,106 --> 00:00:52,324
multilaminar Multi Area Recordings and

23
00:00:52,324 --> 00:00:54,549
the Non Human primate that's these guys

24
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:56,784
right here, macaque monkeys, suggest that

25
00:00:56,784 --> 00:00:58,991
predictive coding is implemented via

26
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:00,536
predictive routing.

27
00:01:00,552 --> 00:01:02,781
And so what do we mean by these things?

28
00:01:02,786 --> 00:01:06,131
Well, just as a point of introduction, I'

29
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:09,450
'd like to start by just saying that I

30
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,787
started out working with Karl Friston in

31
00:01:12,787 --> 00:01:16,132
about 2010, and we were really interested

32
00:01:16,132 --> 00:01:19,468
in trying to map the neurobiology of the

33
00:01:19,468 --> 00:01:23,813
predictive coding circuits that have been

34
00:01:23,813 --> 00:01:26,150
theorized and hypothesized onto cortical

35
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,478
laminar architecture, which you can see

36
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:30,571
here.

37
00:01:30,586 --> 00:01:33,863
And in that work with him, we proposed

38
00:01:33,863 --> 00:01:36,119
that different layers and different

39
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,382
oscillations were involved in either

40
00:01:38,382 --> 00:01:41,645
capturing and calculating prediction

41
00:01:41,645 --> 00:01:43,827
error or predictions.

42
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:45,009
And so what we do in my lab and I

43
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:48,032
recently started as an assistant

44
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,061
professor in the Department of Psychology

45
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:52,073
at Vanderbilt.

46
00:01:52,074 --> 00:01:54,095
And so what we do is we train rhesus

47
00:01:54,095 --> 00:01:56,119
macaque monkeys on tasks which are more

48
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:58,138
or less predictable and that have

49
00:01:58,138 --> 00:02:01,102
different sensory elements that are more

50
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:03,125
or less predictable, and we'll get into

51
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,141
what that looks like.

52
00:02:05,142 --> 00:02:08,171
And then we use multilaminar probes, so

53
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:10,196
high density probes with dozens or

54
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:13,222
hundreds of contacts that can record

55
00:02:13,222 --> 00:02:15,242
across different layers.

56
00:02:15,243 --> 00:02:17,269
And so this is a beautiful drawing here

57
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:20,297
of what the layers look like of Cortex by

58
00:02:20,297 --> 00:02:23,325
Santiago Ramoni Cajal over 100 years ago.

59
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:23,326
.

60
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:25,348
And you can see this really beautiful

61
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:27,361
layered architecture.

62
00:02:27,362 --> 00:02:30,393
Layer 1234 is this dense one.

63
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:32,414
In the middle five, you get these large

64
00:02:32,414 --> 00:02:34,434
pyramidal neurons, and then six on the

65
00:02:34,434 --> 00:02:34,439
bottom.

66
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,462
And so we're interested in my lab

67
00:02:37,462 --> 00:02:39,489
primarily at two levels of explanation.

68
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,525
The first is, what do these neurons spike

69
00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:43,529
to?

70
00:02:44,529 --> 00:02:46,550
What makes them fire action potentials

71
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,560
and excites them?

72
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:49,582
And do they get more or less excitable

73
00:02:49,582 --> 00:02:51,603
depending on how predictable stimuli

74
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:51,606
are?

75
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:53,628
And second, how do they oscillate?

76
00:02:53,628 --> 00:02:56,655
In which frequency bands does rhythmic

77
00:02:56,655 --> 00:02:59,683
activity tend to cause them to fire more

78
00:02:59,683 --> 00:03:01,643
or less action potentials?

79
00:03:01,643 --> 00:03:03,666
And so we record across layers in one

80
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,691
area over here, but we might put in our

81
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:08,717
electrodes in several other areas so that

82
00:03:08,717 --> 00:03:11,742
we can also capture aspects of cortical

83
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:12,754
communication.

84
00:03:12,755 --> 00:03:14,773
And these oscillations in this

85
00:03:14,773 --> 00:03:16,793
communication, we think, is really

86
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:18,815
intimately linked to the interaction

87
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:20,838
between inhibitory cells, these cells in

88
00:03:20,838 --> 00:03:23,861
red here, and excitatory neurons, these

89
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:25,883
cells in black that I've drawn.

90
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:28,909
Okay, so without further ado, let's just

91
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:29,925
dive right into it here.

92
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:32,953
So here's the outline of my talk in part

93
00:03:32,953 --> 00:03:34,979
one we're going to be talking about first

94
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:37,004
an overview of what do we actually mean

95
00:03:37,004 --> 00:03:39,028
by this predictive coding model and how

96
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:42,054
do we think it may be mapped onto cortex

97
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:44,076
and paying special attention to the

98
00:03:44,076 --> 00:03:46,090
neurophysiology.

99
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:49,121
So here's the bird's eye overview of

100
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:52,154
predictive coding at the level that maybe

101
00:03:52,154 --> 00:03:55,187
a neurobiologist or a cognitive scientist

102
00:03:55,187 --> 00:03:59,220
or a cognitive neuroscientist might need

103
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,189
to know about in order to be able to

104
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:04,215
apply it to their own work.

105
00:04:04,217 --> 00:04:07,241
And so, here's what I mean by predictive

106
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:09,262
coding, that there's a hypothesized

107
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:11,287
circuit that is especially rich in higher

108
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:12,296
order areas.

109
00:04:12,296 --> 00:04:14,319
So here's like the front of the brain,

110
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,340
which learns about these statistical

111
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,362
regularities of the world and creates

112
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:21,385
predictions about what is going to be

113
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:23,407
seen and felt and touched and so on in

114
00:04:23,407 --> 00:04:25,428
the next moment in time and in this

115
00:04:25,428 --> 00:04:27,446
moment in time, and sends those

116
00:04:27,446 --> 00:04:30,471
predictions to earlier parts of the brain.

117
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:30,476
.

118
00:04:30,476 --> 00:04:32,499
So, to lower order cortex receive these

119
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:34,519
predictions and sensory inputs, the

120
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,542
inputs coming from the eyes and ears and

121
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:39,566
all of our sensorium is then compared to

122
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:41,583
this top down prediction.

123
00:04:41,584 --> 00:04:43,601
And if there's a mismatch, that's a

124
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:45,620
prediction error and the prediction error

125
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:45,629
is sped forward.

126
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,655
It's a mismatch response and it can be

127
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,677
used to drive models, drive these

128
00:04:50,677 --> 00:04:53,703
internal representations in order to be

129
00:04:53,703 --> 00:04:55,727
better over time and to make better

130
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:56,737
predictions.

131
00:04:56,739 --> 00:04:59,766
And in particular, these prediction

132
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,737
errors are hypothesized to be housed in

133
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:05,761
superficial layers of cortex.

134
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,785
And so that's a hypothesis that we've

135
00:05:07,785 --> 00:05:09,808
been able to test now with these laminar

136
00:05:09,808 --> 00:05:10,816
electrodes.

137
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:13,843
So let's see how our experimental design

138
00:05:13,843 --> 00:05:16,869
worked in order for us to be able to look

139
00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:18,896
at the difference between predictable and

140
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:20,917
unpredictable sensory stimuli.

141
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:22,938
So we train monkeys on what's called a

142
00:05:22,938 --> 00:05:24,954
delayed match to sample task.

143
00:05:24,955 --> 00:05:27,980
It's a classic task of working memory,

144
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,005
where monkeys are trained to fixate on

145
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:31,023
the center of the screen.

146
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:33,043
Then there's a visual stimulus, in this

147
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:35,060
case a car stimulus that's shown.

148
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,077
There's a brief delay in which that

149
00:05:36,077 --> 00:05:38,097
stimulus has to be held in working memory.

150
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:38,097
.

151
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:41,125
Then the animal is tested on which of the

152
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,148
three items was in working memory.

153
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:46,177
The animal makes a correct response when

154
00:05:46,177 --> 00:05:49,207
they saka, in this case to the upper left,

155
00:05:49,207 --> 00:05:52,234
, to indicate that the car stimulus was

156
00:05:52,234 --> 00:05:53,243
last shown.

157
00:05:53,244 --> 00:05:56,272
So we then manipulated the predictability

158
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,297
of this information that was to enter

159
00:05:58,297 --> 00:06:01,263
working memory in the following way.

160
00:06:01,264 --> 00:06:04,291
For 50 trials in a row, we would either

161
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:07,320
keep the sample stimulus constant, so car,

162
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,348
, car, and that's being depicted by the a

163
00:06:09,348 --> 00:06:12,376
here, or in another context, there would

164
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:15,404
be an unpredictable sampling regime where

165
00:06:15,404 --> 00:06:18,431
either the car orange or green could be

166
00:06:18,431 --> 00:06:20,455
sampled at any moment in time.

167
00:06:20,455 --> 00:06:22,476
So the animals went back and forth in

168
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:24,495
being in a predictable context or an

169
00:06:24,495 --> 00:06:25,509
unpredictable context.

170
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:28,532
And then we asked the question, what does

171
00:06:28,532 --> 00:06:30,554
brain activity look like when the exact

172
00:06:30,554 --> 00:06:32,571
same stimulus is processed in a

173
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:33,587
predictable regime versus an

174
00:06:33,587 --> 00:06:35,601
unpredictable regime.

175
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:38,630
And in order to do this work, we

176
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,660
implanted these monkeys with multilaminar

177
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:41,667
probes.

178
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,694
So these are probes, again with these at

179
00:06:44,694 --> 00:06:47,720
that time that I did this work, about a

180
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,747
dozen or so or maybe up to 32 contacts.

181
00:06:49,747 --> 00:06:52,769
Nowadays we can go into the several

182
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:54,795
hundreds of contacts along a single probe.

183
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:54,796
.

184
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:56,818
We can use MRI guidance in order to

185
00:06:56,818 --> 00:06:59,840
position those probes perpendicular to

186
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,805
cortex such that they'll span each of the

187
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:03,827
six cortical layers, layer one through

188
00:07:03,827 --> 00:07:04,832
six.

189
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,857
Here you can see the white matter here

190
00:07:06,857 --> 00:07:07,861
below.

191
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:09,886
And then we sampled from different parts

192
00:07:09,886 --> 00:07:11,906
of both the visual cortex because,

193
00:07:11,906 --> 00:07:13,929
remember, those are the areas that might

194
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:16,952
issue prediction errors in the case of an

195
00:07:16,952 --> 00:07:18,974
unpredictable sample as well as higher

196
00:07:18,974 --> 00:07:20,997
order cortex which has been hypothesized

197
00:07:20,997 --> 00:07:23,021
to create these internal models that then

198
00:07:23,021 --> 00:07:24,035
issue predictions.

199
00:07:24,037 --> 00:07:26,052
So here's what we found.

200
00:07:26,053 --> 00:07:28,077
We first just analyzed the multiunit

201
00:07:28,077 --> 00:07:31,103
activity which is a measure of the spike

202
00:07:31,103 --> 00:07:31,107
rate.

203
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:34,138
So how many action potentials per unit of

204
00:07:34,138 --> 00:07:37,160
time are these neurons firing?

205
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:39,181
And what's being shown here is the

206
00:07:39,181 --> 00:07:41,202
multiunit activity as a difference

207
00:07:41,202 --> 00:07:42,219
between when that sample was

208
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:45,240
unpredictable minus predictable.

209
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:48,269
So positive activity means more activity

210
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:50,295
during an unpredictable sample I-E-A

211
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:53,323
violation of a prediction or a putative

212
00:07:53,323 --> 00:07:55,342
prediction error signal.

213
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:57,367
And all throughout the brain from V four,

214
00:07:57,367 --> 00:08:00,330
the sensory area all the way to these

215
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,354
higher order frontal parietal regions we

216
00:08:02,354 --> 00:08:04,377
saw, without any exception that neurons

217
00:08:04,377 --> 00:08:07,400
were much more excitable when they were

218
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,421
processing an unpredictable stimulus

219
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:11,444
compared to predictable stimulus.

220
00:08:11,446 --> 00:08:13,467
And also, not surprisingly, this started

221
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:15,487
already at the feed forward sweep of

222
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:17,507
activity such that these red bars here

223
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:19,527
indicate the start of significance.

224
00:08:19,528 --> 00:08:22,559
So sure enough, area V four was the first

225
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:24,575
to show significance.

226
00:08:24,576 --> 00:08:26,595
So more spiking to the unpredictable,

227
00:08:26,595 --> 00:08:27,604
over predictable.

228
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:29,628
And this activity fed forward up the

229
00:08:29,628 --> 00:08:31,641
cortical hierarchy.

230
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:34,678
Next, we looked not only at the firing

231
00:08:34,678 --> 00:08:37,704
rate of these neurons but also the local

232
00:08:37,704 --> 00:08:39,728
field potential which is informative

233
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,755
about the local oscillatory activity that'

234
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:43,764
's present.

235
00:08:43,764 --> 00:08:45,788
So you can think of these oscillations as

236
00:08:45,788 --> 00:08:47,808
massive waves of activity that are

237
00:08:47,808 --> 00:08:50,832
synchronous across a large population of

238
00:08:50,832 --> 00:08:52,853
neurons but of course, are produced

239
00:08:52,853 --> 00:08:54,873
through the interplay between these

240
00:08:54,873 --> 00:08:57,899
recurrent inhibitory bouts of activity.

241
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,914
And so, here's what we found.

242
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:01,881
We performed this power spectral analysis

243
00:09:01,881 --> 00:09:02,898
again comparing power in the

244
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:05,921
unpredictable case versus power in the

245
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:06,933
predictable case.

246
00:09:06,935 --> 00:09:08,957
And we did a percent change metric.

247
00:09:08,957 --> 00:09:11,980
Very simple percent change metric.

248
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,009
So again, what's shown here on the Y axis

249
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:16,030
is in positive, more power to

250
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,059
unpredictable samples and in the negative

251
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:21,085
values, more power to the predictable

252
00:09:21,085 --> 00:09:22,094
samples.

253
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,116
Now, what we saw in the gamma range so

254
00:09:24,116 --> 00:09:27,140
that's everywhere above about 30 or 40 Hz

255
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,163
again in all areas very strongly mirrored

256
00:09:29,163 --> 00:09:31,185
what we saw in the spiking activity.

257
00:09:31,186 --> 00:09:34,212
Namely, that there was more of this high

258
00:09:34,212 --> 00:09:36,238
frequency and also the classic low range

259
00:09:36,238 --> 00:09:38,259
frequency in the gamma range.

260
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:41,285
So in both the low gamma and high gamma

261
00:09:41,285 --> 00:09:44,312
ranges an enhancement of power during the

262
00:09:44,312 --> 00:09:45,326
unpredictable cues.

263
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:48,349
That was also the case in the theta band.

264
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:48,349
.

265
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,374
And this makes somewhat sense from the

266
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:52,398
point of view of neurophysiology that

267
00:09:52,398 --> 00:09:55,420
this theta frequency and this gamma

268
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,443
frequency, they very often track one

269
00:09:57,443 --> 00:10:00,412
another and do similar things in cortex.

270
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:01,428
Why exactly that is the case?

271
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:04,452
We actually don't know what the reason

272
00:10:04,452 --> 00:10:06,475
for that is, but that's an observation

273
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:08,499
that we've seen in many other tasks.

274
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,531
But what we saw in between the theta and

275
00:10:12,531 --> 00:10:15,561
the gamma bands was this other band at

276
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:17,588
between ten to about 20 or slightly

277
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:20,619
higher in frequency, this classic alpha

278
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:22,630
beta band.

279
00:10:22,631 --> 00:10:25,669
And this alpha beta band, this alpha beta

280
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:29,704
band acted in the exact opposite way.

281
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:31,721
Namely, there was more power to

282
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:33,740
predictable samples than to unpredictable

283
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:33,745
samples.

284
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:34,757
With one exception.

285
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:36,779
Area seven A was an exception.

286
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:40,815
It did have that canonical pattern in the

287
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:44,850
alpha band, but in the low beta band, it

288
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,878
was actually similar to gamma.

289
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,903
And we think that this might be a working

290
00:10:49,903 --> 00:10:50,918
memory update mechanism.

291
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,945
But for now, we are really stressing and

292
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,970
emphasizing the fact that across all of

293
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,994
these areas, you had this beta signal

294
00:10:58,994 --> 00:11:01,961
that was stronger to the predictable case,

295
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,980
, to the predictable sample.

296
00:11:03,985 --> 00:11:06,010
Okay, so next we had these laminar

297
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:06,019
electrodes.

298
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:09,042
So let's look at the difference between

299
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:11,063
what these neurons are doing when you

300
00:11:11,063 --> 00:11:13,085
record from the so called superficial

301
00:11:13,085 --> 00:11:15,107
layers of cortex versus the so called

302
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:17,122
deep layers of cortex.

303
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:19,144
So the superficial layers are layers two,

304
00:11:19,144 --> 00:11:19,148
three.

305
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:22,174
The deep layers are these layers five and

306
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:22,177
six.

307
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:24,197
These superficial layers, they are the

308
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:25,209
layers that feed forward.

309
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:28,232
So remember from that introductory slide

310
00:11:28,232 --> 00:11:30,252
that these are the layers that were

311
00:11:30,252 --> 00:11:32,273
hypothesized based on predictive coding

312
00:11:32,273 --> 00:11:34,294
theory to house the prediction error

313
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,314
neurons, because according to theory,

314
00:11:36,314 --> 00:11:38,336
those prediction error signals are sent

315
00:11:38,336 --> 00:11:40,357
in the feed forward direction.

316
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:43,384
So we then tested that in a second way,

317
00:11:43,384 --> 00:11:46,410
which was to test whether or not those

318
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,436
enhanced signals during unpredictable

319
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:51,462
samples are more present in layer two,

320
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:52,469
three.

321
00:11:52,471 --> 00:11:53,488
And that's exactly what we found in V

322
00:11:53,488 --> 00:11:54,491
four.

323
00:11:54,492 --> 00:11:57,520
So when we again take this spiking signal

324
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,542
and subtract unpredictable, minus

325
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:01,507
predictable spiking, we see that the

326
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:04,533
signal is more enhanced in superficial

327
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:05,547
layers of D four.

328
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:08,571
There was a trend towards that in PFC as

329
00:12:08,571 --> 00:12:10,596
well, but in D four, it was a significant

330
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:11,604
observation.

331
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,636
And furthermore, when we now look at the

332
00:12:14,636 --> 00:12:17,666
LFP gamma power, this power in the 40 to

333
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,698
90 Hz band, again, we do the power change.

334
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:20,699
.

335
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,722
So these positive signals mean there's an

336
00:12:23,722 --> 00:12:25,739
enhancement of gamma power to the

337
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:26,752
unpredictable signal.

338
00:12:26,753 --> 00:12:29,785
And again, now in both V four and PFC, it'

339
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:32,817
's the superficial layers that are having

340
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:35,848
more of this unpredictable signal again,

341
00:12:35,848 --> 00:12:39,879
and that's consistent with the theorized

342
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,908
type of circuitry for these canonical

343
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:42,918
circuits.

344
00:12:43,924 --> 00:12:46,953
Next, we were interested in whether or

345
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:49,982
not these power changes were blankets

346
00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:51,007
across the board that just overall

347
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:54,036
increase mu activity and GAM activity

348
00:12:54,036 --> 00:12:57,066
independent of the exact sample that was

349
00:12:57,066 --> 00:13:00,038
being shown or whether these signals were

350
00:13:00,038 --> 00:13:03,069
actually specific to the actual item that

351
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:06,090
was being predicted.

352
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:08,115
Because remember, in our task design,

353
00:13:08,115 --> 00:13:11,142
animals were for a large portion of time

354
00:13:11,142 --> 00:13:13,166
predicting that there should be a car

355
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,189
stimulus or predicting an orange or

356
00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:18,212
predicting the green stimulus.

357
00:13:18,212 --> 00:13:20,238
So in that particular task requirement,

358
00:13:20,238 --> 00:13:22,258
it wouldn't make sense if task

359
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:25,286
representations for all three stimuli all

360
00:13:25,286 --> 00:13:28,312
went up to an unpredictable stimuli that

361
00:13:28,312 --> 00:13:30,337
would be more consistent with just an

362
00:13:30,337 --> 00:13:32,356
overall arousal signal.

363
00:13:32,357 --> 00:13:34,378
But what we were next interested in is

364
00:13:34,378 --> 00:13:37,401
whether or not neurons that actually were

365
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:39,422
selective for the car, if it was those

366
00:13:39,422 --> 00:13:41,441
neurons in particular that had the

367
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:42,455
unpredictable signals.

368
00:13:43,463 --> 00:13:45,484
And what we found is that that was indeed

369
00:13:45,484 --> 00:13:45,489
the case.

370
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,514
So we performed the same analysis as

371
00:13:48,514 --> 00:13:50,539
before, LFP gamma power difference for

372
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,564
unpredictable, minus, predictable, but

373
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:56,591
now as a function of whether or not those

374
00:13:56,591 --> 00:13:58,617
neurons preferred the stimulus that was

375
00:13:58,617 --> 00:14:00,571
being predicted.

376
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:02,596
And what we found is that the preference

377
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:04,617
actually modulated this gamma band

378
00:14:04,617 --> 00:14:06,631
activity very strongly.

379
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:08,659
And so this unpredictable signal change

380
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:11,682
was more specific to neurons that

381
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:13,704
actually preferred that predicted

382
00:14:13,704 --> 00:14:16,733
stimulus, indicating that this prediction

383
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:19,761
was not acting as a blanket similar to an

384
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:21,785
arousal mechanism, but was actually

385
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:23,807
reaching down at the level of the

386
00:14:23,807 --> 00:14:26,835
representations that were specific to the

387
00:14:26,835 --> 00:14:29,864
thing that needed to be predicted.

388
00:14:29,865 --> 00:14:32,890
And that was even more the case in the

389
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,916
beta frequency range actually, where the

390
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,942
neurons that didn't encode the predicted

391
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:39,969
stimulus, they couldn't care less whether

392
00:14:39,969 --> 00:14:42,995
or not that stimulus was predictable.

393
00:14:42,996 --> 00:14:45,022
It was really only neurons that carried

394
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:47,047
information about the stimulus that was

395
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:48,058
being predicted.

396
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:51,088
Those were the neurons that were not

397
00:14:51,088 --> 00:14:54,118
enhancing but diminishing their beta

398
00:14:54,118 --> 00:14:57,149
during an unpredictable signal or said

399
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:01,120
another way, enhancing their beta to a

400
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,143
predicted signal change.

401
00:15:04,156 --> 00:15:06,177
So here's what we think is going on.

402
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:08,196
We call this neurophysiological

403
00:15:08,196 --> 00:15:10,213
implementation that we found of

404
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:11,224
predictive coding.

405
00:15:11,225 --> 00:15:14,255
We call it predictive routing to make a

406
00:15:14,255 --> 00:15:17,285
semantic point, but also a slightly more

407
00:15:17,285 --> 00:15:20,313
neurophysiological and computational

408
00:15:20,313 --> 00:15:23,340
argument that we don't actually find

409
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,368
strong evidence for this mismatch and

410
00:15:25,368 --> 00:15:29,401
prediction signal at the level of neurons,

411
00:15:29,401 --> 00:15:31,425
, but instead we think that this

412
00:15:31,425 --> 00:15:34,456
prediction circuit exists but uses these

413
00:15:34,456 --> 00:15:37,485
oscillations in order to implement what

414
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:39,501
is predicted.

415
00:15:39,502 --> 00:15:40,514
So here's how we think this works.

416
00:15:40,514 --> 00:15:43,541
So when a prediction matches a stimulus,

417
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,564
as is being shown here, when you're

418
00:15:45,564 --> 00:15:48,590
predicting A and you get a stimulus A,

419
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,604
then the A column.

420
00:15:49,605 --> 00:15:52,634
In other words, it doesn't have to be a

421
00:15:52,634 --> 00:15:55,664
column, but the area of the brain or the

422
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:58,694
neurons that encode A are going to become

423
00:15:58,694 --> 00:16:01,662
prepared to receive the stimulus A by

424
00:16:01,662 --> 00:16:04,690
enhancing the power of this alpha beta

425
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:04,699
signal.

426
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,724
So this top down beta from higher order

427
00:16:07,724 --> 00:16:09,745
areas we think prepares a cortical

428
00:16:09,745 --> 00:16:11,769
circuit to receive a predicted stimulus

429
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:13,788
and it prepares that stimulus by

430
00:16:13,788 --> 00:16:15,801
enhancing that's.

431
00:16:15,802 --> 00:16:17,824
This up arrow here, the alpha beta,

432
00:16:17,824 --> 00:16:20,850
especially in the deep layers, which can

433
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,875
inhibit both the gamma and the spiking

434
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,899
signal in the superficial layers as a

435
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:25,906
result.

436
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:29,945
So this top down signal inhibits the

437
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:32,974
superficial layers and as a result, there

438
00:16:32,974 --> 00:16:34,999
is decreased gamma and spiking and

439
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:37,029
decreased feed forward output in the case

440
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:40,050
of a predictable stimulus.

441
00:16:41,062 --> 00:16:43,089
The case of an unpredictable stimulus,

442
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:46,115
well, stimulus A, just like before, is

443
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:48,136
still going to be coming in.

444
00:16:48,137 --> 00:16:51,168
But because it's not predictable, that

445
00:16:51,168 --> 00:16:55,201
column, that set of neurons that normally

446
00:16:55,201 --> 00:16:58,234
represents A, was not previously prepared

447
00:16:58,234 --> 00:17:00,196
by an alpha beta signal.

448
00:17:00,197 --> 00:17:02,215
And so the alpha beta signal is

449
00:17:02,215 --> 00:17:04,235
relatively low in an unpredictable

450
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:06,256
context, releasing the inhibition that

451
00:17:06,256 --> 00:17:08,277
the deep layers exert on superficial

452
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,298
layers and as a result, causing more

453
00:17:10,298 --> 00:17:13,322
gamma, more spiking and more feed forward

454
00:17:13,322 --> 00:17:13,329
output.

455
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:17,360
In other words, what we are hypothesizing

456
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,388
here is that predictive coding and this

457
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:22,412
error computation comes about as a

458
00:17:22,412 --> 00:17:24,438
failure in predictive inhibition.

459
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,462
And as a result of the lack of these

460
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:29,485
mechanisms being in place during an

461
00:17:29,485 --> 00:17:31,508
unpredictable stimulus, there is an

462
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,525
enhanced gamma output.

463
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:35,543
And that's what we call a prediction

464
00:17:35,543 --> 00:17:37,562
error, or that's what we interpret as a

465
00:17:37,562 --> 00:17:38,571
prediction error.

466
00:17:38,573 --> 00:17:40,596
So here's the predictive routing model

467
00:17:40,596 --> 00:17:43,620
one more time in a predictable stimulus,

468
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,642
top down inputs prepare the column to

469
00:17:45,642 --> 00:17:46,655
receive a stimulus.

470
00:17:46,656 --> 00:17:48,677
That preparation leads to inhibition,

471
00:17:48,677 --> 00:17:50,691
less feed forward output.

472
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:52,712
In an unpredictable case, those

473
00:17:52,712 --> 00:17:54,738
mechanisms aren't in place, as a result,

474
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:57,759
more feed forward gamma output.

475
00:17:57,766 --> 00:17:58,777
So that's part one.

476
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,742
That's our cortical neurophysiological

477
00:18:01,742 --> 00:18:03,768
hypothesis then, that we call predictive

478
00:18:03,768 --> 00:18:06,791
routing of how we believe predictive

479
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,815
coding is implemented in the brain.

480
00:18:08,817 --> 00:18:11,843
And next I want to turn to a little bit

481
00:18:11,843 --> 00:18:14,870
more about how these rhythms are actually

482
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,897
produced in the brain, because one of the

483
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:19,924
things that we noticed from just placing

484
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:21,949
our laminar electrodes into cortex is

485
00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:24,973
that independent of where we put our

486
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:25,981
probe.

487
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,000
So here's an example of prefrontal cortex

488
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,001
activity.

489
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:31,004
We would see these high frequency gamma

490
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:33,006
waves and superficial layers and slower

491
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:35,008
frequency alpha beta waves in these deep

492
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:36,009
layers.

493
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:40,013
And you can do this analysis very easily

494
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:43,016
and quickly to reveal this, what we call

495
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:45,018
spectrolaminer pattern.

496
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:49,022
And what this is, is simply dividing each

497
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:52,024
contact on the probe, dividing the power

498
00:18:52,024 --> 00:18:54,027
that you observe at that contact by the

499
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:57,030
maximum, by the contact with the maximum

500
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,032
power along the probe.

501
00:18:59,032 --> 00:19:02,029
And what this does is it normalizes power

502
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:04,031
such that a value of one is the layer

503
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:07,034
that had the most power at that

504
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:08,035
particular frequency band.

505
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:11,038
And so, if you look here on the x axis,

506
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:12,039
this is frequency.

507
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:14,041
So these red colors are tracking which

508
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,043
particular layer has more power at that

509
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:17,044
frequency.

510
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:20,047
So you see more of this low and high

511
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:22,049
gamma power in the superficial layers.

512
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,052
So that's above zero on the y axis and

513
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:28,055
more of this alpha beta activity in the

514
00:19:28,055 --> 00:19:30,057
deeper layers of the cortex.

515
00:19:32,058 --> 00:19:38,065
And so in a large scale survey of cortex,

516
00:19:38,065 --> 00:19:43,070
together with Bob DeSimone's Lab and

517
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,072
Diego.

518
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:47,074
And so I did this partially while I was

519
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:49,076
at MIT, when I was a postdoc with Earl

520
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:50,077
Miller.

521
00:19:50,077 --> 00:19:51,078
And I continued this.

522
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:52,079
Now at Vanderbilt.

523
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:55,082
So this was a really cross institutional

524
00:19:55,082 --> 00:19:58,085
study and involved multiple labs.

525
00:19:58,085 --> 00:20:01,082
And the reason that that was important is

526
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:03,084
that most labs specialize in being a

527
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:05,086
prefrontal cortex lab, or a V four lab,

528
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:07,088
or an lip lab, et cetera.

529
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:10,091
And relatively few investigators had

530
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:12,093
actually done the necessary work to be

531
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:15,096
able to record with these laminar probes

532
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:17,098
in multiple areas simultaneously.

533
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:20,101
And so, therefore, by coordinating and

534
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:23,104
pooling data from multiple experiments,

535
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:26,107
we were able to record from a total of 14

536
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:29,110
areas in this study that we have now in

537
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,111
review.

538
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:33,114
And what we found was that independent of

539
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:36,117
the area, we found a spectral laminar

540
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:39,120
pattern that was highly conserved across

541
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,121
areas.

542
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:42,123
And so here it is from zero to 150 Hz for

543
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:45,126
area V four in the sensory cortex, seven

544
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:48,129
A in parietal cortex, prefrontal cortex

545
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:50,130
in the front of the brain.

546
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:52,133
Everywhere we looked, we found that there

547
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:55,136
was this enhanced gamma power in these

548
00:20:55,136 --> 00:20:57,138
red lines here in superficial layers, and

549
00:20:57,138 --> 00:21:00,135
enhanced alpha beta power in the deeper

550
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:00,135
layers.

551
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:06,140
And what we then turn to next is, first

552
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,144
of all, well, let's really confirm at a

553
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:13,148
histological anatomical level that it's

554
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,150
really these layers.

555
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,152
Is it layer one, is it layer two, is it

556
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,154
four that expresses gamma?

557
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:21,156
And the same question for beta.

558
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:24,159
Let's really confirm that that is in fact

559
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,161
the case, because it seemed like a very

560
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:29,164
prominent hypothesis and a very prominent

561
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:30,165
observation.

562
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:32,167
We wanted to really confirm it.

563
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:36,170
So that's the first part of this, part

564
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:36,171
two.

565
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:38,173
And then we're going to get into which

566
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:41,176
specific mechanisms might generate these

567
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,178
oscillations and how does that inform

568
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:45,180
computational modeling?

569
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,182
And so then this was work done in my lab

570
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:50,185
at Vanderbilt, led by a very talented

571
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:52,187
undergraduate student, actually, Max

572
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,188
Lichtenfeld.

573
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:56,190
And so we performed these histological

574
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,191
reconstructions.

575
00:21:57,192 --> 00:22:00,189
Here's the probe, an example probe where

576
00:22:00,189 --> 00:22:02,191
we performed these tiny electrolytic

577
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:05,194
lesions in particular areas while we were

578
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:08,197
recording here's the overlay of the

579
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:10,199
laminar boundaries.

580
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:12,201
So in red here, this is layer four.

581
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:14,203
And then, of course, we had the

582
00:22:14,203 --> 00:22:17,206
electrophysiology so we could look at the

583
00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:20,209
gamma power, gamma relative power, the

584
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:22,211
beta relative power, and the point at

585
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:24,213
which they cross over, actually, we

586
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:27,216
determined was pretty consistent in layer

587
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:28,217
four.

588
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:30,219
And of course, then we also mapped on the

589
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:32,221
other features of these things to the

590
00:22:32,221 --> 00:22:32,221
layers.

591
00:22:33,222 --> 00:22:36,225
And so here's what we found is that the

592
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:38,227
crossover, the point at which the gamma

593
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:40,229
profile in red and the beta profile in

594
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:43,232
blue, the point at which they cross over,

595
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:45,234
at which their powers are equal, that

596
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:47,236
tended to land in layer four.

597
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:50,239
The peak gamma power tended to land in

598
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:53,241
layer two or three, and the peak beta

599
00:22:53,241 --> 00:22:55,244
power tended to land in layer five or six.

600
00:22:55,244 --> 00:22:55,244
.

601
00:22:57,246 --> 00:23:00,243
And so we mapped these distances between

602
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:03,246
these different electrophysiological

603
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:07,250
signatures or distinct profiles to the

604
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,251
different layers.

605
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:11,254
And we did this for several different

606
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:13,256
probes and for several different animals

607
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:16,259
until we were able to get a very nice

608
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:18,261
distribution here, which confirmed that

609
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:20,263
indeed, the gamma beta crossover is

610
00:23:20,263 --> 00:23:23,266
consistent with being at laminar position

611
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:24,267
zero.

612
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:26,269
We called the middle of layer four,

613
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:28,271
whereas this gamma is at the boundary

614
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:31,274
between layer two, three and beta at the

615
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:33,276
boundary between layer five and six.

616
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:36,279
And so here is our current toy model of

617
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:38,281
what we think is going on.

618
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:41,284
So we think that there's different

619
00:23:41,284 --> 00:23:44,287
inhibitory neurons that are interacting

620
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:47,290
with their excitatory cell partners to

621
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:51,294
generate fast frequency gamma activity in

622
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:54,297
the superficial layers and in turn that

623
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:57,300
there is another type of interneuron that

624
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,297
is generating with slower time constants

625
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:04,301
this alpha beta rhythmic activity.

626
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:07,304
So in order to examine this, we again

627
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:10,307
turn to anatomy, we again turn to this

628
00:24:10,307 --> 00:24:12,309
question, well then, which exact

629
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:15,312
inhibitory neurons are most prominent

630
00:24:15,312 --> 00:24:17,314
therefore in the layers that express

631
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:20,317
these different frequencies?

632
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:23,320
And in order to perform this work, what

633
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,323
we did is we quantified the laminar

634
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:29,326
expression of three distinct interneuron

635
00:24:29,326 --> 00:24:31,328
subtypes that are known to account for

636
00:24:31,328 --> 00:24:34,331
over 90% of the inhibitory interneurons

637
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:36,333
in the primate brain.

638
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:40,337
And those inhibitory neuron subtypes are

639
00:24:40,337 --> 00:24:43,340
parvalbumin positive calretin, calbindin

640
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,341
positive.

641
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:47,344
And importantly, previous computational

642
00:24:47,344 --> 00:24:49,346
modeling work had really singled out the

643
00:24:49,346 --> 00:24:52,349
parvalbumin cell class as the critical

644
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:54,351
class for generating these gamma

645
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:57,353
oscillations because of their fast time

646
00:24:57,353 --> 00:24:59,356
constants and strong synapses onto the

647
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:02,353
cell bodies of excitatory neurons.

648
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:05,356
And so again we perform this painstaking

649
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:08,359
histological analysis where you perform

650
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:11,362
different stains, mounting cover,

651
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:14,365
slipping microscopy, semiautomated

652
00:25:14,365 --> 00:25:17,368
thresholding and cell counting in order

653
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:20,371
to be able to then really have a

654
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:23,374
quantitative view on which layers have

655
00:25:23,374 --> 00:25:26,377
which cell types that are most associated

656
00:25:26,377 --> 00:25:29,380
with these frequencies.

657
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,382
And so here's what this data then looks

658
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:31,382
like.

659
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:34,385
We have the gamma and alpha beta

660
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:37,388
electrophysiology here, and then at the

661
00:25:37,388 --> 00:25:39,390
same time we have the presence of

662
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,393
different neuron types with the three

663
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:45,396
inhibitory cell classes here.

664
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:48,399
And then we can perform an analysis to

665
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:50,401
determine which of these cell classes is

666
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:53,404
most strongly associated with the gamma.

667
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:57,407
And here's what we found that in both the

668
00:25:57,407 --> 00:26:00,405
low gamma and the high gamma across over

669
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:02,407
14 regions, what we found quite

670
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:05,410
significantly was that it was really the

671
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:08,413
parvalbumin cell counts shown here as a

672
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:11,416
function of laminar depth that were

673
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:14,419
giving us the best explanation for the

674
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:17,422
laminar profile of the gamma rhythmic

675
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:18,423
activity.

676
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:21,426
Both when you take a very wide band as

677
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:24,429
well as when you perform a low versus

678
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:27,432
high gamma split, it comes out in both

679
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:27,432
ways.

680
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:31,436
So how can this inform computational

681
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:33,438
models of oscillations?

682
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:35,440
Well, here's what we think is going on

683
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,441
then.

684
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:40,445
We collaborated with several people here

685
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:44,449
on this work, including Sanchez Toto et

686
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:49,453
al and computational modelers in Spain.

687
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:51,456
And what we did was we performed an

688
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:53,458
analysis where we took different

689
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:56,461
interneurons with different types of

690
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:57,462
connectivity.

691
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:59,464
So these PV, these parvalbumin

692
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:01,460
interneurons were modeled as having

693
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,463
strong inhibitory connections to the

694
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:06,465
pyramidal cell class and strong self

695
00:27:06,465 --> 00:27:09,468
inhibition, which has been important for

696
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:11,470
gamma oscillations previously.

697
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,472
And when you hook them up in these

698
00:27:13,472 --> 00:27:16,475
particular ways, sure enough, and you

699
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:18,477
measure the spectral output of these

700
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:21,480
neurons, these p two neurons, superficial

701
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,482
parameter neurons, sure enough, they

702
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:25,484
express gamma.

703
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:27,486
And when you put in different types of

704
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:29,488
interneurons with slower time constants

705
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:31,490
and different types of connections to

706
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,492
these deep layer neurons, sure enough,

707
00:27:33,492 --> 00:27:35,494
they come out with more alpha beta

708
00:27:35,494 --> 00:27:36,495
oscillations.

709
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:40,499
So indeed, this anatomical work could

710
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:43,502
produce even more in the future, even

711
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:46,505
more accurate models of how these

712
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:49,508
interneurons work together and with

713
00:27:49,508 --> 00:27:52,511
parameter cells across different layers

714
00:27:52,511 --> 00:27:56,515
in order to express these oscillations.

715
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:59,518
So this is really a work in progress and

716
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:01,514
one of the first steps towards this and

717
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:04,517
our ultimate aim is to really pull

718
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:06,519
together this rich anatomical and

719
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,521
neurophysiological data together with

720
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,523
computational models to be able to

721
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:13,526
approximate the laminar structure of

722
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:16,529
cortex to a better and better degree.

723
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:22,535
This next part here, I'll talk a little

724
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:24,537
bit about a causal test now of the

725
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,539
predictive routing model with propofol

726
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:27,540
anesthesia.

727
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,542
So this will be the last part of the talk

728
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:30,543
here.

729
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,546
And so we were interested in anesthesia.

730
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:36,549
I got interested in anesthesia actually

731
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:39,552
through my work and contact with Jake

732
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:43,556
Donahue over here, who is a very talented

733
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:46,559
MD PhD student at MIT at the time and was

734
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,562
being co mentored by Emory Brown and Earl

735
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:52,565
Miller, who was also my mentor.

736
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:55,568
And so we became interested in this topic

737
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:56,569
for the following reason.

738
00:28:56,569 --> 00:29:00,567
Well, first of all, as surprising as this

739
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:02,569
may seem, if you go into a surgical

740
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:05,572
clinic and you're administered an

741
00:29:05,572 --> 00:29:08,575
anesthetic such as propofol, well, it

742
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:11,578
turns out that the anesthesiologist may

743
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:14,581
not know exactly the cortical mechanisms

744
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:17,584
and the systems level mechanisms for how

745
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:20,587
that anesthetic is actually working in

746
00:29:20,587 --> 00:29:21,588
the brain.

747
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:25,592
And it's actually to this day remains

748
00:29:25,592 --> 00:29:28,595
more often than not the case that there's

749
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:32,599
actually no intraoperative monitoring of

750
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:33,600
brain state.

751
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:35,602
It's far and few between the

752
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:38,605
anesthesiologists that are actually doing

753
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:38,605
that.

754
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:41,608
And so Emory Brown, who's an

755
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:44,611
anesthesiologist himself, is really

756
00:29:44,611 --> 00:29:47,614
pushing for more and more adoption of

757
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:50,617
simple tools like EEG and spectral

758
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:53,620
estimation methods by the clinic.

759
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,623
And so our work was clinically motivated,

760
00:29:56,623 --> 00:29:59,626
but it was also motivated by the ability

761
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:02,623
to test this predictive routing model

762
00:30:02,623 --> 00:30:05,626
when activity, especially in prefrontal

763
00:30:05,626 --> 00:30:08,629
cortex areas, is relatively silenced.

764
00:30:08,629 --> 00:30:10,631
And so in these experiments, we

765
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:13,634
administered propofol to again these

766
00:30:13,634 --> 00:30:15,636
rhesus macaques and we recorded brain

767
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:17,638
activity there's, these local field

768
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:20,641
potentials and spiking activity in the

769
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:23,644
awake state as well as in the unconscious

770
00:30:23,644 --> 00:30:23,644
state.

771
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:26,647
And what we first noticed is that in the

772
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:29,650
unconscious state, there were these slow

773
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,652
rhythmic bouts of activity at about 1

774
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:34,655
cycle per second, or slightly little

775
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:36,657
faster, a little slower than that.

776
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:38,659
Those are the slow frequencies.

777
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:41,662
And these slow frequencies organize these

778
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:44,665
massive bouts of spiking, which could

779
00:30:44,665 --> 00:30:47,668
sometimes be very synchronous across

780
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:50,671
cortex, but that there were long periods

781
00:30:50,671 --> 00:30:52,673
of silence in between these bouts of

782
00:30:52,673 --> 00:30:55,676
spiking in the unconscious state.

783
00:30:56,677 --> 00:30:58,679
And so propofol anesthesia, we found is

784
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:01,676
accompanied by, again, these strong

785
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:03,678
increases in slow frequency activity,

786
00:31:03,678 --> 00:31:05,680
which create alternating on and off

787
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,682
periods for spiking.

788
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:09,684
There's reduced spiking activity

789
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:11,686
throughout the network, but the strongest

790
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:13,688
reductions are in prefrontal cortex.

791
00:31:13,688 --> 00:31:17,692
And sensory areas are relatively spared.

792
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:19,694
So they're still quite reduced in their

793
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:22,697
excitability in the unconscious state,

794
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:24,699
but prefrontal cortex is more inhibited.

795
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,702
There is also, we found reductions in

796
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:29,704
cross area synchrony and very pronounced

797
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:32,707
reductions in the alpha beta band.

798
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:34,709
And so as a result, we thought we could

799
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:36,711
actually use this model, this propofol

800
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:38,713
anesthetic model, in order to test

801
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:41,716
certain aspects of predictive routing.

802
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:43,718
Because what's going on here?

803
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:45,720
We have lower order cortex that's

804
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,722
hypothesized to feed forward prediction

805
00:31:48,722 --> 00:31:50,725
errors to higher order cortex.

806
00:31:51,726 --> 00:31:54,729
And in turn, these higher order areas

807
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:56,731
might feed back their predictions.

808
00:31:56,731 --> 00:31:59,734
But as a result of propofol, these higher

809
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:02,731
order areas are profoundly impaired and

810
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:05,734
very reduced in their spiking activity.

811
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:08,737
And the alpha beta rhythm is also the

812
00:32:08,737 --> 00:32:11,740
synchrony between areas is highly reduced.

813
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:11,740
.

814
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,742
So what's going to happen in this case?

815
00:32:13,742 --> 00:32:16,745
Well, if you think from the point of view

816
00:32:16,745 --> 00:32:18,747
of simply everything is going down, then

817
00:32:18,747 --> 00:32:20,749
sensory areas in a response to an

818
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:22,751
unpredictable stimulus should also just

819
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:23,752
go down.

820
00:32:23,752 --> 00:32:25,754
But if you think from a predictive coding

821
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:27,756
or a predictive routing point of view,

822
00:32:27,756 --> 00:32:30,759
the function of these higher order areas

823
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:32,761
is to create feedback predictions that

824
00:32:32,761 --> 00:32:33,762
inhibit activity.

825
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:35,764
So in the absence of those feedback

826
00:32:35,764 --> 00:32:38,767
inhibitory activities, you might actually

827
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:40,769
hypothesize that there would be an

828
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:43,772
enhancement of the feed forward response

829
00:32:43,772 --> 00:32:46,774
when that feed forward response is

830
00:32:46,774 --> 00:32:48,777
characterized by an unpredictable

831
00:32:48,777 --> 00:32:50,779
stimulus or prediction error.

832
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:53,782
And so we sought to test this out using

833
00:32:53,782 --> 00:32:56,785
the simple sensory prediction paradigm

834
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:58,787
where we have a tone stimuli.

835
00:32:59,788 --> 00:33:01,784
These tone stimuli could either be

836
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:03,786
repeated or occasionally there could be

837
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:04,787
an oddball stimulus.

838
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,793
And what we would expect is that there

839
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:12,795
would be enhanced feedback predictions

840
00:33:12,795 --> 00:33:15,798
when stimuli were repeatable and

841
00:33:15,798 --> 00:33:18,801
predicted, and that the occasion of an

842
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:21,804
oddball would signal an enhanced gamma

843
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:22,805
feed forward signal.

844
00:33:23,806 --> 00:33:26,809
So we performed the auditory stimulation

845
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:29,812
task, both in the awake state as well as

846
00:33:29,812 --> 00:33:32,815
after there was an administration of

847
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:35,818
propofol leading to loss of consciousness.

848
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:35,818
.

849
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:39,822
And here's what we found in the local

850
00:33:39,822 --> 00:33:41,824
state, just as we found in the visual

851
00:33:41,824 --> 00:33:44,827
cortex for an unpredictable visual

852
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:47,830
stimulus, as in the visual cortex, so in

853
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,833
the sensory cortex, my PhD student Sophie

854
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:53,836
Shang, who performed this analysis, found

855
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:55,838
an enhanced gamma.

856
00:33:55,838 --> 00:33:57,840
So right at the time of the local oddball.

857
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:57,840
.

858
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,837
So we have time here on the x axis

859
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:03,840
frequency on the y axis, and spectrogram

860
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,843
hot colors mean more activity to an

861
00:34:06,843 --> 00:34:07,844
unpredictable stimulus.

862
00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:10,847
So there was an enhanced gamma response

863
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:12,849
to this unpredictable stimulus, decreased

864
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:14,851
alpha beta to the unpredictable stimulus.

865
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:14,851
.

866
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:17,854
Or set another way, when the stimulus was

867
00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:19,856
predicted, there was more alpha beta.

868
00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:22,858
And here's what happened in the

869
00:34:22,858 --> 00:34:24,861
anesthetized state when we performed this

870
00:34:24,861 --> 00:34:27,864
exact same contrast, we lost the.

871
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:29,866
Predictable alpha beta signal and instead

872
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:31,868
everything was enhanced.

873
00:34:31,868 --> 00:34:34,871
So there was a decrease in frequency

874
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:37,874
towards the low gamma range.

875
00:34:37,874 --> 00:34:40,877
So the cortex just essentially went into

876
00:34:40,877 --> 00:34:43,880
a constant ringing in the gamma frequency

877
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,883
range, which to our surprise was much

878
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:49,886
stronger in power compared to the gamma

879
00:34:49,886 --> 00:34:52,889
that we saw being enhanced during an

880
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:55,892
unpredictable stimulus in the awake state.

881
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:56,893
.

882
00:34:56,893 --> 00:34:59,896
And the way we interpret this is that in

883
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:02,893
the absence of this inhibitory predictive

884
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:05,896
alpha beta signal, this gamma signal

885
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:08,899
becomes uncontrolled and enhances itself

886
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:11,902
in the local anesthetized state.

887
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:13,904
Here in area TPT is a sensory area,

888
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:15,906
should have mentioned that.

889
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:18,909
So now to conclude, we propose predictive

890
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:19,910
routing.

891
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,911
So predictive routing is a

892
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:22,913
neurophysiologically inspired

893
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:25,916
implementation of predictive coding,

894
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,918
which stresses the importance of these

895
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:30,921
alpha beta signals for implementing

896
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,923
predictions and inhibiting sensory areas

897
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:34,925
and areas of the brain that are

898
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:37,928
experiencing a predictable stimulus.

899
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:40,931
In the absence of that, you get an

900
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:42,933
enhanced feed forward gamma output.

901
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:45,936
And this distinction between gamma and

902
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:48,939
beta across layers we found was

903
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:50,941
ubiquitous across cortex, really

904
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,944
suggesting that something like this may

905
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:56,947
in fact be truly a canonical circuit

906
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:59,950
motif that's repeated across the brain.

907
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:03,948
And these alphabetarhmic predictive

908
00:36:03,948 --> 00:36:06,951
preparation or inhibition we found, we

909
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:09,954
observed was lost in the unconscious

910
00:36:09,954 --> 00:36:12,957
state, with unconsciousness being

911
00:36:12,957 --> 00:36:14,959
mediated by propofol.

912
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:17,962
By the way, it's one of the most often

913
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:20,965
used anesthetics, and that as a result of

914
00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:23,968
this loss of predictive alpha beta, there

915
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:26,971
was an enhanced gamma modulation to these

916
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:28,973
unpredictable inputs.

917
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:31,976
In other words, the sensory cortex was in

918
00:36:31,976 --> 00:36:33,978
a disinhibited state.

919
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:35,980
And so with that, I'd like to thank my

920
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,983
many collaborators and the Bostos lab at

921
00:36:38,983 --> 00:36:41,986

well as my financial support.

924
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:49,994
And lastly, we just started the lab about

925
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:52,997
two years ago, we're still in recruiting

926
00:36:52,997 --> 00:36:55,000
stage, so you guys can check out my

line of research.

930
00:37:03,002 --> 00:37:05,004
And so with that, I'll turn it over in

931
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:07,006

932
00:37:07,006 --> 00:37:08,007
Thank you for your attention.

933

Daniel: Awesome.

934
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:14,013
Thank you andre, I'll just ask one quick

935
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:17,016
question from the chat, dave Douglas asks,

936
00:37:17,016 --> 00:37:20,019
, does propofol change the activity of

937
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:23,022
neuronal microtubules in any interesting

938
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:23,022
way?

939
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:30,029
Thanks Andre.

940
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:33,032
I'll just ask one question from the chat

941
00:37:33,032 --> 00:37:36,035
Dave Douglas asks, does propofol change

942
00:37:36,035 --> 00:37:39,038
the activity of neuronal microtubes in

943
00:37:39,038 --> 00:37:40,039
any interesting way?

944
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:45,044
Andre: I haven't looked into the

945
00:37:45,044 --> 00:37:49,047
microtube kind of hypothesis, that's one

946
00:37:49,047 --> 00:37:52,051
of the hypotheses advocated for many

947
00:37:52,051 --> 00:37:55,054
years by people like Stuart Hammerhoff,

948
00:37:55,054 --> 00:37:58,057
and there has been some recent work done

949
00:37:58,057 --> 00:38:02,055
by George Masure, I believe, and so you

950
00:38:02,055 --> 00:38:05,058
should go check out some of his papers on

951
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:09,062
that topic, but I haven't looked into

952
00:38:09,062 --> 00:38:10,063
that.

953
00:38:10,063 --> 00:38:14,067
And I remain somewhat skeptical to the

954
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:18,071
quantal explanation for consciousness,

955
00:38:18,071 --> 00:38:22,075
but mostly because the mechanism doesn't

956
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:26,079
appear at first glance to be very

957
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,082
biologically reasonable.

958
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:32,085
And also that there's essentially not

959
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:35,088
very much data on it, but that may change

960
00:38:35,088 --> 00:38:37,089
in the coming years.

961
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:39,092
So something to look out for.

962
00:38:40,093 --> 00:38:41,094
Daniel: Great.

963
00:38:41,094 --> 00:38:44,097
One other question more generally, how do

964
00:38:44,097 --> 00:38:47,100
you see experimental work in the active

965
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,103
inference ecosystem, and how do you see

966
00:38:50,103 --> 00:38:53,105
the synthesis of theoretical and in

967
00:38:53,105 --> 00:38:55,108
principle, work with this kind of real

968
00:38:55,108 --> 00:38:58,111
wet lab and real recordings on the

969
00:38:58,111 --> 00:39:01,108
neurons type analysis that you're doing

970
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:02,109
here?

971
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,112
Andre: Yeah, so it's a great question.

972
00:39:05,112 --> 00:39:07,114
I think that what we need to be doing as

973
00:39:07,114 --> 00:39:10,117
a community is having more interactions

974
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:13,120
between theorists and experimentalists.

975
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,122
And so we wouldn't have performed, for

976
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:18,125
example, this experiment here if we hadn'

977
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:21,128
't already been inspired by biological

978
00:39:21,128 --> 00:39:24,131
and theoretical models of predictive

979
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:27,134
coding and of active inference as well.

980
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:30,137
And so that's really what we need, is to

981
00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:33,140
make not only hypotheses that are turned

982
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,143
into great theoretical and computational

983
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:40,147
infrastructures and models, but we also

984
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:42,149
need to be thinking about if we care

985
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:45,152
about the biology and we care about

986
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:48,155
trying to figure out the brain, then we

987
00:39:48,155 --> 00:39:52,159
should also be trying to map those things

988
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:55,162
onto neurobiology and psychology.

989
00:39:55,162 --> 00:39:56,162
Right?

990
00:39:56,162 --> 00:39:58,165
And so that involves them both

991
00:39:58,165 --> 00:40:02,163
considering the neurobiological elements

992
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:05,166
that may implement and mediate active

993
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:08,169
inference in the brain, as well as the

994
00:40:08,169 --> 00:40:11,172
psychological and cognitive constructs

995
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:14,175
that we think are going to be

996
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:18,179
particularly sensitive to capture certain

997
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:20,181
elements of the theory.

998
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:24,185
And so I remain very welcoming to that

999
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:28,189
type of and in fact, there's going to be

1000
00:40:28,189 --> 00:40:32,193
a postdoc joining the lab soon, eli

1001
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:36,197
Sinesh, who has been working very deeply

1002
00:40:36,197 --> 00:40:40,201
in the active inference community.

1003
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:44,205
And so we'll have an opportunity there to

1004
00:40:44,205 --> 00:40:47,208
both work on theory guided data analysis,

1005
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:50,211
but also perform more theoretically

1006
00:40:50,211 --> 00:40:53,214
guided experimental designs that can go

1007
00:40:53,214 --> 00:40:55,216
further into the neurobiological

1008
00:40:55,216 --> 00:40:57,218
implementation.

1009
00:40:57,218 --> 00:41:00,215
And so this was here what I've presented

1010
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:03,218
really simply the first and small,

1011
00:41:03,218 --> 00:41:05,220
somewhat step towards linking the

1012
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:09,224
neurobiological implementation level with

1013
00:41:09,224 --> 00:41:12,227
the algorithmic and computational level

1014
00:41:12,227 --> 00:41:15,230
of predictive coding and active inference.

1015
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,230
.

1016
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:19,234
And so the more interactions that we can

1017
00:41:19,234 --> 00:41:23,238
have between the communities, the better

1018
00:41:23,238 --> 00:41:25,240
that will be.

1019
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,244
I think what would be somewhat of a shame

1020
00:41:29,244 --> 00:41:33,248
is if the active inference community went

1021
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:37,252
way too far into just pure theory and

1022
00:41:37,252 --> 00:41:41,256
delved into increasing areas that were

1023
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:44,259
divorced from the biology.

1024
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,263
So that's, of course, one of the great

1025
00:41:48,263 --> 00:41:50,265
critiques, right, of the deep learning

1026
00:41:50,265 --> 00:41:54,269
and more machine learning, purely machine

1027
00:41:54,269 --> 00:41:57,272
learning driven approaches, is that they

1028
00:41:57,272 --> 00:41:59,274
took a little bit of biological

1029
00:41:59,274 --> 00:42:02,271
inspiration, but then started using

1030
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:05,274
algorithms like Backprop that were very

1031
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:07,276
biologically unrealistic.

1032
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:10,279
And so, of course, active inference is a

1033
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:12,281
response to that in certain ways.

1034
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:15,284
But in order to continue being that, I

1035
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:18,287
think that there needs to be indeed a

1036
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:21,290
tight dialogue between experimentalists

1037
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:23,292
and theorists.

1038
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:25,294
And so if you have any particular ideas,

1039
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:26,295
I'd be happy to hear them.

1040
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:31,300
Please reach out to me by email or

1041
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:37,306
through X, which you can find here on the

1042
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:38,307
slide.

1043
00:42:39,308 --> 00:42:40,309
Daniel: That's really cool.

1044
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:41,310
That's awesome.

1045
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,312
You're going to be working with Eli.

1046
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:44,313
And one final question.

1047
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:46,314
This is from Alexandra.

1048
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:49,318
Is it possible to detect the contribution

1049
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:52,321
of Glia to the neural firing rate of the

1050
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:53,322
field potentials?

1051
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:58,327
Andre: That is a question that I have not

1052
00:42:58,327 --> 00:42:59,328
considered yet.

1053
00:43:00,323 --> 00:43:03,326
So we normally do not consider Glia to be

1054
00:43:03,326 --> 00:43:06,329
active in the network, but of course,

1055
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:08,331
that is likely to be an

1056
00:43:08,331 --> 00:43:10,333
oversimplification.

1057
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:12,335
We know that they can have interactions

1058
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:13,336
with neurons.

1059
00:43:13,336 --> 00:43:15,338
We know that they can also have different

1060
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:18,341
levels of excitability, and of course,

1061
00:43:18,341 --> 00:43:20,343
that's how they can regulate neurons

1062
00:43:20,343 --> 00:43:21,344
metabolically.

1063
00:43:21,344 --> 00:43:25,348
But as far as the contributions of Glia

1064
00:43:25,348 --> 00:43:28,351
directly to the local field potential, I

1065
00:43:28,351 --> 00:43:32,355
am not aware of how to determine whether

1066
00:43:32,355 --> 00:43:34,357
or not they make a significant

1067
00:43:34,357 --> 00:43:36,359
contribution.

1068
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:41,363
I actually haven't seen any work on that.

1069
00:43:41,363 --> 00:43:41,363
.

1070
00:43:41,364 --> 00:43:42,365
But thank you for the question.

1071
00:43:43,366 --> 00:43:47,370
It's always good to reconsider our core

1072
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:51,374
assumptions, right, about the cell types

1073
00:43:51,374 --> 00:43:55,378
that are most important to capture.

1074
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:57,380
So certainly something to think about.

1075
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:58,381
Thank you.

1076
00:43:58,381 --> 00:43:59,382
Thank you.

1077
00:43:59,382 --> 00:44:00,377
All right.

1078
00:44:00,377 --> 00:44:01,378
Daniel: Thank you, Andre.

1079
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:02,379
Super cool work.

1080
00:44:02,379 --> 00:44:03,380
And good luck with everything.

1081
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:09,386
Till next bye.
