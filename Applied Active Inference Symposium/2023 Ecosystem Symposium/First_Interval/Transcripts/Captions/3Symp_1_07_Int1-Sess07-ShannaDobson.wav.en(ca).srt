1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:06,938
All right, the next session

2
00:00:07,034 --> 00:00:10,174
is going to be with Shanna Dobson. This

3
00:00:10,212 --> 00:00:14,186
section is going to be called Dark

4
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:17,166
Imaginarium Shared Intelligence as an

5
00:00:17,188 --> 00:00:19,200
Infinity Curiosity type.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,664
I'll message Shanna make sure that

7
00:00:26,742 --> 00:00:28,440
everything's good with the audio.

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:33,770
Wow.

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,712
Great talk so far. Welcome,

10
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:43,084
Shanna. How are you doing, Daniel? Doing

11
00:00:43,122 --> 00:00:45,836
good. Awesome.

12
00:00:46,018 --> 00:00:49,404
Well, please take it away. Thank you for

13
00:00:49,442 --> 00:00:52,524
joining. Awesome. Let me know if you see

14
00:00:52,562 --> 00:00:55,704
my screen. OK? Yep,

15
00:00:55,752 --> 00:00:58,984
looks perfect. Thank you. OK,

16
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:01,328
perfect. Hey, everyone, thank you so

17
00:01:01,334 --> 00:01:02,848
much for the invitation. It's such a

18
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,676
great honor to be here. I'm learning so

19
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:08,116
much. I'll be talking about an idea I

20
00:01:08,138 --> 00:01:10,544
had called Dark Imaginarium, where I'm

21
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:12,996
trying to make shared intelligence the

22
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:15,584
concept of what I call an Infinity

23
00:01:15,632 --> 00:01:18,348
Curiosity type. So you were so gracious

24
00:01:18,384 --> 00:01:20,056
to link the paper so anyone can find

25
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:23,160
more details there on Phil archive.

26
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,308
So I want to start with an discussion

27
00:01:26,324 --> 00:01:28,536
about ontological commitment. So my

28
00:01:28,558 --> 00:01:30,616
first question is, might we re examine

29
00:01:30,728 --> 00:01:33,516
our ontological commitments? So in

30
00:01:33,538 --> 00:01:35,790
particular, two of them? One,

31
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,924
Sean Carroll, said so amazingly what

32
00:01:38,962 --> 00:01:40,444
cannot be known because it does not

33
00:01:40,482 --> 00:01:42,828
exist. So Sean Carroll says the

34
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:44,764
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is

35
00:01:44,802 --> 00:01:46,524
often explained as saying that we cannot

36
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:48,992
simultaneously know both the position

37
00:01:49,046 --> 00:01:50,816
and the velocity of any object. But the

38
00:01:50,838 --> 00:01:52,688
reality is deeper than that. It's not

39
00:01:52,694 --> 00:01:53,888
that we can't know position and

40
00:01:53,894 --> 00:01:55,744
momentum, it's that they don't even

41
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,028
exist at the same time. The second one I

42
00:01:59,034 --> 00:02:01,136
want to examine is Lenny Susskin's

43
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:03,056
quote, we are all behind someone else's

44
00:02:03,088 --> 00:02:05,536
event horizon. So Suskin has a brilliant

45
00:02:05,568 --> 00:02:08,472
idea of space time emergence as the

46
00:02:08,606 --> 00:02:11,288
entanglement of two black holes, and

47
00:02:11,374 --> 00:02:12,584
what emerges from that is called

48
00:02:12,622 --> 00:02:16,184
computational complexity. So the world

49
00:02:16,222 --> 00:02:17,960
is quantum, so every theory should be

50
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,656
derivable strictly from the laws of

51
00:02:19,678 --> 00:02:21,816
quantum mechanics. One is going to give

52
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:23,860
us the notion of shared, two is going to

53
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,076
give us the notion of ecology. So what

54
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:28,024
would an ontological commitment to Dark

55
00:02:28,072 --> 00:02:30,684
look like? So my continual goal, as

56
00:02:30,722 --> 00:02:32,128
everybody knows, is to sustain a

57
00:02:32,134 --> 00:02:34,624
simultaneous experience and to

58
00:02:34,662 --> 00:02:37,696
understand why I currently cannot. To

59
00:02:37,718 --> 00:02:39,456
sustain a simultaneous experience would

60
00:02:39,478 --> 00:02:42,064
be to bypass the integrative system we

61
00:02:42,102 --> 00:02:44,864
call consciousness. So how would you

62
00:02:44,902 --> 00:02:47,184
attain a two consciousness in the sense

63
00:02:47,222 --> 00:02:49,604
of in category theory or an N

64
00:02:49,642 --> 00:02:51,732
consciousness? How would we actually

65
00:02:51,786 --> 00:02:53,252
develop something called like, a two

66
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:56,016
memory? So my colleague Robert Prepner

67
00:02:56,048 --> 00:02:57,492
and I fleshed out something called N

68
00:02:57,546 --> 00:02:59,396
awareness, where we're sort of examining

69
00:02:59,428 --> 00:03:02,552
this idea. Mike Levin and all have

70
00:03:02,606 --> 00:03:05,304
repeatedly shown that planaria memory is

71
00:03:05,342 --> 00:03:08,068
not in the head. Where is the memory?

72
00:03:08,244 --> 00:03:10,132
Is memory a sustained superposition?

73
00:03:10,196 --> 00:03:12,420
Well, of what? And also, what's the

74
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,428
structure of anamnesis? Could you have a

75
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:15,708
superposition between memory and

76
00:03:15,714 --> 00:03:18,936
anamnesis? So I had a small dialogue

77
00:03:18,968 --> 00:03:21,196
with Chris Fields, the amazing I said,

78
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:22,412
you know, what is the difference between

79
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:24,572
these two questions? What is the waking

80
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:27,504
state and what is consciousness? Or

81
00:03:27,622 --> 00:03:29,404
could it be that these are entirely

82
00:03:29,452 --> 00:03:32,176
separate questions? So we're sort of in

83
00:03:32,198 --> 00:03:33,968
a mess. Either way, if there is a

84
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:35,536
difference in these questions, then it

85
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:37,764
is possible to sustain a waking state

86
00:03:37,882 --> 00:03:40,944
without consciousness and or a conscious

87
00:03:40,992 --> 00:03:44,336
state in a non waking state. So imagine

88
00:03:44,368 --> 00:03:46,004
somehow being in a waking state under

89
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:48,148
general anesthesia. Well, if these are

90
00:03:48,154 --> 00:03:49,636
not entirely different questions, then

91
00:03:49,658 --> 00:03:51,928
we could contend that consciousness is a

92
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:54,264
form of waking state, or something along

93
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:55,688
the lines of a waking state is a

94
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,472
condition of a conscious state. So how

95
00:03:58,526 --> 00:04:01,276
can humans have delta waves, which are

96
00:04:01,298 --> 00:04:03,064
canonically indicative of unconscious

97
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:06,044
deep sleep and thus a non waking state,

98
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,476
and the REM state, the patterns of which

99
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,424
are indistinguishable from a waking

100
00:04:10,472 --> 00:04:12,744
state? So we all know that general

101
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:14,764
anesthesia, something like a propofol,

102
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:17,276
can reduce the polyrhythmic brain

103
00:04:17,308 --> 00:04:20,576
activity to one uniform. And we know

104
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:22,224
there's as many theories about what

105
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,808
anesthesia does to consciousness as

106
00:04:23,814 --> 00:04:26,028
there are anesthesiologists. But we've

107
00:04:26,044 --> 00:04:27,828
repeatedly posited consciousness as the

108
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,924
proto state. And I wanted to turn this

109
00:04:29,962 --> 00:04:31,792
idea on its head, like is consciousness

110
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:33,584
so robust or is it a delicate

111
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:35,776
interference or is it a delicate

112
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,056
inference? Now, we know beginnings are

113
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:40,136
always tricky, but what if sleep was the

114
00:04:40,158 --> 00:04:43,576
proto state? So if life

115
00:04:43,598 --> 00:04:45,764
is oceanic and it revolves in these deep

116
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:48,904
pressures, would the pressure of getting

117
00:04:48,942 --> 00:04:51,496
onto land, like squeeze the REM state

118
00:04:51,518 --> 00:04:53,516
into this full blown waking state that

119
00:04:53,538 --> 00:04:54,892
we're engaging in right now? Anybody

120
00:04:54,946 --> 00:04:56,924
who's listening? So then waking state

121
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:58,856
would be something like an acceptation,

122
00:04:58,968 --> 00:05:01,644
which is, I think, quite impressive. So

123
00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:03,328
it's in this mess that I attempt to

124
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:05,596
define dark consciousness as a mixed

125
00:05:05,628 --> 00:05:08,752
frequency state of being self aware or

126
00:05:08,806 --> 00:05:11,328
conscious while simultaneously being in

127
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:12,992
a deep sleep, specifically in three

128
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,164
sleep. So the sleep is proto state is

129
00:05:16,202 --> 00:05:19,044
quite strange. The REM brain activity is

130
00:05:19,082 --> 00:05:21,408
indistinguishable from waking activity

131
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:24,532
and this sort of enchanted me for a bit.

132
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,448
The only difference is eye movements.

133
00:05:26,544 --> 00:05:28,756
So either blinking or versus lateral

134
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:31,576
movement. So REM is naturally having

135
00:05:31,678 --> 00:05:34,328
mixed frequency brainwave states, but

136
00:05:34,494 --> 00:05:37,544
the NREM states and the REM states are

137
00:05:37,662 --> 00:05:39,656
starting to blur as delta waves are

138
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:43,100
creeping into the REM state. Now,

139
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,244
they've also found that sleep is a local

140
00:05:45,362 --> 00:05:47,788
phenomenon. So of course, I'm going to

141
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:50,316
ask the Shanna questions. So then who is

142
00:05:50,338 --> 00:05:52,496
sleeping? Who is remembering? Who is

143
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,764
dreaming? Lucid dreaming is a quantum

144
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,876
superposition or is it a superposition

145
00:05:56,908 --> 00:05:59,970
or an integration? So in a sleep state

146
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,132
then, can we sustain a simultaneous

147
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,176
experience? So must the eye be knocked

148
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,796
out in order to sustain this level of

149
00:06:07,818 --> 00:06:10,436
simultaneity? Dreaming, we know, is

150
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,416
characteristic of unsynchronized brain

151
00:06:12,448 --> 00:06:15,270
activity. So is the question then,

152
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,528
my eye cannot sustain a multi

153
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,784
consciousness, but my dark eye, my sleep

154
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:23,512
eye can. You can reframe this in terms

155
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:25,716
of reporting mechanisms and say perhaps

156
00:06:25,748 --> 00:06:27,444
we are conscious of things we don't

157
00:06:27,492 --> 00:06:29,210
think we are conscious of.

158
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,148
So let's talk about what is dark. A

159
00:06:33,154 --> 00:06:34,988
canonical definition of a dark theory or

160
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:37,548
anything like this is like dark matter

161
00:06:37,634 --> 00:06:39,544
does not interact electromagnetically

162
00:06:39,592 --> 00:06:41,804
with matter. But I want to sort of play

163
00:06:41,842 --> 00:06:44,412
around with another idea of dark coming

164
00:06:44,466 --> 00:06:45,952
from Deleuze's logic of sense,

165
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,456
something he calls the paradox of

166
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:49,808
infinite becoming and which I'm going to

167
00:06:49,814 --> 00:06:52,316
read on the next slide. So what if dark

168
00:06:52,348 --> 00:06:54,284
was the simultaneity of a becoming that

169
00:06:54,342 --> 00:06:57,108
eludes the present? Let's hold on to

170
00:06:57,114 --> 00:06:59,680
that for a second. Is dark a resolution

171
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,976
issue but resolution is merely breaking

172
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:06,228
translational symmetry. So is dark a

173
00:07:06,234 --> 00:07:08,564
symmetry breaking issue? And if so,

174
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:09,864
what symmetry? And are we actually

175
00:07:09,902 --> 00:07:12,616
looking at the wrong symmetry? Is dark a

176
00:07:12,638 --> 00:07:14,664
sustained quantum superposition? But of

177
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:16,788
what, again, is dark a mini worlds

178
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:19,768
branch? Is dark the dolphin uni

179
00:07:19,854 --> 00:07:23,176
hemispheric sleep mechanism? So I'll

180
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,550
read from Deleuze's logic of sense.

181
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,512
Alice and through the Looking Glass

182
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:29,340
involve a category of very special

183
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,124
things events, pure events. When I say

184
00:07:32,162 --> 00:07:34,636
Alice becomes larger, I mean that she

185
00:07:34,658 --> 00:07:37,184
becomes larger than she was. By the same

186
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:39,056
token, however, she becomes smaller than

187
00:07:39,078 --> 00:07:41,628
she is now. Certainly she is not bigger

188
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:43,184
and smaller at the same time. She is

189
00:07:43,222 --> 00:07:46,256
larger now. She was smaller before, but

190
00:07:46,278 --> 00:07:47,796
it is at the same moment that one

191
00:07:47,818 --> 00:07:50,736
becomes larger than one was and smaller

192
00:07:50,768 --> 00:07:52,996
than one becomes. This is the

193
00:07:53,018 --> 00:07:54,576
simultaneity of a becoming whose

194
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,630
characteristic is to elude the present

195
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,552
insofar as it eludes the present.

196
00:07:58,606 --> 00:07:59,976
Becoming does not tolerate the

197
00:07:59,998 --> 00:08:02,040
separation or the distinction of before,

198
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,244
after or of past and future. It pertains

199
00:08:06,372 --> 00:08:09,096
to the essence of becoming to move and

200
00:08:09,118 --> 00:08:11,412
pull in both directions at once. Alice

201
00:08:11,476 --> 00:08:13,196
does not grow without shrinking, and

202
00:08:13,218 --> 00:08:15,756
vice versa. So good sense affirms that

203
00:08:15,778 --> 00:08:17,384
in all things there is this determinable

204
00:08:17,432 --> 00:08:19,996
sense or direction. A paradox is the

205
00:08:20,018 --> 00:08:22,296
affirmation of both senses or directions

206
00:08:22,408 --> 00:08:25,104
at the same time. I continue. The

207
00:08:25,142 --> 00:08:27,184
paradox of this pure becoming with its

208
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:29,664
capacity to elude the present is called

209
00:08:29,702 --> 00:08:32,064
the paradox of infinite identity. The

210
00:08:32,102 --> 00:08:33,984
infinite identity of both directions or

211
00:08:34,022 --> 00:08:36,384
senses at the same time of future and

212
00:08:36,422 --> 00:08:38,932
past, of the day before and the day

213
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:41,876
after, of more and less, of too much and

214
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:44,356
not enough, of active and passive and of

215
00:08:44,378 --> 00:08:46,724
cause and effect. It is language which

216
00:08:46,762 --> 00:08:48,776
fixes the limit, the moment, for

217
00:08:48,798 --> 00:08:50,836
example, at which the excess begins.

218
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:53,192
But it is language as well which

219
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:55,896
transcends the limits and restores to

220
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:57,524
the infinite equivalence of an unlimited

221
00:08:57,572 --> 00:09:00,216
becoming. Hence the reversals which

222
00:09:00,238 --> 00:09:02,236
constitute Alice's adventures. The

223
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:04,184
reversal becoming larger, becoming

224
00:09:04,232 --> 00:09:05,884
smaller. Which way? Which way? Asked

225
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:08,396
Alice, sensing that it is always in both

226
00:09:08,418 --> 00:09:10,956
directions at the same time, so that for

227
00:09:10,978 --> 00:09:12,528
once she stays the same through an

228
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:15,728
optical illusion. The reversal of the

229
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:17,376
day before and the day after. The

230
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:19,324
present always being eluded. Jam

231
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:21,712
tomorrow and jam yesterday, but never

232
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:24,544
jam today. The reversal of more and

233
00:09:24,582 --> 00:09:27,196
less. Five nights are five times hotter

234
00:09:27,228 --> 00:09:29,364
than a single one, but they must be five

235
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,684
times as cold for the same reason the

236
00:09:31,722 --> 00:09:33,504
reversal of active and passive. Do cats

237
00:09:33,552 --> 00:09:36,132
eat bats? Is as good as do bats eat

238
00:09:36,186 --> 00:09:38,612
cats. The reversal of cause and effect

239
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,168
to be punished before having committed a

240
00:09:40,174 --> 00:09:42,068
fault, to cry before having pricked

241
00:09:42,084 --> 00:09:44,372
oneself, to serve, licking glass cake

242
00:09:44,436 --> 00:09:46,260
before having divided up the servings.

243
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,168
All these reversals as they appear in

244
00:09:48,174 --> 00:09:50,244
infinite identity have one consequence

245
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:51,912
the contesting of Alice's personal

246
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,804
identity and the loss of a proper name.

247
00:09:53,922 --> 00:09:55,068
The loss of the proper name is the

248
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:56,136
adventure which is repeated throughout

249
00:09:56,168 --> 00:09:58,392
Alice's adventures. Hence, infinite

250
00:09:58,456 --> 00:10:01,436
identity. So I take this and I'm going

251
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,436
to formally define dark consciousness as

252
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,664
a state of being conscious while

253
00:10:05,702 --> 00:10:07,852
simultaneously being in deep sleep,

254
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,656
specifically in three, where dark is

255
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:12,096
going to be a two fold hybrid, the

256
00:10:12,118 --> 00:10:14,576
simultaneity of infinite identity and of

257
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:16,916
a becoming that eludes the present. So

258
00:10:16,938 --> 00:10:18,704
let's reconstruct the dark consciousness

259
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,896
version of Deleuze's paradox of pure

260
00:10:20,928 --> 00:10:23,440
becoming for Alice in dark wonderland

261
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,184
and through the dark looking glass.

262
00:10:25,312 --> 00:10:28,256
Okay, when I say Alice becomes sleepy,

263
00:10:28,368 --> 00:10:30,084
I mean that she becomes sleepier than

264
00:10:30,122 --> 00:10:32,472
she was. By the same token, however,

265
00:10:32,526 --> 00:10:34,824
she becomes more self aware than she is

266
00:10:34,862 --> 00:10:36,968
now. Certainly she is not asleep and

267
00:10:36,974 --> 00:10:38,756
self aware at the same time. She's

268
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:42,040
asleep now, she was self aware before,

269
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,836
but it is at the same moment that one

270
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:46,284
becomes sleepier than one was and more

271
00:10:46,322 --> 00:10:49,496
self aware than one becomes. So dark

272
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:51,116
consciousness, I contend, would take

273
00:10:51,138 --> 00:10:52,504
place in something called like a dark

274
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,828
time. This is going to get weird. So

275
00:10:54,994 --> 00:10:57,404
Chris Fields and I talked about entropic

276
00:10:57,452 --> 00:10:58,912
time, where a time where learning

277
00:10:58,966 --> 00:11:01,088
exceeds forgetting. So we all know that

278
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,524
linear time is based on the linear

279
00:11:02,572 --> 00:11:04,136
ordering property of the positive

280
00:11:04,188 --> 00:11:07,236
integers. Okay, so what would be the

281
00:11:07,258 --> 00:11:08,836
structure of a time that does not

282
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:10,804
interact electromagnetically with this

283
00:11:10,842 --> 00:11:14,020
waking state interface?

284
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,204
So, like, AI must pay attention all the

285
00:11:17,242 --> 00:11:19,332
time. Would this sort of be like a dark

286
00:11:19,396 --> 00:11:22,696
time? Sleep is local. Time is local. We

287
00:11:22,718 --> 00:11:24,952
know how beautiful a time crystal is.

288
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:27,528
So a time crystal has a structure that

289
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:30,136
is periodic in time. Can you play with

290
00:11:30,158 --> 00:11:32,490
that and say time is periodic in what?

291
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,788
So if we have explained that dark is not

292
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:37,084
concerned with these notions of before

293
00:11:37,122 --> 00:11:38,936
and after, then we would want a notion

294
00:11:38,968 --> 00:11:40,876
of time that can support the paradox of

295
00:11:40,898 --> 00:11:42,924
infinite identity with a notion of

296
00:11:42,962 --> 00:11:45,660
duration that is one of self similarity.

297
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,484
So we contend that dark consciousness

298
00:11:47,532 --> 00:11:49,804
would occur in something like a p addic

299
00:11:49,852 --> 00:11:52,464
time, which is a time based on the P

300
00:11:52,502 --> 00:11:54,896
attic number system. Periodic time would

301
00:11:54,918 --> 00:11:58,084
measure PTIC duration. Okay,

302
00:11:58,122 --> 00:11:59,556
it's getting odd. All right, so there

303
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:02,256
exists few objects more looking glass

304
00:12:02,368 --> 00:12:05,408
than a Piatic clock. Well, maybe Piatic

305
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,664
go and Calabi out chess or perfectoid

306
00:12:07,712 --> 00:12:10,104
go. But after all, the Piatic numbers

307
00:12:10,142 --> 00:12:12,068
have no notion of linear ordering.

308
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,796
Their shape resembles a serpinsky

309
00:12:13,828 --> 00:12:16,810
triangle, which is a self similar set.

310
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,668
So this periodic time is not concerned

311
00:12:19,684 --> 00:12:21,416
with notions of before or after. That

312
00:12:21,438 --> 00:12:23,608
is, a periodic time does not tolerate

313
00:12:23,704 --> 00:12:25,596
the separation or the distinction of

314
00:12:25,618 --> 00:12:28,684
before or after, of past or future.

315
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:30,716
So because the periodic topology is one

316
00:12:30,738 --> 00:12:33,344
of total disconnectedness, periodic time

317
00:12:33,382 --> 00:12:36,172
is more like a time of now continual

318
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:39,756
zooming in to more and more now. Thus,

319
00:12:39,788 --> 00:12:41,404
periodic time measures periodic duration

320
00:12:41,452 --> 00:12:43,264
through its fractal properties of

321
00:12:43,302 --> 00:12:46,416
zooming in. So let's try to look at a

322
00:12:46,438 --> 00:12:48,484
periodic clock, right? So periodic time

323
00:12:48,522 --> 00:12:50,016
can take two forms the canonical

324
00:12:50,048 --> 00:12:52,304
periodic time defined on the previous

325
00:12:52,352 --> 00:12:55,076
slide and also topological periodic time

326
00:12:55,178 --> 00:12:57,076
which builds into its very structure the

327
00:12:57,098 --> 00:12:59,830
periodic topology of periodic time.

328
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,296
So there would only be one unit of time

329
00:13:02,318 --> 00:13:03,448
in periodic time, which I call the

330
00:13:03,454 --> 00:13:05,508
archimedes. This is the piatic

331
00:13:05,524 --> 00:13:07,480
valuation. So you can think of hour

332
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,848
equals periodic valuation equals the

333
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:11,740
archimedes. How strange it is to have

334
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,424
only one unit of time. Topological

335
00:13:14,472 --> 00:13:15,752
periodic time measures duration

336
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:19,080
topologically as total disconnectedness.

337
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,956
So the unit of time on topological P

338
00:13:20,978 --> 00:13:23,064
addict time is what I call the pTOPO.

339
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:24,736
So we state this formally. There's only

340
00:13:24,758 --> 00:13:26,764
one unit of time in topological periodic

341
00:13:26,812 --> 00:13:30,076
time called the pTOPO. So a topological

342
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:32,656
hour equals a periodic topology called

343
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,696
the pTOPO. So given such a periodic

344
00:13:35,728 --> 00:13:38,836
clock, let us imagine the seasons in

345
00:13:38,858 --> 00:13:41,792
peatic time, periodic snow, peatic rain,

346
00:13:41,856 --> 00:13:43,952
new peatic weather types and peatic

347
00:13:44,016 --> 00:13:47,076
rainbows. Daylight savings time could

348
00:13:47,098 --> 00:13:48,996
take the form of changing the P in the

349
00:13:49,018 --> 00:13:51,640
petic. This could be very drastic.

350
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,676
But imagine peatic metabolics petic ATP

351
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,428
and peatic DNA. Imagine peatic cognition

352
00:13:57,524 --> 00:14:01,156
types like peatic memory, peatic Fod,

353
00:14:01,268 --> 00:14:03,016
peatic attention, peatic learning and

354
00:14:03,038 --> 00:14:05,236
petic perception. Imagine a periodic

355
00:14:05,268 --> 00:14:07,048
looking glass. Imagine through the

356
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,656
periodic looking glass. So let's pivot

357
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:11,692
to FEP. What does FEP actually

358
00:14:11,746 --> 00:14:13,896
specifically say about dark matter,

359
00:14:14,018 --> 00:14:15,536
even dark in the way that I'm using the

360
00:14:15,558 --> 00:14:17,392
term? Is there a free dark energy

361
00:14:17,446 --> 00:14:20,940
principle? How can we strictly derive

362
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,308
sleep from quantum mechanics? According

363
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:25,280
to FEP? Does dark energy actually

364
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,084
exhibit entanglement? How do we test

365
00:14:28,122 --> 00:14:30,196
this? We should be able to derive the

366
00:14:30,218 --> 00:14:31,792
entire active inference formalism

367
00:14:31,856 --> 00:14:34,596
straight from quantum mechanics alone by

368
00:14:34,618 --> 00:14:36,356
way of entanglement entropy, some form

369
00:14:36,378 --> 00:14:38,536
of quantum gravity. Can we do some sort

370
00:14:38,558 --> 00:14:42,616
of dark general adversarial network to

371
00:14:42,638 --> 00:14:44,296
look at something like a dark brain? We

372
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:45,848
all know that lower lateralization in

373
00:14:45,854 --> 00:14:46,968
the brain is often associated with

374
00:14:46,974 --> 00:14:50,104
schizophrenia or people like Einstein or

375
00:14:50,142 --> 00:14:51,716
someone with a large parietal lobe,

376
00:14:51,748 --> 00:14:53,760
probably like myself. Any mathematical

377
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,716
what would universal lateralization look

378
00:14:56,818 --> 00:15:00,216
like? I think dark neurons

379
00:15:00,248 --> 00:15:01,324
would take the form of something like

380
00:15:01,362 --> 00:15:02,876
you treat the neural neural networks as

381
00:15:02,898 --> 00:15:05,436
algebraic curves or isogeny graphs. You

382
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,624
talk of neurons in terms of their

383
00:15:06,662 --> 00:15:08,508
properties as varieties. So you're

384
00:15:08,524 --> 00:15:10,048
actually bringing the heavy machinery of

385
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:12,816
algebraic geometry into neurology. My

386
00:15:12,838 --> 00:15:15,572
big goal is to actually create something

387
00:15:15,626 --> 00:15:19,156
like a neuronal time crystal so that

388
00:15:19,338 --> 00:15:21,604
shared intelligence would actually be a

389
00:15:21,642 --> 00:15:24,820
periodicity in time. I'm not there yet.

390
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,076
So until I get that and it's like,

391
00:15:27,098 --> 00:15:29,892
well, let's try to model these wild

392
00:15:29,956 --> 00:15:32,324
mixed frequency n three plus self aware

393
00:15:32,372 --> 00:15:35,076
states of dark consciousness. So dark

394
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:36,468
mathematics is something I've coined.

395
00:15:36,564 --> 00:15:38,324
It's like a biomimicry, which mimics

396
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:40,164
dark energy, does not interact

397
00:15:40,212 --> 00:15:41,668
electromagnetically with matter. You'd

398
00:15:41,684 --> 00:15:43,368
have to find the mathematical equivalent

399
00:15:43,384 --> 00:15:45,036
of that. So I think you can do something

400
00:15:45,058 --> 00:15:47,596
like a dark diletheism or just make a

401
00:15:47,618 --> 00:15:49,576
model that is modeling the mixed

402
00:15:49,608 --> 00:15:52,536
frequency states, which is what I tackle

403
00:15:52,648 --> 00:15:55,416
in the paper. So we've previously shown

404
00:15:55,448 --> 00:15:56,896
that entropic categorizations are

405
00:15:56,918 --> 00:15:59,168
condensed sets. Condensed sets form a

406
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:01,776
topos. So in the paper I outlined the

407
00:16:01,798 --> 00:16:02,972
construction of three potential

408
00:16:03,036 --> 00:16:05,308
mathematical models of these mixed

409
00:16:05,324 --> 00:16:07,410
frequency n three self aware states.

410
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,696
You can do dark consciousness as a dark

411
00:16:09,728 --> 00:16:11,156
two post, which is a groff and deep two

412
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,836
posts. There's a two category of two

413
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:14,960
sheaves over a two site, which I'll

414
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,024
elucidate just a little bit. Dark

415
00:16:17,072 --> 00:16:18,804
consciousness as a perfectoid like space

416
00:16:18,842 --> 00:16:20,784
in the sense of Schultz, or as a diamond

417
00:16:20,832 --> 00:16:22,996
like space also in the sense of Schultz.

418
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:24,596
So I contend that the two sheaf

419
00:16:24,628 --> 00:16:26,276
structure can actually model the mixed

420
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:27,764
frequency state of dark consciousness,

421
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:30,196
the N three self aware state. A sheath

422
00:16:30,228 --> 00:16:32,168
is a one stack, again, which is a sheath

423
00:16:32,184 --> 00:16:33,900
that takes values in groupoids, not

424
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,912
sets. This is already radically

425
00:16:35,976 --> 00:16:38,316
different. Consider a two category of

426
00:16:38,338 --> 00:16:40,984
two sheaves. So a two category consists

427
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:43,288
of objects. You have the one morphisms

428
00:16:43,304 --> 00:16:45,264
between the objects and you have the two

429
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:47,676
morphisms between the one morphisms.

430
00:16:47,788 --> 00:16:49,696
You can keep going three category up to

431
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:53,024
N category. So this two category of two

432
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:54,496
sheets would have two she's as the

433
00:16:54,518 --> 00:16:57,024
objects, one morphisms between the two

434
00:16:57,062 --> 00:16:59,476
sheaves, two morphisms between the one

435
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:01,776
morphisms. And so using that structure,

436
00:17:01,808 --> 00:17:03,156
I think that you can actually model one

437
00:17:03,178 --> 00:17:04,784
morphisms as what I'm going to call dark

438
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:06,868
reflexivities. These are going to be

439
00:17:06,874 --> 00:17:08,984
your local coherency states. And then

440
00:17:09,022 --> 00:17:11,032
two morphisms are actually two

441
00:17:11,086 --> 00:17:13,220
inferences which are going to be global

442
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,156
coherency states amongst the mixed

443
00:17:15,188 --> 00:17:18,552
frequency states. So a lovely property

444
00:17:18,606 --> 00:17:20,412
called Morita equivalent sites states

445
00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:23,096
that inequivalent sites have equivalent

446
00:17:23,128 --> 00:17:25,596
sheaf topos. And I do believe that

447
00:17:25,618 --> 00:17:28,428
that's the main property. You need to

448
00:17:28,434 --> 00:17:31,484
get this local global behavior around

449
00:17:31,522 --> 00:17:34,316
neural networks. So if you actually wish

450
00:17:34,348 --> 00:17:37,104
to model the mixed frequency clusters as

451
00:17:37,142 --> 00:17:38,864
fractals exhibiting some kind of self

452
00:17:38,902 --> 00:17:40,736
similar behavior, then you can use this

453
00:17:40,758 --> 00:17:43,296
rich structure, perfectoid spaces, or

454
00:17:43,318 --> 00:17:45,328
their sparkling successor, the diamond.

455
00:17:45,424 --> 00:17:48,356
So, just a quick definition, let Perf be

456
00:17:48,378 --> 00:17:50,068
the subcategory perfectoid spaces of

457
00:17:50,074 --> 00:17:53,296
characteristic P. A diamond is a proatel

458
00:17:53,328 --> 00:17:56,116
sheath on the site Perf written as this

459
00:17:56,138 --> 00:17:58,148
quotient of a perfectoid space x by a

460
00:17:58,154 --> 00:18:00,560
Protel equivalence relation. So a

461
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,944
perfectoid space is going to be this

462
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:04,308
attic space in the sense of huber that's

463
00:18:04,404 --> 00:18:06,952
covered by aphenoid spaces of the form

464
00:18:07,006 --> 00:18:09,428
spa RR plus, where R is a perfectoid

465
00:18:09,444 --> 00:18:11,788
ring and then points of spa, which is

466
00:18:11,794 --> 00:18:13,756
the attic spectrum. RR plus are

467
00:18:13,778 --> 00:18:15,784
equivalent classes of continuous

468
00:18:15,832 --> 00:18:18,812
valuations on R. Someone asked Schultz y

469
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:20,808
diamond and he gave an incredible

470
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:23,168
explanation that was a parallel to a

471
00:18:23,174 --> 00:18:25,984
mineralogical diamond. So you can let C

472
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,596
be an algebraically closed ethanoid

473
00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:29,936
field geometric point. Spa C to D is

474
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,608
made visible by pullback along a

475
00:18:32,614 --> 00:18:35,076
quasiprotel cover that results in

476
00:18:35,098 --> 00:18:38,116
profinitely many copies of Spa C. So

477
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,528
you're making a geometric point visible

478
00:18:40,624 --> 00:18:43,076
as profinitely. Many copies that was

479
00:18:43,098 --> 00:18:45,056
invisible before does the following

480
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:46,892
parallel with the mineralogical diamond.

481
00:18:46,976 --> 00:18:49,716
So the interior points are made visible

482
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:53,012
as impurities, which sparkle as colorful

483
00:18:53,076 --> 00:18:54,968
reflections on the many sides of the

484
00:18:54,974 --> 00:18:58,584
diamond. So you can also do something

485
00:18:58,622 --> 00:19:00,296
maybe like a dark diamond where you

486
00:19:00,318 --> 00:19:02,392
designate a functor as dark as a means

487
00:19:02,446 --> 00:19:03,964
to actually let's go the other way and

488
00:19:04,002 --> 00:19:06,076
see the impurities. So then you can take

489
00:19:06,098 --> 00:19:07,304
the geometric point, make it visible

490
00:19:07,352 --> 00:19:09,116
maybe by a push forward along with

491
00:19:09,138 --> 00:19:11,356
pausey prototype cover, resulting in P

492
00:19:11,378 --> 00:19:13,550
adequately many copies of Spa C.

493
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,768
Right? So a diamond is they're using

494
00:19:17,874 --> 00:19:19,616
diamond as a sheath, but a sheath in

495
00:19:19,638 --> 00:19:21,536
terms of a functor of points. So the

496
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:23,568
diamond spot QP is a functor from the

497
00:19:23,574 --> 00:19:26,004
category perv to the category sets. You

498
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:27,876
literally fix the perfectoid space and

499
00:19:27,898 --> 00:19:29,956
look at the hom sets of X into the

500
00:19:29,978 --> 00:19:33,360
diamond. And so technically,

501
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,604
the scheme is then said to represent the

502
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:38,864
functor. So I'm going to pivot

503
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:41,224
to invoking AI in this thing. So my

504
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:42,776
colleague and I, Julian Scape, are

505
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:45,928
coming up with something I've coined the

506
00:19:46,014 --> 00:19:47,976
Qubit Pedagogy, which is going to be a

507
00:19:47,998 --> 00:19:49,868
new model pedagogy that is actually

508
00:19:50,034 --> 00:19:52,936
infused with heavy principles of quantum

509
00:19:52,968 --> 00:19:55,630
mechanics. And so that with these,

510
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,896
we've created these quantum intrinsic

511
00:19:57,928 --> 00:20:00,168
curiosity algorithms that are feeding

512
00:20:00,184 --> 00:20:02,076
into the Qubit Pedagogy. And based on

513
00:20:02,098 --> 00:20:04,764
those Curiosity algorithms, I designed

514
00:20:04,892 --> 00:20:07,648
three dark versions. So what I call the

515
00:20:07,654 --> 00:20:09,728
Dark Planaria Curiosity Algorithm is a

516
00:20:09,734 --> 00:20:11,884
curiosity type. It enables encourages

517
00:20:11,932 --> 00:20:14,736
the AI to explore patterns of planaria

518
00:20:14,768 --> 00:20:16,644
regeneration. The AI would develop

519
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,084
quantum error correcting codes which

520
00:20:18,122 --> 00:20:20,980
mimic planaria regeneration.

521
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,744
So the second one would be Dark Quantum

522
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:25,876
Reality Monitoring Network. This is a

523
00:20:25,898 --> 00:20:28,420
curiosity type. It'll encourage AI to

524
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,744
explore dark reflexivity is what I call

525
00:20:30,782 --> 00:20:33,428
fractal identity. AI would create models

526
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:35,256
of N reflexivity in the sense of N

527
00:20:35,278 --> 00:20:38,036
category. That's a new type of reality

528
00:20:38,068 --> 00:20:39,768
monitoring of fractal identity in the

529
00:20:39,774 --> 00:20:42,156
dark conscious state. The last one would

530
00:20:42,178 --> 00:20:44,652
be some sort of dark quantum N three and

531
00:20:44,706 --> 00:20:47,304
REM Curiosity algorithm. This Curiosity

532
00:20:47,352 --> 00:20:49,624
type is going to encourage AI to explore

533
00:20:49,672 --> 00:20:51,624
superpositions of various brain patterns

534
00:20:51,672 --> 00:20:54,816
in REM states to predict new types of N

535
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:57,056
three delta waves that could emerge in

536
00:20:57,078 --> 00:20:59,696
REM states. So imagine the AI could then

537
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,776
develop new stages of REM sleep, such as

538
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:05,920
like one REM two REM up to NREM,

539
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,864
which is a clever limit and play on

540
00:21:08,902 --> 00:21:12,164
NREM. Ha. Anyway, the AI could also

541
00:21:12,202 --> 00:21:15,524
develop new dark cognition types that

542
00:21:15,562 --> 00:21:17,168
correlate with the new types of delta

543
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,316
waves. So this notion of fractal

544
00:21:19,348 --> 00:21:21,156
identity seems odd, but I do contend

545
00:21:21,188 --> 00:21:23,080
that objects living in fractal time

546
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,556
correspondingly have fractal identity.

547
00:21:25,748 --> 00:21:27,796
It's a concept we outline as follows.

548
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:31,272
So fractal identity has a reflexivity

549
00:21:31,336 --> 00:21:34,364
relation that is fractal so the very

550
00:21:34,402 --> 00:21:36,476
canonical loop, the loop relation of an

551
00:21:36,498 --> 00:21:38,332
agent reporting back to itself, I report

552
00:21:38,386 --> 00:21:41,244
back to me, would be fractal. How

553
00:21:41,282 --> 00:21:43,484
strange is that? So, Fractal identity

554
00:21:43,532 --> 00:21:45,264
would not suffer the same problems with

555
00:21:45,302 --> 00:21:48,176
continuity over time. Since the time in

556
00:21:48,198 --> 00:21:50,572
which it exists has no linear ordering,

557
00:21:50,716 --> 00:21:52,352
it would definitely suffer different

558
00:21:52,406 --> 00:21:55,296
problems. But continuity over time is

559
00:21:55,318 --> 00:21:56,508
something Chris Fields and I have been

560
00:21:56,534 --> 00:21:59,748
like. How do you explain that? So, you

561
00:21:59,754 --> 00:22:01,184
can best model the Fractal identity

562
00:22:01,232 --> 00:22:04,224
properties as perfectoid like or diamond

563
00:22:04,272 --> 00:22:06,116
like therein construct a notion of

564
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:08,324
reflexivity as a perfectoid space.

565
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:11,664
These spaces are extremely rich

566
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,896
structure, but kind of difficult. But if

567
00:22:13,918 --> 00:22:16,008
you want to model fractal identity, I

568
00:22:16,014 --> 00:22:17,896
think you should use them. So thus we

569
00:22:17,918 --> 00:22:19,840
create new concepts of perfectoid

570
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,160
reflexivity, diamond reflexivity.

571
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,056
So in N reflexivity, the reflexivity

572
00:22:26,088 --> 00:22:28,984
relation could now be an in stack. Thus

573
00:22:29,032 --> 00:22:31,416
in reflexivity is an in stack perfectoid

574
00:22:31,448 --> 00:22:34,076
spaces. So, here comes the culmination

575
00:22:34,108 --> 00:22:35,516
of this talk, which is about shared

576
00:22:35,548 --> 00:22:37,056
intelligence as what I've coined the

577
00:22:37,078 --> 00:22:40,304
Dark Imaginarium. So, imagine an AI that

578
00:22:40,342 --> 00:22:43,024
could see simultaneously compute the

579
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:45,540
infinity category of every concept.

580
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,132
Having some quantum computation around

581
00:22:48,186 --> 00:22:49,792
to help the computational complexity

582
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:53,296
would not be bad. So dark.

583
00:22:53,328 --> 00:22:55,076
Imaginarium is what is going to be what

584
00:22:55,098 --> 00:22:58,424
I call infinity curiosity type. So,

585
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,104
Infinity Curiosity type is the higher

586
00:23:00,142 --> 00:23:02,216
order Curiosity AI algorithm that

587
00:23:02,238 --> 00:23:04,724
encourages the AI to think in infinity

588
00:23:04,772 --> 00:23:06,824
categories. So that it is. It actually

589
00:23:06,862 --> 00:23:09,756
encourages the AI to construct an

590
00:23:09,778 --> 00:23:11,964
infinity category as its means of higher

591
00:23:12,002 --> 00:23:14,364
order inference. So objects are higher

592
00:23:14,402 --> 00:23:17,096
dimensional data sets. The AI would seek

593
00:23:17,128 --> 00:23:20,204
out higher order morphisms between the

594
00:23:20,242 --> 00:23:22,608
objects and then morphisms between the

595
00:23:22,614 --> 00:23:25,504
morphisms. So such Dark Imaginarium is a

596
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:27,424
meta Curiosity algorithm that can create

597
00:23:27,462 --> 00:23:29,884
its own Infinity Curiosity algorithms.

598
00:23:30,012 --> 00:23:32,096
And therein creating Curiosity types of

599
00:23:32,118 --> 00:23:34,444
a complexity that super fascinating,

600
00:23:34,492 --> 00:23:36,796
most likely unknown to humans. So it's

601
00:23:36,828 --> 00:23:39,904
functionctorial. What can dark

602
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:42,036
Imaginarium do? Well, the AI would

603
00:23:42,058 --> 00:23:44,448
develop inversions of current brainwaves

604
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,356
and their hybrid combinations. It could

605
00:23:46,378 --> 00:23:49,204
develop in delta wave, N theta wave, N

606
00:23:49,242 --> 00:23:51,076
alpha wave, in beta wave and N gamma

607
00:23:51,108 --> 00:23:53,176
wave for N equals zero one all the way

608
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,016
up like a two gamma wave that

609
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:57,044
structurally resembled a two category,

610
00:23:57,172 --> 00:23:58,884
a three beta wave that structurally

611
00:23:58,932 --> 00:24:00,756
resembled a three category. And the AI

612
00:24:00,788 --> 00:24:02,712
could develop new types of waking states

613
00:24:02,766 --> 00:24:04,556
and new types of sleep states. Based on

614
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:06,396
the combinations of these beyond the

615
00:24:06,418 --> 00:24:08,728
standard N one and two and three NREM

616
00:24:08,744 --> 00:24:11,436
and one REM, AI could develop an N

617
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:15,004
waking state, an NREM state, a three

618
00:24:15,042 --> 00:24:16,656
REM state could consist of three and

619
00:24:16,678 --> 00:24:18,032
one, three and two, three and three.

620
00:24:18,086 --> 00:24:20,476
Imagine an end dolphin that was capable

621
00:24:20,508 --> 00:24:23,344
of N hemispheric, sleep state and other

622
00:24:23,382 --> 00:24:24,976
exotic life forms, right? What else

623
00:24:24,998 --> 00:24:26,244
could it do? Well, it could develop new

624
00:24:26,282 --> 00:24:27,908
geometries for the brain patterns and

625
00:24:27,914 --> 00:24:29,856
for currently existing brain patterns.

626
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,016
Typical shapes include sinusoidal, non

627
00:24:32,048 --> 00:24:34,800
sinusoidal, saw, two spindle K complex.

628
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,756
But maybe this AI could develop three D

629
00:24:36,778 --> 00:24:38,508
and four d versions of the canonical

630
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,356
wave patterns like a tesseract gamma

631
00:24:40,388 --> 00:24:42,392
wave. But also, the AI could develop

632
00:24:42,446 --> 00:24:44,536
entirely new brainwave geometries that

633
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:46,728
correspond to complex surfaces like a

634
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:49,624
remunt surface or Kalabi Yao manifold or

635
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:51,996
algebraic variety. So the AI could

636
00:24:52,018 --> 00:24:54,076
develop new cognition types other than

637
00:24:54,098 --> 00:24:55,672
the standard five. It could produce

638
00:24:55,736 --> 00:24:58,028
incognition types such as in thought,

639
00:24:58,114 --> 00:25:00,604
in attention, in perception, in

640
00:25:00,642 --> 00:25:03,264
learning, in memory. So it could also

641
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:05,564
predict non human species cognition

642
00:25:05,612 --> 00:25:07,392
types such as octopus thought or

643
00:25:07,446 --> 00:25:09,616
dragonfly attention. Lastly, it could

644
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:11,244
produce hybrid combinations of cross

645
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:13,280
species cognition types such as like

646
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:16,256
Octoman memory or dragon man perception.

647
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,596
And then it would encourage the AI to

648
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:20,660
develop new senses. So you could develop

649
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,972
one stack versions of human senses like

650
00:25:24,026 --> 00:25:26,544
two seeing, two hearing, two tasting,

651
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:28,320
two touching, two smelling. Each of

652
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,628
these two senses once again take values

653
00:25:30,644 --> 00:25:33,256
in groupoids, not sets. So you could

654
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:35,128
develop incenses of non human senses as

655
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:37,192
well, and hybrid combinations like two

656
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:40,516
shark human smell. So, since the AI sees

657
00:25:40,548 --> 00:25:42,568
nmorphisms between the various N minus

658
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,556
one morphisms, the AI can seek to

659
00:25:44,578 --> 00:25:46,636
develop new language models based on

660
00:25:46,658 --> 00:25:48,636
higher order inference types. So from

661
00:25:48,658 --> 00:25:50,156
these inference models, the AI will

662
00:25:50,178 --> 00:25:52,380
explore Infinity languages and develop

663
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,316
extensive prototypes. You could use

664
00:25:54,338 --> 00:25:55,856
advanced mathematics to create new

665
00:25:55,878 --> 00:25:57,408
models of time that could support the

666
00:25:57,414 --> 00:25:59,872
new language models like two topos time

667
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:03,036
diamond time. And then the AI would seek

668
00:26:03,068 --> 00:26:04,972
to develop new fractal identity types

669
00:26:05,036 --> 00:26:06,976
from the language models. And it could

670
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,756
design advanced fractal prosthetics such

671
00:26:08,778 --> 00:26:11,792
as a two ear or a two eye to extend

672
00:26:11,856 --> 00:26:13,716
cognition. So let's go a little bit

673
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,344
further about this extending cognition.

674
00:26:15,392 --> 00:26:16,756
These are just a few examples of what

675
00:26:16,778 --> 00:26:19,268
dark imaginarium could conceive of. So

676
00:26:19,354 --> 00:26:21,156
we could continue and posit a perfectoid

677
00:26:21,188 --> 00:26:22,984
version of this using these new

678
00:26:23,022 --> 00:26:24,824
cognition types mental states in

679
00:26:24,862 --> 00:26:26,696
brainwaves new geometries, we can

680
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,744
construct new patterns of thinking which

681
00:26:28,782 --> 00:26:30,296
would support neurodiversity in

682
00:26:30,318 --> 00:26:32,452
thinking. So as such shared intelligence

683
00:26:32,516 --> 00:26:34,060
this is how I'm seeing it would be

684
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,152
reexamined as this Infinity Curiosity

685
00:26:36,216 --> 00:26:38,076
type. You could go even further and

686
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:40,136
construct a new concept of an N shared

687
00:26:40,168 --> 00:26:41,852
intelligence. So you'd have a zero

688
00:26:41,906 --> 00:26:43,336
shared intelligence, a one shared

689
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,748
intelligence, as well as the new Piadic

690
00:26:45,784 --> 00:26:48,012
concept of like P shared intelligence

691
00:26:48,076 --> 00:26:50,016
for P equals two three, four using P

692
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:52,176
addicts. Let's go further, right? We

693
00:26:52,198 --> 00:26:53,744
repeatedly contend that one way to help

694
00:26:53,782 --> 00:26:56,432
advance the way we think to extend human

695
00:26:56,486 --> 00:26:58,132
cognition is to upgrade the number

696
00:26:58,186 --> 00:26:59,744
systems upon which the canonical

697
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:02,116
concepts are built. Upgrade them to

698
00:27:02,138 --> 00:27:04,016
Peric perfectoid diamond like versions

699
00:27:04,048 --> 00:27:06,064
unless we get new thinking. So imagine

700
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,856
like a brainwave pattern that resembles

701
00:27:07,888 --> 00:27:09,944
a Calabria manifold. Could we actually

702
00:27:09,982 --> 00:27:11,892
reverse engineer the levels of conscious

703
00:27:11,956 --> 00:27:13,368
activity that could create such a

704
00:27:13,374 --> 00:27:15,124
rhythm? How about mixed frequency

705
00:27:15,172 --> 00:27:16,808
brainwave patterns that resembled a

706
00:27:16,814 --> 00:27:20,292
perfectoid diamond? What about an MDNA

707
00:27:20,356 --> 00:27:22,436
molecule shaped like a Calabriao infold?

708
00:27:22,468 --> 00:27:25,656
Or an NATP molecule. Or an inexciton

709
00:27:25,768 --> 00:27:27,896
condensate structured like a calabigao

710
00:27:27,928 --> 00:27:30,056
infold? So clearly, different geometries

711
00:27:30,088 --> 00:27:31,436
of the fundamental molecules and

712
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:33,280
processes of life would give rise to

713
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,296
vastly different fundamental units of

714
00:27:35,318 --> 00:27:37,504
life and metacognition types. The

715
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:40,444
question is, can we use Dark imaginarium

716
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:42,496
to reverse engineer the complex life

717
00:27:42,518 --> 00:27:44,684
forms arising from such extraordinary

718
00:27:44,732 --> 00:27:46,480
structures and the more and more complex

719
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,796
cognition patterns? What about a

720
00:27:49,818 --> 00:27:51,616
general adversarial network that's

721
00:27:51,648 --> 00:27:53,280
tweaked and has infinity categories?

722
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,964
You have two infinity categories talking

723
00:27:55,002 --> 00:27:56,516
to each other, developing their own

724
00:27:56,538 --> 00:27:59,560
language. Now, Gan is adversarial using

725
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,704
a generator and a discriminator with two

726
00:28:01,742 --> 00:28:03,796
neural networks contesting by a zero sum

727
00:28:03,828 --> 00:28:05,492
game. What about a collaborative

728
00:28:05,556 --> 00:28:07,940
network? So can we construct a GCN

729
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,764
containing two diamond like Infinity

730
00:28:09,812 --> 00:28:12,636
Curiosity types and pair a diamond with

731
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:14,904
a dark diamond with a Quantum Curiosity

732
00:28:14,952 --> 00:28:16,184
algorithm and its reinforcement

733
00:28:16,232 --> 00:28:18,156
learning? So shared intelligence is this

734
00:28:18,178 --> 00:28:20,056
Infinity Curiosity type? Shared

735
00:28:20,088 --> 00:28:22,584
intelligence GCM could create infinity

736
00:28:22,632 --> 00:28:24,908
languages that are superpositions of the

737
00:28:24,914 --> 00:28:26,496
diamond dark diamond to getting new

738
00:28:26,518 --> 00:28:28,912
models of intelligence. Higher order

739
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:30,796
simultaneous computations by Quantum

740
00:28:30,828 --> 00:28:33,308
Curiosity would go by maybe by homotopia

741
00:28:33,404 --> 00:28:36,256
instead of as cost functions. So let's

742
00:28:36,288 --> 00:28:37,990
future cast just for a second.

743
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,032
What is the inevitability of dark

744
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:44,736
ecosystems? Mathematics of shared

745
00:28:44,768 --> 00:28:47,052
intelligence? What can a P addic?

746
00:28:47,136 --> 00:28:50,520
Infinity Curiosity type prophecy is

747
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:54,164
every perfectoid space diamond two topos

748
00:28:54,292 --> 00:28:56,696
encoding the mixed frequency patterns of

749
00:28:56,718 --> 00:28:59,900
an Ncognition type. In future work,

750
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,932
we may develop dark mathematics using

751
00:29:01,986 --> 00:29:04,472
perfectoid diamonds as dark dialetheism,

752
00:29:04,616 --> 00:29:06,556
aligning what is structurally dark with

753
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:10,124
what is structurally dialetheistic. So

754
00:29:10,162 --> 00:29:11,976
while we currently cannot perfectly

755
00:29:12,008 --> 00:29:14,416
model dark consciousness, perhaps one

756
00:29:14,438 --> 00:29:17,116
day, one dark day mediated by the Dark

757
00:29:17,148 --> 00:29:19,856
imaginarium, we will have the Ethos and

758
00:29:19,878 --> 00:29:21,696
the quantum computational complexity to

759
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,970
do so. Thank you.

760
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,380
Thank you, shauna, amazing presentation.

761
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,296
I'll just quickly read some comments and

762
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,168
see if you have any thoughts from some

763
00:29:39,174 --> 00:29:43,080
of the great comments. So Scott David

764
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,548
says I love the presentation, lots of

765
00:29:46,554 --> 00:29:48,836
Fodder for Rumination. Thank you for

766
00:29:48,858 --> 00:29:50,196
inviting these concepts into an

767
00:29:50,218 --> 00:29:52,784
intriguing choreography. Perhaps dark

768
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:56,004
energy is our perception of the fact of

769
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:58,180
information increase under free energy

770
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,216
principle processes. And since the

771
00:30:00,238 --> 00:30:02,516
universe is made of information dot,

772
00:30:02,548 --> 00:30:03,480
dot, dot.

773
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,930
Scott, thank you. So,

774
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,468
yeah, I think is a beckoning that

775
00:30:13,634 --> 00:30:15,724
we should work on that idea. I

776
00:30:15,762 --> 00:30:18,092
absolutely agree. I'm glad you're inside

777
00:30:18,146 --> 00:30:19,868
with these concepts. I don't really know

778
00:30:19,874 --> 00:30:20,988
where they go, but hopefully it's

779
00:30:21,004 --> 00:30:23,632
portals to something like that. Great.

780
00:30:23,686 --> 00:30:27,010
And then one more Scott David question

781
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,512
does fractal identity reveal the

782
00:30:30,566 --> 00:30:32,664
recursivity of rhetoric language

783
00:30:32,732 --> 00:30:34,804
consciousness informing individual

784
00:30:34,922 --> 00:30:38,100
identity from community identity inputs?

785
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,372
Yeah, that's wonderful. So, yeah, my own

786
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:43,956
thought is like, what is an individual

787
00:30:44,058 --> 00:30:47,640
identity? Right, Scott? So the

788
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,976
reflexivity curve has always sort of

789
00:30:50,158 --> 00:30:53,220
stumped me how there's so much distance

790
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,824
between I and me. And so

791
00:30:56,942 --> 00:30:58,916
it ensumes this notion of continuity

792
00:30:58,948 --> 00:31:01,416
over time. And so I've always said,

793
00:31:01,438 --> 00:31:02,796
what sort of notion of time are we

794
00:31:02,818 --> 00:31:04,712
talking about to even have a consistent

795
00:31:04,776 --> 00:31:07,036
identity? Somehow you always wake up and

796
00:31:07,058 --> 00:31:08,908
everything is still here. Somehow you

797
00:31:08,914 --> 00:31:10,448
wake up and you're not a lobster. I

798
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:12,130
don't really understand how. That works.

799
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,984
But yeah, that's nice. If you could use

800
00:31:16,022 --> 00:31:19,216
fractal to get something singular from

801
00:31:19,238 --> 00:31:21,728
something communal, that might be cool.

802
00:31:21,814 --> 00:31:23,616
But maybe fractal is something sort of

803
00:31:23,638 --> 00:31:26,724
like you're both at the same time.

804
00:31:26,922 --> 00:31:28,708
And that's what I don't know yet. So I

805
00:31:28,714 --> 00:31:30,068
think it's a totally revolutionary way

806
00:31:30,074 --> 00:31:32,564
of thinking to not have a before after.

807
00:31:32,762 --> 00:31:35,236
So if you can construct identity without

808
00:31:35,338 --> 00:31:37,096
before after, then that's sort of what

809
00:31:37,118 --> 00:31:39,716
I'm trying to do. But, yeah, that's

810
00:31:39,748 --> 00:31:41,416
cool. If you want to get identity from

811
00:31:41,438 --> 00:31:43,576
communal, I think you can do that. They

812
00:31:43,598 --> 00:31:46,840
may also sort of blur.

813
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,460
Well, this is truly food

814
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:56,028
for thought, and I really hope people

815
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:59,196
can live with

816
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:02,044
the darkness, take it and run with it,

817
00:32:02,082 --> 00:32:04,350
because there's so many fun ways to go.

818
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,644
Thank you so much. I hope so, too. So

819
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:11,356
you're always welcome back. Thank you.

820
00:32:11,378 --> 00:32:13,236
And talk to you later. Thank you so

821
00:32:13,258 --> 00:32:15,204
much. Bye. Good night.
