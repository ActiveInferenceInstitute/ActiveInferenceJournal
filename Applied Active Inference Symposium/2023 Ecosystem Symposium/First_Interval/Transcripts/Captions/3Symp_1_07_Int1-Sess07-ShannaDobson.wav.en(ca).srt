1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:05,954
Daniel: All right, the next session is

2
00:00:05,954 --> 00:00:09,014
going to be with Shanna Dobson.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,438
This section is going to be called Dark

4
00:00:13,438 --> 00:00:16,779
Imaginarium Shared Intelligence as an

5
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:19,018
Infinity Curiosity type.

6
00:00:24,547 --> 00:00:26,744
I'll message Shanna make sure that

7
00:00:26,744 --> 00:00:28,941
everything's good with the audio.

8
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:33,473
Wow.

9
00:00:37,814 --> 00:00:40,128
Great talk so far.

10
00:00:40,137 --> 00:00:41,219
Welcome, Shana.

11
00:00:41,222 --> 00:00:42,377
How are you doing, Daniel?

12
00:00:42,382 --> 00:00:43,466
Shanna: Doing good.

13
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:45,679
Daniel: Awesome.

14
00:00:46,697 --> 00:00:48,960
Well, please take it away.

15
00:00:48,973 --> 00:00:50,117
Thank you for joining.

16
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:51,230
Shanna: Awesome.

17
00:00:51,248 --> 00:00:53,414
Let me know if you see my screen.

18
00:00:53,424 --> 00:00:53,489
OK?

19
00:00:55,614 --> 00:00:56,732
Daniel: Yep, looks perfect.

20
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:57,817
Thank you.

21
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,058
Shanna: OK, perfect.

22
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:01,671
Hey, everyone, thank you so much for the

23
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:02,728
invitation.

24
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:03,898
It's such a great honor to be here.

25
00:01:04,901 --> 00:01:05,026
I'm learning so much.

26
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:07,295
I'll be talking about an idea I had

27
00:01:07,295 --> 00:01:10,590
called Dark Imaginarium, where I'm trying

28
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,871
to make shared intelligence the concept

29
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:16,174
of what I call an Infinity Curiosity type.

30
00:01:16,174 --> 00:01:16,196
.

31
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,468
So you were so gracious to link the paper

32
00:01:19,468 --> 00:01:22,719
so anyone can find more details there on

33
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,813
Phil archive.

34
00:01:23,887 --> 00:01:26,109
So I want to start with an discussion

35
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:27,289
about ontological commitment.

36
00:01:28,302 --> 00:01:30,523
So my first question is, might we re

37
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:32,750
examine our ontological commitments?

38
00:01:32,784 --> 00:01:34,993
So in particular, two of them?

39
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:38,310
One, Sean Carroll, said so amazingly what

40
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,622
cannot be known because it does not exist.

41
00:01:41,622 --> 00:01:41,629
.

42
00:01:41,648 --> 00:01:43,829
So Sean Carroll says the Heisenberg

43
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,003
Uncertainty Principle is often explained

44
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:47,023
as saying that we cannot simultaneously

45
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,043
know both the position and the velocity

46
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:50,053
of any object.

47
00:01:50,053 --> 00:01:52,071
But the reality is deeper than that.

48
00:01:52,072 --> 00:01:54,092
It's not that we can't know position and

49
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:56,112
momentum, it's that they don't even exist

50
00:01:56,112 --> 00:01:57,122
at the same time.

51
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,094
The second one I want to examine is Lenny

52
00:02:00,094 --> 00:02:02,114
Susskin's quote, we are all behind

53
00:02:02,114 --> 00:02:04,131
someone else's event horizon.

54
00:02:04,132 --> 00:02:06,157
So Suskin has a brilliant idea of space

55
00:02:06,157 --> 00:02:09,183
time emergence as the entanglement of two

56
00:02:09,183 --> 00:02:11,207
black holes, and what emerges from that

57
00:02:11,207 --> 00:02:14,231
is called computational complexity.

58
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:16,259
So the world is quantum, so every theory

59
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:19,281
should be derivable strictly from the

60
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:20,297
laws of quantum mechanics.

61
00:02:20,298 --> 00:02:22,316
One is going to give us the notion of

62
00:02:22,316 --> 00:02:24,333
shared, two is going to give us the

63
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,343
notion of ecology.

64
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:27,368
So what would an ontological commitment

65
00:02:27,368 --> 00:02:29,379
to Dark look like?

66
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:31,408
So my continual goal, as everybody knows,

67
00:02:31,408 --> 00:02:34,433
is to sustain a simultaneous experience

68
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:37,460
and to understand why I currently cannot.

69
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:37,461
.

70
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:39,485
To sustain a simultaneous experience

71
00:02:39,485 --> 00:02:42,511
would be to bypass the integrative system

72
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:43,525
we call consciousness.

73
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:45,546
So how would you attain a two

74
00:02:45,546 --> 00:02:48,574
consciousness in the sense of in category

75
00:02:48,574 --> 00:02:50,594
theory or an N consciousness?

76
00:02:50,596 --> 00:02:52,615
How would we actually develop something

77
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:54,629
called like, a two memory?

78
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:56,649
So my colleague Robert Prepner and I

79
00:02:56,649 --> 00:02:58,670
fleshed out something called N awareness,

80
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,632
where we're sort of examining this idea.

81
00:03:00,634 --> 00:03:03,663
Mike Levin and all have repeatedly shown

82
00:03:03,663 --> 00:03:06,693
that planaria memory is not in the head.

83
00:03:06,695 --> 00:03:08,710
Where is the memory?

84
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:10,731
Is memory a sustained superposition?

85
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:11,742
Well, of what?

86
00:03:11,743 --> 00:03:13,761
And also, what's the structure of

87
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:13,767
anamnesis?

88
00:03:13,768 --> 00:03:15,787
Could you have a superposition between

89
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:16,797
memory and anamnesis?

90
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:18,819
So I had a small dialogue with Chris

91
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:20,838
Fields, the amazing I said, you know,

92
00:03:20,838 --> 00:03:22,858
what is the difference between these two

93
00:03:22,858 --> 00:03:23,864
questions?

94
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:25,889
What is the waking state and what is

95
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:26,898
consciousness?

96
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:29,923
Or could it be that these are entirely

97
00:03:29,923 --> 00:03:30,936
separate questions?

98
00:03:31,941 --> 00:03:32,954
So we're sort of in a mess.

99
00:03:32,955 --> 00:03:35,980
Either way, if there is a difference in

100
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,004
these questions, then it is possible to

101
00:03:37,004 --> 00:03:39,023
sustain a waking state without

102
00:03:39,023 --> 00:03:42,049
consciousness and or a conscious state in

103
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:43,064
a non waking state.

104
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:45,085
So imagine somehow being in a waking

105
00:03:45,085 --> 00:03:47,102
state under general anesthesia.

106
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:49,123
Well, if these are not entirely different

107
00:03:49,123 --> 00:03:51,141
questions, then we could contend that

108
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:53,161
consciousness is a form of waking state,

109
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:55,180
or something along the lines of a waking

110
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,200
state is a condition of a conscious state.

111
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,202
.

112
00:03:57,204 --> 00:04:00,171
So how can humans have delta waves, which

113
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:02,198
are canonically indicative of unconscious

114
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:05,224
deep sleep and thus a non waking state,

115
00:04:05,224 --> 00:04:08,250
and the REM state, the patterns of which

116
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,273
are indistinguishable from a waking

117
00:04:10,273 --> 00:04:11,280
state?

118
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:13,309
So we all know that general anesthesia,

119
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:16,334
something like a propofol, can reduce the

120
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:18,355
polyrhythmic brain activity to one

121
00:04:18,355 --> 00:04:19,362
uniform.

122
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,387
And we know there's as many theories

123
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:23,401
about what anesthesia does to

124
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:24,413
consciousness as there are

125
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:25,423
anesthesiologists.

126
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:26,439
But we've repeatedly posited

127
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,456
consciousness as the proto state.

128
00:04:28,457 --> 00:04:30,478
And I wanted to turn this idea on its

129
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,501
head, like is consciousness so robust or

130
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:35,523
is it a delicate interference or is it a

131
00:04:35,523 --> 00:04:36,536
delicate inference?

132
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:39,560
Now, we know beginnings are always tricky,

133
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,581
, but what if sleep was the proto state?

134
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:44,614
So if life is oceanic and it revolves in

135
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:47,640
these deep pressures, would the pressure

136
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,664
of getting onto land, like squeeze the

137
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,688
REM state into this full blown waking

138
00:04:51,688 --> 00:04:54,715
state that we're engaging in right now?

139
00:04:54,715 --> 00:04:55,728
Anybody who's listening?

140
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,750
So then waking state would be something

141
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,711
like an acceptation, which is, I think,

142
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:01,721
quite impressive.

143
00:05:01,723 --> 00:05:03,747
So it's in this mess that I attempt to

144
00:05:03,747 --> 00:05:05,769
define dark consciousness as a mixed

145
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:08,793
frequency state of being self aware or

146
00:05:08,793 --> 00:05:10,819
conscious while simultaneously being in a

147
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:13,847
deep sleep, specifically in three sleep.

148
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:16,875
So the sleep is proto state is quite

149
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:17,882
strange.

150
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:19,900
The REM brain activity is

151
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,926
indistinguishable from waking activity

152
00:05:21,926 --> 00:05:24,955
and this sort of enchanted me for a bit.

153
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:26,974
The only difference is eye movements.

154
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:28,998
So either blinking or versus lateral

155
00:05:28,998 --> 00:05:29,005
movement.

156
00:05:29,006 --> 00:05:32,030
So REM is naturally having mixed

157
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,059
frequency brainwave states, but the NREM

158
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:38,090
states and the REM states are starting to

159
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,120
blur as delta waves are creeping into the

160
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,130
REM state.

161
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:45,161
Now, they've also found that sleep is a

162
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:46,173
local phenomenon.

163
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:48,196
So of course, I'm going to ask the Shanna

164
00:05:48,196 --> 00:05:49,201
questions.

165
00:05:49,203 --> 00:05:51,220
So then who is sleeping?

166
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:52,231
Who is remembering?

167
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:53,240
Who is dreaming?

168
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:55,265
Lucid dreaming is a quantum superposition

169
00:05:55,265 --> 00:05:57,282
or is it a superposition or an

170
00:05:57,282 --> 00:05:58,290
integration?

171
00:05:58,293 --> 00:06:01,265
So in a sleep state then, can we sustain

172
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:03,286
a simultaneous experience?

173
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:06,313
So must the eye be knocked out in order

174
00:06:06,313 --> 00:06:08,339
to sustain this level of simultaneity?

175
00:06:09,343 --> 00:06:11,365
Dreaming, we know, is characteristic of

176
00:06:11,365 --> 00:06:13,382
unsynchronized brain activity.

177
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:16,413
So is the question then, my eye cannot

178
00:06:16,413 --> 00:06:19,442
sustain a multi consciousness, but my

179
00:06:19,442 --> 00:06:21,465
dark eye, my sleep eye can.

180
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:23,485
You can reframe this in terms of

181
00:06:23,485 --> 00:06:25,507
reporting mechanisms and say perhaps we

182
00:06:25,507 --> 00:06:28,530
are conscious of things we don't think we

183
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,541
are conscious of.

184
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,577
So let's talk about what is dark.

185
00:06:32,578 --> 00:06:35,600
A canonical definition of a dark theory

186
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,624
or anything like this is like dark matter

187
00:06:37,624 --> 00:06:39,645
does not interact electromagnetically

188
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:40,653
with matter.

189
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:42,675
But I want to sort of play around with

190
00:06:42,675 --> 00:06:44,697
another idea of dark coming from Deleuze'

191
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:46,718
's logic of sense, something he calls the

192
00:06:46,718 --> 00:06:49,740
paradox of infinite becoming and which I'

193
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,758
'm going to read on the next slide.

194
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,784
So what if dark was the simultaneity of a

195
00:06:53,784 --> 00:06:55,805
becoming that eludes the present?

196
00:06:56,813 --> 00:06:58,829
Let's hold on to that for a second.

197
00:06:58,831 --> 00:07:01,802
Is dark a resolution issue but resolution

198
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:04,834
is merely breaking translational symmetry.

199
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:04,834
.

200
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,866
So is dark a symmetry breaking issue?

201
00:07:07,868 --> 00:07:09,881
And if so, what symmetry?

202
00:07:09,881 --> 00:07:11,901
And are we actually looking at the wrong

203
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:11,906
symmetry?

204
00:07:11,908 --> 00:07:13,922
Is dark a sustained quantum

205
00:07:13,922 --> 00:07:14,930
superposition?

206
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:16,957
But of what, again, is dark a mini worlds

207
00:07:16,957 --> 00:07:17,962
branch?

208
00:07:17,964 --> 00:07:20,998
Is dark the dolphin uni hemispheric sleep

209
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:21,007
mechanism?

210
00:07:22,016 --> 00:07:25,040
So I'll read from Deleuze's logic of

211
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,045
sense.

212
00:07:26,049 --> 00:07:27,068
Alice and through the Looking Glass

213
00:07:27,068 --> 00:07:30,091
involve a category of very special things

214
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:31,103
events, pure events.

215
00:07:31,104 --> 00:07:33,129
When I say Alice becomes larger, I mean

216
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:36,153
that she becomes larger than she was.

217
00:07:36,154 --> 00:07:38,176
By the same token, however, she becomes

218
00:07:38,176 --> 00:07:40,190
smaller than she is now.

219
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:41,209
Certainly she is not bigger and smaller

220
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:42,217
at the same time.

221
00:07:42,217 --> 00:07:44,230
She is larger now.

222
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,257
She was smaller before, but it is at the

223
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,284
same moment that one becomes larger than

224
00:07:49,284 --> 00:07:52,310
one was and smaller than one becomes.

225
00:07:52,312 --> 00:07:54,332
This is the simultaneity of a becoming

226
00:07:54,332 --> 00:07:56,351
whose characteristic is to elude the

227
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,373
present insofar as it eludes the present.

228
00:07:58,373 --> 00:07:58,374
.

229
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,342
Becoming does not tolerate the separation

230
00:08:01,342 --> 00:08:03,369
or the distinction of before, after or of

231
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:05,380
past and future.

232
00:08:05,382 --> 00:08:07,409
It pertains to the essence of becoming to

233
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:10,436
move and pull in both directions at once.

234
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:10,437
.

235
00:08:10,438 --> 00:08:13,462
Alice does not grow without shrinking,

236
00:08:13,462 --> 00:08:14,472
and vice versa.

237
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:16,493
So good sense affirms that in all things

238
00:08:16,493 --> 00:08:17,509
there is this determinable sense or

239
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:18,515
direction.

240
00:08:18,516 --> 00:08:21,539
A paradox is the affirmation of both

241
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,564
senses or directions at the same time.

242
00:08:23,565 --> 00:08:24,575
I continue.

243
00:08:24,577 --> 00:08:27,599
The paradox of this pure becoming with

244
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,621
its capacity to elude the present is

245
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:31,646
called the paradox of infinite identity.

246
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:34,672
The infinite identity of both directions

247
00:08:34,672 --> 00:08:36,697
or senses at the same time of future and

248
00:08:36,697 --> 00:08:39,724
past, of the day before and the day after,

249
00:08:39,724 --> 00:08:41,748
, of more and less, of too much and not

250
00:08:41,748 --> 00:08:44,771
enough, of active and passive and of

251
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:45,783
cause and effect.

252
00:08:45,785 --> 00:08:47,809
It is language which fixes the limit, the

253
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:50,832
moment, for example, at which the excess

254
00:08:50,832 --> 00:08:50,837
begins.

255
00:08:50,838 --> 00:08:52,858
But it is language as well which

256
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:55,884
transcends the limits and restores to the

257
00:08:55,884 --> 00:08:57,906
infinite equivalence of an unlimited

258
00:08:57,906 --> 00:08:58,913
becoming.

259
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:00,877
Hence the reversals which constitute

260
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:01,889
Alice's adventures.

261
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,910
The reversal becoming larger, becoming

262
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:04,915
smaller.

263
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:05,920
Which way?

264
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:05,926
Which way?

265
00:09:05,926 --> 00:09:08,950
Asked Alice, sensing that it is always in

266
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,974
both directions at the same time, so that

267
00:09:10,974 --> 00:09:12,996
for once she stays the same through an

268
00:09:12,996 --> 00:09:13,008
optical illusion.

269
00:09:14,014 --> 00:09:16,034
The reversal of the day before and the

270
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:17,040
day after.

271
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,059
The present always being eluded.

272
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,089
Jam tomorrow and jam yesterday, but never

273
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:22,097
jam today.

274
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:25,119
The reversal of more and less.

275
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:27,142
Five nights are five times hotter than a

276
00:09:27,142 --> 00:09:29,164
single one, but they must be five times

277
00:09:29,164 --> 00:09:31,185
as cold for the same reason the reversal

278
00:09:31,185 --> 00:09:32,199
of active and passive.

279
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:34,212
Do cats eat bats?

280
00:09:34,213 --> 00:09:37,239
Is as good as do bats eat cats.

281
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:39,259
The reversal of cause and effect to be

282
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:41,279
punished before having committed a fault,

283
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,299
to cry before having pricked oneself, to

284
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:44,318
serve, licking glass cake before having

285
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:46,332
divided up the servings.

286
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,351
All these reversals as they appear in

287
00:09:48,351 --> 00:09:50,370
infinite identity have one consequence

288
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,386
the contesting of Alice's personal

289
00:09:51,386 --> 00:09:53,407
identity and the loss of a proper name.

290
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:55,420
The loss of the proper name is the

291
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,433
adventure which is repeated throughout

292
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:57,440
Alice's adventures.

293
00:09:57,441 --> 00:09:59,462
Hence, infinite identity.

294
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,429
So I take this and I'm going to formally

295
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:04,452
define dark consciousness as a state of

296
00:10:04,452 --> 00:10:06,473
being conscious while simultaneously

297
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:08,494
being in deep sleep, specifically in

298
00:10:08,494 --> 00:10:10,516
three, where dark is going to be a two

299
00:10:10,516 --> 00:10:13,540
fold hybrid, the simultaneity of infinite

300
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,562
identity and of a becoming that eludes

301
00:10:15,562 --> 00:10:16,573
the present.

302
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,592
So let's reconstruct the dark

303
00:10:18,592 --> 00:10:20,610
consciousness version of Deleuze's

304
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,631
paradox of pure becoming for Alice in

305
00:10:22,631 --> 00:10:24,651
dark wonderland and through the dark

306
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:25,661
looking glass.

307
00:10:25,662 --> 00:10:27,689
Okay, when I say Alice becomes sleepy, I

308
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:30,714
mean that she becomes sleepier than she

309
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:30,718
was.

310
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,743
By the same token, however, she becomes

311
00:10:33,743 --> 00:10:35,764
more self aware than she is now.

312
00:10:35,765 --> 00:10:37,781
Certainly she is not asleep and self

313
00:10:37,781 --> 00:10:38,792
aware at the same time.

314
00:10:38,793 --> 00:10:40,816
She's asleep now, she was self aware

315
00:10:40,816 --> 00:10:43,843
before, but it is at the same moment that

316
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,866
one becomes sleepier than one was and

317
00:10:45,866 --> 00:10:48,890
more self aware than one becomes.

318
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,915
So dark consciousness, I contend, would

319
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:52,931
take place in something called like a

320
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:52,937
dark time.

321
00:10:52,937 --> 00:10:54,949
This is going to get weird.

322
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,972
So Chris Fields and I talked about

323
00:10:56,972 --> 00:10:58,992
entropic time, where a time where

324
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,952
learning exceeds forgetting.

325
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:02,972
So we all know that linear time is based

326
00:11:02,972 --> 00:11:04,991
on the linear ordering property of the

327
00:11:04,991 --> 00:11:05,001
positive integers.

328
00:11:05,002 --> 00:11:08,031
Okay, so what would be the structure of a

329
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:10,051
time that does not interact

330
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:12,076
electromagnetically with this waking

331
00:11:12,076 --> 00:11:14,090
state interface?

332
00:11:14,095 --> 00:11:17,122
So, like, AI must pay attention all the

333
00:11:17,122 --> 00:11:17,126
time.

334
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:20,150
Would this sort of be like a dark time?

335
00:11:20,152 --> 00:11:21,161
Sleep is local.

336
00:11:21,162 --> 00:11:22,172
Time is local.

337
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:24,199
We know how beautiful a time crystal is.

338
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,228
So a time crystal has a structure that is

339
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,241
periodic in time.

340
00:11:29,243 --> 00:11:31,264
Can you play with that and say time is

341
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:32,274
periodic in what?

342
00:11:33,284 --> 00:11:35,305
So if we have explained that dark is not

343
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:37,325
concerned with these notions of before

344
00:11:37,325 --> 00:11:39,346
and after, then we would want a notion of

345
00:11:39,346 --> 00:11:41,365
time that can support the paradox of

346
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:43,382
infinite identity with a notion of

347
00:11:43,382 --> 00:11:45,406
duration that is one of self similarity.

348
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:48,429
So we contend that dark consciousness

349
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:50,452
would occur in something like a p addic

350
00:11:50,452 --> 00:11:52,473
time, which is a time based on the P

351
00:11:52,473 --> 00:11:53,487
attic number system.

352
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:56,516
Periodic time would measure PTIC duration.

353
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:56,516
.

354
00:11:57,526 --> 00:11:58,536
Okay, it's getting odd.

355
00:11:58,537 --> 00:12:01,503
All right, so there exists few objects

356
00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:04,530
more looking glass than a Piatic clock.

357
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:06,557
Well, maybe Piatic go and Calabi out

358
00:12:06,557 --> 00:12:08,573
chess or perfectoid go.

359
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,596
But after all, the Piatic numbers have no

360
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,610
notion of linear ordering.

361
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:14,632
Their shape resembles a serpinsky

362
00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:16,657
triangle, which is a self similar set.

363
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:19,686
So this periodic time is not concerned

364
00:12:19,686 --> 00:12:21,701
with notions of before or after.

365
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:23,723
That is, a periodic time does not

366
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:25,742
tolerate the separation or the

367
00:12:25,742 --> 00:12:27,768
distinction of before or after, of past

368
00:12:27,768 --> 00:12:28,776
or future.

369
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:31,804
So because the periodic topology is one

370
00:12:31,804 --> 00:12:34,831
of total disconnectedness, periodic time

371
00:12:34,831 --> 00:12:36,855
is more like a time of now continual

372
00:12:36,855 --> 00:12:38,878
zooming in to more and more now.

373
00:12:39,882 --> 00:12:41,902
Thus, periodic time measures periodic

374
00:12:41,902 --> 00:12:43,924
duration through its fractal properties

375
00:12:43,924 --> 00:12:44,933
of zooming in.

376
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,962
So let's try to look at a periodic clock,

377
00:12:47,962 --> 00:12:47,965
right?

378
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:49,989
So periodic time can take two forms the

379
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:52,011
canonical periodic time defined on the

380
00:12:52,011 --> 00:12:54,032
previous slide and also topological

381
00:12:54,032 --> 00:12:56,056
periodic time which builds into its very

382
00:12:56,056 --> 00:12:58,076
structure the periodic topology of

383
00:12:58,076 --> 00:12:59,087
periodic time.

384
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:02,050
So there would only be one unit of time

385
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,067
in periodic time, which I call the

386
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:04,073
archimedes.

387
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,091
This is the piatic valuation.

388
00:13:06,093 --> 00:13:08,116
So you can think of hour equals periodic

389
00:13:08,116 --> 00:13:10,134
valuation equals the archimedes.

390
00:13:10,135 --> 00:13:12,157
How strange it is to have only one unit

391
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:13,162
of time.

392
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,188
Topological periodic time measures

393
00:13:15,188 --> 00:13:17,208
duration topologically as total

394
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,220
disconnectedness.

395
00:13:19,222 --> 00:13:21,240
So the unit of time on topological P

396
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,260
addict time is what I call the pTOPO.

397
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,273
So we state this formally.

398
00:13:24,273 --> 00:13:26,292
There's only one unit of time in

399
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:28,312
topological periodic time called the

400
00:13:28,312 --> 00:13:28,317
pTOPO.

401
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:31,348
So a topological hour equals a periodic

402
00:13:31,348 --> 00:13:33,368
topology called the pTOPO.

403
00:13:34,373 --> 00:13:37,400
So given such a periodic clock, let us

404
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,425
imagine the seasons in peatic time,

405
00:13:39,425 --> 00:13:42,452
periodic snow, peatic rain, new peatic

406
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:44,479
weather types and peatic rainbows.

407
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:47,506
Daylight savings time could take the form

408
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:49,524
of changing the P in the petic.

409
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:51,545
This could be very drastic.

410
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,576
But imagine peatic metabolics petic ATP

411
00:13:54,576 --> 00:13:55,586
and peatic DNA.

412
00:13:55,588 --> 00:13:58,612
Imagine peatic cognition types like

413
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:00,576
peatic memory, peatic Fod, peatic

414
00:14:00,576 --> 00:14:03,602
attention, peatic learning and petic

415
00:14:03,602 --> 00:14:04,612
perception.

416
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:05,629
Imagine a periodic looking glass.

417
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,650
Imagine through the periodic looking

418
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:08,654
glass.

419
00:14:08,657 --> 00:14:10,674
So let's pivot to FEP.

420
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:12,696
What does FEP actually specifically say

421
00:14:12,696 --> 00:14:14,716
about dark matter, even dark in the way

422
00:14:14,716 --> 00:14:16,730
that I'm using the term?

423
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,752
Is there a free dark energy principle?

424
00:14:18,755 --> 00:14:21,783
How can we strictly derive sleep from

425
00:14:21,783 --> 00:14:22,797
quantum mechanics?

426
00:14:22,798 --> 00:14:23,809
According to FEP?

427
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:26,831
Does dark energy actually exhibit

428
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:27,840
entanglement?

429
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:28,857
How do we test this?

430
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:30,878
We should be able to derive the entire

431
00:14:30,878 --> 00:14:32,899
active inference formalism straight from

432
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:34,916
quantum mechanics alone by way of

433
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,934
entanglement entropy, some form of

434
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:37,944
quantum gravity.

435
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:40,969
Can we do some sort of dark general

436
00:14:40,969 --> 00:14:42,997
adversarial network to look at something

437
00:14:42,997 --> 00:14:44,010
like a dark brain?

438
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:46,030
We all know that lower lateralization in

439
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,046
the brain is often associated with

440
00:14:47,046 --> 00:14:49,065
schizophrenia or people like Einstein or

441
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:51,081
someone with a large parietal lobe,

442
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:52,093
probably like myself.

443
00:14:52,094 --> 00:14:55,123
Any mathematical what would universal

444
00:14:55,123 --> 00:14:57,144
lateralization look like?

445
00:14:58,158 --> 00:15:00,117
I think dark neurons would take the form

446
00:15:00,117 --> 00:15:02,135
of something like you treat the neural

447
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,152
neural networks as algebraic curves or

448
00:15:04,152 --> 00:15:05,161
isogeny graphs.

449
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:06,178
You talk of neurons in terms of their

450
00:15:06,178 --> 00:15:08,190
properties as varieties.

451
00:15:08,191 --> 00:15:09,209
So you're actually bringing the heavy

452
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,227
machinery of algebraic geometry into

453
00:15:11,227 --> 00:15:12,233
neurology.

454
00:15:12,234 --> 00:15:15,260
My big goal is to actually create

455
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,291
something like a neuronal time crystal so

456
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:21,321
that shared intelligence would actually

457
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,342
be a periodicity in time.

458
00:15:23,346 --> 00:15:24,357
I'm not there yet.

459
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:27,384
So until I get that and it's like, well,

460
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,406
let's try to model these wild mixed

461
00:15:29,406 --> 00:15:32,432
frequency n three plus self aware states

462
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,448
of dark consciousness.

463
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,470
So dark mathematics is something I've

464
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:36,474
coined.

465
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:38,495
It's like a biomimicry, which mimics dark

466
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,507
energy, does not interact

467
00:15:39,507 --> 00:15:41,524
electromagnetically with matter.

468
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,539
You'd have to find the mathematical

469
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:43,548
equivalent of that.

470
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:46,572
So I think you can do something like a

471
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,597
dark diletheism or just make a model that

472
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:51,620
is modeling the mixed frequency states,

473
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,644
which is what I tackle in the paper.

474
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:55,668
So we've previously shown that entropic

475
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:57,689
categorizations are condensed sets.

476
00:15:58,690 --> 00:15:59,709
Condensed sets form a topos.

477
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:01,667
So in the paper I outlined the

478
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:03,684
construction of three potential

479
00:16:03,684 --> 00:16:05,702
mathematical models of these mixed

480
00:16:05,702 --> 00:16:07,724
frequency n three self aware states.

481
00:16:07,728 --> 00:16:09,745
You can do dark consciousness as a dark

482
00:16:09,745 --> 00:16:11,762
two post, which is a groff and deep two

483
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:11,766
posts.

484
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:13,785
There's a two category of two sheaves

485
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:15,805
over a two site, which I'll elucidate

486
00:16:15,805 --> 00:16:16,815
just a little bit.

487
00:16:16,816 --> 00:16:18,836
Dark consciousness as a perfectoid like

488
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:20,854
space in the sense of Schultz, or as a

489
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,874
diamond like space also in the sense of

490
00:16:22,874 --> 00:16:22,879
Schultz.

491
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,899
So I contend that the two sheaf structure

492
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,917
can actually model the mixed frequency

493
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:28,935
state of dark consciousness, the N three

494
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:29,944
self aware state.

495
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:31,967
A sheath is a one stack, again, which is

496
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:34,989
a sheath that takes values in groupoids,

497
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:34,995
not sets.

498
00:16:34,996 --> 00:16:36,016
This is already radically different.

499
00:16:36,018 --> 00:16:39,041
Consider a two category of two sheaves.

500
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:41,068
So a two category consists of objects.

501
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:44,090
You have the one morphisms between the

502
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,110
objects and you have the two morphisms

503
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,126
between the one morphisms.

504
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:50,150
You can keep going three category up to N

505
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,156
category.

506
00:16:51,161 --> 00:16:53,186
So this two category of two sheets would

507
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:55,206
have two she's as the objects, one

508
00:16:55,206 --> 00:16:58,230
morphisms between the two sheaves, two

509
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,194
morphisms between the one morphisms.

510
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:02,213
And so using that structure, I think that

511
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:04,231
you can actually model one morphisms as

512
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,249
what I'm going to call dark reflexivities.

513
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:06,250
.

514
00:17:06,252 --> 00:17:07,266
These are going to be your local

515
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:08,275
coherency states.

516
00:17:08,276 --> 00:17:10,299
And then two morphisms are actually two

517
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:13,322
inferences which are going to be global

518
00:17:13,322 --> 00:17:15,342
coherency states amongst the mixed

519
00:17:15,342 --> 00:17:16,354
frequency states.

520
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:19,380
So a lovely property called Morita

521
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,408
equivalent sites states that inequivalent

522
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:24,434
sites have equivalent sheaf topos.

523
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:27,461
And I do believe that that's the main

524
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:27,468
property.

525
00:17:27,469 --> 00:17:30,493
You need to get this local global

526
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:32,516
behavior around neural networks.

527
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,540
So if you actually wish to model the

528
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,560
mixed frequency clusters as fractals

529
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,580
exhibiting some kind of self similar

530
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,600
behavior, then you can use this rich

531
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,621
structure, perfectoid spaces, or their

532
00:17:43,621 --> 00:17:45,642
sparkling successor, the diamond.

533
00:17:45,643 --> 00:17:47,668
So, just a quick definition, let Perf be

534
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:50,690
the subcategory perfectoid spaces of

535
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,702
characteristic P.

536
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:54,730
A diamond is a proatel sheath on the site

537
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,752
Perf written as this quotient of a

538
00:17:56,752 --> 00:17:58,772
perfectoid space x by a Protel

539
00:17:58,772 --> 00:17:59,787
equivalence relation.

540
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,754
So a perfectoid space is going to be this

541
00:18:02,754 --> 00:18:04,777
attic space in the sense of huber that's

542
00:18:04,777 --> 00:18:06,799
covered by aphenoid spaces of the form

543
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,823
spa RR plus, where R is a perfectoid ring

544
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:11,844
and then points of spa, which is the

545
00:18:11,844 --> 00:18:12,855
attic spectrum.

546
00:18:12,856 --> 00:18:15,880
RR plus are equivalent classes of

547
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,901
continuous valuations on R.

548
00:18:17,905 --> 00:18:19,928
Someone asked Schultz y diamond and he

549
00:18:19,928 --> 00:18:22,952
gave an incredible explanation that was a

550
00:18:22,952 --> 00:18:24,975
parallel to a mineralogical diamond.

551
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,998
So you can let C be an algebraically

552
00:18:26,998 --> 00:18:28,001
closed ethanoid field geometric point.

553
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:31,004
Spa C to D is made visible by pullback

554
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:34,007
along a quasiprotel cover that results in

555
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:37,010
profinitely many copies of Spa C.

556
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,012
So you're making a geometric point

557
00:18:39,012 --> 00:18:41,014
visible as profinitely.

558
00:18:41,014 --> 00:18:43,016
Many copies that was invisible before

559
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:45,018
does the following parallel with the

560
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:46,019
mineralogical diamond.

561
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:49,022
So the interior points are made visible

562
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:52,025
as impurities, which sparkle as colorful

563
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:55,027
reflections on the many sides of the

564
00:18:55,027 --> 00:18:55,028
diamond.

565
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:58,031
So you can also do something maybe like a

566
00:18:58,031 --> 00:19:00,027
dark diamond where you designate a

567
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:02,029
functor as dark as a means to actually

568
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:04,031
let's go the other way and see the

569
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:05,032
impurities.

570
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:07,034
So then you can take the geometric point,

571
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:09,036
make it visible maybe by a push forward

572
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:11,038
along with pausey prototype cover,

573
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:13,040
resulting in P adequately many copies of

574
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,040
Spa C.

575
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:14,041
Right?

576
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,044
So a diamond is they're using diamond as

577
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:19,046
a sheath, but a sheath in terms of a

578
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:21,048
functor of points.

579
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:23,050
So the diamond spot QP is a functor from

580
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,052
the category perv to the category sets.

581
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:27,054
You literally fix the perfectoid space

582
00:19:27,054 --> 00:19:30,057
and look at the hom sets of X into the

583
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:30,057
diamond.

584
00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:33,060
And so technically, the scheme is then

585
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,063
said to represent the functor.

586
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:39,066
So I'm going to pivot to invoking AI in

587
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:40,067
this thing.

588
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:43,070
So my colleague and I, Julian Scape, are

589
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,072
coming up with something I've coined the

590
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:48,075
Qubit Pedagogy, which is going to be a

591
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:50,077
new model pedagogy that is actually

592
00:19:50,077 --> 00:19:52,079
infused with heavy principles of quantum

593
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:53,080
mechanics.

594
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,083
And so that with these, we've created

595
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,085
these quantum intrinsic curiosity

596
00:19:58,085 --> 00:20:00,081
algorithms that are feeding into the

597
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:01,082
Qubit Pedagogy.

598
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:04,085
And based on those Curiosity algorithms,

599
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:06,087
I designed three dark versions.

600
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:08,089
So what I call the Dark Planaria

601
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:10,091
Curiosity Algorithm is a curiosity type.

602
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:13,094
It enables encourages the AI to explore

603
00:20:13,094 --> 00:20:15,096
patterns of planaria regeneration.

604
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:17,098
The AI would develop quantum error

605
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:20,101
correcting codes which mimic planaria

606
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:20,101
regeneration.

607
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:23,104
So the second one would be Dark Quantum

608
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:25,106
Reality Monitoring Network.

609
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:26,107
This is a curiosity type.

610
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:28,109
It'll encourage AI to explore dark

611
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:31,112
reflexivity is what I call fractal

612
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:32,112
identity.

613
00:20:32,113 --> 00:20:34,115
AI would create models of N reflexivity

614
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:36,116
in the sense of N category.

615
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:38,119
That's a new type of reality monitoring

616
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:40,121
of fractal identity in the dark conscious

617
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:41,122
state.

618
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:43,124
The last one would be some sort of dark

619
00:20:43,124 --> 00:20:45,126
quantum N three and REM Curiosity

620
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:46,127
algorithm.

621
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:49,130
This Curiosity type is going to encourage

622
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,132
AI to explore superpositions of various

623
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:53,134
brain patterns in REM states to predict

624
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:56,137
new types of N three delta waves that

625
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:58,139
could emerge in REM states.

626
00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:01,136
So imagine the AI could then develop new

627
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:04,139
stages of REM sleep, such as like one REM

628
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:07,142
two REM up to NREM, which is a clever

629
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:09,144
limit and play on NREM.

630
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:10,145
Ha.

631
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:12,147
Anyway, the AI could also develop new

632
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:15,150
dark cognition types that correlate with

633
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,152
the new types of delta waves.

634
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:20,155
So this notion of fractal identity seems

635
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:22,157
odd, but I do contend that objects living

636
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:24,159
in fractal time correspondingly have

637
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,160
fractal identity.

638
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,162
It's a concept we outline as follows.

639
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:30,165
So fractal identity has a reflexivity

640
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:32,167
relation that is fractal so the very

641
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:35,170
canonical loop, the loop relation of an

642
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,173
agent reporting back to itself, I report

643
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:40,175
back to me, would be fractal.

644
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:42,177
How strange is that?

645
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:44,179
So, Fractal identity would not suffer the

646
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:46,181
same problems with continuity over time.

647
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,184
Since the time in which it exists has no

648
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,186
linear ordering, it would definitely

649
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:53,187
suffer different problems.

650
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:55,190
But continuity over time is something

651
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,192
Chris Fields and I have been like.

652
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:59,193
How do you explain that?

653
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,190
So, you can best model the Fractal

654
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,192
identity properties as perfectoid like or

655
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:05,194
diamond like therein construct a notion

656
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:08,197
of reflexivity as a perfectoid space.

657
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:11,200
These spaces are extremely rich structure,

658
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,202
, but kind of difficult.

659
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:15,204
But if you want to model fractal identity,

660
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:17,206
, I think you should use them.

661
00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:19,208
So thus we create new concepts of

662
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:22,211
perfectoid reflexivity, diamond

663
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:23,212
reflexivity.

664
00:22:23,212 --> 00:22:25,214
So in N reflexivity, the reflexivity

665
00:22:25,214 --> 00:22:28,217
relation could now be an in stack.

666
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:30,219
Thus in reflexivity is an in stack

667
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:32,221
perfectoid spaces.

668
00:22:32,221 --> 00:22:34,223
So, here comes the culmination of this

669
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:36,225
talk, which is about shared intelligence

670
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:38,227
as what I've coined the Dark Imaginarium.

671
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:38,227
.

672
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:40,229
So, imagine an AI that could see

673
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:43,232
simultaneously compute the infinity

674
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:45,234
category of every concept.

675
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:49,238
Having some quantum computation around to

676
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:51,240
help the computational complexity would

677
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,241
not be bad.

678
00:22:52,241 --> 00:22:53,242
So dark.

679
00:22:53,242 --> 00:22:56,244
Imaginarium is what is going to be what I

680
00:22:56,244 --> 00:22:57,246
call infinity curiosity type.

681
00:22:58,247 --> 00:23:00,243
So, Infinity Curiosity type is the higher

682
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:02,245
order Curiosity AI algorithm that

683
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:04,247
encourages the AI to think in infinity

684
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:05,248
categories.

685
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:06,249
So that it is.

686
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:08,251
It actually encourages the AI to

687
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:10,253
construct an infinity category as its

688
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:13,256
means of higher order inference.

689
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:15,258
So objects are higher dimensional data

690
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:15,258
sets.

691
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:18,261
The AI would seek out higher order

692
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:21,264
morphisms between the objects and then

693
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:23,266
morphisms between the morphisms.

694
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:25,268
So such Dark Imaginarium is a meta

695
00:23:25,268 --> 00:23:27,270
Curiosity algorithm that can create its

696
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,272
own Infinity Curiosity algorithms.

697
00:23:30,272 --> 00:23:32,275
And therein creating Curiosity types of a

698
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:34,277
complexity that super fascinating, most

699
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:36,279
likely unknown to humans.

700
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:37,280
So it's functionctorial.

701
00:23:39,282 --> 00:23:41,284
What can dark Imaginarium do?

702
00:23:41,284 --> 00:23:43,286
Well, the AI would develop inversions of

703
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:45,288
current brainwaves and their hybrid

704
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:45,288
combinations.

705
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:48,291
It could develop in delta wave, N theta

706
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,293
wave, N alpha wave, in beta wave and N

707
00:23:50,293 --> 00:23:52,295
gamma wave for N equals zero one all the

708
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:54,297
way up like a two gamma wave that

709
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:56,299
structurally resembled a two category, a

710
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:58,301
three beta wave that structurally

711
00:23:58,301 --> 00:24:00,297
resembled a three category.

712
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:02,299
And the AI could develop new types of

713
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:03,300
waking states and new types of sleep

714
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,301
states.

715
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:06,303
Based on the combinations of these beyond

716
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:09,306
the standard N one and two and three NREM

717
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:11,308
and one REM, AI could develop an N waking

718
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:13,310
state, an NREM state, a three REM state

719
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,313
could consist of three and one, three and

720
00:24:16,313 --> 00:24:18,315
two, three and three.

721
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:20,317
Imagine an end dolphin that was capable

722
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:22,319
of N hemispheric, sleep state and other

723
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:24,321
exotic life forms, right?

724
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:25,322
What else could it do?

725
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:27,324
Well, it could develop new geometries for

726
00:24:27,324 --> 00:24:28,325
the brain patterns and for currently

727
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:29,326
existing brain patterns.

728
00:24:29,326 --> 00:24:32,329
Typical shapes include sinusoidal, non

729
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:34,331
sinusoidal, saw, two spindle K complex.

730
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:36,333
But maybe this AI could develop three D

731
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:39,336
and four d versions of the canonical wave

732
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:41,338
patterns like a tesseract gamma wave.

733
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:43,340
But also, the AI could develop entirely

734
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,342
new brainwave geometries that correspond

735
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:48,345
to complex surfaces like a remunt surface

736
00:24:48,345 --> 00:24:50,347
or Kalabi Yao manifold or algebraic

737
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:51,348
variety.

738
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:53,350
So the AI could develop new cognition

739
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,351
types other than the standard five.

740
00:24:55,351 --> 00:24:57,354
It could produce incognition types such

741
00:24:57,354 --> 00:24:59,356
as in thought, in attention, in

742
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:02,353
perception, in learning, in memory.

743
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:04,355
So it could also predict non human

744
00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:06,357
species cognition types such as octopus

745
00:25:06,357 --> 00:25:08,359
thought or dragonfly attention.

746
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:10,361
Lastly, it could produce hybrid

747
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:12,363
combinations of cross species cognition

748
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:14,365
types such as like Octoman memory or

749
00:25:14,365 --> 00:25:16,367
dragon man perception.

750
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:18,369
And then it would encourage the AI to

751
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:19,370
develop new senses.

752
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,373
So you could develop one stack versions

753
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:24,375
of human senses like two seeing, two

754
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:27,378
hearing, two tasting, two touching, two

755
00:25:27,378 --> 00:25:27,378
smelling.

756
00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:30,381
Each of these two senses once again take

757
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:32,383
values in groupoids, not sets.

758
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:34,385
So you could develop incenses of non

759
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:36,387
human senses as well, and hybrid

760
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:38,389
combinations like two shark human smell.

761
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:41,392
So, since the AI sees nmorphisms between

762
00:25:41,392 --> 00:25:43,394
the various N minus one morphisms, the AI

763
00:25:43,394 --> 00:25:45,396
can seek to develop new language models

764
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:48,399
based on higher order inference types.

765
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:50,401
So from these inference models, the AI

766
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:52,403
will explore Infinity languages and

767
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:53,404
develop extensive prototypes.

768
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:55,406
You could use advanced mathematics to

769
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:57,408
create new models of time that could

770
00:25:57,408 --> 00:25:59,410
support the new language models like two

771
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,405
topos time diamond time.

772
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:03,408
And then the AI would seek to develop new

773
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:05,410
fractal identity types from the language

774
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,411
models.

775
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:08,413
And it could design advanced fractal

776
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:10,415
prosthetics such as a two ear or a two

777
00:26:10,415 --> 00:26:12,417
eye to extend cognition.

778
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:14,419
So let's go a little bit further about

779
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:15,420
this extending cognition.

780
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,422
These are just a few examples of what

781
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:18,423
dark imaginarium could conceive of.

782
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:20,425
So we could continue and posit a

783
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:22,427
perfectoid version of this using these

784
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:24,429
new cognition types mental states in

785
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:26,431
brainwaves new geometries, we can

786
00:26:26,431 --> 00:26:28,433
construct new patterns of thinking which

787
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:30,435
would support neurodiversity in thinking.

788
00:26:30,435 --> 00:26:30,435
.

789
00:26:30,435 --> 00:26:32,437
So as such shared intelligence this is

790
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:35,439
how I'm seeing it would be reexamined as

791
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:36,441
this Infinity Curiosity type.

792
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:38,443
You could go even further and construct a

793
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:40,445
new concept of an N shared intelligence.

794
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:43,448
So you'd have a zero shared intelligence,

795
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:45,450
a one shared intelligence, as well as the

796
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,452
new Piadic concept of like P shared

797
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:49,454
intelligence for P equals two three, four

798
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:50,455
using P addicts.

799
00:26:50,455 --> 00:26:51,456
Let's go further, right?

800
00:26:52,456 --> 00:26:53,458
We repeatedly contend that one way to

801
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:56,460
help advance the way we think to extend

802
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,463
human cognition is to upgrade the number

803
00:26:58,463 --> 00:27:00,459
systems upon which the canonical concepts

804
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:01,460
are built.

805
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,462
Upgrade them to Peric perfectoid diamond

806
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:05,464
like versions unless we get new thinking.

807
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:05,464
.

808
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:07,466
So imagine like a brainwave pattern that

809
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:09,468
resembles a Calabria manifold.

810
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:11,470
Could we actually reverse engineer the

811
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,471
levels of conscious activity that could

812
00:27:12,471 --> 00:27:13,472
create such a rhythm?

813
00:27:14,472 --> 00:27:15,474
How about mixed frequency brainwave

814
00:27:15,474 --> 00:27:17,476
patterns that resembled a perfectoid

815
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:18,477
diamond?

816
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:21,480
What about an MDNA molecule shaped like a

817
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,481
Calabriao infold?

818
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:24,483
Or an NATP molecule.

819
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:26,485
Or an inexciton condensate structured

820
00:27:26,485 --> 00:27:28,487
like a calabigao infold?

821
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:30,489
So clearly, different geometries of the

822
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:32,491
fundamental molecules and processes of

823
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:34,493
life would give rise to vastly different

824
00:27:34,493 --> 00:27:35,494
fundamental units of life and

825
00:27:35,494 --> 00:27:37,496
metacognition types.

826
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:39,498
The question is, can we use Dark

827
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:41,500
imaginarium to reverse engineer the

828
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,502
complex life forms arising from such

829
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:46,505
extraordinary structures and the more and

830
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:48,507
more complex cognition patterns?

831
00:27:48,507 --> 00:27:50,509
What about a general adversarial network

832
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:52,511
that's tweaked and has infinity

833
00:27:52,511 --> 00:27:53,512
categories?

834
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:55,514
You have two infinity categories talking

835
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:56,515
to each other, developing their own

836
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:57,516
language.

837
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:59,518
Now, Gan is adversarial using a generator

838
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:01,514
and a discriminator with two neural

839
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:04,517
networks contesting by a zero sum game.

840
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:06,519
What about a collaborative network?

841
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,521
So can we construct a GCN containing two

842
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,523
diamond like Infinity Curiosity types and

843
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:13,526
pair a diamond with a dark diamond with a

844
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,528
Quantum Curiosity algorithm and its

845
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:16,529
reinforcement learning?

846
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,531
So shared intelligence is this Infinity

847
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:19,532
Curiosity type?

848
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:21,534
Shared intelligence GCM could create

849
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,536
infinity languages that are

850
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,538
superpositions of the diamond dark

851
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:27,540
diamond to getting new models of

852
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:27,540
intelligence.

853
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,543
Higher order simultaneous computations by

854
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:32,545
Quantum Curiosity would go by maybe by

855
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:35,548
homotopia instead of as cost functions.

856
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,550
So let's future cast just for a second.

857
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,555
What is the inevitability of dark

858
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:43,556
ecosystems?

859
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:45,558
Mathematics of shared intelligence?

860
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,560
What can a P addic?

861
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,563
Infinity Curiosity type prophecy is every

862
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:53,566
perfectoid space diamond two topos

863
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:56,569
encoding the mixed frequency patterns of

864
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,571
an Ncognition type.

865
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:01,568
In future work, we may develop dark

866
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,570
mathematics using perfectoid diamonds as

867
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,572
dark dialetheism, aligning what is

868
00:29:05,572 --> 00:29:07,574
structurally dark with what is

869
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:09,576
structurally dialetheistic.

870
00:29:09,576 --> 00:29:12,579
So while we currently cannot perfectly

871
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:14,581
model dark consciousness, perhaps one day,

872
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:17,584
, one dark day mediated by the Dark

873
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:19,586
imaginarium, we will have the Ethos and

874
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:21,588
the quantum computational complexity to

875
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:22,589
do so.

876
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:23,590
Thank you.

877
00:29:31,598 --> 00:29:33,600
Daniel: Thank you, shauna, amazing

878
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,601
presentation.

879
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:36,603
I'll just quickly read some comments and

880
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:39,606
see if you have any thoughts from some of

881
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:40,607
the great comments.

882
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:43,610
So Scott David says I love the

883
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,613
presentation, lots of Fodder for

884
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:48,614
Rumination.

885
00:29:48,615 --> 00:29:50,617
Thank you for inviting these concepts

886
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:51,618
into an intriguing choreography.

887
00:29:51,618 --> 00:29:54,621
Perhaps dark energy is our perception of

888
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:57,624
the fact of information increase under

889
00:29:57,624 --> 00:29:59,626
free energy principle processes.

890
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:01,622
And since the universe is made of

891
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:03,624
information dot, dot, dot.

892
00:30:06,627 --> 00:30:07,628
Shanna: Scott, thank you.

893
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:12,633
So, yeah, I think is a beckoning that we

894
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:15,636
should work on that idea.

895
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:16,637
I absolutely agree.

896
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:18,639
I'm glad you're inside with these

897
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:19,640
concepts.

898
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,641
I don't really know where they go, but

899
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:22,643
hopefully it's portals to something like

900
00:30:22,643 --> 00:30:22,643
that.

901
00:30:23,644 --> 00:30:23,644
Daniel: Great.

902
00:30:23,644 --> 00:30:26,647
And then one more Scott David question

903
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:29,650
does fractal identity reveal the

904
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,652
recursivity of rhetoric language

905
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:34,655
consciousness informing individual

906
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:38,659
identity from community identity inputs?

907
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,661
Shanna: Yeah, that's wonderful.

908
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:43,664
So, yeah, my own thought is like, what is

909
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:44,665
an individual identity?

910
00:30:44,665 --> 00:30:45,666
Right, Scott?

911
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:49,670
So the reflexivity curve has always sort

912
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,673
of stumped me how there's so much

913
00:30:52,673 --> 00:30:55,676
distance between I and me.

914
00:30:56,677 --> 00:30:58,679
And so it ensumes this notion of

915
00:30:58,679 --> 00:30:59,680
continuity over time.

916
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,676
And so I've always said, what sort of

917
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:03,678
notion of time are we talking about to

918
00:31:03,678 --> 00:31:05,680
even have a consistent identity?

919
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,682
Somehow you always wake up and everything

920
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:08,683
is still here.

921
00:31:08,683 --> 00:31:09,684
Somehow you wake up and you're not a

922
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:10,685
lobster.

923
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:11,686
I don't really understand how.

924
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:12,687
That works.

925
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:15,690
But yeah, that's nice.

926
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:18,693
If you could use fractal to get something

927
00:31:18,693 --> 00:31:20,695
singular from something communal, that

928
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:21,696
might be cool.

929
00:31:21,696 --> 00:31:24,699
But maybe fractal is something sort of

930
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:26,701
like you're both at the same time.

931
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:28,703
And that's what I don't know yet.

932
00:31:28,703 --> 00:31:30,705
So I think it's a totally revolutionary

933
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:32,707
way of thinking to not have a before

934
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:32,707
after.

935
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:34,709
So if you can construct identity without

936
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:37,712
before after, then that's sort of what I'

937
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:38,713
'm trying to do.

938
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:39,714
But, yeah, that's cool.

939
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:41,716
If you want to get identity from communal,

940
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:43,718
, I think you can do that.

941
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:46,721
They may also sort of blur.

942
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:52,727
Daniel: Well, this is truly food for

943
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:55,730
thought, and I really hope people can

944
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:59,734
live with the darkness, take it and run

945
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:03,732
with it, because there's so many fun ways

946
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:04,733
to go.

947
00:32:06,734 --> 00:32:06,735
Shanna: Thank you so much.

948
00:32:07,736 --> 00:32:08,737
I hope so, too.

949
00:32:09,738 --> 00:32:10,739
Daniel: So you're always welcome back.

950
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:11,740
Thank you.

951
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,741
And talk to you later.

952
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:13,742
Shanna: Thank you so much.

953
00:32:13,742 --> 00:32:14,743
Daniel: Bye.

954
00:32:14,743 --> 00:32:15,744
Good night.

955
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:15,744
Shanna: Bye.
