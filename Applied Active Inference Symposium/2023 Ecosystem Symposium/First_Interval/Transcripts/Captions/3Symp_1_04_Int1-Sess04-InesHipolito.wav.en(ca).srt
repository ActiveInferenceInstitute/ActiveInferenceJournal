00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:02,960
Greetings Ines!

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,250
Hello. Welcome.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,568
Hi, Daniel. Thank you. Yes,

4
00:00:13,654 --> 00:00:17,184
well, we're really looking

5
00:00:17,222 --> 00:00:19,968
forward to your presentation. You can

6
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:22,210
share your slides and go for it.

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:23,810
Great.

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,250
It can you see it?

9
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,376
Yes. Looks great. Thank you. All right,

10
00:00:38,478 --> 00:00:41,352
good. So thank you so much for having

11
00:00:41,406 --> 00:00:43,724
me. I'm really happy to present this

12
00:00:43,762 --> 00:00:46,044
paper today, and particularly because

13
00:00:46,082 --> 00:00:47,820
it's the very first time that I present

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,540
this work. So I'm really looking forward

15
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,852
to any feedback and

16
00:00:53,906 --> 00:00:56,190
any reactions to this work.

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,328
OK, so the aim of this paper was to

18
00:01:01,414 --> 00:01:04,304
apply the free energy principle to

19
00:01:04,342 --> 00:01:07,356
analyze the interdependent dynamics

20
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:10,112
between living systems on the one hand,

21
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:13,460
and nonliving planetary processes.

22
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,628
And this, hopefully, would, we hope,

23
00:01:16,714 --> 00:01:19,412
allow us to gain some insights into the

24
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:22,516
future states of Gaia. And by Gaia we're

25
00:01:22,548 --> 00:01:25,924
going to mean the Earth and formulate

26
00:01:25,972 --> 00:01:28,996
some predictions and devise potential

27
00:01:29,108 --> 00:01:32,024
interventions to alleviate future

28
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:34,860
dysfunction on the planet.

29
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,196
Okay? So then the lineup for the

30
00:01:39,218 --> 00:01:41,772
presentation is I'm first going to go

31
00:01:41,826 --> 00:01:45,780
over, in brief, the theory,

32
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,976
the concept of Gaia, so known as the

33
00:01:48,998 --> 00:01:52,448
Gaia hypothesis. Then I'm going

34
00:01:52,454 --> 00:01:55,724
to go into just giving some essentials

35
00:01:55,772 --> 00:01:58,540
on the free energy principle, which I'm

36
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,548
assuming that it's not really necessary,

37
00:02:01,644 --> 00:02:05,924
but just for the sake of the flow of my

38
00:02:05,962 --> 00:02:08,020
argument. Then I'm just going to present

39
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,632
some things on the free energy principle

40
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,456
and specifically on self organizing

41
00:02:11,488 --> 00:02:14,164
interacting systems. And then I'm going

42
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:16,244
to apply the free energy principle to

43
00:02:16,282 --> 00:02:18,360
the Gaia poses is in a sort of like

44
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,192
comparison analysis, as in how do they,

45
00:02:21,246 --> 00:02:23,912
if at all, complement each other for

46
00:02:23,966 --> 00:02:28,988
epistemic gain? And then after

47
00:02:29,154 --> 00:02:32,284
having done that, this should be should

48
00:02:32,322 --> 00:02:35,052
allow us to inform or to gain some

49
00:02:35,106 --> 00:02:38,624
insights as per the human behavior in

50
00:02:38,662 --> 00:02:42,000
relation to Gaia or the planet Earth.

51
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,352
Okay, so let's see how it goes. So first

52
00:02:46,406 --> 00:02:48,064
I want to introduce the notion of

53
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:51,264
biophilia, which plays a fundamental

54
00:02:51,312 --> 00:02:54,980
role in this work. So biophilia

55
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,808
came first, or came more prominently

56
00:02:59,904 --> 00:03:02,672
in this particular book here, and it's

57
00:03:02,736 --> 00:03:05,944
quite interesting. The idea is that the

58
00:03:05,982 --> 00:03:08,136
relation of humanity to the rest of the

59
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:10,664
natural world is essentially one of

60
00:03:10,702 --> 00:03:12,344
dependence. And this is very much

61
00:03:12,382 --> 00:03:13,836
already in the literature and the free

62
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:17,868
energy principle. But more than that,

63
00:03:18,034 --> 00:03:21,372
there is this view of the necessity of a

64
00:03:21,426 --> 00:03:24,572
continued survival and flourishing that

65
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:27,424
is utterly contingent upon the state and

66
00:03:27,462 --> 00:03:29,596
functioning of the environment. So we're

67
00:03:29,628 --> 00:03:31,104
talking about things like very

68
00:03:31,142 --> 00:03:33,404
utilitarian things like survival,

69
00:03:33,452 --> 00:03:35,568
flourishing, mental health, right? So

70
00:03:35,654 --> 00:03:36,896
individuals interact with the

71
00:03:36,918 --> 00:03:39,350
environment. So to achieve that,

72
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,500
but then on top of that, we wanted to

73
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,244
add another conceptual layer which is or

74
00:03:46,282 --> 00:03:49,620
concerns how humans possess an

75
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,744
innate cognitive disposition towards

76
00:03:52,862 --> 00:03:55,608
nature, which is known and developed in

77
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,992
this particular other field of work as

78
00:03:58,046 --> 00:04:01,784
biophilia. And this is the idea of

79
00:04:01,822 --> 00:04:04,584
the natural psychological disposition of

80
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:07,532
humans to seek out and connect with

81
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:10,072
other living organisms and the natural

82
00:04:10,136 --> 00:04:12,156
environment. So that's kind of like the

83
00:04:12,178 --> 00:04:13,932
idea that is encapsulated in the whole

84
00:04:13,986 --> 00:04:16,700
framework and theory under biophilia.

85
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,944
So then this seems to if

86
00:04:22,982 --> 00:04:25,664
that's the case of as things are

87
00:04:25,702 --> 00:04:28,444
described by biophilia, then that seems

88
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:32,352
to bring us to a dilemma.

89
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:35,072
On the one hand, we have these natural

90
00:04:35,136 --> 00:04:38,212
tendencies, so to speak, of humans to

91
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:41,780
engage with the natural world in a

92
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,696
very positive and constructive way. And

93
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:47,272
on the other hand we see the lack of

94
00:04:47,326 --> 00:04:50,280
action to protect the Earth. And here we

95
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,216
have in mind particularly the case of

96
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:54,764
the climate crisis. So in the

97
00:04:54,802 --> 00:04:57,180
presentation I'm going to make my way

98
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,748
slowly towards getting to that and to

99
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,780
better understand the dilemma.

100
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,300
Okay? So let's go in brief over the Gaia

101
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,524
hypotheses. So this is a concept

102
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:15,452
that comes more prominently in James

103
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:18,884
Loflock's book Gaia a New Look

104
00:05:18,922 --> 00:05:22,196
at Life on Earth. And the idea there

105
00:05:22,298 --> 00:05:25,380
is that 3.8 billion years that

106
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,420
life has persisted on Earth and

107
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,020
conditions have remained remarkably

108
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,280
constant and favorable across a huge

109
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,372
range of parameters. The Gaia hypothesis

110
00:05:38,436 --> 00:05:44,636
is that this consistency or constancy is

111
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:47,260
a natural product of evolution.

112
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,356
In a modification, however, of the

113
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:55,512
canonical Darwinism, the Gaia hypothesis

114
00:05:55,576 --> 00:05:58,572
somewhat modifies canonical Darwinism

115
00:05:58,716 --> 00:06:02,032
how? Well, by thinking that rather than

116
00:06:02,086 --> 00:06:05,424
evolution of the individual organisms on

117
00:06:05,462 --> 00:06:09,168
an inert environment, what evolves

118
00:06:09,264 --> 00:06:12,452
is the whole Earth system with its

119
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:15,732
living and nonliving parts existing as

120
00:06:15,786 --> 00:06:18,436
a tight coupled entity. So this is the

121
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,624
kind of like, so to speak, refreshing or

122
00:06:21,662 --> 00:06:24,804
new way of thinking that somewhat

123
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:27,764
reformulated a little bit of Darwinism,

124
00:06:27,812 --> 00:06:30,824
right? The emphasis is not how one

125
00:06:30,942 --> 00:06:34,812
individual organism evolves or

126
00:06:34,866 --> 00:06:37,884
species evolves, but the whole Earth as

127
00:06:37,922 --> 00:06:40,588
a system. So that's quite interesting

128
00:06:40,754 --> 00:06:43,550
because, for example,

129
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,132
the view that the combined genetic

130
00:06:47,196 --> 00:06:49,328
wealth of information of the whole

131
00:06:49,414 --> 00:06:51,984
system becomes much more prominent here

132
00:06:52,022 --> 00:06:54,176
than the Darwinistic kind of view and

133
00:06:54,198 --> 00:06:56,720
this acquires characteristics that are

134
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,080
conductive to its continued existence

135
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,964
and in turn affect changes on the

136
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:05,796
environment. So then,

137
00:07:05,898 --> 00:07:08,868
seen as a whole organism or as a whole

138
00:07:08,954 --> 00:07:11,784
system, one can look at Gaia or the

139
00:07:11,822 --> 00:07:15,444
Earth as a complex system which appears

140
00:07:15,492 --> 00:07:17,912
to have the goal of regulating the

141
00:07:17,966 --> 00:07:20,584
climate and the chemistry at a

142
00:07:20,622 --> 00:07:23,932
comfortable state of life. And these

143
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:27,180
views and these ideas have come to gain

144
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,452
more official expression in 2001

145
00:07:31,506 --> 00:07:33,592
with the Amsterdam Declaration on Earth

146
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:35,836
system science precisely endorsing this

147
00:07:35,858 --> 00:07:38,450
view on the planet Earth as a whole

148
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,124
system. So then the Gaia hypothesis

149
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:46,496
is a complex system in various ways

150
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:50,036
because it changes in

151
00:07:50,058 --> 00:07:52,836
an adaptive and nonlinear way.

152
00:07:53,018 --> 00:07:56,464
It also displays dynamical emergent

153
00:07:56,512 --> 00:08:00,212
and sudden tipping behavior. And when

154
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:03,624
bifurcation points are reached, the new

155
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:07,240
tractor states form, new tractor states

156
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,552
are formed. And this means that it also

157
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:13,032
self organizes and there is

158
00:08:13,086 --> 00:08:15,400
interdependence between the processors

159
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,764
of the system. And finally,

160
00:08:18,882 --> 00:08:21,420
the Gaia hypothesis seems to be quite

161
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,324
interesting and extraordinary in the

162
00:08:23,362 --> 00:08:26,144
sense that it brings together so many

163
00:08:26,182 --> 00:08:28,252
different fields such as ecology,

164
00:08:28,316 --> 00:08:30,892
climate science, cybernetics, complex

165
00:08:30,956 --> 00:08:33,728
systems theory, chaos, mathematics and

166
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:36,816
philosophy of mine and that's just a

167
00:08:36,838 --> 00:08:41,110
few. All right. So then

168
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,124
the idea is of the Gaia hypothesis is

169
00:08:45,162 --> 00:08:48,212
that we could look at the planet from

170
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:51,036
orbit or as it is known, the overview

171
00:08:51,088 --> 00:08:53,716
effect. And the Gaia hypothesis offers

172
00:08:53,748 --> 00:08:55,780
this glimpse of a fundamentally

173
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,284
different way of thinking of the planet,

174
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:02,356
of thinking that in fact dominated

175
00:09:02,548 --> 00:09:05,308
mostly by human history. So it's a

176
00:09:05,314 --> 00:09:09,512
little bit of like that very inspiring

177
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:12,696
clip by Karl Sagan, the Pale blue

178
00:09:12,728 --> 00:09:16,304
dot whereby the world is

179
00:09:16,342 --> 00:09:18,480
considered. So throughout the human

180
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,600
history there's typically a tendency for

181
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,948
the world or the planet to be considered

182
00:09:24,044 --> 00:09:26,480
from a single living organism,

183
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,836
though, rather than an it. So that's the

184
00:09:30,858 --> 00:09:33,236
idea of overview effect and taking this

185
00:09:33,258 --> 00:09:35,364
overview effect to look at the planet as

186
00:09:35,402 --> 00:09:38,212
this whole living system rather than an

187
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:42,024
it. Okay? So then we can think

188
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:46,040
about the Gaia hypotheses as like

189
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,696
Newtonian physics or even as the free

190
00:09:48,718 --> 00:09:51,284
energy principle. The Gaia hypotheses

191
00:09:51,412 --> 00:09:54,124
can be seen much more as a framework or

192
00:09:54,162 --> 00:09:57,676
a method of investigation rather than a

193
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:00,220
falsifiable empirical claim.

194
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,964
So in this sense, these particular

195
00:10:04,082 --> 00:10:06,544
frameworks, they are and should be

196
00:10:06,582 --> 00:10:09,696
judged by their usefulness and not

197
00:10:09,798 --> 00:10:14,320
by their purported correctness with

198
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,896
usefulness. Importantly, usefulness is

199
00:10:16,918 --> 00:10:19,524
to be determined by factors such as

200
00:10:19,642 --> 00:10:22,848
parsimony, coherence and consistency

201
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:26,864
plus its empirical and epistemic

202
00:10:26,912 --> 00:10:30,292
power to explain phenomena, produce new

203
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:33,704
facts and so on in a given context and

204
00:10:33,742 --> 00:10:37,144
at a given time frame. So that's the

205
00:10:37,182 --> 00:10:39,208
stance that we think that should be

206
00:10:39,214 --> 00:10:42,856
taken on the Gaia hypothesis. All right?

207
00:10:42,878 --> 00:10:44,408
So now having said a few words on the

208
00:10:44,414 --> 00:10:47,164
Gaia hypothesis now I'm going to just

209
00:10:47,202 --> 00:10:49,420
prepare the stage by saying a few words

210
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,476
on the Fiang principle which, given the

211
00:10:52,498 --> 00:10:54,636
topic of this conference, needs no

212
00:10:54,658 --> 00:10:56,876
introduction. But for these purposes I

213
00:10:56,898 --> 00:10:59,916
must mention just a few things. So the

214
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:02,064
Fiang principle, we take it to be the

215
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:05,424
case as well that it is a methodology to

216
00:11:05,462 --> 00:11:08,496
understand overserved patterns of

217
00:11:08,518 --> 00:11:11,316
behavior sorry, observed patterns of

218
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,164
behavior in the natural world. So then

219
00:11:14,202 --> 00:11:16,372
we apply the free energy principle as

220
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,040
the tool and methodology to analyze

221
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,732
these interdependent dynamics between

222
00:11:21,786 --> 00:11:25,248
living systems and planetary processes,

223
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:27,812
right? Kind of like these goggles,

224
00:11:27,876 --> 00:11:29,828
these methodological, technical,

225
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:32,216
scientific goggles that you put on to

226
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:35,260
gain insights into the future states of

227
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,164
Gaia or the Earth such as to make

228
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,784
future formulate predictions and devise

229
00:11:41,912 --> 00:11:44,204
potential interventions in this

230
00:11:44,242 --> 00:11:46,560
particular case with the care of

231
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,210
alleviating future potential or present

232
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,600
dysfunction.

233
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:58,144
Okay, so the free energy principle very

234
00:11:58,182 --> 00:12:02,096
much aligns with this thinking

235
00:12:02,198 --> 00:12:05,860
by Ewan Schwellinger and the view

236
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,164
that the second law of thermodynamics or

237
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:10,032
under the second law of thermodynamics

238
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:13,512
that open systems like us should

239
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,160
tend to dissipation.

240
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,352
However interestingly, there are

241
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,264
displays of this super cool thing,

242
00:12:22,382 --> 00:12:25,916
the negantropy, which are pockets of the

243
00:12:25,938 --> 00:12:27,864
universe where order and bodily

244
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:30,620
integrity are maintained in the face of

245
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,908
the surge towards chaos or towards

246
00:12:32,994 --> 00:12:36,144
entropy or towards dissipation. And this

247
00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:38,352
view of the pockets of the universe is

248
00:12:38,406 --> 00:12:41,376
incredibly interesting because this is

249
00:12:41,398 --> 00:12:44,012
where we find self organizing systems

250
00:12:44,076 --> 00:12:47,952
like us. And what is so peculiar that

251
00:12:48,006 --> 00:12:50,640
distinguishes these self organizing

252
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,004
living systems from nonliving systems is

253
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:56,224
that they have the capacity of acting

254
00:12:56,272 --> 00:12:59,268
upon and exchanging matter,

255
00:12:59,354 --> 00:13:00,896
energy or information with the

256
00:13:00,938 --> 00:13:04,084
environment in order to seemingly defy

257
00:13:04,132 --> 00:13:07,140
the second law and therefore or thereby

258
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,572
avoid dissipation and chaos

259
00:13:11,636 --> 00:13:14,700
and entropy. So that's extraordinary.

260
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,764
So then active inference becomes this

261
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:22,316
very useful tool to tell us or to

262
00:13:22,338 --> 00:13:26,040
explain elucidate how these

263
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,992
systems seemingly defy the second law,

264
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:32,336
how they resist entropy, how the

265
00:13:32,358 --> 00:13:35,244
self organizing systems combat entropy

266
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:37,324
through the interaction, maintaining

267
00:13:37,372 --> 00:13:40,260
their integrity via homeostasis.

268
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,792
So then they maintain this energetic

269
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,532
integrity. They utilize energy to stay

270
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:49,396
within a specific range of states that

271
00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:51,544
is vital for their survival and

272
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:54,744
preserving their existence. And they

273
00:13:54,782 --> 00:13:57,012
also engage with these feedback cycles

274
00:13:57,076 --> 00:13:59,640
which are the feedback actions like

275
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,040
drinking when thirsty or moving away

276
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,492
from heat signify working, accomplished

277
00:14:05,556 --> 00:14:08,296
by bound energy, contrasting with the

278
00:14:08,318 --> 00:14:10,796
free energy. They also define the

279
00:14:10,818 --> 00:14:13,052
thermodynamics, as I just mentioned, by

280
00:14:13,106 --> 00:14:14,924
seemingly challenging the law, they

281
00:14:14,962 --> 00:14:17,264
minimize entropy and safeguard their

282
00:14:17,302 --> 00:14:20,880
free energy. And finally this

283
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,344
behavior that we observe in these self

284
00:14:23,382 --> 00:14:27,488
organizing living systems in

285
00:14:27,574 --> 00:14:31,428
striving to minimize free energy is

286
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:35,424
or agrees with a certain principle

287
00:14:35,552 --> 00:14:37,252
that we know, which is the free energy

288
00:14:37,306 --> 00:14:40,870
principle. Okay? So then,

289
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,664
as I said earlier and as we know but

290
00:14:44,702 --> 00:14:46,996
just to keep in mind then active

291
00:14:47,028 --> 00:14:49,416
inference becomes a very useful tool to

292
00:14:49,438 --> 00:14:51,288
understand and make predictions about

293
00:14:51,374 --> 00:14:53,192
these coupling dynamics taking place

294
00:14:53,246 --> 00:14:55,980
between interacting systems, living

295
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:59,484
systems. Internal states is both

296
00:14:59,522 --> 00:15:01,868
operationally closed and

297
00:15:01,954 --> 00:15:04,344
thermodynamically open to the external

298
00:15:04,392 --> 00:15:07,228
states creating this distinct boundary

299
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:09,724
which we usually mathematically capture

300
00:15:09,852 --> 00:15:13,024
with Markov blanket. And then this

301
00:15:13,062 --> 00:15:14,704
interaction unfolds through the

302
00:15:14,742 --> 00:15:18,012
immediate of active and sensory

303
00:15:18,076 --> 00:15:21,524
states. Then the key point here to

304
00:15:21,562 --> 00:15:24,532
keep in mind is that what we want to

305
00:15:24,586 --> 00:15:27,844
have for adaptation and well being is

306
00:15:27,882 --> 00:15:30,368
that there is a balanced interaction

307
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:32,824
between sensory and active states. And

308
00:15:32,862 --> 00:15:35,576
this is because it is within the

309
00:15:35,598 --> 00:15:37,108
interaction between sensory and active

310
00:15:37,124 --> 00:15:39,496
states that so to speak, all of the

311
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:42,584
important things happen in order for the

312
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:46,072
system to be well adjusted attuned

313
00:15:46,136 --> 00:15:48,860
adapted to the environment.

314
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,764
So living systems avoid this

315
00:15:52,802 --> 00:15:54,872
dissipation. They want to remain alive,

316
00:15:54,936 --> 00:15:57,376
they do everything in their power, they

317
00:15:57,478 --> 00:16:00,850
navigate their environments in order to

318
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,144
avoid this dissipation which is also or

319
00:16:04,182 --> 00:16:05,904
can be also said to minimize free

320
00:16:05,942 --> 00:16:08,476
energy. And they avoid their dissipation

321
00:16:08,588 --> 00:16:11,668
by doing either one of the two things

322
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:14,624
either by changing the model or changing

323
00:16:14,672 --> 00:16:17,748
the world, by acting upon the world.

324
00:16:17,914 --> 00:16:20,196
And this is extremely crucial for the

325
00:16:20,218 --> 00:16:22,470
point that I want to make later on.

326
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,548
So now I want to apply the Fionergy

327
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:30,232
principle to the Guy hypothesis and see

328
00:16:30,286 --> 00:16:35,560
how that comes together in

329
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,996
identifying and developing and why do I

330
00:16:38,018 --> 00:16:39,452
want to do that? I want to do that

331
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:41,916
because I've also already mentioned it.

332
00:16:41,938 --> 00:16:44,204
But I'm just going to refresh it because

333
00:16:44,242 --> 00:16:45,880
I want to identify and develop

334
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,276
interventions to rectify any potential

335
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:53,196
maladaptive responses, namely actions

336
00:16:53,308 --> 00:16:56,524
which are antithetical to maintaining

337
00:16:56,572 --> 00:16:58,804
the integrity of the system. What we

338
00:16:58,842 --> 00:17:01,232
want is to have healthy, well adjusted

339
00:17:01,296 --> 00:17:05,376
adaptive systems and human behavior

340
00:17:05,488 --> 00:17:08,612
particularly that leads to

341
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,444
the imbalance within the Markov blanket

342
00:17:11,492 --> 00:17:14,612
states, is or could be considered

343
00:17:14,756 --> 00:17:17,620
sometimes maladaptive or pathological.

344
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,316
And this will be the last point I'm

345
00:17:19,348 --> 00:17:21,384
going to make in the presentation, but

346
00:17:21,422 --> 00:17:24,872
for now want to focus on how does

347
00:17:24,926 --> 00:17:27,652
the French principle deal with the Gaia

348
00:17:27,716 --> 00:17:30,988
hypothesis as a

349
00:17:30,994 --> 00:17:33,484
self organizing system like Ruth? Just

350
00:17:33,522 --> 00:17:35,480
saying. The Gaia meets the requirements

351
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,924
to be formalized as part of an active

352
00:17:38,972 --> 00:17:42,476
inference system. It exists in a non

353
00:17:42,668 --> 00:17:45,968
equilibrium steady state, which means

354
00:17:46,054 --> 00:17:48,080
that its processes and states must

355
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,212
persist over time within a range of

356
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:52,912
states that are far from equilibrium.

357
00:17:52,976 --> 00:17:56,004
That means resisting entropy. And the

358
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:58,660
Gaia is also distinguishable from its

359
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,996
largest scale cosmic environment such as

360
00:18:01,018 --> 00:18:02,248
other planets and the rest of the

361
00:18:02,254 --> 00:18:05,364
universe. It is also defined

362
00:18:05,412 --> 00:18:07,016
by the conditional independence that we

363
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:08,456
were just talking about between the

364
00:18:08,478 --> 00:18:10,264
internal and external stage which

365
00:18:10,302 --> 00:18:12,760
influence each other only vicariously.

366
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,392
So then we can taking that into

367
00:18:16,446 --> 00:18:18,108
consideration, we can even see that some

368
00:18:18,114 --> 00:18:19,836
of the people have already done this

369
00:18:19,858 --> 00:18:21,448
kind of like line of reasoning, they've

370
00:18:21,464 --> 00:18:23,340
already run it through and they did that

371
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,444
by employing Markov blanket to analyze

372
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:29,884
the Earth's climate system dynamics,

373
00:18:30,012 --> 00:18:31,936
which is quite interesting. What they

374
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,204
did was they looked at metabolic rates

375
00:18:34,252 --> 00:18:37,004
of the biosphere and they represented

376
00:18:37,052 --> 00:18:40,244
them as internal states and space

377
00:18:40,362 --> 00:18:43,796
weather as external states and then they

378
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:46,080
looked at active states as mirrored

379
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,376
greenhouse effect shifts and sensory

380
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:52,500
states as echoed ocean driven

381
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,956
temperature changes and then internal

382
00:18:55,988 --> 00:18:58,376
and external states. The idea here is

383
00:18:58,398 --> 00:19:00,664
that they indirectly influenced each

384
00:19:00,702 --> 00:19:03,640
other through ocean's delayed response.

385
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,548
Then Earth's climate is interpreted as

386
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:10,840
anticipatory minimizing variational,

387
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,444
free energy. So we take this work and

388
00:19:14,482 --> 00:19:16,380
we want to take it a step further

389
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,520
agreeing with this work and building

390
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,732
upon this work which shows climate

391
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:27,744
change, we wanted to look at the

392
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:30,884
more broad understanding of Gaia through

393
00:19:30,922 --> 00:19:33,408
the lenses of the free energy principle.

394
00:19:33,584 --> 00:19:37,360
So instead of focusing on climate

395
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,892
change, which is very brilliantly done

396
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:42,184
by these researchers, we wanted to then

397
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,520
scale it up and apply the free energy

398
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,924
principle to understand the Gaia.

399
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:50,484
So then one can think of the internal

400
00:19:50,532 --> 00:19:53,092
states as the biosphere geographical

401
00:19:53,156 --> 00:19:57,068
processes and the external states as

402
00:19:57,234 --> 00:19:59,724
everything that is beyond the system,

403
00:19:59,842 --> 00:20:02,584
such as the outer atmosphere, Celicia

404
00:20:02,632 --> 00:20:05,896
bodies and molten core. Then we can

405
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,844
think of sensory states as the external

406
00:20:08,892 --> 00:20:11,804
environment impact such as the Earth

407
00:20:11,932 --> 00:20:14,976
rotation, orbit, tides affected by the

408
00:20:14,998 --> 00:20:18,716
sun, moon, planets, plate tectonics,

409
00:20:18,828 --> 00:20:21,888
climate, weather influenced by solar

410
00:20:21,974 --> 00:20:25,636
radiation, space weather, etc. So and

411
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,428
then we can think of the active states

412
00:20:27,514 --> 00:20:30,924
as Earth's adaptability and adjusting

413
00:20:30,992 --> 00:20:34,104
properties from external influence such

414
00:20:34,142 --> 00:20:37,080
as gravitational force, altars orbits,

415
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,880
magnetic field interacts with solar

416
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,292
winds or emission of detectable

417
00:20:42,356 --> 00:20:45,480
radiation influences distant objects.

418
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,636
That's a few examples. So then

419
00:20:48,658 --> 00:20:50,670
I want to focus on the active states.

420
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,880
Active states then through this lens,

421
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,924
active states then embody its primary

422
00:20:56,972 --> 00:20:59,200
mechanism for self regulation,

423
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,204
representing its efforts to remain

424
00:21:02,252 --> 00:21:05,244
within the bounds required for ongoing

425
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:08,476
existence based on predictions about the

426
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:10,950
present and future states of the system.

427
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,044
For instance, the current levels of

428
00:21:15,082 --> 00:21:18,516
greenhouse and albedo effects, soil PH

429
00:21:18,618 --> 00:21:20,432
and the number of living organisms

430
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:22,056
reflect the predictive attempts of the

431
00:21:22,078 --> 00:21:25,572
Gaia system to adapt to anticipated

432
00:21:25,716 --> 00:21:28,116
effects of solar events, volcanic

433
00:21:28,148 --> 00:21:31,064
eruptions, ocean salinity changes, and

434
00:21:31,102 --> 00:21:33,836
other environmental factors in the

435
00:21:33,858 --> 00:21:37,084
future. So it is in this context that

436
00:21:37,122 --> 00:21:39,916
the role of life itself assumes a

437
00:21:39,938 --> 00:21:41,852
paramount importance in the self

438
00:21:41,906 --> 00:21:45,084
regulation of the biosphere. Because the

439
00:21:45,122 --> 00:21:47,904
role of life itself, and particularly as

440
00:21:47,942 --> 00:21:51,456
we are going to focus on next, the human

441
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:55,440
life, has a particular influence on

442
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,344
all of these sort of already natural

443
00:21:58,412 --> 00:22:01,620
dynamics going on in the gaia.

444
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,140
This allows us, before we move into the

445
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,204
human effects, this allows us to make

446
00:22:09,242 --> 00:22:11,364
one final point before we move there,

447
00:22:11,402 --> 00:22:14,776
which is to address the criticism that

448
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:17,588
has been made in this paper by Vicente

449
00:22:17,604 --> 00:22:20,532
Haja on the Markov blanket trick.

450
00:22:20,676 --> 00:22:24,616
And what they have identified

451
00:22:24,728 --> 00:22:27,916
is that a purported weakness of

452
00:22:27,938 --> 00:22:32,140
the free energy principle what we say

453
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,772
is that a weakness of the free energy

454
00:22:33,826 --> 00:22:35,644
principle that is identified in this

455
00:22:35,682 --> 00:22:38,752
paper actually speaks in favor of its

456
00:22:38,806 --> 00:22:41,024
application to the Gaia hypothesis. And

457
00:22:41,062 --> 00:22:45,548
let me just try to explain that. So Raja

458
00:22:45,644 --> 00:22:47,920
and colleagues, they rightly point out

459
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,796
that Markov Lincolns do not

460
00:22:49,898 --> 00:22:52,512
automatically capture every relevant

461
00:22:52,576 --> 00:22:54,820
property of biological systems,

462
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,932
relational properties such as

463
00:22:56,986 --> 00:22:59,796
affordances. And by affordances they

464
00:22:59,818 --> 00:23:02,392
mean what the environment offers, the

465
00:23:02,446 --> 00:23:06,180
animal, what it provides, or furnishes,

466
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,304
either good or evil fall into this

467
00:23:09,342 --> 00:23:11,720
bracket. So what they're saying is that

468
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,504
Markov blanket do not automatically

469
00:23:14,552 --> 00:23:16,812
capture every relevant aspect of

470
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:20,856
biological system such as affordances,

471
00:23:20,968 --> 00:23:24,972
right? And we want to point out

472
00:23:25,026 --> 00:23:27,090
that however,

473
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,472
affordances correspond to Gaia as one

474
00:23:31,526 --> 00:23:34,492
rung in the ladder of the Nested Marco

475
00:23:34,556 --> 00:23:37,584
blankets within the system in question

476
00:23:37,702 --> 00:23:41,364
at every level ranging up from,

477
00:23:41,482 --> 00:23:44,704
say, cells, organs, animals,

478
00:23:44,832 --> 00:23:47,684
ecosystems, solar systems, the whole

479
00:23:47,722 --> 00:23:51,256
cosmos. And how is it that we think that

480
00:23:51,358 --> 00:23:53,192
this particular framework that we bring

481
00:23:53,246 --> 00:23:56,696
here does have or solve or address the

482
00:23:56,718 --> 00:24:00,216
notion of affordances? Our solar system

483
00:24:00,318 --> 00:24:03,000
is one that affords a living planet.

484
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,924
So the affordance available is an

485
00:24:06,962 --> 00:24:10,140
environment. In an environment are not

486
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,664
determined solely by the physical

487
00:24:12,712 --> 00:24:14,204
properties of the environment. And we

488
00:24:14,242 --> 00:24:18,416
think that this is the point that we

489
00:24:18,438 --> 00:24:21,810
would like to address in HaHa's paper,

490
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,624
is that the affordances are not

491
00:24:24,662 --> 00:24:26,988
determined solely by the physical

492
00:24:27,084 --> 00:24:30,388
properties of the environment, but also

493
00:24:30,474 --> 00:24:32,932
by the organism's goals, abilities and

494
00:24:32,986 --> 00:24:37,380
previous experiences and in this case,

495
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:40,708
of the sun. So what is meant here

496
00:24:40,794 --> 00:24:44,668
is that the sun is what has the furnaces

497
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:48,664
for or what affords anything else to

498
00:24:48,702 --> 00:24:50,712
happen on the planet at whatever each

499
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:53,724
scale, right? The physical properties of

500
00:24:53,762 --> 00:24:55,916
the sun as well as the goals and

501
00:24:55,938 --> 00:24:58,780
abilities of the organisms on earth

502
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,108
shape the affordances that the sun

503
00:25:02,194 --> 00:25:05,052
provides. So it's a quite interesting

504
00:25:05,186 --> 00:25:08,188
way of thinking that any affordance

505
00:25:08,284 --> 00:25:10,080
whatsoever that we might think of that

506
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:12,496
we have as living systems, they are

507
00:25:12,518 --> 00:25:15,490
afforded by the sun. So that's the idea.

508
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,112
Okay, so now having gone through how

509
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:23,344
the female G principle somewhat speaks

510
00:25:23,392 --> 00:25:26,964
to and contributes to understanding the

511
00:25:27,002 --> 00:25:30,516
Gaia hypotheses, then we want

512
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:34,468
to focus on how human behavior

513
00:25:34,644 --> 00:25:38,170
has a profound effect on

514
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:41,048
the dynamics that already existing in

515
00:25:41,054 --> 00:25:43,690
the natural world. Okay?

516
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,320
So according to the frequencies

517
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,504
principle, living beings have a natural

518
00:25:48,552 --> 00:25:51,224
tendency to act upon their environment

519
00:25:51,272 --> 00:25:53,004
to prevent dissipation of their

520
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:54,972
integrity. So that's what we do in order

521
00:25:55,026 --> 00:25:57,792
to remain alive. There are therefore two

522
00:25:57,846 --> 00:26:01,056
ways for a thing like us to minimize its

523
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:03,104
free energy and thereby maintain our own

524
00:26:03,142 --> 00:26:06,796
integrity upon evidence. As we navigate

525
00:26:06,828 --> 00:26:08,972
the world and gather and observe

526
00:26:09,036 --> 00:26:12,492
evidence, we have two options.

527
00:26:12,566 --> 00:26:14,036
One is to change the model. The other

528
00:26:14,058 --> 00:26:15,488
one is to change the world by acting

529
00:26:15,504 --> 00:26:18,724
upon it, like I just said before. So

530
00:26:18,762 --> 00:26:20,724
then why is this relevant? Well, this is

531
00:26:20,762 --> 00:26:24,184
relevant because there is the

532
00:26:24,222 --> 00:26:28,088
possibility that in the ways in which

533
00:26:28,174 --> 00:26:30,008
living systems and in this particular

534
00:26:30,094 --> 00:26:32,968
case human beings interact and adapt to

535
00:26:32,974 --> 00:26:34,900
the world, there is the possibility that

536
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:38,700
we see maladaptive behavior. And how

537
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:41,084
would that be? Well, if it is the case

538
00:26:41,122 --> 00:26:42,956
that there is a rejection of the

539
00:26:42,978 --> 00:26:45,064
information available so as to remove

540
00:26:45,112 --> 00:26:47,836
the imperative for action or if it is

541
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:49,408
the case that possessing the information

542
00:26:49,494 --> 00:26:52,124
available but we still remain or refrain

543
00:26:52,172 --> 00:26:54,816
from taking action, then there seems to

544
00:26:54,838 --> 00:26:56,672
be if the free energy principle is

545
00:26:56,726 --> 00:26:58,896
correct if the free energy principle is

546
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:01,172
to be correct, that systems, living

547
00:27:01,226 --> 00:27:03,556
beings tend to act upon the world in

548
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:06,724
order to remain alive and if it is

549
00:27:06,762 --> 00:27:08,916
the case that one rejects that kind of

550
00:27:08,938 --> 00:27:11,496
information and does not take action to

551
00:27:11,518 --> 00:27:14,632
remain alive, such as the information of

552
00:27:14,686 --> 00:27:17,368
the climate crisis, then we might be

553
00:27:17,454 --> 00:27:20,216
looking at maladaptive behavior. So if

554
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,424
the free energy principle holds, then

555
00:27:22,462 --> 00:27:25,852
the observed contradictory behavior is

556
00:27:25,906 --> 00:27:27,836
a maladaptive state or should be seen as

557
00:27:27,858 --> 00:27:30,956
a maladaptive state that arises from an

558
00:27:30,978 --> 00:27:33,656
imbalance within the Markov blanket.

559
00:27:33,848 --> 00:27:36,412
And how do we see this imbalance within

560
00:27:36,466 --> 00:27:38,448
the Markov blanket? We see it to put it

561
00:27:38,454 --> 00:27:40,896
in very, very simple terms, we see it as

562
00:27:40,918 --> 00:27:44,896
an insulation of internal states that

563
00:27:44,918 --> 00:27:48,348
are not being affected

564
00:27:48,444 --> 00:27:50,528
by the information available outside of

565
00:27:50,534 --> 00:27:53,828
the system. So the influences or the

566
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:55,172
interactions are occurring between

567
00:27:55,226 --> 00:27:57,124
internal, active and sensory states.

568
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,636
And this is an imbalance that results in

569
00:27:59,658 --> 00:28:02,648
an insulation or an echo chamber effect

570
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:05,700
in internal states that are impermeable

571
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,340
to the information from or potentially

572
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,264
existing in the external states that

573
00:28:10,302 --> 00:28:11,640
demands action.

574
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,610
So then some food for thought.

575
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,764
What can we make of this? The free

576
00:28:18,802 --> 00:28:21,836
energy principle? If we are to use the

577
00:28:21,858 --> 00:28:23,356
free energy principle to model the

578
00:28:23,378 --> 00:28:25,052
dynamics of the relationships between

579
00:28:25,106 --> 00:28:27,824
humans and the environment then we think

580
00:28:27,862 --> 00:28:29,680
that it is possible to see the current

581
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:33,664
lack of pro environmental behavior as a

582
00:28:33,702 --> 00:28:36,608
pathology of the human species that must

583
00:28:36,694 --> 00:28:39,104
receive treatment. We label this

584
00:28:39,142 --> 00:28:41,640
condition as Biophilia Deficiency

585
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,016
Deficiency Syndrome. Biophilia

586
00:28:44,048 --> 00:28:47,876
Deficiency Syndrome and

587
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:50,150
it is important for us to focus on that

588
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:55,176
to construct some validity. Is useful to

589
00:28:55,198 --> 00:28:58,036
consider in this case other applications

590
00:28:58,068 --> 00:29:00,264
of the free energy principle that may be

591
00:29:00,302 --> 00:29:04,200
useful as an analogous case of pathology

592
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,320
mainly conducted in psychiatry and

593
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:10,392
neurology and in here and very short

594
00:29:10,446 --> 00:29:12,316
because I don't have time. The idea is

595
00:29:12,338 --> 00:29:15,164
to see it as a failure to assign the

596
00:29:15,202 --> 00:29:18,044
right way or prediction to prediction

597
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:19,792
errors. So then the free energy

598
00:29:19,846 --> 00:29:22,944
principle from this point of view this

599
00:29:22,982 --> 00:29:27,008
is a persuasive pathology because doing

600
00:29:27,094 --> 00:29:30,036
nothing is a base optimal response in

601
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:32,932
the face of pathological attention to

602
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:35,392
various sources of evidence. So evidence

603
00:29:35,456 --> 00:29:40,420
is ignored. So concluding

604
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,996
and recapping according to the free

605
00:29:43,018 --> 00:29:44,772
energy principle living systems possess

606
00:29:44,836 --> 00:29:47,784
a biological encoded inclination to

607
00:29:47,822 --> 00:29:49,176
interact with the environment in order

608
00:29:49,198 --> 00:29:51,716
to survive and adapt to the environment.

609
00:29:51,908 --> 00:29:55,276
And despite the climate change being a

610
00:29:55,298 --> 00:29:57,084
pressing issue and the information being

611
00:29:57,122 --> 00:29:58,940
available the evidence being available

612
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,244
proactive measures to reverse its

613
00:30:01,282 --> 00:30:03,404
effects are not giving the priority they

614
00:30:03,442 --> 00:30:07,312
deserve. This state of affairs seems

615
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:10,652
to show very clearly a divergence

616
00:30:10,716 --> 00:30:12,464
from a natural inclination that we call

617
00:30:12,502 --> 00:30:14,768
biophilia or that is existing in the

618
00:30:14,774 --> 00:30:16,624
literature as biophilia. This

619
00:30:16,662 --> 00:30:18,704
discrepancy between the expected and the

620
00:30:18,742 --> 00:30:20,708
observed actions can be understood in

621
00:30:20,714 --> 00:30:21,684
the framework of the free energy

622
00:30:21,722 --> 00:30:24,976
principle or so we think. As an illness,

623
00:30:25,088 --> 00:30:27,300
it implies that systems, including human

624
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:30,032
societies may form erroneous inferences

625
00:30:30,096 --> 00:30:31,588
that prevent them from effectively

626
00:30:31,604 --> 00:30:34,648
addressing the problem at hand. Now,

627
00:30:34,734 --> 00:30:36,328
thinking about future directions and

628
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:40,372
this is my last slide current ecological

629
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:42,856
imbalances could be thought of as a

630
00:30:42,878 --> 00:30:46,448
stuck state that require an active

631
00:30:46,484 --> 00:30:49,324
disturbance to bring about some change.

632
00:30:49,522 --> 00:30:51,532
A stuck state is a state that a system

633
00:30:51,586 --> 00:30:54,172
is at a local minimum where the system

634
00:30:54,226 --> 00:30:56,392
is at and won't get out of that state

635
00:30:56,466 --> 00:30:59,456
unless it is disturbed. So that's the

636
00:30:59,478 --> 00:31:01,808
principle in complex systems theory and

637
00:31:01,814 --> 00:31:04,912
we think that that's how this particular

638
00:31:05,046 --> 00:31:06,828
state should be looked at. But that's

639
00:31:06,844 --> 00:31:09,264
for future research. And what we would

640
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:11,504
be calling is we would be calling for

641
00:31:11,622 --> 00:31:14,472
amounts to the kind of homeostatic

642
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:16,244
awakening. So the sort of like getting

643
00:31:16,282 --> 00:31:18,256
out of this stuck state would require

644
00:31:18,288 --> 00:31:20,592
some kind of like omniostatic awakening

645
00:31:20,736 --> 00:31:23,780
a deliberately induced disruptive shift

646
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,896
in the trajectory reflecting a

647
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:27,908
prioritization of the planetary

648
00:31:28,004 --> 00:31:31,128
homeostasis over infinite growth or

649
00:31:31,214 --> 00:31:34,516
staying in the same place. And yeah,

650
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:36,044
this is my last slide. Thank you so

651
00:31:36,082 --> 00:31:38,104
much. I would like also to acknowledge

652
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:41,436
my co author Casper Montgomery. Thank

653
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:42,700
you so much for your attention.

654
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,104
Thank you. Well, a lot of ways to go.

655
00:31:49,142 --> 00:31:52,176
I'll just ask one question just in the

656
00:31:52,198 --> 00:31:54,976
years that you've been in the game how

657
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:56,556
do you see the active inference

658
00:31:56,588 --> 00:31:58,896
ecosystem and the ways also that it's

659
00:31:58,928 --> 00:32:01,840
being applied to ecosystems evolving,

660
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,636
like, over what timescales or in what

661
00:32:03,658 --> 00:32:06,196
ways does that really present itself to

662
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:08,740
you? Slow,

663
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,328
sadly slow. I think there's a

664
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:16,410
lot of work that needs to be done.

665
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,424
We try to do this particular one here to

666
00:32:20,462 --> 00:32:25,548
apply employ active inference to

667
00:32:25,714 --> 00:32:28,092
the planet or the Earth as a living

668
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:30,444
system precisely to bring out or to

669
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:34,510
overcome. One is

670
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,564
to look at this problem of the climate

671
00:32:37,612 --> 00:32:40,944
crisis as what we think it is, which is

672
00:32:40,982 --> 00:32:43,760
more of a pathology. If the free energy

673
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,224
principle holds, then it seems that

674
00:32:46,262 --> 00:32:48,996
there is maladaptive behavior of the

675
00:32:49,018 --> 00:32:51,300
collective of the human species.

676
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,844
So I think that there's a lot of work

677
00:32:53,882 --> 00:32:56,484
that can be done and that would very

678
00:32:56,522 --> 00:33:00,420
much be useful in the climate crisis

679
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,112
in general. There is some other work

680
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:08,052
that came out more recently by Maxwell

681
00:33:08,196 --> 00:33:10,664
and colleagues as well on the

682
00:33:10,702 --> 00:33:13,428
ecosystems, which is really cool. And I

683
00:33:13,454 --> 00:33:16,764
would also mention that one, and I

684
00:33:16,802 --> 00:33:20,492
really hope that we can pursue this line

685
00:33:20,546 --> 00:33:22,376
of research and employee active

686
00:33:22,408 --> 00:33:24,540
inference in the free energy principle

687
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:29,968
to this particular case. One of

688
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:31,168
the things that really attracts me to

689
00:33:31,174 --> 00:33:32,496
the free energy principle is the

690
00:33:32,518 --> 00:33:35,616
capacity that it has to bring to the

691
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:39,620
forefront certain

692
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:42,740
laws of physics, but also the living

693
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,996
systems navigating and interacting with

694
00:33:45,018 --> 00:33:46,516
their environments, which I find much

695
00:33:46,538 --> 00:33:48,368
more appealing than any computational

696
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:51,752
framework per se. So that's what I find

697
00:33:51,806 --> 00:33:53,972
that it's a very useful conceptual

698
00:33:54,036 --> 00:33:56,344
toolkit that I think that I would really

699
00:33:56,382 --> 00:33:59,736
like to see more applied in the future

700
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:02,840
for the climate crisis and the Earth.

701
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,890
Great. Well, thank you so much for

702
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,416
building on that line of work and for

703
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:10,840
sharing it with us tonight.

704
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,596
Thank you so much for having me. Till

705
00:34:14,628 --> 00:34:17,552
next time. See you. Thank you.

706
00:34:17,686 --> 00:34:19,680
Bye bye.

707
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,512
All right, well,

708
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:29,010
great talk by Ines!
