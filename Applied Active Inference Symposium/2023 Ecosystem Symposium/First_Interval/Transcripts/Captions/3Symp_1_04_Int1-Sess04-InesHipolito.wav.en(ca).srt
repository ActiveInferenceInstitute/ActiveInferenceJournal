00:00:01,689 --> 00:00:02,958
Daniel: Greetings, Ines!

2
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:07,323
Ines: Hello.

3
00:00:08,492 --> 00:00:09,024
Daniel: Welcome.

4
00:00:10,149 --> 00:00:11,228
Ines: Hi, Daniel.

5
00:00:11,234 --> 00:00:12,319
Thank you.

6
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:16,754
Daniel: Yes, well, we're really looking

7
00:00:16,754 --> 00:00:19,024
forward to your presentation.

8
00:00:19,032 --> 00:00:22,318
You can share your slides and go for it.

9
00:00:23,403 --> 00:00:23,478
Ines: Great.

10
00:00:31,222 --> 00:00:34,521
It can you see it?

11
00:00:35,598 --> 00:00:35,658
Daniel: Yes.

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,743
Looks great.

13
00:00:36,749 --> 00:00:37,825
Thank you.

14
00:00:37,862 --> 00:00:38,994
Ines: All right, good.

15
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:41,272
So thank you so much for having me.

16
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:44,497
I'm really happy to present this paper

17
00:00:44,497 --> 00:00:46,724
today, and particularly because it's the

18
00:00:46,724 --> 00:00:48,956
very first time that I present this work.

19
00:00:48,956 --> 00:00:48,968
.

20
00:00:48,981 --> 00:00:52,323
So I'm really looking forward to any

21
00:00:52,323 --> 00:00:56,713
feedback and any reactions to this work.

22
00:00:57,838 --> 00:01:01,606
OK, so the aim of this paper was to apply

23
00:01:01,606 --> 00:01:04,960
the free energy principle to analyze the

24
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,296
interdependent dynamics between living

25
00:01:07,296 --> 00:01:11,632
systems on the one hand, and nonliving

26
00:01:11,632 --> 00:01:13,844
planetary processes.

27
00:01:13,886 --> 00:01:16,156
And this, hopefully, would, we hope,

28
00:01:16,156 --> 00:01:19,448
allow us to gain some insights into the

29
00:01:19,448 --> 00:01:21,627
future states of Gaia.

30
00:01:21,635 --> 00:01:24,994
And by Gaia we're going to mean the Earth

31
00:01:24,994 --> 00:01:28,352
and formulate some predictions and devise

32
00:01:28,352 --> 00:01:31,667
potential interventions to alleviate

33
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:34,982
future dysfunction on the planet.

34
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:36,179
Okay?

35
00:01:36,187 --> 00:01:40,551
So then the lineup for the presentation

36
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:44,925
is I'm first going to go over, in brief,

37
00:01:44,925 --> 00:01:48,030
the theory, the concept of Gaia, so known

38
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,055
as the Gaia hypothesis.

39
00:01:51,062 --> 00:01:54,092
Then I'm going to go into just giving

40
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:57,120
some essentials on the free energy

41
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,093
principle, which I'm assuming that it's

42
00:02:00,093 --> 00:02:03,124
not really necessary, but just for the

43
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:06,153
sake of the flow of my argument.

44
00:02:06,154 --> 00:02:08,172
Then I'm just going to present some

45
00:02:08,172 --> 00:02:10,191
things on the free energy principle and

46
00:02:10,191 --> 00:02:11,206
specifically on self organizing

47
00:02:11,206 --> 00:02:12,218
interacting systems.

48
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,244
And then I'm going to apply the free

49
00:02:15,244 --> 00:02:18,270
energy principle to the Gaia poses is in

50
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,297
a sort of like comparison analysis, as in

51
00:02:20,297 --> 00:02:23,323
how do they, if at all, complement each

52
00:02:23,323 --> 00:02:25,342
other for epistemic gain?

53
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:29,382
And then after having done that, this

54
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:33,423
should be should allow us to inform or to

55
00:02:33,423 --> 00:02:36,458
gain some insights as per the human

56
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:40,492
behavior in relation to Gaia or the

57
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:42,509
planet Earth.

58
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:45,542
Okay, so let's see how it goes.

59
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:48,575
So first I want to introduce the notion

60
00:02:48,575 --> 00:02:51,604
of biophilia, which plays a fundamental

61
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,619
role in this work.

62
00:02:53,621 --> 00:02:56,657
So biophilia came first, or came more

63
00:02:56,657 --> 00:03:00,639
prominently in this particular book here,

64
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,667
and it's quite interesting.

65
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:07,701
The idea is that the relation of humanity

66
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:09,723
to the rest of the natural world is

67
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:11,743
essentially one of dependence.

68
00:03:11,743 --> 00:03:13,760
And this is very much already in the

69
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,778
literature and the free energy principle.

70
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:14,779
.

71
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:19,823
But more than that, there is this view of

72
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:22,853
the necessity of a continued survival and

73
00:03:22,853 --> 00:03:25,881
flourishing that is utterly contingent

74
00:03:25,881 --> 00:03:27,908
upon the state and functioning of the

75
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,920
environment.

76
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:31,942
So we're talking about things like very

77
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:33,961
utilitarian things like survival,

78
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:35,981
flourishing, mental health, right?

79
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:36,998
So individuals interact with the

80
00:03:36,998 --> 00:03:37,005
environment.

81
00:03:37,006 --> 00:03:40,038
So to achieve that, but then on top of

82
00:03:40,038 --> 00:03:44,073
that, we wanted to add another conceptual

83
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:47,104
layer which is or concerns how humans

84
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:50,137
possess an innate cognitive disposition

85
00:03:50,137 --> 00:03:53,166
towards nature, which is known and

86
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:57,200
developed in this particular other field

87
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,223
of work as biophilia.

88
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,195
And this is the idea of the natural

89
00:04:02,195 --> 00:04:05,222
psychological disposition of humans to

90
00:04:05,222 --> 00:04:07,249
seek out and connect with other living

91
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:10,278
organisms and the natural environment.

92
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,301
So that's kind of like the idea that is

93
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:15,323
encapsulated in the whole framework and

94
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:16,336
theory under biophilia.

95
00:04:19,363 --> 00:04:23,405
So then this seems to if that's the case

96
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:27,447
of as things are described by biophilia,

97
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:32,491
then that seems to bring us to a dilemma.

98
00:04:32,491 --> 00:04:32,493
.

99
00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:35,525
On the one hand, we have these natural

100
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,555
tendencies, so to speak, of humans to

101
00:04:38,555 --> 00:04:41,586
engage with the natural world in a very

102
00:04:41,586 --> 00:04:44,613
positive and constructive way.

103
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:47,643
And on the other hand we see the lack of

104
00:04:47,643 --> 00:04:49,663
action to protect the Earth.

105
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,689
And here we have in mind particularly the

106
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:53,706
case of the climate crisis.

107
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:56,738
So in the presentation I'm going to make

108
00:04:56,738 --> 00:05:00,710
my way slowly towards getting to that and

109
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,737
to better understand the dilemma.

110
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:04,754
Okay?

111
00:05:04,755 --> 00:05:08,793
So let's go in brief over the Gaia

112
00:05:08,793 --> 00:05:09,806
hypotheses.

113
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:13,843
So this is a concept that comes more

114
00:05:13,843 --> 00:05:17,883
prominently in James Loflock's book Gaia

115
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:20,913
a New Look at Life on Earth.

116
00:05:20,915 --> 00:05:23,948
And the idea there is that 3.8 billion

117
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:27,981
years that life has persisted on Earth

118
00:05:27,981 --> 00:05:30,015
and conditions have remained remarkably

119
00:05:30,015 --> 00:05:33,047
constant and favorable across a huge

120
00:05:33,047 --> 00:05:35,068
range of parameters.

121
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,115
The Gaia hypothesis is that this

122
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:44,156
consistency or constancy is a natural

123
00:05:44,156 --> 00:05:47,182
product of evolution.

124
00:05:48,192 --> 00:05:51,224
In a modification, however, of the

125
00:05:51,224 --> 00:05:55,261
canonical Darwinism, the Gaia hypothesis

126
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:58,296
somewhat modifies canonical Darwinism

127
00:05:58,296 --> 00:05:59,302
how?

128
00:05:59,303 --> 00:06:02,274
Well, by thinking that rather than

129
00:06:02,274 --> 00:06:05,309
evolution of the individual organisms on

130
00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:09,345
an inert environment, what evolves is the

131
00:06:09,345 --> 00:06:12,378
whole Earth system with its living and

132
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:15,409
nonliving parts existing as a tight

133
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:17,426
coupled entity.

134
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:20,459
So this is the kind of like, so to speak,

135
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:23,489
refreshing or new way of thinking that

136
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:26,518
somewhat reformulated a little bit of

137
00:06:26,518 --> 00:06:28,533
Darwinism, right?

138
00:06:28,537 --> 00:06:32,572
The emphasis is not how one individual

139
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:35,609
organism evolves or species evolves, but

140
00:06:35,609 --> 00:06:38,637
the whole Earth as a system.

141
00:06:38,638 --> 00:06:42,669
So that's quite interesting because, for

142
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,697
example, the view that the combined

143
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:47,725
genetic wealth of information of the

144
00:06:47,725 --> 00:06:50,756
whole system becomes much more prominent

145
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:53,785
here than the Darwinistic kind of view

146
00:06:53,785 --> 00:06:56,815
and this acquires characteristics that

147
00:06:56,815 --> 00:06:59,847
are conductive to its continued existence

148
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:02,813
and in turn affect changes on the

149
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:03,829
environment.

150
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:08,873
So then, seen as a whole organism or as a

151
00:07:08,873 --> 00:07:11,906
whole system, one can look at Gaia or the

152
00:07:11,906 --> 00:07:14,939
Earth as a complex system which appears

153
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:17,967
to have the goal of regulating the

154
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:20,992
climate and the chemistry at a

155
00:07:20,992 --> 00:07:22,017
comfortable state of life.

156
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:26,054
And these views and these ideas have come

157
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:29,086
to gain more official expression in 2001

158
00:07:29,086 --> 00:07:32,117
with the Amsterdam Declaration on Earth

159
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:35,148
system science precisely endorsing this

160
00:07:35,148 --> 00:07:38,175
view on the planet Earth as a whole

161
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:39,185
system.

162
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:44,237
So then the Gaia hypothesis is a complex

163
00:07:44,237 --> 00:07:49,280
system in various ways because it changes

164
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,317
in an adaptive and nonlinear way.

165
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:56,353
It also displays dynamical emergent and

166
00:07:56,353 --> 00:07:58,375
sudden tipping behavior.

167
00:07:59,383 --> 00:08:02,359
And when bifurcation points are reached,

168
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:06,395
the new tractor states form, new tractor

169
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:08,413
states are formed.

170
00:08:08,418 --> 00:08:11,441
And this means that it also self

171
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:13,468
organizes and there is interdependence

172
00:08:13,468 --> 00:08:16,496
between the processors of the system.

173
00:08:17,508 --> 00:08:20,537
And finally, the Gaia hypothesis seems to

174
00:08:20,537 --> 00:08:23,565
be quite interesting and extraordinary in

175
00:08:23,565 --> 00:08:26,594
the sense that it brings together so many

176
00:08:26,594 --> 00:08:29,623
different fields such as ecology, climate

177
00:08:29,623 --> 00:08:31,649
science, cybernetics, complex systems

178
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:34,678
theory, chaos, mathematics and philosophy

179
00:08:34,678 --> 00:08:37,703
of mine and that's just a few.

180
00:08:38,713 --> 00:08:39,720
All right.

181
00:08:39,722 --> 00:08:42,751
So then the idea is of the Gaia

182
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,789
hypothesis is that we could look at the

183
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:49,828
planet from orbit or as it is known, the

184
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:51,846
overview effect.

185
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:54,875
And the Gaia hypothesis offers this

186
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,906
glimpse of a fundamentally different way

187
00:08:57,906 --> 00:09:00,877
of thinking of the planet, of thinking

188
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:03,907
that in fact dominated mostly by human

189
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:04,916
history.

190
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:08,957
So it's a little bit of like that very

191
00:09:08,957 --> 00:09:12,996
inspiring clip by Karl Sagan, the Pale

192
00:09:12,996 --> 00:09:16,039
blue dot whereby the world is considered.

193
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,041
.

194
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:20,070
So throughout the human history there's

195
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,100
typically a tendency for the world or the

196
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,126
planet to be considered from a single

197
00:09:25,126 --> 00:09:28,154
living organism, though, rather than an

198
00:09:28,154 --> 00:09:29,160
it.

199
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:32,194
So that's the idea of overview effect and

200
00:09:32,194 --> 00:09:34,219
taking this overview effect to look at

201
00:09:34,219 --> 00:09:37,244
the planet as this whole living system

202
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,258
rather than an it.

203
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:40,275
Okay?

204
00:09:40,276 --> 00:09:43,305
So then we can think about the Gaia

205
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:46,337
hypotheses as like Newtonian physics or

206
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:49,367
even as the free energy principle.

207
00:09:49,368 --> 00:09:53,401
The Gaia hypotheses can be seen much more

208
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:55,424
as a framework or a method of

209
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:58,456
investigation rather than a falsifiable

210
00:09:58,456 --> 00:10:00,412
empirical claim.

211
00:10:00,418 --> 00:10:04,450
So in this sense, these particular

212
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,488
frameworks, they are and should be judged

213
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:11,522
by their usefulness and not by their

214
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:15,561
purported correctness with usefulness.

215
00:10:15,562 --> 00:10:18,590
Importantly, usefulness is to be

216
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,625
determined by factors such as parsimony,

217
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,655
coherence and consistency plus its

218
00:10:24,655 --> 00:10:28,691
empirical and epistemic power to explain

219
00:10:28,691 --> 00:10:31,727
phenomena, produce new facts and so on in

220
00:10:31,727 --> 00:10:35,764
a given context and at a given time frame.

221
00:10:35,764 --> 00:10:35,769
.

222
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,795
So that's the stance that we think that

223
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:41,822
should be taken on the Gaia hypothesis.

224
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:42,838
All right?

225
00:10:42,838 --> 00:10:45,860
So now having said a few words on the

226
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,883
Gaia hypothesis now I'm going to just

227
00:10:47,883 --> 00:10:49,906
prepare the stage by saying a few words

228
00:10:49,906 --> 00:10:52,930
on the Fiang principle which, given the

229
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,950
topic of this conference, needs no

230
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:55,961
introduction.

231
00:10:55,962 --> 00:10:57,985
But for these purposes I must mention

232
00:10:57,985 --> 00:10:58,997
just a few things.

233
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:02,973
So the Fiang principle, we take it to be

234
00:11:02,973 --> 00:11:05,004
the case as well that it is a methodology

235
00:11:05,004 --> 00:11:08,031
to understand overserved patterns of

236
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:10,058
behavior sorry, observed patterns of

237
00:11:10,058 --> 00:11:13,083
behavior in the natural world.

238
00:11:13,085 --> 00:11:15,109
So then we apply the free energy

239
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:18,139
principle as the tool and methodology to

240
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:21,167
analyze these interdependent dynamics

241
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:24,193
between living systems and planetary

242
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:25,209
processes, right?

243
00:11:26,212 --> 00:11:28,238
Kind of like these goggles, these

244
00:11:28,238 --> 00:11:31,266
methodological, technical, scientific

245
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:34,296
goggles that you put on to gain insights

246
00:11:34,296 --> 00:11:37,325
into the future states of Gaia or the

247
00:11:37,325 --> 00:11:40,354
Earth such as to make future formulate

248
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:42,378
predictions and devise potential

249
00:11:42,378 --> 00:11:45,407
interventions in this particular case

250
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:48,434
with the care of alleviating future

251
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:51,465
potential or present dysfunction.

252
00:11:53,484 --> 00:11:57,519
Okay, so the free energy principle very

253
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,494
much aligns with this thinking by Ewan

254
00:12:00,494 --> 00:12:04,532
Schwellinger and the view that the second

255
00:12:04,532 --> 00:12:07,569
law of thermodynamics or under the second

256
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:11,604
law of thermodynamics that open systems

257
00:12:11,604 --> 00:12:15,641
like us should tend to dissipation.

258
00:12:16,657 --> 00:12:19,688
However interestingly, there are displays

259
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:22,718
of this super cool thing, the negantropy,

260
00:12:22,718 --> 00:12:25,747
which are pockets of the universe where

261
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:28,778
order and bodily integrity are maintained

262
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:31,808
in the face of the surge towards chaos or

263
00:12:31,808 --> 00:12:35,841
towards entropy or towards dissipation.

264
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:38,869
And this view of the pockets of the

265
00:12:38,869 --> 00:12:40,894
universe is incredibly interesting

266
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,918
because this is where we find self

267
00:12:42,918 --> 00:12:45,939
organizing systems like us.

268
00:12:45,944 --> 00:12:47,967
And what is so peculiar that

269
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,997
distinguishes these self organizing

270
00:12:50,997 --> 00:12:54,031
living systems from nonliving systems is

271
00:12:54,031 --> 00:12:57,062
that they have the capacity of acting

272
00:12:57,062 --> 00:13:00,034
upon and exchanging matter, energy or

273
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:03,069
information with the environment in order

274
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:07,100
to seemingly defy the second law and

275
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,132
therefore or thereby avoid dissipation

276
00:13:10,132 --> 00:13:12,157
and chaos and entropy.

277
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,176
So that's extraordinary.

278
00:13:15,184 --> 00:13:18,217
So then active inference becomes this

279
00:13:18,217 --> 00:13:22,253
very useful tool to tell us or to explain

280
00:13:22,253 --> 00:13:25,286
elucidate how these systems seemingly

281
00:13:25,286 --> 00:13:28,317
defy the second law, how they resist

282
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:32,353
entropy, how the self organizing systems

283
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,387
combat entropy through the interaction,

284
00:13:35,387 --> 00:13:38,415
maintaining their integrity via

285
00:13:38,415 --> 00:13:40,432
homeostasis.

286
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,467
So then they maintain this energetic

287
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:44,474
integrity.

288
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:47,500
They utilize energy to stay within a

289
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,527
specific range of states that is vital

290
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:52,554
for their survival and preserving their

291
00:13:52,554 --> 00:13:53,563
existence.

292
00:13:54,571 --> 00:13:57,599
And they also engage with these feedback

293
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:59,626
cycles which are the feedback actions

294
00:13:59,626 --> 00:14:02,595
like drinking when thirsty or moving away

295
00:14:02,595 --> 00:14:05,623
from heat signify working, accomplished

296
00:14:05,623 --> 00:14:07,649
by bound energy, contrasting with the

297
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:09,661
free energy.

298
00:14:09,668 --> 00:14:12,691
They also define the thermodynamics, as I

299
00:14:12,691 --> 00:14:14,714
just mentioned, by seemingly challenging

300
00:14:14,714 --> 00:14:16,734
the law, they minimize entropy and

301
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:18,751
safeguard their free energy.

302
00:14:18,756 --> 00:14:22,795
And finally this behavior that we observe

303
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:26,832
in these self organizing living systems

304
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:30,871
in striving to minimize free energy is or

305
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:33,907
agrees with a certain principle that we

306
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:37,946
know, which is the free energy principle.

307
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:38,950
.

308
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:39,968
Okay?

309
00:14:39,969 --> 00:14:42,997
So then, as I said earlier and as we know

310
00:14:42,997 --> 00:14:45,022
but just to keep in mind then active

311
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:48,049
inference becomes a very useful tool to

312
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:50,075
understand and make predictions about

313
00:14:50,075 --> 00:14:53,100
these coupling dynamics taking place

314
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,124
between interacting systems, living

315
00:14:55,124 --> 00:14:56,134
systems.

316
00:14:56,134 --> 00:14:59,164
Internal states is both operationally

317
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:02,136
closed and thermodynamically open to the

318
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:05,167
external states creating this distinct

319
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:08,198
boundary which we usually mathematically

320
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:11,224
capture with Markov blanket.

321
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,262
And then this interaction unfolds through

322
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:17,289
the immediate of active and sensory

323
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:18,296
states.

324
00:15:19,303 --> 00:15:22,332
Then the key point here to keep in mind

325
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:24,356
is that what we want to have for

326
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:27,386
adaptation and well being is that there

327
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:30,416
is a balanced interaction between sensory

328
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,433
and active states.

329
00:15:32,434 --> 00:15:35,462
And this is because it is within the

330
00:15:35,462 --> 00:15:38,491
interaction between sensory and active

331
00:15:38,491 --> 00:15:40,517
states that so to speak, all of the

332
00:15:40,517 --> 00:15:43,548
important things happen in order for the

333
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:46,573
system to be well adjusted attuned

334
00:15:46,573 --> 00:15:48,598
adapted to the environment.

335
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:53,643
So living systems avoid this dissipation.

336
00:15:53,643 --> 00:15:53,643
.

337
00:15:53,644 --> 00:15:55,667
They want to remain alive, they do

338
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:58,695
everything in their power, they navigate

339
00:15:58,695 --> 00:16:01,664
their environments in order to avoid this

340
00:16:01,664 --> 00:16:04,691
dissipation which is also or can be also

341
00:16:04,691 --> 00:16:06,714
said to minimize free energy.

342
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,747
And they avoid their dissipation by doing

343
00:16:09,747 --> 00:16:12,775
either one of the two things either by

344
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:15,806
changing the model or changing the world,

345
00:16:15,806 --> 00:16:17,827
by acting upon the world.

346
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:20,852
And this is extremely crucial for the

347
00:16:20,852 --> 00:16:22,874
point that I want to make later on.

348
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,922
So now I want to apply the Fionergy

349
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:30,958
principle to the Guy hypothesis and see

350
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,992
how that comes together in identifying

351
00:16:34,992 --> 00:16:37,027
and developing and why do I want to do

352
00:16:37,027 --> 00:16:38,036
that?

353
00:16:38,036 --> 00:16:40,056
I want to do that because I've also

354
00:16:40,056 --> 00:16:41,068
already mentioned it.

355
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:44,099
But I'm just going to refresh it because

356
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:47,121
I want to identify and develop

357
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:50,150
interventions to rectify any potential

358
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,178
maladaptive responses, namely actions

359
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:56,209
which are antithetical to maintaining the

360
00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:58,231
integrity of the system.

361
00:16:58,233 --> 00:17:01,205
What we want is to have healthy, well

362
00:17:01,205 --> 00:17:04,236
adjusted adaptive systems and human

363
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:07,269
behavior particularly that leads to the

364
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:11,300
imbalance within the Markov blanket

365
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,328
states, is or could be considered

366
00:17:13,328 --> 00:17:17,366
sometimes maladaptive or pathological.

367
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:20,398
And this will be the last point I'm going

368
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:24,430
to make in the presentation, but for now

369
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,458
want to focus on how does the French

370
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:29,488
principle deal with the Gaia hypothesis

371
00:17:29,488 --> 00:17:33,521
as a self organizing system like Ruth?

372
00:17:33,522 --> 00:17:33,527
Just saying.

373
00:17:33,528 --> 00:17:36,555
The Gaia meets the requirements to be

374
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,584
formalized as part of an active inference

375
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:40,590
system.

376
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,620
It exists in a non equilibrium steady

377
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,652
state, which means that its processes and

378
00:17:46,652 --> 00:17:49,681
states must persist over time within a

379
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:51,706
range of states that are far from

380
00:17:51,706 --> 00:17:52,718
equilibrium.

381
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:54,739
That means resisting entropy.

382
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,766
And the Gaia is also distinguishable from

383
00:17:57,766 --> 00:18:00,731
its largest scale cosmic environment such

384
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:02,754
as other planets and the rest of the

385
00:18:02,754 --> 00:18:03,761
universe.

386
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:06,790
It is also defined by the conditional

387
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,810
independence that we were just talking

388
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,830
about between the internal and external

389
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,849
stage which influence each other only

390
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:12,857
vicariously.

391
00:18:13,867 --> 00:18:15,885
So then we can taking that into

392
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:18,910
consideration, we can even see that some

393
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,934
of the people have already done this kind

394
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,955
of like line of reasoning, they've

395
00:18:22,955 --> 00:18:24,979
already run it through and they did that

396
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,000
by employing Markov blanket to analyze

397
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,002
the Earth's climate system dynamics,

398
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:31,004
which is quite interesting.

399
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:34,007
What they did was they looked at

400
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:37,010
metabolic rates of the biosphere and they

401
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,013
represented them as internal states and

402
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:43,016
space weather as external states and then

403
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:46,019
they looked at active states as mirrored

404
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:49,022
greenhouse effect shifts and sensory

405
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:52,025
states as echoed ocean driven temperature

406
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:55,028
changes and then internal and external

407
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:57,030
states.

408
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,032
The idea here is that they indirectly

409
00:18:59,032 --> 00:19:02,029
influenced each other through ocean's

410
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:03,030
delayed response.

411
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:07,034
Then Earth's climate is interpreted as

412
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:10,037
anticipatory minimizing variational, free

413
00:19:10,037 --> 00:19:11,038
energy.

414
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:15,042
So we take this work and we want to take

415
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:19,045
it a step further agreeing with this work

416
00:19:19,045 --> 00:19:22,049
and building upon this work which shows

417
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:25,052
climate change, we wanted to look at the

418
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:29,056
more broad understanding of Gaia through

419
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:33,060
the lenses of the free energy principle.

420
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,063
So instead of focusing on climate change,

421
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:39,066
which is very brilliantly done by these

422
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:42,069
researchers, we wanted to then scale it

423
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:46,073
up and apply the free energy principle to

424
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:47,074
understand the Gaia.

425
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:51,077
So then one can think of the internal

426
00:19:51,077 --> 00:19:53,080
states as the biosphere geographical

427
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,083
processes and the external states as

428
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:59,086
everything that is beyond the system,

429
00:19:59,086 --> 00:20:02,083
such as the outer atmosphere, Celicia

430
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,086
bodies and molten core.

431
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:08,089
Then we can think of sensory states as

432
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:11,092
the external environment impact such as

433
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:15,096
the Earth rotation, orbit, tides affected

434
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:17,098
by the sun, moon, planets, plate

435
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:21,102
tectonics, climate, weather influenced by

436
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:24,105
solar radiation, space weather, etc.

437
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:27,108
So and then we can think of the active

438
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:30,111
states as Earth's adaptability and

439
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:32,113
adjusting properties from external

440
00:20:32,113 --> 00:20:35,116
influence such as gravitational force,

441
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:38,119
altars orbits, magnetic field interacts

442
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:41,122
with solar winds or emission of

443
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:44,125
detectable radiation influences distant

444
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,126
objects.

445
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:47,128
That's a few examples.

446
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:50,131
So then I want to focus on the active

447
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:50,131
states.

448
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:54,135
Active states then through this lens,

449
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:56,137
active states then embody its primary

450
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:59,140
mechanism for self regulation,

451
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,137
representing its efforts to remain within

452
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:05,140
the bounds required for ongoing existence

453
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,143
based on predictions about the present

454
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,145
and future states of the system.

455
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:15,150
For instance, the current levels of

456
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,152
greenhouse and albedo effects, soil PH

457
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:20,155
and the number of living organisms

458
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:23,158
reflect the predictive attempts of the

459
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:25,160
Gaia system to adapt to anticipated

460
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,163
effects of solar events, volcanic

461
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:30,165
eruptions, ocean salinity changes, and

462
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:33,168
other environmental factors in the future.

463
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:34,169
.

464
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,173
So it is in this context that the role of

465
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:40,175
life itself assumes a paramount

466
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:43,178
importance in the self regulation of the

467
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:43,178
biosphere.

468
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:47,182
Because the role of life itself, and

469
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:50,185
particularly as we are going to focus on

470
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:54,189
next, the human life, has a particular

471
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:57,192
influence on all of these sort of already

472
00:21:57,192 --> 00:22:01,190
natural dynamics going on in the gaia.

473
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:07,196
This allows us, before we move into the

474
00:22:07,196 --> 00:22:10,199
human effects, this allows us to make one

475
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:12,201
final point before we move there, which

476
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:15,204
is to address the criticism that has been

477
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:18,207
made in this paper by Vicente Haja on the

478
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:20,209
Markov blanket trick.

479
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:23,212
And what they have identified is that a

480
00:22:23,212 --> 00:22:26,215
purported weakness of the free energy

481
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:30,219
principle what we say is that a weakness

482
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:32,221
of the free energy principle that is

483
00:22:32,221 --> 00:22:36,225
identified in this paper actually speaks

484
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:39,228
in favor of its application to the Gaia

485
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:40,229
hypothesis.

486
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:42,231
And let me just try to explain that.

487
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:46,235
So Raja and colleagues, they rightly

488
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:49,238
point out that Markov Lincolns do not

489
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:52,241
automatically capture every relevant

490
00:22:52,241 --> 00:22:54,243
property of biological systems,

491
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:57,246
relational properties such as affordances.

492
00:22:57,246 --> 00:22:58,247
.

493
00:22:58,247 --> 00:23:01,244
And by affordances they mean what the

494
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:04,247
environment offers, the animal, what it

495
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:07,250
provides, or furnishes, either good or

496
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,252
evil fall into this bracket.

497
00:23:09,252 --> 00:23:12,255
So what they're saying is that Markov

498
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:15,258
blanket do not automatically capture

499
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:18,261
every relevant aspect of biological

500
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:21,264
system such as affordances, right?

501
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:26,269
And we want to point out that however,

502
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:30,273
affordances correspond to Gaia as one

503
00:23:30,273 --> 00:23:33,276
rung in the ladder of the Nested Marco

504
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:37,280
blankets within the system in question at

505
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,284
every level ranging up from, say, cells,

506
00:23:41,284 --> 00:23:45,288
organs, animals, ecosystems, solar

507
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:48,291
systems, the whole cosmos.

508
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:51,293
And how is it that we think that this

509
00:23:51,293 --> 00:23:53,296
particular framework that we bring here

510
00:23:53,296 --> 00:23:56,299
does have or solve or address the notion

511
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:58,301
of affordances?

512
00:23:58,301 --> 00:24:01,298
Our solar system is one that affords a

513
00:24:01,298 --> 00:24:03,299
living planet.

514
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:06,303
So the affordance available is an

515
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:07,304
environment.

516
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:10,307
In an environment are not determined

517
00:24:10,307 --> 00:24:12,309
solely by the physical properties of the

518
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:13,310
environment.

519
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:17,314
And we think that this is the point that

520
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:21,318
we would like to address in HaHa's paper,

521
00:24:21,318 --> 00:24:23,320
is that the affordances are not

522
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,323
determined solely by the physical

523
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:30,327
properties of the environment, but also

524
00:24:30,327 --> 00:24:33,330
by the organism's goals, abilities and

525
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:37,334
previous experiences and in this case, of

526
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:38,335
the sun.

527
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:42,339
So what is meant here is that the sun is

528
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:46,343
what has the furnaces for or what affords

529
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:49,346
anything else to happen on the planet at

530
00:24:49,346 --> 00:24:52,349
whatever each scale, right?

531
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:55,352
The physical properties of the sun as

532
00:24:55,352 --> 00:24:58,354
well as the goals and abilities of the

533
00:24:58,354 --> 00:25:01,352
organisms on earth shape the affordances

534
00:25:01,352 --> 00:25:03,354
that the sun provides.

535
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:05,356
So it's a quite interesting way of

536
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:07,358
thinking that any affordance whatsoever

537
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:10,361
that we might think of that we have as

538
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:13,364
living systems, they are afforded by the

539
00:25:13,364 --> 00:25:13,364
sun.

540
00:25:13,364 --> 00:25:15,366
So that's the idea.

541
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:20,371
Okay, so now having gone through how the

542
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:24,375
female G principle somewhat speaks to and

543
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:28,379
contributes to understanding the Gaia

544
00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:32,383
hypotheses, then we want to focus on how

545
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:36,387
human behavior has a profound effect on

546
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:40,391
the dynamics that already existing in the

547
00:25:40,391 --> 00:25:42,393
natural world.

548
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:43,394
Daniel: Okay?

549
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:46,397
Ines: So according to the frequencies

550
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:48,399
principle, living beings have a natural

551
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:51,402
tendency to act upon their environment to

552
00:25:51,402 --> 00:25:53,404
prevent dissipation of their integrity.

553
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:55,406
So that's what we do in order to remain

554
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:56,407
alive.

555
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:59,410
There are therefore two ways for a thing

556
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,407
like us to minimize its free energy and

557
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:05,410
thereby maintain our own integrity upon

558
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:05,410
evidence.

559
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:09,414
As we navigate the world and gather and

560
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:12,417
observe evidence, we have two options.

561
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:13,418
One is to change the model.

562
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:15,420
The other one is to change the world by

563
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,422
acting upon it, like I just said before.

564
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:20,425
So then why is this relevant?

565
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:22,427
Well, this is relevant because there is

566
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:25,430
the possibility that in the ways in which

567
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,433
living systems and in this particular

568
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:31,436
case human beings interact and adapt to

569
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:34,439
the world, there is the possibility that

570
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:36,441
we see maladaptive behavior.

571
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:39,444
And how would that be?

572
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:41,446
Well, if it is the case that there is a

573
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:44,449
rejection of the information available so

574
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:47,452
as to remove the imperative for action or

575
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:49,454
if it is the case that possessing the

576
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:52,457
information available but we still remain

577
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:54,459
or refrain from taking action, then there

578
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:57,462
seems to be if the free energy principle

579
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:59,464
is correct if the free energy principle

580
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:02,461
is to be correct, that systems, living

581
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:04,463
beings tend to act upon the world in

582
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:07,466
order to remain alive and if it is the

583
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:09,468
case that one rejects that kind of

584
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:11,470
information and does not take action to

585
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,473
remain alive, such as the information of

586
00:27:14,473 --> 00:27:16,475
the climate crisis, then we might be

587
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:19,478
looking at maladaptive behavior.

588
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:22,481
So if the free energy principle holds,

589
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:25,484
then the observed contradictory behavior

590
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:27,486
is a maladaptive state or should be seen

591
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:30,489
as a maladaptive state that arises from

592
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:33,492
an imbalance within the Markov blanket.

593
00:27:33,492 --> 00:27:36,495
And how do we see this imbalance within

594
00:27:36,495 --> 00:27:37,496
the Markov blanket?

595
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:40,499
We see it to put it in very, very simple

596
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:43,502
terms, we see it as an insulation of

597
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:46,505
internal states that are not being

598
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:49,508
affected by the information available

599
00:27:49,508 --> 00:27:51,510
outside of the system.

600
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,512
So the influences or the interactions are

601
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:56,515
occurring between internal, active and

602
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:57,516
sensory states.

603
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:59,518
And this is an imbalance that results in

604
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:02,515
an insulation or an echo chamber effect

605
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:05,518
in internal states that are impermeable

606
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,520
to the information from or potentially

607
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,523
existing in the external states that

608
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:11,524
demands action.

609
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,528
So then some food for thought.

610
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,531
What can we make of this?

611
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:19,532
The free energy principle?

612
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:22,535
If we are to use the free energy

613
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:24,537
principle to model the dynamics of the

614
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:27,540
relationships between humans and the

615
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,542
environment then we think that it is

616
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:32,544
possible to see the current lack of pro

617
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,547
environmental behavior as a pathology of

618
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:36,549
the human species that must receive

619
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,551
treatment.

620
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,553
We label this condition as Biophilia

621
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:43,556
Deficiency Deficiency Syndrome.

622
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:47,560
Biophilia Deficiency Syndrome and it is

623
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,563
important for us to focus on that to

624
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:53,566
construct some validity.

625
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:56,569
Is useful to consider in this case other

626
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:59,572
applications of the free energy principle

627
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:02,569
that may be useful as an analogous case

628
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:05,572
of pathology mainly conducted in

629
00:29:05,572 --> 00:29:08,575
psychiatry and neurology and in here and

630
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:11,578
very short because I don't have time.

631
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:14,581
The idea is to see it as a failure to

632
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:17,584
assign the right way or prediction to

633
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:18,585
prediction errors.

634
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:21,588
So then the free energy principle from

635
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:24,591
this point of view this is a persuasive

636
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:27,594
pathology because doing nothing is a base

637
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:30,597
optimal response in the face of

638
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:33,600
pathological attention to various sources

639
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,601
of evidence.

640
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:37,604
So evidence is ignored.

641
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:41,608
So concluding and recapping according to

642
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:43,610
the free energy principle living systems

643
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,613
possess a biological encoded inclination

644
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:48,615
to interact with the environment in order

645
00:29:48,615 --> 00:29:51,618
to survive and adapt to the environment.

646
00:29:51,618 --> 00:29:54,621
And despite the climate change being a

647
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:56,623
pressing issue and the information being

648
00:29:56,623 --> 00:29:58,625
available the evidence being available

649
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:01,622
proactive measures to reverse its effects

650
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:03,624
are not giving the priority they deserve.

651
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:04,625
.

652
00:30:05,626 --> 00:30:08,629
This state of affairs seems to show very

653
00:30:08,629 --> 00:30:10,631
clearly a divergence from a natural

654
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:12,633
inclination that we call biophilia or

655
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:15,636
that is existing in the literature as

656
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:16,637
biophilia.

657
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:18,639
This discrepancy between the expected and

658
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:20,641
the observed actions can be understood in

659
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:22,643
the framework of the free energy

660
00:30:22,643 --> 00:30:23,644
principle or so we think.

661
00:30:23,644 --> 00:30:26,647
As an illness, it implies that systems,

662
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:28,649
including human societies may form

663
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:30,651
erroneous inferences that prevent them

664
00:30:30,651 --> 00:30:32,653
from effectively addressing the problem

665
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:33,654
at hand.

666
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:37,658
Now, thinking about future directions and

667
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:40,661
this is my last slide current ecological

668
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:43,664
imbalances could be thought of as a stuck

669
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:46,667
state that require an active disturbance

670
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:49,670
to bring about some change.

671
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,673
A stuck state is a state that a system is

672
00:30:52,673 --> 00:30:54,675
at a local minimum where the system is at

673
00:30:54,675 --> 00:30:57,678
and won't get out of that state unless it

674
00:30:57,678 --> 00:30:58,679
is disturbed.

675
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:00,675
So that's the principle in complex

676
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:03,678
systems theory and we think that that's

677
00:31:03,678 --> 00:31:05,680
how this particular state should be

678
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,681
looked at.

679
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:08,683
But that's for future research.

680
00:31:08,683 --> 00:31:11,685
And what we would be calling is we would

681
00:31:11,685 --> 00:31:13,688
be calling for amounts to the kind of

682
00:31:13,688 --> 00:31:15,690
homeostatic awakening.

683
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:17,692
So the sort of like getting out of this

684
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:20,695
stuck state would require some kind of

685
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:22,697
like omniostatic awakening a deliberately

686
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:25,699
induced disruptive shift in the

687
00:31:25,699 --> 00:31:27,702
trajectory reflecting a prioritization of

688
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:30,705
the planetary homeostasis over infinite

689
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:32,707
growth or staying in the same place.

690
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:35,710
And yeah, this is my last slide.

691
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,711
Thank you so much.

692
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:38,713
I would like also to acknowledge my co

693
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:40,715
author Casper Montgomery.

694
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:42,717
Thank you so much for your attention.

695
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,721
Daniel: Thank you.

696
00:31:47,722 --> 00:31:49,724
Well, a lot of ways to go.

697
00:31:49,724 --> 00:31:51,726
I'll just ask one question just in the

698
00:31:51,726 --> 00:31:54,729
years that you've been in the game how do

699
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:56,731
you see the active inference ecosystem

700
00:31:56,731 --> 00:31:59,734
and the ways also that it's being applied

701
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:02,731
to ecosystems evolving, like, over what

702
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:04,733
timescales or in what ways does that

703
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:06,735
really present itself to you?

704
00:32:07,736 --> 00:32:12,741
Ines: Slow, sadly slow.

705
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:15,744
I think there's a lot of work that needs

706
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:16,745
to be done.

707
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:20,749
We try to do this particular one here to

708
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:24,753
apply employ active inference to the

709
00:32:24,753 --> 00:32:27,756
planet or the Earth as a living system

710
00:32:27,756 --> 00:32:31,760
precisely to bring out or to overcome.

711
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:36,765
One is to look at this problem of the

712
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:39,768
climate crisis as what we think it is,

713
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:42,771
which is more of a pathology.

714
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:45,774
If the free energy principle holds, then

715
00:32:45,774 --> 00:32:47,776
it seems that there is maladaptive

716
00:32:47,776 --> 00:32:50,779
behavior of the collective of the human

717
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:51,780
species.

718
00:32:52,781 --> 00:32:55,784
So I think that there's a lot of work

719
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:58,787
that can be done and that would very much

720
00:32:58,787 --> 00:33:01,784
be useful in the climate crisis in

721
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:02,785
general.

722
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:06,789
There is some other work that came out

723
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:09,792
more recently by Maxwell and colleagues

724
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:11,794
as well on the ecosystems, which is

725
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:12,795
really cool.

726
00:33:12,795 --> 00:33:16,799
And I would also mention that one, and I

727
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,802
really hope that we can pursue this line

728
00:33:19,802 --> 00:33:23,806
of research and employee active inference

729
00:33:23,806 --> 00:33:26,809
in the free energy principle to this

730
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:27,810
particular case.

731
00:33:29,812 --> 00:33:32,815
One of the things that really attracts me

732
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:34,817
to the free energy principle is the

733
00:33:34,817 --> 00:33:36,819
capacity that it has to bring to the

734
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:39,822
forefront certain laws of physics, but

735
00:33:39,822 --> 00:33:42,825
also the living systems navigating and

736
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:44,827
interacting with their environments,

737
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:47,830
which I find much more appealing than any

738
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,832
computational framework per se.

739
00:33:49,832 --> 00:33:52,835
So that's what I find that it's a very

740
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:55,838
useful conceptual toolkit that I think

741
00:33:55,838 --> 00:33:58,841
that I would really like to see more

742
00:33:58,841 --> 00:34:00,837
applied in the future for the climate

743
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:02,839
crisis and the Earth.

744
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:05,842
Daniel: Great.

745
00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:07,844
Well, thank you so much for building on

746
00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:10,847
that line of work and for sharing it with

747
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:10,847
us tonight.

748
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:14,851
Ines: Thank you so much for having me.

749
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:15,852
Daniel: Till next time.

750
00:34:15,852 --> 00:34:16,853
See you.

751
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:17,854
Ines: Thank you.

752
00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:19,856
Daniel: Bye bye.

753
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:29,865
All right, well, great talk by an S.

754
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:29,866
Bye.
