
00:06 _Daniel:_
[[start:6720][end:8350]]Hello and welcome, everyone.
[[start:8720][end:14376]]This is the third applied active inference symposium enacting ecosystems of shared intelligence.
[[start:14488][end:17564]]It is August 22, 2023.
[[start:17762][end:26456]]We have a lot of really awesome presentations and sessions coming up in the first interval and in the second interval.

00:26 [[start:26568][end:30212]]So let's just get right into it with our first talk.
[[start:30266][end:32112]]This will be by Andre Bastos.
[[start:32176][end:36230]]So, Andre, thank you for joining and looking forward to your talk.

00:37 _Andre:_
[[start:37640][end:39152]]Thank you very well, Daniel.
[[start:39216][end:44324]]And thank you for the other organizers of the Active Inference Conference and Symposium here.

00:44 [[start:44442][end:48120]]I'm glad to be talking to you guys today about my work.
[[start:48270][end:60360]]The title of the presentation is multilaminar Multi Area Recordings and the Non Human primate that's these guys right here, macaque monkeys, suggest that predictive coding is implemented via predictive routing.
[[start:60520][end:62812]]And so what do we mean by these things?
[[start:62866][end:90740]]Well, just as a point of introduction, I'd like to start by just saying that I started out working with Karl Friston in about 2010, and we were really interested in trying to map the neurobiology of the predictive coding circuits that have been theorized and hypothesized onto cortical laminar architecture, which you can see here.
[[start:90890][end:103320]]And in that work with him, we proposed that different layers and different oscillations were involved in either capturing and calculating prediction error or predictions.

01:43 [[start:103660][end:112360]]And so what we do in my lab and I recently started as an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at Vanderbilt.
[[start:112520][end:125120]]And so what we do is we train rhesus macaque monkeys on tasks which are more or less predictable and that have different sensory elements that are more or less predictable, and we'll get into what that looks like.
[[start:125270][end:135296]]And then we use multilaminar probes, so high density probes with dozens or hundreds of contacts that can record across different layers.
[[start:135328][end:143680]]And so this is a beautiful drawing here of what the layers look like of Cortex by Santiago Ramoni Cajal over 100 years ago.
[[start:143770][end:147204]]And you can see this really beautiful layered architecture.

02:27 [[start:147252][end:150376]]Layer 1234 is this dense one.
[[start:150398][end:154972]]In the middle five, you get these large pyramidal neurons, and then six on the bottom.
[[start:155106][end:159960]]And so we're interested in my lab primarily at two levels of explanation.
[[start:160040][end:163964]]The first is, what do these neurons spike to?

02:44 [[start:164002][end:167056]]What makes them fire action potentials and excites them?

02:47 [[start:167158][end:171728]]And do they get more or less excitable depending on how predictable stimuli are?
[[start:171814][end:173916]]And second, how do they oscillate?
[[start:173948][end:181308]]In which frequency bands does rhythmic activity tend to cause them to fire more or less action potentials?
[[start:181324][end:192452]]And so we record across layers in one area over here, but we might put in our electrodes in several other areas so that we can also capture aspects of cortical communication.
[[start:192596][end:205332]]And these oscillations in this communication, we think, is really intimately linked to the interaction between inhibitory cells, these cells in red here, and excitatory neurons, these cells in black that I've drawn.

03:25 [[start:205476][end:209596]]Okay, so without further ado, let's just dive right into it here.
[[start:209778][end:226140]]So here's the outline of my talk in part one we're going to be talking about first an overview of what do we actually mean by this predictive coding model and how do we think it may be mapped onto cortex and paying special attention to the neurophysiology.

03:46 [[start:226300][end:244560]]So here's the bird's eye overview of predictive coding at the level that maybe a neurobiologist or a cognitive scientist or a cognitive neuroscientist might need to know about in order to be able to apply it to their own work.
[[start:244730][end:252676]]And so, here's what I mean by predictive coding, that there's a hypothesized circuit that is especially rich in higher order areas.
[[start:252708][end:270636]]So here's like the front of the brain, which learns about these statistical regularities of the world and creates predictions about what is going to be seen and felt and touched and so on in the next moment in time and in this moment in time, and sends those predictions to earlier parts of the brain.

04:30 [[start:270668][end:281356]]So, to lower order cortex receive these predictions and sensory inputs, the inputs coming from the eyes and ears and all of our sensorium is then compared to this top down prediction.
[[start:281468][end:285972]]And if there's a mismatch, that's a prediction error and the prediction error is sped forward.
[[start:286106][end:296852]]It's a mismatch response and it can be used to drive models, drive these internal representations in order to be better over time and to make better predictions.

04:56 [[start:296996][end:305172]]And in particular, these prediction errors are hypothesized to be housed in superficial layers of cortex.
[[start:305316][end:310664]]And so that's a hypothesis that we've been able to test now with these laminar electrodes.

05:10 [[start:310792][end:320780]]So let's see how our experimental design worked in order for us to be able to look at the difference between predictable and unpredictable sensory stimuli.
[[start:320860][end:324444]]So we train monkeys on what's called a delayed match to sample task.
[[start:324572][end:331424]]It's a classic task of working memory, where monkeys are trained to fixate on the center of the screen.
[[start:331542][end:335040]]Then there's a visual stimulus, in this case a car stimulus that's shown.
[[start:335120][end:338800]]There's a brief delay in which that stimulus has to be held in working memory.

05:38 [[start:338880][end:343888]]Then the animal is tested on which of the three items was in working memory.
[[start:343984][end:353380]]The animal makes a correct response when they saka, in this case to the upper left, to indicate that the car stimulus was last shown.
[[start:353540][end:361324]]So we then manipulated the predictability of this information that was to enter working memory in the following way.

06:01 [[start:361442][end:380544]]For 50 trials in a row, we would either keep the sample stimulus constant, so car, car, and that's being depicted by the a here, or in another context, there would be an unpredictable sampling regime where either the car orange or green could be sampled at any moment in time.
[[start:380582][end:385952]]So the animals went back and forth in being in a predictable context or an unpredictable context.

06:26 [[start:386016][end:395160]]And then we asked the question, what does brain activity look like when the exact same stimulus is processed in a predictable regime versus an unpredictable regime.
[[start:395740][end:401796]]And in order to do this work, we implanted these monkeys with multilaminar probes.
[[start:401828][end:409784]]So these are probes, again with these at that time that I did this work, about a dozen or so or maybe up to 32 contacts.
[[start:409832][end:414696]]Nowadays we can go into the several hundreds of contacts along a single probe.
[[start:414808][end:424256]]We can use MRI guidance in order to position those probes perpendicular to cortex such that they'll span each of the six cortical layers, layer one through six.

07:04 [[start:424358][end:427184]]Here you can see the white matter here below.
[[start:427382][end:444596]]And then we sampled from different parts of both the visual cortex because, remember, those are the areas that might issue prediction errors in the case of an unpredictable sample as well as higher order cortex which has been hypothesized to create these internal models that then issue predictions.
[[start:444788][end:446248]]So here's what we found.
[[start:446414][end:451800]]We first just analyzed the multiunit activity which is a measure of the spike rate.
[[start:451870][end:457080]]So how many action potentials per unit of time are these neurons firing?

07:37 [[start:457160][end:465112]]And what's being shown here is the multiunit activity as a difference between when that sample was unpredictable minus predictable.
[[start:465176][end:475308]]So positive activity means more activity during an unpredictable sample I-E-A violation of a prediction or a putative prediction error signal.
[[start:475404][end:491504]]And all throughout the brain from V four, the sensory area all the way to these higher order frontal parietal regions we saw, without any exception that neurons were much more excitable when they were processing an unpredictable stimulus compared to predictable stimulus.

08:11 [[start:491632][end:499812]]And also, not surprisingly, this started already at the feed forward sweep of activity such that these red bars here indicate the start of significance.
[[start:499876][end:504596]]So sure enough, area V four was the first to show significance.

08:24 [[start:504708][end:507520]]So more spiking to the unpredictable, over predictable.
[[start:507620][end:511180]]And this activity fed forward up the cortical hierarchy.
[[start:512400][end:523472]]Next, we looked not only at the firing rate of these neurons but also the local field potential which is informative about the local oscillatory activity that's present.
[[start:523526][end:537008]]So you can think of these oscillations as massive waves of activity that are synchronous across a large population of neurons but of course, are produced through the interplay between these recurrent inhibitory bouts of activity.
[[start:537104][end:538516]]And so, here's what we found.

08:58 [[start:538618][end:546360]]We performed this power spectral analysis again comparing power in the unpredictable case versus power in the predictable case.
[[start:546510][end:548724]]And we did a percent change metric.
[[start:548772][end:551044]]Very simple percent change metric.
[[start:551092][end:562424]]So again, what's shown here on the Y axis is in positive, more power to unpredictable samples and in the negative values, more power to the predictable samples.

09:22 [[start:562552][end:571592]]Now, what we saw in the gamma range so that's everywhere above about 30 or 40 Hz again in all areas very strongly mirrored what we saw in the spiking activity.

09:31 [[start:571656][end:578940]]Namely, that there was more of this high frequency and also the classic low range frequency in the gamma range.
[[start:579020][end:585664]]So in both the low gamma and high gamma ranges an enhancement of power during the unpredictable cues.
[[start:585792][end:588016]]That was also the case in the theta band.
[[start:588048][end:600292]]And this makes somewhat sense from the point of view of neurophysiology that this theta frequency and this gamma frequency, they very often track one another and do similar things in cortex.
[[start:600356][end:601832]]Why exactly that is the case?

10:01 [[start:601886][end:608920]]We actually don't know what the reason for that is, but that's an observation that we've seen in many other tasks.
[[start:609080][end:622028]]But what we saw in between the theta and the gamma bands was this other band at between ten to about 20 or slightly higher in frequency, this classic alpha beta band.
[[start:622124][end:629504]]And this alpha beta band, this alpha beta band acted in the exact opposite way.

10:29 [[start:629622][end:633616]]Namely, there was more power to predictable samples than to unpredictable samples.
[[start:633648][end:634768]]With one exception.

10:34 [[start:634864][end:636944]]Area seven A was an exception.
[[start:636992][end:646916]]It did have that canonical pattern in the alpha band, but in the low beta band, it was actually similar to gamma.
[[start:646948][end:650916]]And we think that this might be a working memory update mechanism.
[[start:651028][end:663100]]But for now, we are really stressing and emphasizing the fact that across all of these areas, you had this beta signal that was stronger to the predictable case, to the predictable sample.
[[start:663520][end:666936]]Okay, so next we had these laminar electrodes.

11:06 [[start:666968][end:677244]]So let's look at the difference between what these neurons are doing when you record from the so called superficial layers of cortex versus the so called deep layers of cortex.
[[start:677372][end:679840]]So the superficial layers are layers two, three.
[[start:679990][end:682788]]The deep layers are these layers five and six.
[[start:682954][end:685940]]These superficial layers, they are the layers that feed forward.
[[start:686010][end:700756]]So remember from that introductory slide that these are the layers that were hypothesized based on predictive coding theory to house the prediction error neurons, because according to theory, those prediction error signals are sent in the feed forward direction.

11:40 [[start:700788][end:712044]]So we then tested that in a second way, which was to test whether or not those enhanced signals during unpredictable samples are more present in layer two, three.
[[start:712162][end:714236]]And that's exactly what we found in V four.
[[start:714338][end:725728]]So when we again take this spiking signal and subtract unpredictable, minus predictable spiking, we see that the signal is more enhanced in superficial layers of D four.
[[start:725814][end:731488]]There was a trend towards that in PFC as well, but in D four, it was a significant observation.
[[start:731664][end:740980]]And furthermore, when we now look at the LFP gamma power, this power in the 40 to 90 Hz band, again, we do the power change.

12:21 [[start:741050][end:746260]]So these positive signals mean there's an enhancement of gamma power to the unpredictable signal.
[[start:746340][end:762860]]And again, now in both V four and PFC, it's the superficial layers that are having more of this unpredictable signal again, and that's consistent with the theorized type of circuitry for these canonical circuits.

12:43 [[start:763520][end:786064]]Next, we were interested in whether or not these power changes were blankets across the board that just overall increase mu activity and GAM activity independent of the exact sample that was being shown or whether these signals were actually specific to the actual item that was being predicted.
[[start:786112][end:798244]]Because remember, in our task design, animals were for a large portion of time predicting that there should be a car stimulus or predicting an orange or predicting the green stimulus.
[[start:798292][end:812680]]So in that particular task requirement, it wouldn't make sense if task representations for all three stimuli all went up to an unpredictable stimuli that would be more consistent with just an overall arousal signal.

13:32 [[start:812760][end:822640]]But what we were next interested in is whether or not neurons that actually were selective for the car, if it was those neurons in particular that had the unpredictable signals.
[[start:823380][end:825984]]And what we found is that that was indeed the case.

13:46 [[start:826102][end:840176]]So we performed the same analysis as before, LFP gamma power difference for unpredictable, minus, predictable, but now as a function of whether or not those neurons preferred the stimulus that was being predicted.
[[start:840288][end:846196]]And what we found is that the preference actually modulated this gamma band activity very strongly.
[[start:846308][end:869484]]And so this unpredictable signal change was more specific to neurons that actually preferred that predicted stimulus, indicating that this prediction was not acting as a blanket similar to an arousal mechanism, but was actually reaching down at the level of the representations that were specific to the thing that needed to be predicted.

14:29 [[start:869612][end:882640]]And that was even more the case in the beta frequency range actually, where the neurons that didn't encode the predicted stimulus, they couldn't care less whether or not that stimulus was predictable.
[[start:882720][end:888944]]It was really only neurons that carried information about the stimulus that was being predicted.

14:48 [[start:888992][end:903370]]Those were the neurons that were not enhancing but diminishing their beta during an unpredictable signal or said another way, enhancing their beta to a predicted signal change.
[[start:904620][end:906796]]So here's what we think is going on.
[[start:906978][end:911496]]We call this neurophysiological implementation that we found of predictive coding.

15:11 [[start:911528][end:939168]]We call it predictive routing to make a semantic point, but also a slightly more neurophysiological and computational argument that we don't actually find strong evidence for this mismatch and prediction signal at the level of neurons, but instead we think that this prediction circuit exists but uses these oscillations in order to implement what is predicted.
[[start:939264][end:940484]]So here's how we think this works.
[[start:940522][end:949492]]So when a prediction matches a stimulus, as is being shown here, when you're predicting A and you get a stimulus A, then the A column.

15:49 [[start:949636][end:964968]]In other words, it doesn't have to be a column, but the area of the brain or the neurons that encode A are going to become prepared to receive the stimulus A by enhancing the power of this alpha beta signal.
[[start:965064][end:975196]]So this top down beta from higher order areas we think prepares a cortical circuit to receive a predicted stimulus and it prepares that stimulus by enhancing that's.

16:15 [[start:975228][end:985670]]This up arrow here, the alpha beta, especially in the deep layers, which can inhibit both the gamma and the spiking signal in the superficial layers as a result.
[[start:986920][end:1000120]]So this top down signal inhibits the superficial layers and as a result, there is decreased gamma and spiking and decreased feed forward output in the case of a predictable stimulus.
[[start:1001340][end:1008684]]The case of an unpredictable stimulus, well, stimulus A, just like before, is still going to be coming in.
[[start:1008802][end:1020668]]But because it's not predictable, that column, that set of neurons that normally represents A, was not previously prepared by an alpha beta signal.

17:00 [[start:1020764][end:1033968]]And so the alpha beta signal is relatively low in an unpredictable context, releasing the inhibition that the deep layers exert on superficial layers and as a result, causing more gamma, more spiking and more feed forward output.

17:14 [[start:1034064][end:1044868]]In other words, what we are hypothesizing here is that predictive coding and this error computation comes about as a failure in predictive inhibition.
[[start:1044964][end:1053540]]And as a result of the lack of these mechanisms being in place during an unpredictable stimulus, there is an enhanced gamma output.
[[start:1053620][end:1058168]]And that's what we call a prediction error, or that's what we interpret as a prediction error.
[[start:1058344][end:1066628]]So here's the predictive routing model one more time in a predictable stimulus, top down inputs prepare the column to receive a stimulus.
[[start:1066744][end:1070236]]That preparation leads to inhibition, less feed forward output.

17:50 [[start:1070348][end:1077040]]In an unpredictable case, those mechanisms aren't in place, as a result, more feed forward gamma output.
[[start:1077700][end:1078784]]So that's part one.
[[start:1078822][end:1088560]]That's our cortical neurophysiological hypothesis then, that we call predictive routing of how we believe predictive coding is implemented in the brain.

18:08 [[start:1088720][end:1105176]]And next I want to turn to a little bit more about how these rhythms are actually produced in the brain, because one of the things that we noticed from just placing our laminar electrodes into cortex is that independent of where we put our probe.
[[start:1105208][end:1108696]]So here's an example of prefrontal cortex activity.

18:28 [[start:1108808][end:1116420]]We would see these high frequency gamma waves and superficial layers and slower frequency alpha beta waves in these deep layers.
[[start:1116600][end:1125980]]And you can do this analysis very easily and quickly to reveal this, what we call spectrolaminer pattern.
[[start:1126140][end:1139680]]And what this is, is simply dividing each contact on the probe, dividing the power that you observe at that contact by the maximum, by the contact with the maximum power along the probe.
[[start:1139760][end:1148948]]And what this does is it normalizes power such that a value of one is the layer that had the most power at that particular frequency band.

19:09 [[start:1149044][end:1152036]]And so, if you look here on the x axis, this is frequency.

19:12 [[start:1152148][end:1157512]]So these red colors are tracking which particular layer has more power at that frequency.
[[start:1157576][end:1162984]]So you see more of this low and high gamma power in the superficial layers.
[[start:1163032][end:1170960]]So that's above zero on the y axis and more of this alpha beta activity in the deeper layers of the cortex.
[[start:1172020][end:1185088]]And so in a large scale survey of cortex, together with Bob DeSimone's Lab and Diego.
[[start:1185184][end:1190368]]And so I did this partially while I was at MIT, when I was a postdoc with Earl Miller.

19:50 [[start:1190384][end:1191236]]And I continued this.
[[start:1191258][end:1192928]]Now at Vanderbilt.
[[start:1193024][end:1198484]]So this was a really cross institutional study and involved multiple labs.
[[start:1198532][end:1207784]]And the reason that that was important is that most labs specialize in being a prefrontal cortex lab, or a V four lab, or an lip lab, et cetera.
[[start:1207912][end:1217724]]And relatively few investigators had actually done the necessary work to be able to record with these laminar probes in multiple areas simultaneously.

20:17 [[start:1217852][end:1230324]]And so, therefore, by coordinating and pooling data from multiple experiments, we were able to record from a total of 14 areas in this study that we have now in review.
[[start:1230522][end:1240176]]And what we found was that independent of the area, we found a spectral laminar pattern that was highly conserved across areas.
[[start:1240288][end:1250004]]And so here it is from zero to 150 Hz for area V four in the sensory cortex, seven A in parietal cortex, prefrontal cortex in the front of the brain.
[[start:1250132][end:1260780]]Everywhere we looked, we found that there was this enhanced gamma power in these red lines here in superficial layers, and enhanced alpha beta power in the deeper layers.
[[start:1262400][end:1275340]]And what we then turn to next is, first of all, well, let's really confirm at a histological anatomical level that it's really these layers.

21:15 [[start:1275500][end:1279660]]Is it layer one, is it layer two, is it four that expresses gamma?

21:19 [[start:1279820][end:1281408]]And the same question for beta.
[[start:1281424][end:1290544]]Let's really confirm that that is in fact the case, because it seemed like a very prominent hypothesis and a very prominent observation.
[[start:1290592][end:1292730]]We wanted to really confirm it.
[[start:1293180][end:1296376]]So that's the first part of this, part two.

21:36 [[start:1296478][end:1305336]]And then we're going to get into which specific mechanisms might generate these oscillations and how does that inform computational modeling?
[[start:1305448][end:1313688]]And so then this was work done in my lab at Vanderbilt, led by a very talented undergraduate student, actually, Max Lichtenfeld.
[[start:1313864][end:1317032]]And so we performed these histological reconstructions.
[[start:1317096][end:1330412]]Here's the probe, an example probe where we performed these tiny electrolytic lesions in particular areas while we were recording here's the overlay of the laminar boundaries.
[[start:1330476][end:1332740]]So in red here, this is layer four.

22:12 [[start:1332890][end:1348456]]And then, of course, we had the electrophysiology so we could look at the gamma power, gamma relative power, the beta relative power, and the point at which they cross over, actually, we determined was pretty consistent in layer four.

22:28 [[start:1348638][end:1352920]]And of course, then we also mapped on the other features of these things to the layers.
[[start:1353900][end:1367630]]And so here's what we found is that the crossover, the point at which the gamma profile in red and the beta profile in blue, the point at which they cross over, at which their powers are equal, that tended to land in layer four.
[[start:1367940][end:1375970]]The peak gamma power tended to land in layer two or three, and the peak beta power tended to land in layer five or six.
[[start:1377220][end:1388736]]And so we mapped these distances between these different electrophysiological signatures or distinct profiles to the different layers.

23:08 [[start:1388768][end:1404360]]And we did this for several different probes and for several different animals until we were able to get a very nice distribution here, which confirmed that indeed, the gamma beta crossover is consistent with being at laminar position zero.
[[start:1404430][end:1413724]]We called the middle of layer four, whereas this gamma is at the boundary between layer two, three and beta at the boundary between layer five and six.

23:33 [[start:1413922][end:1418784]]And so here is our current toy model of what we think is going on.
[[start:1418902][end:1444200]]So we think that there's different inhibitory neurons that are interacting with their excitatory cell partners to generate fast frequency gamma activity in the superficial layers and in turn that there is another type of interneuron that is generating with slower time constants this alpha beta rhythmic activity.
[[start:1445180][end:1460060]]So in order to examine this, we again turn to anatomy, we again turn to this question, well then, which exact inhibitory neurons are most prominent therefore in the layers that express these different frequencies?

24:20 [[start:1460480][end:1476844]]And in order to perform this work, what we did is we quantified the laminar expression of three distinct interneuron subtypes that are known to account for over 90% of the inhibitory interneurons in the primate brain.

24:36 [[start:1476972][end:1484656]]And those inhibitory neuron subtypes are parvalbumin positive calretin, calbindin positive.
[[start:1484768][end:1502116]]And importantly, previous computational modeling work had really singled out the parvalbumin cell class as the critical class for generating these gamma oscillations because of their fast time constants and strong synapses onto the cell bodies of excitatory neurons.
[[start:1502308][end:1529148]]And so again we perform this painstaking histological analysis where you perform different stains, mounting cover, slipping microscopy, semiautomated thresholding and cell counting in order to be able to then really have a quantitative view on which layers have which cell types that are most associated with these frequencies.
[[start:1529324][end:1531604]]And so here's what this data then looks like.

25:31 [[start:1531642][end:1545210]]We have the gamma and alpha beta electrophysiology here, and then at the same time we have the presence of different neuron types with the three inhibitory cell classes here.

25:45 [[start:1545660][end:1553684]]And then we can perform an analysis to determine which of these cell classes is most strongly associated with the gamma.
[[start:1553812][end:1578956]]And here's what we found that in both the low gamma and the high gamma across over 14 regions, what we found quite significantly was that it was really the parvalbumin cell counts shown here as a function of laminar depth that were giving us the best explanation for the laminar profile of the gamma rhythmic activity.
[[start:1579068][end:1587990]]Both when you take a very wide band as well as when you perform a low versus high gamma split, it comes out in both ways.
[[start:1589640][end:1593428]]So how can this inform computational models of oscillations?

26:33 [[start:1593524][end:1596250]]Well, here's what we think is going on then.
[[start:1596620][end:1609016]]We collaborated with several people here on this work, including Sanchez Toto et al and computational modelers in Spain.

26:49 [[start:1609128][end:1617404]]And what we did was we performed an analysis where we took different interneurons with different types of connectivity.
[[start:1617452][end:1631472]]So these PV, these parvalbumin interneurons were modeled as having strong inhibitory connections to the pyramidal cell class and strong self inhibition, which has been important for gamma oscillations previously.
[[start:1631616][end:1645156]]And when you hook them up in these particular ways, sure enough, and you measure the spectral output of these neurons, these p two neurons, superficial parameter neurons, sure enough, they express gamma.

27:25 [[start:1645268][end:1656780]]And when you put in different types of interneurons with slower time constants and different types of connections to these deep layer neurons, sure enough, they come out with more alpha beta oscillations.
[[start:1657680][end:1676524]]So indeed, this anatomical work could produce even more in the future, even more accurate models of how these interneurons work together and with parameter cells across different layers in order to express these oscillations.

27:56 [[start:1676572][end:1696120]]So this is really a work in progress and one of the first steps towards this and our ultimate aim is to really pull together this rich anatomical and neurophysiological data together with computational models to be able to approximate the laminar structure of cortex to a better and better degree.

28:19 [[start:1699420][end:1707816]]This next part here, I'll talk a little bit about a causal test now of the predictive routing model with propofol anesthesia.
[[start:1707848][end:1710190]]So this will be the last part of the talk here.
[[start:1711280][end:1713608]]And so we were interested in anesthesia.
[[start:1713704][end:1732704]]I got interested in anesthesia actually through my work and contact with Jake Donahue over here, who is a very talented MD PhD student at MIT at the time and was being co mentored by Emory Brown and Earl Miller, who was also my mentor.
[[start:1732832][end:1736740]]And so we became interested in this topic for the following reason.

28:56 [[start:1736890][end:1761656]]Well, first of all, as surprising as this may seem, if you go into a surgical clinic and you're administered an anesthetic such as propofol, well, it turns out that the anesthesiologist may not know exactly the cortical mechanisms and the systems level mechanisms for how that anesthetic is actually working in the brain.
[[start:1761768][end:1773968]]And it's actually to this day remains more often than not the case that there's actually no intraoperative monitoring of brain state.
[[start:1774134][end:1778784]]It's far and few between the anesthesiologists that are actually doing that.
[[start:1778822][end:1793796]]And so Emory Brown, who's an anesthesiologist himself, is really pushing for more and more adoption of simple tools like EEG and spectral estimation methods by the clinic.
[[start:1793908][end:1808712]]And so our work was clinically motivated, but it was also motivated by the ability to test this predictive routing model when activity, especially in prefrontal cortex areas, is relatively silenced.

30:08 [[start:1808856][end:1823890]]And so in these experiments, we administered propofol to again these rhesus macaques and we recorded brain activity there's, these local field potentials and spiking activity in the awake state as well as in the unconscious state.
[[start:1824340][end:1836710]]And what we first noticed is that in the unconscious state, there were these slow rhythmic bouts of activity at about 1 cycle per second, or slightly little faster, a little slower than that.
[[start:1837240][end:1838704]]Those are the slow frequencies.
[[start:1838752][end:1855630]]And these slow frequencies organize these massive bouts of spiking, which could sometimes be very synchronous across cortex, but that there were long periods of silence in between these bouts of spiking in the unconscious state.
[[start:1856400][end:1867420]]And so propofol anesthesia, we found is accompanied by, again, these strong increases in slow frequency activity, which create alternating on and off periods for spiking.

31:07 [[start:1867840][end:1873852]]There's reduced spiking activity throughout the network, but the strongest reductions are in prefrontal cortex.

31:13 [[start:1873996][end:1877452]]And sensory areas are relatively spared.
[[start:1877516][end:1884956]]So they're still quite reduced in their excitability in the unconscious state, but prefrontal cortex is more inhibited.
[[start:1885148][end:1892208]]There is also, we found reductions in cross area synchrony and very pronounced reductions in the alpha beta band.
[[start:1892384][end:1901204]]And so as a result, we thought we could actually use this model, this propofol anesthetic model, in order to test certain aspects of predictive routing.

31:41 [[start:1901252][end:1903176]]Because what's going on here?
[[start:1903198][end:1910140]]We have lower order cortex that's hypothesized to feed forward prediction errors to higher order cortex.
[[start:1911840][end:1916540]]And in turn, these higher order areas might feed back their predictions.
[[start:1916900][end:1925580]]But as a result of propofol, these higher order areas are profoundly impaired and very reduced in their spiking activity.
[[start:1925660][end:1931724]]And the alpha beta rhythm is also the synchrony between areas is highly reduced.

32:11 [[start:1931772][end:1933620]]So what's going to happen in this case?
[[start:1933690][end:1943524]]Well, if you think from the point of view of simply everything is going down, then sensory areas in a response to an unpredictable stimulus should also just go down.

32:23 [[start:1943642][end:1953236]]But if you think from a predictive coding or a predictive routing point of view, the function of these higher order areas is to create feedback predictions that inhibit activity.
[[start:1953348][end:1970716]]So in the absence of those feedback inhibitory activities, you might actually hypothesize that there would be an enhancement of the feed forward response when that feed forward response is characterized by an unpredictable stimulus or prediction error.
[[start:1970828][end:1978952]]And so we sought to test this out using the simple sensory prediction paradigm where we have a tone stimuli.

32:59 [[start:1979116][end:1984580]]These tone stimuli could either be repeated or occasionally there could be an oddball stimulus.

33:07 [[start:1987240][end:2002920]]And what we would expect is that there would be enhanced feedback predictions when stimuli were repeatable and predicted, and that the occasion of an oddball would signal an enhanced gamma feed forward signal.
[[start:2003500][end:2015900]]So we performed the auditory stimulation task, both in the awake state as well as after there was an administration of propofol leading to loss of consciousness.

33:36 [[start:2016240][end:2035536]]And here's what we found in the local state, just as we found in the visual cortex for an unpredictable visual stimulus, as in the visual cortex, so in the sensory cortex, my PhD student Sophie Shang, who performed this analysis, found an enhanced gamma.
[[start:2035648][end:2037888]]So right at the time of the local oddball.
[[start:2037904][end:2047956]]So we have time here on the x axis frequency on the y axis, and spectrogram hot colors mean more activity to an unpredictable stimulus.

34:07 [[start:2047988][end:2054928]]So there was an enhanced gamma response to this unpredictable stimulus, decreased alpha beta to the unpredictable stimulus.
[[start:2054964][end:2059768]]Or set another way, when the stimulus was predicted, there was more alpha beta.
[[start:2059864][end:2067264]]And here's what happened in the anesthetized state when we performed this exact same contrast, we lost the.
[[start:2067302][end:2071324]]Predictable alpha beta signal and instead everything was enhanced.
[[start:2071372][end:2077068]]So there was a decrease in frequency towards the low gamma range.

34:37 [[start:2077244][end:2096232]]So the cortex just essentially went into a constant ringing in the gamma frequency range, which to our surprise was much stronger in power compared to the gamma that we saw being enhanced during an unpredictable stimulus in the awake state.
[[start:2096366][end:2111052]]And the way we interpret this is that in the absence of this inhibitory predictive alpha beta signal, this gamma signal becomes uncontrolled and enhances itself in the local anesthetized state.
[[start:2111106][end:2115230]]Here in area TPT is a sensory area, should have mentioned that.
[[start:2115600][end:2119148]]So now to conclude, we propose predictive routing.
[[start:2119244][end:2137728]]So predictive routing is a neurophysiologically inspired implementation of predictive coding, which stresses the importance of these alpha beta signals for implementing predictions and inhibiting sensory areas and areas of the brain that are experiencing a predictable stimulus.

35:37 [[start:2137824][end:2142772]]In the absence of that, you get an enhanced feed forward gamma output.
[[start:2142916][end:2159660]]And this distinction between gamma and beta across layers we found was ubiquitous across cortex, really suggesting that something like this may in fact be truly a canonical circuit motif that's repeated across the brain.
[[start:2160640][end:2174156]]And these alphabetarhmic predictive preparation or inhibition we found, we observed was lost in the unconscious state, with unconsciousness being mediated by propofol.
[[start:2174348][end:2188080]]By the way, it's one of the most often used anesthetics, and that as a result of this loss of predictive alpha beta, there was an enhanced gamma modulation to these unpredictable inputs.
[[start:2188240][end:2193200]]In other words, the sensory cortex was in a disinhibited state.

36:33 [[start:2193370][end:2205836]]And so with that, I'd like to thank my many collaborators and the Bostos lab at Vanderbilt, as well as collaborators on the anatomy and collaborators at MIT, as well as my financial support.

36:46 [[start:2206018][end:2223728]]And lastly, we just started the lab about two years ago, we're still in recruiting stage, so you guys can check out my website, my ex Twitter feed, and email me if interested in contributing to this line of research.
[[start:2223894][end:2227392]]And so with that, I'll turn it over in case there are any questions.
[[start:2227526][end:2228880]]Thank you for your attention.

37:10 _Daniel:_
[[start:2230040][end:2230790]]Awesome.

37:11 [[start:2231160][end:2243530]]Thank you andre, I'll just ask one quick question from the chat, dave Douglas asks, does propofol change the activity of neuronal microtubules in any interesting way?

37:29 [[start:2249480][end:2250496]]Thanks Andre.
[[start:2250608][end:2260730]]I'll just ask one question from the chat Dave Douglas asks, does propofol change the activity of neuronal microtubes in any interesting way?

37:42 _Andre:_
[[start:2262780][end:2290256]]I haven't looked into the microtube kind of hypothesis, that's one of the hypotheses advocated for many years by people like Stuart Hammerhoff, and there has been some recent work done by George Masure, I believe, and so you should go check out some of his papers on that topic, but I haven't looked into that.
[[start:2290358][end:2309240]]And I remain somewhat skeptical to the quantal explanation for consciousness, but mostly because the mechanism doesn't appear at first glance to be very biologically reasonable.
[[start:2309900][end:2317016]]And also that there's essentially not very much data on it, but that may change in the coming years.
[[start:2317118][end:2319770]]So something to look out for.

38:40 _Daniel:_
[[start:2320400][end:2321052]]Great.

38:41 [[start:2321186][end:2342530]]One other question more generally, how do you see experimental work in the active inference ecosystem, and how do you see the synthesis of theoretical and in principle, work with this kind of real wet lab and real recordings on the neurons type analysis that you're doing here?

39:03 _Andre:_
[[start:2343220][end:2345280]]Yeah, so it's a great question.
[[start:2345350][end:2353088]]I think that what we need to be doing as a community is having more interactions between theorists and experimentalists.
[[start:2353184][end:2367192]]And so we wouldn't have performed, for example, this experiment here if we hadn't already been inspired by biological and theoretical models of predictive coding and of active inference as well.
[[start:2367246][end:2395512]]And so that's really what we need, is to make not only hypotheses that are turned into great theoretical and computational infrastructures and models, but we also need to be thinking about if we care about the biology and we care about trying to figure out the brain, then we should also be trying to map those things onto neurobiology and psychology.

39:55 [[start:2395676][end:2396004]]Right?
[[start:2396042][end:2420712]]And so that involves them both considering the neurobiological elements that may implement and mediate active inference in the brain, as well as the psychological and cognitive constructs that we think are going to be particularly sensitive to capture certain elements of the theory.

40:20 [[start:2420856][end:2440752]]And so I remain very welcoming to that type of and in fact, there's going to be a postdoc joining the lab soon, eli Sinesh, who has been working very deeply in the active inference community.
[[start:2440886][end:2457216]]And so we'll have an opportunity there to both work on theory guided data analysis, but also perform more theoretically guided experimental designs that can go further into the neurobiological implementation.
[[start:2457328][end:2475844]]And so this was here what I've presented really simply the first and small, somewhat step towards linking the neurobiological implementation level with the algorithmic and computational level of predictive coding and active inference.

41:15 [[start:2475892][end:2485184]]And so the more interactions that we can have between the communities, the better that will be.

41:25 [[start:2485302][end:2504976]]I think what would be somewhat of a shame is if the active inference community went way too far into just pure theory and delved into increasing areas that were divorced from the biology.
[[start:2505168][end:2527500]]So that's, of course, one of the great critiques, right, of the deep learning and more machine learning, purely machine learning driven approaches, is that they took a little bit of biological inspiration, but then started using algorithms like Backprop that were very biologically unrealistic.
[[start:2527840][end:2532652]]And so, of course, active inference is a response to that in certain ways.
[[start:2532786][end:2543084]]But in order to continue being that, I think that there needs to be indeed a tight dialogue between experimentalists and theorists.

42:23 [[start:2543132][end:2546356]]And so if you have any particular ideas, I'd be happy to hear them.

42:26 [[start:2546378][end:2558820]]Please reach out to me by email or through X, which you can find here on the slide.

42:39 _Daniel:_
[[start:2559660][end:2560680]]That's really cool.
[[start:2560750][end:2561272]]That's awesome.
[[start:2561326][end:2563204]]You're going to be working with Eli.

42:43 [[start:2563252][end:2564312]]And one final question.
[[start:2564366][end:2566040]]This is from Alexandra.
[[start:2566460][end:2573820]]Is it possible to detect the contribution of Glia to the neural firing rate of the field potentials?

42:55 _Andre:_
[[start:2575760][end:2579470]]That is a question that I have not considered yet.
[[start:2580240][end:2590316]]So we normally do not consider Glia to be active in the network, but of course, that is likely to be an oversimplification.

43:10 [[start:2590428][end:2593036]]We know that they can have interactions with neurons.
[[start:2593148][end:2601380]]We know that they can also have different levels of excitability, and of course, that's how they can regulate neurons metabolically.
[[start:2601960][end:2616040]]But as far as the contributions of Glia directly to the local field potential, I am not aware of how to determine whether or not they make a significant contribution.

43:38 [[start:2618140][end:2621032]]I actually haven't seen any work on that.
[[start:2621086][end:2622570]]But thank you for the question.
[[start:2623180][end:2635612]]It's always good to reconsider our core assumptions, right, about the cell types that are most important to capture.
[[start:2635756][end:2637952]]So certainly something to think about.

43:58 [[start:2638006][end:2638816]]Thank you.

43:58 [[start:2638998][end:2639680]]Thank you.
[[start:2639750][end:2640160]]All right.

44:00 _Daniel:_
[[start:2640230][end:2641244]]Thank you, Andre.
[[start:2641372][end:2642304]]Super cool work.
[[start:2642342][end:2643648]]And good luck with everything.

44:03 [[start:2643814][end:2649580]]Till next bye.
