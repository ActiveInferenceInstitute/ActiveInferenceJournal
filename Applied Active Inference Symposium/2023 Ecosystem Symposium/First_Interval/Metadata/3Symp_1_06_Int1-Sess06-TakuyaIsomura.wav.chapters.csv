1210	42760	00:01	All right. Greetings, Takuya. You can mute the live stream or turn off the other live stream. Well, we have a little bit 35 or 38 minutes, so it would be awesome to have your presentation.	You can mute the live stream or turn off the other live stream	Takuya Miyamoto's presentation
45500	88476	00:45	Great. Thank you for organizing this wonderful symposium. Can you see my screen? Perfect. So shall we start? Yes. Then.	Great. Thank you for organizing this wonderful symposium	Symposium
88588	1403220	01:28	Today I'd like to talk about relationship between canonical neural network and active inference. Possible extension for modeling social and shared intelligence using canonical neuralNetwork. Free energy principle is proposed by Karl Friston that states that perception, learning and action of all biological organisms are determined to minimize variational free energy.	Free energy principle of active inference can be applied to neural network optimization	Inverse relationship between canonical neural network and active inference
1404710	2008916	23:24	And next we consider whether the scientific plasticity followed the free energy principle. We show that this biologically plausible neural network model with moderation of heavy and plasticity can solve some sort of delayed reward task like maze task. And then we discuss a possible extension to this framework to the modeling social intelligence.	Free energy principle can predict qualitative self organization of subsequent neural data	Free Energy principle of brain plasticity

Or is he saying merely that it was shown that there is plasticity. Cool. I think that answers it.	Dave says Takuya used phrase after plasticity was established	Dopamine and its plasticity
2107460	2229780	35:07	One direction is the modeling of social interaction, which is much rich architecture than the interaction between the static environment. We are excited with modeling those phenomena using biologically plausible neural network model through this equivalence. People should check out Live Stream 51, where you and I talked a few other times. There's a lot there.
