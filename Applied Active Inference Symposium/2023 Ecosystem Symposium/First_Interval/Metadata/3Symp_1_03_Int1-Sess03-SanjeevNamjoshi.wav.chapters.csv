Hello everyone, and thank you for being here.	Sanjeev Namjoshi is a machine learning engineer working at AI firm	Developing Next-Gen Active Inference Tools
47310	203370	00:47	Sanjeev Namjoshi is a machine learning engineer working at the AI services firm Kung Fu AI. He is working exclusively on an active inference textbook and related tools. He wants to provide greater accessibility, visibility, and knowledge of active inference and the free energy principle.

The increased accessibility for researchers would lead to many new industry applications.	The active inference field has seen a number of important milestones in recent years	The state of Active Inference
439960	551640	07:19	The textbook is divided into four parts. The first part introduces fundamental concepts to set the stage. The second part focuses on continuous and discrete state space formulations of active inference. Part four is a systematic literature review that covers all the various applications and extensions to active inference that have been innovated in the last six to eight years.

There's a large focus on building an intuitive understanding of the concepts. Margins also provide further explanation to accompany the text.

942860	1024100	15:42	Next, I'd like to cover and shift my attention toward Jupyter notebooks and videos. Notebooks will be released on GitHub and should be fully reproducible using Docker and other version handling tools. I also plan to create detailed code walkthrough videos that walk through the different examples.	Next, I'll discuss Jupyter notebooks and videos	Projects 6, Jupyter notebooks and the textbook
1026280	1168288	17:06	Future resources include a software suite in Python to enable an alternative learning approach for those who do not wish to learn about the algorithms from scratch. I'm also very much interested in interactive learning. If you would like access to the textbook and related materials, please send an email requesting access.	I'm working on a few planned future resources for Bayesian mechanics	Future resources planned
1168454	1177440	19:28	And that's all I have for today. All right. Thank you, Sanjeev.	All right. Awesome. Thank you very much for joining us today	A Minute With Sanjeev
