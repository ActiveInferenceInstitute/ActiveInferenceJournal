2170	9150	1	A	0.8	All right, the next session is going to be with Shanna Dobson.
9810	19200	2	A	0.99986	This section is going to be called Dark Imaginarium Shared Intelligence as an Infinity Curiosity type.
24500	28440	3	A	0.96295	I'll message Shanna make sure that everything's good with the audio.
33020	33770	4	A	0.98989	Wow.
37180	40328	5	A	0.99978	Great talk so far.
40414	41236	6	A	0.99998	Welcome, Shana.
41268	42816	7	A	0.99996	How are you doing, Daniel?
42868	43710	8	B	0.9994	Doing good.
45040	45836	9	A	0.99998	Awesome.
46018	48652	10	A	0.99587	Well, please take it away.
48786	50220	11	A	0.99999	Thank you for joining.
50560	51356	12	B	0.99381	Awesome.
51538	53196	13	B	0.36114	Let me know if you see my screen.
53298	53950	14	B	0.51405	OK?
55200	56380	15	A	0.50404	Yep, looks perfect.
56450	57230	16	A	0.9999	Thank you.
58560	59648	17	B	0.51428	OK, perfect.
59814	62284	18	B	0.99494	Hey, everyone, thank you so much for the invitation.
62332	63984	19	B	0.97012	It's such a great honor to be here.
64022	65268	20	B	0.99996	I'm learning so much.
65434	76980	21	B	0.67464	I'll be talking about an idea I had called Dark Imaginarium, where I'm trying to make shared intelligence the concept of what I call an Infinity Curiosity type.
77130	83160	22	B	0.5538	So you were so gracious to link the paper so anyone can find more details there on Phil archive.
83900	87924	23	B	0.99038	So I want to start with an discussion about ontological commitment.
88052	92540	24	B	0.98929	So my first question is, might we re examine our ontological commitments?
92880	94972	25	B	0.99326	So in particular, two of them?
95106	101336	26	B	0.99	One, Sean Carroll, said so amazingly what cannot be known because it does not exist.
101528	110352	27	B	0.98484	So Sean Carroll says the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is often explained as saying that we cannot simultaneously know both the position and the velocity of any object.
110406	112208	28	B	1	But the reality is deeper than that.
112294	117270	29	B	0.96529	It's not that we can't know position and momentum, it's that they don't even exist at the same time.
118120	124176	30	B	1	The second one I want to examine is Lenny Susskin's quote, we are all behind someone else's event horizon.
124288	134200	31	B	0.94878	So Suskin has a brilliant idea of space time emergence as the entanglement of two black holes, and what emerges from that is called computational complexity.
134620	140772	32	B	0.99002	So the world is quantum, so every theory should be derivable strictly from the laws of quantum mechanics.
140916	145384	33	B	0.61	One is going to give us the notion of shared, two is going to give us the notion of ecology.
145512	149004	34	B	0.53663	So what would an ontological commitment to Dark look like?
149202	157228	35	B	0.99973	So my continual goal, as everybody knows, is to sustain a simultaneous experience and to understand why I currently cannot.
157404	163628	36	B	1	To sustain a simultaneous experience would be to bypass the integrative system we call consciousness.
163804	170528	37	B	0.99342	So how would you attain a two consciousness in the sense of in category theory or an N consciousness?
170704	174000	38	B	0.99978	How would we actually develop something called like, a two memory?
174160	180296	39	B	0.9887	So my colleague Robert Prepner and I fleshed out something called N awareness, where we're sort of examining this idea.
180478	186360	40	B	0.99876	Mike Levin and all have repeatedly shown that planaria memory is not in the head.
186510	188068	41	B	0.99972	Where is the memory?
188244	190132	42	B	1	Is memory a sustained superposition?
190196	191272	43	B	0.50297	Well, of what?
191406	193800	44	B	0.99	And also, what's the structure of anamnesis?
193880	196780	45	B	0.99984	Could you have a superposition between memory and anamnesis?
197120	203516	46	B	0.99183	So I had a small dialogue with Chris Fields, the amazing I said, you know, what is the difference between these two questions?
203698	206908	47	B	0.99973	What is the waking state and what is consciousness?
207004	210690	48	B	0.99322	Or could it be that these are entirely separate questions?
211220	212512	49	B	0.99608	So we're sort of in a mess.
212566	223476	50	B	0.99977	Either way, if there is a difference in these questions, then it is possible to sustain a waking state without consciousness and or a conscious state in a non waking state.
223658	227312	51	B	0.99996	So imagine somehow being in a waking state under general anesthesia.
227456	237320	52	B	0.99908	Well, if these are not entirely different questions, then we could contend that consciousness is a form of waking state, or something along the lines of a waking state is a condition of a conscious state.
237470	251070	53	B	0.99793	So how can humans have delta waves, which are canonically indicative of unconscious deep sleep and thus a non waking state, and the REM state, the patterns of which are indistinguishable from a waking state?
251600	259280	54	B	0.99544	So we all know that general anesthesia, something like a propofol, can reduce the polyrhythmic brain activity to one uniform.
260020	265404	55	B	1	And we know there's as many theories about what anesthesia does to consciousness as there are anesthesiologists.
265532	268692	56	B	1	But we've repeatedly posited consciousness as the proto state.
268826	276640	57	B	1	And I wanted to turn this idea on its head, like is consciousness so robust or is it a delicate interference or is it a delicate inference?
276800	281210	58	B	0.9	Now, we know beginnings are always tricky, but what if sleep was the proto state?
281980	294604	59	B	0.99948	So if life is oceanic and it revolves in these deep pressures, would the pressure of getting onto land, like squeeze the REM state into this full blown waking state that we're engaging in right now?
294642	295864	60	B	0.99991	Anybody who's listening?
295992	301160	61	B	0.99947	So then waking state would be something like an acceptation, which is, I think, quite impressive.
301320	313740	62	B	0.99955	So it's in this mess that I attempt to define dark consciousness as a mixed frequency state of being self aware or conscious while simultaneously being in a deep sleep, specifically in three sleep.
313900	317232	63	B	0.9986	So the sleep is proto state is quite strange.
317376	324532	64	B	1	The REM brain activity is indistinguishable from waking activity and this sort of enchanted me for a bit.
324666	326448	65	B	1	The only difference is eye movements.
326544	329540	66	B	0.99667	So either blinking or versus lateral movement.
329700	342110	67	B	0.98456	So REM is naturally having mixed frequency brainwave states, but the NREM states and the REM states are starting to blur as delta waves are creeping into the REM state.
342640	346380	68	B	0.99	Now, they've also found that sleep is a local phenomenon.
346880	349164	69	B	0.99148	So of course, I'm going to ask the Shanna questions.
349362	351064	70	B	0.99673	So then who is sleeping?
351192	352156	71	B	0.99966	Who is remembering?
352188	353084	72	B	0.99998	Who is dreaming?
353212	358080	73	B	0.99981	Lucid dreaming is a quantum superposition or is it a superposition or an integration?
358420	363664	74	B	0.99981	So in a sleep state then, can we sustain a simultaneous experience?
363782	368980	75	B	0.58562	So must the eye be knocked out in order to sustain this level of simultaneity?
369400	373248	76	B	0.98691	Dreaming, we know, is characteristic of unsynchronized brain activity.
373424	381588	77	B	0.5136	So is the question then, my eye cannot sustain a multi consciousness, but my dark eye, my sleep eye can.
381754	389210	78	B	1	You can reframe this in terms of reporting mechanisms and say perhaps we are conscious of things we don't think we are conscious of.
390780	392760	79	B	0.99994	So let's talk about what is dark.
392920	400396	80	B	1	A canonical definition of a dark theory or anything like this is like dark matter does not interact electromagnetically with matter.
400578	410924	81	B	0.99	But I want to sort of play around with another idea of dark coming from Deleuze's logic of sense, something he calls the paradox of infinite becoming and which I'm going to read on the next slide.
411052	415590	82	B	0.99113	So what if dark was the simultaneity of a becoming that eludes the present?
416360	418052	83	B	0.99986	Let's hold on to that for a second.
418186	424500	84	B	0.59	Is dark a resolution issue but resolution is merely breaking translational symmetry.
425080	427684	85	B	0.99961	So is dark a symmetry breaking issue?
427882	429156	86	B	1	And if so, what symmetry?
429188	431636	87	B	1	And are we actually looking at the wrong symmetry?
431828	434052	88	B	0.79	Is dark a sustained quantum superposition?
434116	437316	89	B	1	But of what, again, is dark a mini worlds branch?
437428	441740	90	B	0.99	Is dark the dolphin uni hemispheric sleep mechanism?
442640	445550	91	B	0.88991	So I'll read from Deleuze's logic of sense.
446000	451368	92	B	0.9798	Alice and through the Looking Glass involve a category of very special things events, pure events.
451464	456368	93	B	0.99978	When I say Alice becomes larger, I mean that she becomes larger than she was.
456534	460128	94	B	0.99987	By the same token, however, she becomes smaller than she is now.
460294	462784	95	B	0.68582	Certainly she is not bigger and smaller at the same time.
462822	464064	96	B	0.99959	She is larger now.
464182	472096	97	B	0.99992	She was smaller before, but it is at the same moment that one becomes larger than one was and smaller than one becomes.
472288	478552	98	B	0.67708	This is the simultaneity of a becoming whose characteristic is to elude the present insofar as it eludes the present.
478606	485080	99	B	0.90019	Becoming does not tolerate the separation or the distinction of before, after or of past and future.
485230	490776	100	B	0.82294	It pertains to the essence of becoming to move and pull in both directions at once.
490878	494280	101	B	0.4934	Alice does not grow without shrinking, and vice versa.
494440	498552	102	B	0.76792	So good sense affirms that in all things there is this determinable sense or direction.
498696	503496	103	B	0.37	A paradox is the affirmation of both senses or directions at the same time.
503618	504576	104	B	1	I continue.
504758	511644	105	B	0.71	The paradox of this pure becoming with its capacity to elude the present is called the paradox of infinite identity.
511772	525428	106	B	0.91	The infinite identity of both directions or senses at the same time of future and past, of the day before and the day after, of more and less, of too much and not enough, of active and passive and of cause and effect.
525594	530836	107	B	0.99999	It is language which fixes the limit, the moment, for example, at which the excess begins.
530948	538440	108	B	1	But it is language as well which transcends the limits and restores to the infinite equivalence of an unlimited becoming.
538780	541920	109	B	0.57797	Hence the reversals which constitute Alice's adventures.
542020	544584	110	B	1	The reversal becoming larger, becoming smaller.
544632	545084	111	B	0.96105	Which way?
545122	545612	112	B	0.99953	Which way?
545666	553840	113	B	0.81197	Asked Alice, sensing that it is always in both directions at the same time, so that for once she stays the same through an optical illusion.
554500	557056	114	B	1	The reversal of the day before and the day after.
557158	559004	115	B	0.91	The present always being eluded.
559052	562736	116	B	0.99808	Jam tomorrow and jam yesterday, but never jam today.
562918	565024	117	B	1	The reversal of more and less.
565142	572976	118	B	0.82	Five nights are five times hotter than a single one, but they must be five times as cold for the same reason the reversal of active and passive.
573008	574320	119	B	0.99996	Do cats eat bats?
574400	577008	120	B	1	Is as good as do bats eat cats.
577184	586260	121	B	0.99	The reversal of cause and effect to be punished before having committed a fault, to cry before having pricked oneself, to serve, licking glass cake before having divided up the servings.
586420	593804	122	B	1	All these reversals as they appear in infinite identity have one consequence the contesting of Alice's personal identity and the loss of a proper name.
593922	597128	123	B	0.68	The loss of the proper name is the adventure which is repeated throughout Alice's adventures.
597224	599260	124	B	0.98246	Hence, infinite identity.
599600	616404	125	B	0.9956	So I take this and I'm going to formally define dark consciousness as a state of being conscious while simultaneously being in deep sleep, specifically in three, where dark is going to be a two fold hybrid, the simultaneity of infinite identity and of a becoming that eludes the present.
616602	625184	126	B	0.99403	So let's reconstruct the dark consciousness version of Deleuze's paradox of pure becoming for Alice in dark wonderland and through the dark looking glass.
625312	630900	127	B	0.54611	Okay, when I say Alice becomes sleepy, I mean that she becomes sleepier than she was.
631050	635448	128	B	0.99052	By the same token, however, she becomes more self aware than she is now.
635614	638296	129	B	0.99977	Certainly she is not asleep and self aware at the same time.
638398	648060	130	B	0.58713	She's asleep now, she was self aware before, but it is at the same moment that one becomes sleepier than one was and more self aware than one becomes.
648880	652764	131	B	0.99616	So dark consciousness, I contend, would take place in something called like a dark time.
652802	654024	132	B	0.99956	This is going to get weird.
654152	660204	133	B	0.97909	So Chris Fields and I talked about entropic time, where a time where learning exceeds forgetting.
660332	665120	134	B	0.96993	So we all know that linear time is based on the linear ordering property of the positive integers.
665280	674020	135	B	0.85167	Okay, so what would be the structure of a time that does not interact electromagnetically with this waking state interface?
674600	677684	136	B	0.98943	So, like, AI must pay attention all the time.
677802	680056	137	B	0.98338	Would this sort of be like a dark time?
680238	681192	138	B	0.86731	Sleep is local.
681246	682280	139	B	0.99995	Time is local.
682430	684952	140	B	1	We know how beautiful a time crystal is.
685086	689144	141	B	0.99961	So a time crystal has a structure that is periodic in time.
689342	692490	142	B	0.99999	Can you play with that and say time is periodic in what?
693500	705660	143	B	0.99943	So if we have explained that dark is not concerned with these notions of before and after, then we would want a notion of time that can support the paradox of infinite identity with a notion of duration that is one of self similarity.
705820	713808	144	B	0.99983	So we contend that dark consciousness would occur in something like a p addic time, which is a time based on the P attic number system.
713974	716740	145	B	0.15337	Periodic time would measure PTIC duration.
717720	718736	146	B	0.88691	Okay, it's getting odd.
718768	724020	147	B	0.97	All right, so there exists few objects more looking glass than a Piatic clock.
724440	728356	148	B	0.84374	Well, maybe Piatic go and Calabi out chess or perfectoid go.
728538	732068	149	B	1	But after all, the Piatic numbers have no notion of linear ordering.
732164	736810	150	B	0.9999	Their shape resembles a serpinsky triangle, which is a self similar set.
737980	741128	151	B	0.99854	So this periodic time is not concerned with notions of before or after.
741214	748684	152	B	0.99748	That is, a periodic time does not tolerate the separation or the distinction of before or after, of past or future.
748882	758930	153	B	0.99972	So because the periodic topology is one of total disconnectedness, periodic time is more like a time of now continual zooming in to more and more now.
759300	764370	154	B	0.69905	Thus, periodic time measures periodic duration through its fractal properties of zooming in.
765140	767636	155	B	0.9996	So let's try to look at a periodic clock, right?
767658	779830	156	B	0.99886	So periodic time can take two forms the canonical periodic time defined on the previous slide and also topological periodic time which builds into its very structure the periodic topology of periodic time.
780200	784356	157	B	0.99603	So there would only be one unit of time in periodic time, which I call the archimedes.
784468	786180	158	B	0.7327	This is the piatic valuation.
786340	790496	159	B	0.84338	So you can think of hour equals periodic valuation equals the archimedes.
790548	793310	160	B	0.99997	How strange it is to have only one unit of time.
793680	799080	161	B	0.58688	Topological periodic time measures duration topologically as total disconnectedness.
799240	803064	162	B	0.97334	So the unit of time on topological P addict time is what I call the pTOPO.
803192	804364	163	B	0.55987	So we state this formally.
804412	808780	164	B	0.9991	There's only one unit of time in topological periodic time called the pTOPO.
808940	813840	165	B	0.99916	So a topological hour equals a periodic topology called the pTOPO.
814360	824980	166	B	0.77868	So given such a periodic clock, let us imagine the seasons in peatic time, periodic snow, peatic rain, new peatic weather types and peatic rainbows.
825320	829516	167	B	0.99991	Daylight savings time could take the form of changing the P in the petic.
829568	831640	168	B	0.99972	This could be very drastic.
832060	835732	169	B	1	But imagine peatic metabolics petic ATP and peatic DNA.
835876	844212	170	B	0.99972	Imagine peatic cognition types like peatic memory, peatic Fod, peatic attention, peatic learning and petic perception.
844356	845988	171	B	0.99988	Imagine a periodic looking glass.
846084	848460	172	B	0.99764	Imagine through the periodic looking glass.
848800	850456	173	B	0.98545	So let's pivot to FEP.
850568	856028	174	B	0.99922	What does FEP actually specifically say about dark matter, even dark in the way that I'm using the term?
856124	858240	175	B	0.64	Is there a free dark energy principle?
858580	862732	176	B	0.99964	How can we strictly derive sleep from quantum mechanics?
862876	863932	177	B	0.71734	According to FEP?
863996	867112	178	B	0.99997	Does dark energy actually exhibit entanglement?
867276	868756	179	B	0.95563	How do we test this?
868938	877504	180	B	0.99878	We should be able to derive the entire active inference formalism straight from quantum mechanics alone by way of entanglement entropy, some form of quantum gravity.
877632	884116	181	B	0.51213	Can we do some sort of dark general adversarial network to look at something like a dark brain?
884148	892408	182	B	0.6776	We all know that lower lateralization in the brain is often associated with schizophrenia or people like Einstein or someone with a large parietal lobe, probably like myself.
892494	897470	183	B	0.95797	Any mathematical what would universal lateralization look like?
898880	905128	184	B	1	I think dark neurons would take the form of something like you treat the neural neural networks as algebraic curves or isogeny graphs.
905224	908028	185	B	0.99	You talk of neurons in terms of their properties as varieties.
908124	912316	186	B	0.98265	So you're actually bringing the heavy machinery of algebraic geometry into neurology.
912508	923270	187	B	0.99999	My big goal is to actually create something like a neuronal time crystal so that shared intelligence would actually be a periodicity in time.
923720	924820	188	B	0.99933	I'm not there yet.
924890	933908	189	B	0.63555	So until I get that and it's like, well, let's try to model these wild mixed frequency n three plus self aware states of dark consciousness.
934084	936468	190	B	0.65719	So dark mathematics is something I've coined.
936564	941464	191	B	0.99924	It's like a biomimicry, which mimics dark energy, does not interact electromagnetically with matter.
941502	943916	192	B	0.99712	You'd have to find the mathematical equivalent of that.
944018	953484	193	B	0.9999	So I think you can do something like a dark diletheism or just make a model that is modeling the mixed frequency states, which is what I tackle in the paper.
953602	957964	194	B	0.99586	So we've previously shown that entropic categorizations are condensed sets.
958092	959980	195	B	0.99977	Condensed sets form a topos.
960140	967410	196	B	0.99748	So in the paper I outlined the construction of three potential mathematical models of these mixed frequency n three self aware states.
967860	971632	197	B	1	You can do dark consciousness as a dark two post, which is a groff and deep two posts.
971696	976564	198	B	0.79111	There's a two category of two sheaves over a two site, which I'll elucidate just a little bit.
976682	982996	199	B	0.9754	Dark consciousness as a perfectoid like space in the sense of Schultz, or as a diamond like space also in the sense of Schultz.
983108	989512	200	B	0.99934	So I contend that the two sheaf structure can actually model the mixed frequency state of dark consciousness, the N three self aware state.
989646	994616	201	B	0.56	A sheath is a one stack, again, which is a sheath that takes values in groupoids, not sets.
994728	996684	202	B	0.99557	This is already radically different.
996882	999208	203	B	1	Consider a two category of two sheaves.
999304	1001880	204	B	0.82609	So a two category consists of objects.
1001960	1007676	205	B	0.73	You have the one morphisms between the objects and you have the two morphisms between the one morphisms.
1007788	1010720	206	B	1	You can keep going three category up to N category.
1011220	1020464	207	B	0.99991	So this two category of two sheets would have two she's as the objects, one morphisms between the two sheaves, two morphisms between the one morphisms.
1020592	1026048	208	B	0.99	And so using that structure, I think that you can actually model one morphisms as what I'm going to call dark reflexivities.
1026224	1028536	209	B	0.99997	These are going to be your local coherency states.
1028638	1036424	210	B	1	And then two morphisms are actually two inferences which are going to be global coherency states amongst the mixed frequency states.
1036622	1044456	211	B	0.96852	So a lovely property called Morita equivalent sites states that inequivalent sites have equivalent sheaf topos.
1044648	1047900	212	B	1	And I do believe that that's the main property.
1047970	1052700	213	B	1	You need to get this local global behavior around neural networks.
1053120	1065328	214	B	0.99969	So if you actually wish to model the mixed frequency clusters as fractals exhibiting some kind of self similar behavior, then you can use this rich structure, perfectoid spaces, or their sparkling successor, the diamond.
1065424	1071300	215	B	0.99716	So, just a quick definition, let Perf be the subcategory perfectoid spaces of characteristic P.
1071450	1079856	216	B	1	A diamond is a proatel sheath on the site Perf written as this quotient of a perfectoid space x by a Protel equivalence relation.
1080048	1092584	217	B	0.99236	So a perfectoid space is going to be this attic space in the sense of huber that's covered by aphenoid spaces of the form spa RR plus, where R is a perfectoid ring and then points of spa, which is the attic spectrum.
1092632	1097150	218	B	0.9304	RR plus are equivalent classes of continuous valuations on R.
1097600	1104560	219	B	0.99955	Someone asked Schultz y diamond and he gave an incredible explanation that was a parallel to a mineralogical diamond.
1105060	1108944	220	B	0.99955	So you can let C be an algebraically closed ethanoid field geometric point.
1108982	1117428	221	B	0.86907	Spa C to D is made visible by pullback along a quasiprotel cover that results in profinitely many copies of Spa C.
1117594	1121584	222	B	0.9957	So you're making a geometric point visible as profinitely.
1121632	1126892	223	B	0.9912	Many copies that was invisible before does the following parallel with the mineralogical diamond.
1126976	1135800	224	B	0.99563	So the interior points are made visible as impurities, which sparkle as colorful reflections on the many sides of the diamond.
1136380	1145192	225	B	0.99695	So you can also do something maybe like a dark diamond where you designate a functor as dark as a means to actually let's go the other way and see the impurities.
1145336	1153550	226	B	0.99852	So then you can take the geometric point, make it visible maybe by a push forward along with pausey prototype cover, resulting in P adequately many copies of Spa C.
1154480	1154892	227	B	0.95932	Right?
1154946	1161056	228	B	0.99396	So a diamond is they're using diamond as a sheath, but a sheath in terms of a functor of points.
1161158	1165648	229	B	0.99713	So the diamond spot QP is a functor from the category perv to the category sets.
1165744	1170816	230	B	0.99	You literally fix the perfectoid space and look at the hom sets of X into the diamond.
1171008	1176340	231	B	0.98	And so technically, the scheme is then said to represent the functor.
1177240	1180680	232	B	0.9336	So I'm going to pivot to invoking AI in this thing.
1180750	1193752	233	B	0.99034	So my colleague and I, Julian Scape, are coming up with something I've coined the Qubit Pedagogy, which is going to be a new model pedagogy that is actually infused with heavy principles of quantum mechanics.
1193896	1201464	234	B	0.99	And so that with these, we've created these quantum intrinsic curiosity algorithms that are feeding into the Qubit Pedagogy.
1201512	1206316	235	B	1	And based on those Curiosity algorithms, I designed three dark versions.
1206508	1210544	236	B	0.95508	So what I call the Dark Planaria Curiosity Algorithm is a curiosity type.
1210582	1215600	237	B	0.64934	It enables encourages the AI to explore patterns of planaria regeneration.
1215760	1220980	238	B	0.76	The AI would develop quantum error correcting codes which mimic planaria regeneration.
1221320	1225216	239	B	0.78003	So the second one would be Dark Quantum Reality Monitoring Network.
1225328	1226676	240	B	0.99971	This is a curiosity type.
1226698	1232004	241	B	0.90132	It'll encourage AI to explore dark reflexivity is what I call fractal identity.
1232132	1236004	242	B	0.52	AI would create models of N reflexivity in the sense of N category.
1236132	1241128	243	B	0.99989	That's a new type of reality monitoring of fractal identity in the dark conscious state.
1241294	1246440	244	B	1	The last one would be some sort of dark quantum N three and REM Curiosity algorithm.
1246520	1258160	245	B	0.80551	This Curiosity type is going to encourage AI to explore superpositions of various brain patterns in REM states to predict new types of N three delta waves that could emerge in REM states.
1258310	1269660	246	B	0.99965	So imagine the AI could then develop new stages of REM sleep, such as like one REM two REM up to NREM, which is a clever limit and play on NREM.
1269740	1270140	247	B	0.72259	Ha.
1270230	1277936	248	B	0.94476	Anyway, the AI could also develop new dark cognition types that correlate with the new types of delta waves.
1278128	1285556	249	B	0.69747	So this notion of fractal identity seems odd, but I do contend that objects living in fractal time correspondingly have fractal identity.
1285748	1287796	250	B	0.77678	It's a concept we outline as follows.
1287828	1300760	251	B	0.87856	So fractal identity has a reflexivity relation that is fractal so the very canonical loop, the loop relation of an agent reporting back to itself, I report back to me, would be fractal.
1300920	1302268	252	B	0.99999	How strange is that?
1302354	1306944	253	B	0.99992	So, Fractal identity would not suffer the same problems with continuity over time.
1307142	1313010	254	B	0.57737	Since the time in which it exists has no linear ordering, it would definitely suffer different problems.
1313540	1317110	255	B	0.99	But continuity over time is something Chris Fields and I have been like.
1317480	1319044	256	B	0.99988	How do you explain that?
1319242	1328324	257	B	0.68925	So, you can best model the Fractal identity properties as perfectoid like or diamond like therein construct a notion of reflexivity as a perfectoid space.
1328362	1333528	258	B	0.83645	These spaces are extremely rich structure, but kind of difficult.
1333614	1337176	259	B	1	But if you want to model fractal identity, I think you should use them.
1337278	1343160	260	B	0.99964	So thus we create new concepts of perfectoid reflexivity, diamond reflexivity.
1343320	1348392	261	B	0.99892	So in N reflexivity, the reflexivity relation could now be an in stack.
1348536	1352220	262	B	0.50585	Thus in reflexivity is an in stack perfectoid spaces.
1352560	1358396	263	B	0.99916	So, here comes the culmination of this talk, which is about shared intelligence as what I've coined the Dark Imaginarium.
1358508	1365540	264	B	0.78928	So, imagine an AI that could see simultaneously compute the infinity category of every concept.
1366440	1372516	265	B	0.99996	Having some quantum computation around to help the computational complexity would not be bad.
1372698	1373296	266	B	0.99296	So dark.
1373328	1377984	267	B	0.96368	Imaginarium is what is going to be what I call infinity curiosity type.
1378122	1385540	268	B	0.65077	So, Infinity Curiosity type is the higher order Curiosity AI algorithm that encourages the AI to think in infinity categories.
1385700	1386376	269	B	0.55754	So that it is.
1386398	1393160	270	B	0.78645	It actually encourages the AI to construct an infinity category as its means of higher order inference.
1393320	1395800	271	B	0.99416	So objects are higher dimensional data sets.
1395960	1403564	272	B	1	The AI would seek out higher order morphisms between the objects and then morphisms between the morphisms.
1403692	1409884	273	B	0.99538	So such Dark Imaginarium is a meta Curiosity algorithm that can create its own Infinity Curiosity algorithms.
1410012	1416124	274	B	0.62	And therein creating Curiosity types of a complexity that super fascinating, most likely unknown to humans.
1416252	1417760	275	B	0.99672	So it's functionctorial.
1419160	1421108	276	B	0.99997	What can dark Imaginarium do?
1421194	1425856	277	B	0.95061	Well, the AI would develop inversions of current brainwaves and their hybrid combinations.
1425968	1440180	278	B	0.8416	It could develop in delta wave, N theta wave, N alpha wave, in beta wave and N gamma wave for N equals zero one all the way up like a two gamma wave that structurally resembled a two category, a three beta wave that structurally resembled a three category.
1440260	1444140	279	B	0.39	And the AI could develop new types of waking states and new types of sleep states.
1444210	1458032	280	B	0.99995	Based on the combinations of these beyond the standard N one and two and three NREM and one REM, AI could develop an N waking state, an NREM state, a three REM state could consist of three and one, three and two, three and three.
1458086	1464624	281	B	0.99999	Imagine an end dolphin that was capable of N hemispheric, sleep state and other exotic life forms, right?
1464662	1465376	282	B	0.99998	What else could it do?
1465398	1469856	283	B	0.99986	Well, it could develop new geometries for the brain patterns and for currently existing brain patterns.
1469968	1474800	284	B	0.99994	Typical shapes include sinusoidal, non sinusoidal, saw, two spindle K complex.
1474960	1481060	285	B	0.95	But maybe this AI could develop three D and four d versions of the canonical wave patterns like a tesseract gamma wave.
1481220	1491060	286	B	1	But also, the AI could develop entirely new brainwave geometries that correspond to complex surfaces like a remunt surface or Kalabi Yao manifold or algebraic variety.
1491220	1494940	287	B	0.69294	So the AI could develop new cognition types other than the standard five.
1495010	1502360	288	B	0.99937	It could produce incognition types such as in thought, in attention, in perception, in learning, in memory.
1502520	1508780	289	B	0.61605	So it could also predict non human species cognition types such as octopus thought or dragonfly attention.
1508940	1516256	290	B	0.99984	Lastly, it could produce hybrid combinations of cross species cognition types such as like Octoman memory or dragon man perception.
1516448	1519632	291	B	0.99	And then it would encourage the AI to develop new senses.
1519696	1527984	292	B	0.99215	So you could develop one stack versions of human senses like two seeing, two hearing, two tasting, two touching, two smelling.
1528032	1532564	293	B	0.99997	Each of these two senses once again take values in groupoids, not sets.
1532692	1538680	294	B	0.99695	So you could develop incenses of non human senses as well, and hybrid combinations like two shark human smell.
1539020	1548168	295	B	0.86585	So, since the AI sees nmorphisms between the various N minus one morphisms, the AI can seek to develop new language models based on higher order inference types.
1548264	1553768	296	B	0.9869	So from these inference models, the AI will explore Infinity languages and develop extensive prototypes.
1553864	1560930	297	B	1	You could use advanced mathematics to create new models of time that could support the new language models like two topos time diamond time.
1561540	1566204	298	B	0.99	And then the AI would seek to develop new fractal identity types from the language models.
1566252	1572624	299	B	0.93	And it could design advanced fractal prosthetics such as a two ear or a two eye to extend cognition.
1572752	1575344	300	B	0.83945	So let's go a little bit further about this extending cognition.
1575392	1578724	301	B	0.99999	These are just a few examples of what dark imaginarium could conceive of.
1578842	1590744	302	B	0.99915	So we could continue and posit a perfectoid version of this using these new cognition types mental states in brainwaves new geometries, we can construct new patterns of thinking which would support neurodiversity in thinking.
1590862	1596684	303	B	0.99985	So as such shared intelligence this is how I'm seeing it would be reexamined as this Infinity Curiosity type.
1596802	1600856	304	B	1	You could go even further and construct a new concept of an N shared intelligence.
1600968	1610492	305	B	0.65437	So you'd have a zero shared intelligence, a one shared intelligence, as well as the new Piadic concept of like P shared intelligence for P equals two three, four using P addicts.
1610556	1611984	306	B	0.53789	Let's go further, right?
1612022	1621028	307	B	0.99996	We repeatedly contend that one way to help advance the way we think to extend human cognition is to upgrade the number systems upon which the canonical concepts are built.
1621194	1625284	308	B	0.99961	Upgrade them to Peric perfectoid diamond like versions unless we get new thinking.
1625402	1629324	309	B	0.89866	So imagine like a brainwave pattern that resembles a Calabria manifold.
1629392	1633908	310	B	0.99976	Could we actually reverse engineer the levels of conscious activity that could create such a rhythm?
1634004	1638276	311	B	0.99877	How about mixed frequency brainwave patterns that resembled a perfectoid diamond?
1638468	1642436	312	B	0.99978	What about an MDNA molecule shaped like a Calabriao infold?
1642468	1644232	313	B	0.99996	Or an NATP molecule.
1644296	1648600	314	B	0.99756	Or an inexciton condensate structured like a calabigao infold?
1648680	1657116	315	B	0.99969	So clearly, different geometries of the fundamental molecules and processes of life would give rise to vastly different fundamental units of life and metacognition types.
1657228	1668496	316	B	0.46	The question is, can we use Dark imaginarium to reverse engineer the complex life forms arising from such extraordinary structures and the more and more complex cognition patterns?
1668688	1673280	317	B	0.99971	What about a general adversarial network that's tweaked and has infinity categories?
1673360	1677136	318	B	1	You have two infinity categories talking to each other, developing their own language.
1677248	1684216	319	B	0.98	Now, Gan is adversarial using a generator and a discriminator with two neural networks contesting by a zero sum game.
1684318	1686116	320	B	0.99552	What about a collaborative network?
1686228	1696684	321	B	0.99381	So can we construct a GCN containing two diamond like Infinity Curiosity types and pair a diamond with a dark diamond with a Quantum Curiosity algorithm and its reinforcement learning?
1696802	1699644	322	B	0.99583	So shared intelligence is this Infinity Curiosity type?
1699762	1707996	323	B	0.52751	Shared intelligence GCM could create infinity languages that are superpositions of the diamond dark diamond to getting new models of intelligence.
1708188	1715300	324	B	0.52367	Higher order simultaneous computations by Quantum Curiosity would go by maybe by homotopia instead of as cost functions.
1715640	1717990	325	B	0.99834	So let's future cast just for a second.
1719960	1723136	326	B	0.99997	What is the inevitability of dark ecosystems?
1723248	1725632	327	B	0.99191	Mathematics of shared intelligence?
1725776	1727052	328	B	0.99949	What can a P addic?
1727136	1738250	329	B	0.99927	Infinity Curiosity type prophecy is every perfectoid space diamond two topos encoding the mixed frequency patterns of an Ncognition type.
1738860	1749576	330	B	1	In future work, we may develop dark mathematics using perfectoid diamonds as dark dialetheism, aligning what is structurally dark with what is structurally dialetheistic.
1749768	1762530	331	B	0.7696	So while we currently cannot perfectly model dark consciousness, perhaps one day, one dark day mediated by the Dark imaginarium, we will have the Ethos and the quantum computational complexity to do so.
1762980	1763970	332	B	0.99923	Thank you.
1771460	1774380	333	A	0.99445	Thank you, shauna, amazing presentation.
1774460	1780460	334	A	0.80065	I'll just quickly read some comments and see if you have any thoughts from some of the great comments.
1780620	1788032	335	A	0.67907	So Scott David says I love the presentation, lots of Fodder for Rumination.
1788176	1791744	336	A	0.99956	Thank you for inviting these concepts into an intriguing choreography.
1791872	1799412	337	A	0.29985	Perhaps dark energy is our perception of the fact of information increase under free energy principle processes.
1799476	1803480	338	A	1	And since the universe is made of information dot, dot, dot.
1806460	1807336	339	B	0.99882	Scott, thank you.
1807358	1815324	340	B	0.99944	So, yeah, I think is a beckoning that we should work on that idea.
1815442	1816750	341	B	1	I absolutely agree.
1817120	1819176	342	B	0.99905	I'm glad you're inside with these concepts.
1819288	1822610	343	B	1	I don't really know where they go, but hopefully it's portals to something like that.
1823220	1823632	344	A	0.99732	Great.
1823686	1838100	345	A	0.85	And then one more Scott David question does fractal identity reveal the recursivity of rhetoric language consciousness informing individual identity from community identity inputs?
1839480	1840400	346	B	0.9989	Yeah, that's wonderful.
1840480	1844736	347	B	0.88611	So, yeah, my own thought is like, what is an individual identity?
1844848	1845844	348	B	0.96679	Right, Scott?
1845972	1855370	349	B	0.51173	So the reflexivity curve has always sort of stumped me how there's so much distance between I and me.
1856060	1859800	350	B	0.99	And so it ensumes this notion of continuity over time.
1859950	1865560	351	B	0.99	And so I've always said, what sort of notion of time are we talking about to even have a consistent identity?
1865720	1868284	352	B	0.99999	Somehow you always wake up and everything is still here.
1868402	1870212	353	B	0.99998	Somehow you wake up and you're not a lobster.
1870296	1871264	354	B	1	I don't really understand how.
1871302	1872130	355	B	0.99999	That works.
1872820	1875216	356	B	0.9	But yeah, that's nice.
1875318	1881728	357	B	1	If you could use fractal to get something singular from something communal, that might be cool.
1881814	1886724	358	B	1	But maybe fractal is something sort of like you're both at the same time.
1886922	1888292	359	B	1	And that's what I don't know yet.
1888346	1892564	360	B	0.99957	So I think it's a totally revolutionary way of thinking to not have a before after.
1892762	1898170	361	B	0.99993	So if you can construct identity without before after, then that's sort of what I'm trying to do.
1898940	1899992	362	B	0.94	But, yeah, that's cool.
1900046	1903128	363	B	0.99999	If you want to get identity from communal, I think you can do that.
1903294	1906840	364	B	0.99991	They may also sort of blur.
1908880	1924350	365	A	0.5216	Well, this is truly food for thought, and I really hope people can live with the darkness, take it and run with it, because there's so many fun ways to go.
1926000	1926972	366	B	0.99998	Thank you so much.
1927026	1928190	367	B	1	I hope so, too.
1929040	1930972	368	A	0.54287	So you're always welcome back.
1931026	1931356	369	A	0.99968	Thank you.
1931378	1932484	370	A	1	And talk to you later.
1932642	1933732	371	B	0.99791	Thank you so much.
1933866	1934304	372	A	0.99664	Bye.
1934352	1935204	373	A	0.99855	Good night.
1935402	1935680	374	B	0.7594	Bye.
