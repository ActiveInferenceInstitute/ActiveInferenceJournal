6720	8350	2	B	0.99992	Hello and welcome, everyone.
8720	14376	3	B	1	This is the third applied active inference symposium enacting ecosystems of shared intelligence.
14488	17564	4	B	0.99993	It is August 22, 2023.
17762	26456	5	B	0.99997	We have a lot of really awesome presentations and sessions coming up in the first interval and in the second interval.
26568	30212	6	B	0.99996	So let's just get right into it with our first talk.
30266	32112	7	B	0.99997	This will be by Andre Bastos.
32176	36230	8	B	0.99452	So, Andre, thank you for joining and looking forward to your talk.
37640	39152	9	A	0.99981	Thank you very well, Daniel.
39216	44324	10	A	1	And thank you for the other organizers of the Active Inference Conference and Symposium here.
44442	48120	11	A	0.95879	I'm glad to be talking to you guys today about my work.
48270	60360	12	A	0.55	The title of the presentation is multilaminar Multi Area Recordings and the Non Human primate that's these guys right here, macaque monkeys, suggest that predictive coding is implemented via predictive routing.
60520	62812	13	A	1	And so what do we mean by these things?
62866	90740	14	A	0.99995	Well, just as a point of introduction, I'd like to start by just saying that I started out working with Karl Friston in about 2010, and we were really interested in trying to map the neurobiology of the predictive coding circuits that have been theorized and hypothesized onto cortical laminar architecture, which you can see here.
90890	103320	15	A	1	And in that work with him, we proposed that different layers and different oscillations were involved in either capturing and calculating prediction error or predictions.
103660	112360	16	A	0.98	And so what we do in my lab and I recently started as an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at Vanderbilt.
112520	125120	17	A	0.98	And so what we do is we train rhesus macaque monkeys on tasks which are more or less predictable and that have different sensory elements that are more or less predictable, and we'll get into what that looks like.
125270	135296	18	A	1	And then we use multilaminar probes, so high density probes with dozens or hundreds of contacts that can record across different layers.
135328	143680	19	A	1	And so this is a beautiful drawing here of what the layers look like of Cortex by Santiago Ramoni Cajal over 100 years ago.
143770	147204	20	A	1	And you can see this really beautiful layered architecture.
147252	150376	21	A	0.99982	Layer 1234 is this dense one.
150398	154972	22	A	0.99999	In the middle five, you get these large pyramidal neurons, and then six on the bottom.
155106	159960	23	A	1	And so we're interested in my lab primarily at two levels of explanation.
160040	163964	24	A	1	The first is, what do these neurons spike to?
164002	167056	25	A	0.99996	What makes them fire action potentials and excites them?
167158	171728	26	A	1	And do they get more or less excitable depending on how predictable stimuli are?
171814	173916	27	A	1	And second, how do they oscillate?
173948	181308	28	A	0.89236	In which frequency bands does rhythmic activity tend to cause them to fire more or less action potentials?
181324	192452	29	A	0.76	And so we record across layers in one area over here, but we might put in our electrodes in several other areas so that we can also capture aspects of cortical communication.
192596	205332	30	A	1	And these oscillations in this communication, we think, is really intimately linked to the interaction between inhibitory cells, these cells in red here, and excitatory neurons, these cells in black that I've drawn.
205476	209596	31	A	0.9994	Okay, so without further ado, let's just dive right into it here.
209778	226140	32	A	0.99915	So here's the outline of my talk in part one we're going to be talking about first an overview of what do we actually mean by this predictive coding model and how do we think it may be mapped onto cortex and paying special attention to the neurophysiology.
226300	244560	33	A	0.99549	So here's the bird's eye overview of predictive coding at the level that maybe a neurobiologist or a cognitive scientist or a cognitive neuroscientist might need to know about in order to be able to apply it to their own work.
244730	252676	34	A	1	And so, here's what I mean by predictive coding, that there's a hypothesized circuit that is especially rich in higher order areas.
252708	270636	35	A	0.99806	So here's like the front of the brain, which learns about these statistical regularities of the world and creates predictions about what is going to be seen and felt and touched and so on in the next moment in time and in this moment in time, and sends those predictions to earlier parts of the brain.
270668	281356	36	A	0.99963	So, to lower order cortex receive these predictions and sensory inputs, the inputs coming from the eyes and ears and all of our sensorium is then compared to this top down prediction.
281468	285972	37	A	1	And if there's a mismatch, that's a prediction error and the prediction error is sped forward.
286106	296852	38	A	0.99944	It's a mismatch response and it can be used to drive models, drive these internal representations in order to be better over time and to make better predictions.
296996	305172	39	A	1	And in particular, these prediction errors are hypothesized to be housed in superficial layers of cortex.
305316	310664	40	A	1	And so that's a hypothesis that we've been able to test now with these laminar electrodes.
310792	320780	41	A	0.99979	So let's see how our experimental design worked in order for us to be able to look at the difference between predictable and unpredictable sensory stimuli.
320860	324444	42	A	0.99954	So we train monkeys on what's called a delayed match to sample task.
324572	331424	43	A	0.99173	It's a classic task of working memory, where monkeys are trained to fixate on the center of the screen.
331542	335040	44	A	0.98647	Then there's a visual stimulus, in this case a car stimulus that's shown.
335120	338800	45	A	0.99991	There's a brief delay in which that stimulus has to be held in working memory.
338880	343888	46	A	0.64702	Then the animal is tested on which of the three items was in working memory.
343984	353380	47	A	1	The animal makes a correct response when they saka, in this case to the upper left, to indicate that the car stimulus was last shown.
353540	361324	48	A	0.99824	So we then manipulated the predictability of this information that was to enter working memory in the following way.
361442	380544	49	A	0.99995	For 50 trials in a row, we would either keep the sample stimulus constant, so car, car, and that's being depicted by the a here, or in another context, there would be an unpredictable sampling regime where either the car orange or green could be sampled at any moment in time.
380582	385952	50	A	0.99997	So the animals went back and forth in being in a predictable context or an unpredictable context.
386016	395160	51	A	1	And then we asked the question, what does brain activity look like when the exact same stimulus is processed in a predictable regime versus an unpredictable regime.
395740	401796	52	A	1	And in order to do this work, we implanted these monkeys with multilaminar probes.
401828	409784	53	A	0.98476	So these are probes, again with these at that time that I did this work, about a dozen or so or maybe up to 32 contacts.
409832	414696	54	A	0.99862	Nowadays we can go into the several hundreds of contacts along a single probe.
414808	424256	55	A	0.9342	We can use MRI guidance in order to position those probes perpendicular to cortex such that they'll span each of the six cortical layers, layer one through six.
424358	427184	56	A	0.85976	Here you can see the white matter here below.
427382	444596	57	A	1	And then we sampled from different parts of both the visual cortex because, remember, those are the areas that might issue prediction errors in the case of an unpredictable sample as well as higher order cortex which has been hypothesized to create these internal models that then issue predictions.
444788	446248	58	A	0.99981	So here's what we found.
446414	451800	59	A	0.99994	We first just analyzed the multiunit activity which is a measure of the spike rate.
451870	457080	60	A	0.99992	So how many action potentials per unit of time are these neurons firing?
457160	465112	61	A	1	And what's being shown here is the multiunit activity as a difference between when that sample was unpredictable minus predictable.
465176	475308	62	A	0.99999	So positive activity means more activity during an unpredictable sample I-E-A violation of a prediction or a putative prediction error signal.
475404	491504	63	A	0.98	And all throughout the brain from V four, the sensory area all the way to these higher order frontal parietal regions we saw, without any exception that neurons were much more excitable when they were processing an unpredictable stimulus compared to predictable stimulus.
491632	499812	64	A	1	And also, not surprisingly, this started already at the feed forward sweep of activity such that these red bars here indicate the start of significance.
499876	504596	65	A	0.9988	So sure enough, area V four was the first to show significance.
504708	507520	66	A	0.99998	So more spiking to the unpredictable, over predictable.
507620	511180	67	A	1	And this activity fed forward up the cortical hierarchy.
512400	523472	68	A	1	Next, we looked not only at the firing rate of these neurons but also the local field potential which is informative about the local oscillatory activity that's present.
523526	537008	69	A	0.99998	So you can think of these oscillations as massive waves of activity that are synchronous across a large population of neurons but of course, are produced through the interplay between these recurrent inhibitory bouts of activity.
537104	538516	70	A	1	And so, here's what we found.
538618	546360	71	A	0.99999	We performed this power spectral analysis again comparing power in the unpredictable case versus power in the predictable case.
546510	548724	72	A	1	And we did a percent change metric.
548772	551044	73	A	0.99998	Very simple percent change metric.
551092	562424	74	A	0.99998	So again, what's shown here on the Y axis is in positive, more power to unpredictable samples and in the negative values, more power to the predictable samples.
562552	571592	75	A	0.99999	Now, what we saw in the gamma range so that's everywhere above about 30 or 40 Hz again in all areas very strongly mirrored what we saw in the spiking activity.
571656	578940	76	A	0.8136	Namely, that there was more of this high frequency and also the classic low range frequency in the gamma range.
579020	585664	77	A	0.99848	So in both the low gamma and high gamma ranges an enhancement of power during the unpredictable cues.
585792	588016	78	A	0.97343	That was also the case in the theta band.
588048	600292	79	A	0.63	And this makes somewhat sense from the point of view of neurophysiology that this theta frequency and this gamma frequency, they very often track one another and do similar things in cortex.
600356	601832	80	A	0.99999	Why exactly that is the case?
601886	608920	81	A	0.99999	We actually don't know what the reason for that is, but that's an observation that we've seen in many other tasks.
609080	622028	82	A	0.9997	But what we saw in between the theta and the gamma bands was this other band at between ten to about 20 or slightly higher in frequency, this classic alpha beta band.
622124	629504	83	A	1	And this alpha beta band, this alpha beta band acted in the exact opposite way.
629622	633616	84	A	0.99988	Namely, there was more power to predictable samples than to unpredictable samples.
633648	634768	85	A	0.93243	With one exception.
634864	636944	86	A	0.99523	Area seven A was an exception.
636992	646916	87	A	0.99996	It did have that canonical pattern in the alpha band, but in the low beta band, it was actually similar to gamma.
646948	650916	88	A	1	And we think that this might be a working memory update mechanism.
651028	663100	89	A	0.99989	But for now, we are really stressing and emphasizing the fact that across all of these areas, you had this beta signal that was stronger to the predictable case, to the predictable sample.
663520	666936	90	A	0.99873	Okay, so next we had these laminar electrodes.
666968	677244	91	A	0.99991	So let's look at the difference between what these neurons are doing when you record from the so called superficial layers of cortex versus the so called deep layers of cortex.
677372	679840	92	A	0.5572	So the superficial layers are layers two, three.
679990	682788	93	A	1	The deep layers are these layers five and six.
682954	685940	94	A	0.71523	These superficial layers, they are the layers that feed forward.
686010	700756	95	A	0.99998	So remember from that introductory slide that these are the layers that were hypothesized based on predictive coding theory to house the prediction error neurons, because according to theory, those prediction error signals are sent in the feed forward direction.
700788	712044	96	A	0.79362	So we then tested that in a second way, which was to test whether or not those enhanced signals during unpredictable samples are more present in layer two, three.
712162	714236	97	A	1	And that's exactly what we found in V four.
714338	725728	98	A	0.99997	So when we again take this spiking signal and subtract unpredictable, minus predictable spiking, we see that the signal is more enhanced in superficial layers of D four.
725814	731488	99	A	0.99999	There was a trend towards that in PFC as well, but in D four, it was a significant observation.
731664	740980	100	A	1	And furthermore, when we now look at the LFP gamma power, this power in the 40 to 90 Hz band, again, we do the power change.
741050	746260	101	A	0.99908	So these positive signals mean there's an enhancement of gamma power to the unpredictable signal.
746340	762860	102	A	1	And again, now in both V four and PFC, it's the superficial layers that are having more of this unpredictable signal again, and that's consistent with the theorized type of circuitry for these canonical circuits.
763520	786064	103	A	0.99982	Next, we were interested in whether or not these power changes were blankets across the board that just overall increase mu activity and GAM activity independent of the exact sample that was being shown or whether these signals were actually specific to the actual item that was being predicted.
786112	798244	104	A	0.99999	Because remember, in our task design, animals were for a large portion of time predicting that there should be a car stimulus or predicting an orange or predicting the green stimulus.
798292	812680	105	A	0.99965	So in that particular task requirement, it wouldn't make sense if task representations for all three stimuli all went up to an unpredictable stimuli that would be more consistent with just an overall arousal signal.
812760	822640	106	A	0.99991	But what we were next interested in is whether or not neurons that actually were selective for the car, if it was those neurons in particular that had the unpredictable signals.
823380	825984	107	A	1	And what we found is that that was indeed the case.
826102	840176	108	A	0.99886	So we performed the same analysis as before, LFP gamma power difference for unpredictable, minus, predictable, but now as a function of whether or not those neurons preferred the stimulus that was being predicted.
840288	846196	109	A	1	And what we found is that the preference actually modulated this gamma band activity very strongly.
846308	869484	110	A	1	And so this unpredictable signal change was more specific to neurons that actually preferred that predicted stimulus, indicating that this prediction was not acting as a blanket similar to an arousal mechanism, but was actually reaching down at the level of the representations that were specific to the thing that needed to be predicted.
869612	882640	111	A	1	And that was even more the case in the beta frequency range actually, where the neurons that didn't encode the predicted stimulus, they couldn't care less whether or not that stimulus was predictable.
882720	888944	112	A	0.87424	It was really only neurons that carried information about the stimulus that was being predicted.
888992	903370	113	A	1	Those were the neurons that were not enhancing but diminishing their beta during an unpredictable signal or said another way, enhancing their beta to a predicted signal change.
904620	906796	114	A	0.99994	So here's what we think is going on.
906978	911496	115	A	0.99996	We call this neurophysiological implementation that we found of predictive coding.
911528	939168	116	A	1	We call it predictive routing to make a semantic point, but also a slightly more neurophysiological and computational argument that we don't actually find strong evidence for this mismatch and prediction signal at the level of neurons, but instead we think that this prediction circuit exists but uses these oscillations in order to implement what is predicted.
939264	940484	117	A	0.99989	So here's how we think this works.
940522	949492	118	A	0.99997	So when a prediction matches a stimulus, as is being shown here, when you're predicting A and you get a stimulus A, then the A column.
949636	964968	119	A	1	In other words, it doesn't have to be a column, but the area of the brain or the neurons that encode A are going to become prepared to receive the stimulus A by enhancing the power of this alpha beta signal.
965064	975196	120	A	0.99993	So this top down beta from higher order areas we think prepares a cortical circuit to receive a predicted stimulus and it prepares that stimulus by enhancing that's.
975228	985670	121	A	1	This up arrow here, the alpha beta, especially in the deep layers, which can inhibit both the gamma and the spiking signal in the superficial layers as a result.
986920	1000120	122	A	0.99983	So this top down signal inhibits the superficial layers and as a result, there is decreased gamma and spiking and decreased feed forward output in the case of a predictable stimulus.
1001340	1008684	123	A	0.99	The case of an unpredictable stimulus, well, stimulus A, just like before, is still going to be coming in.
1008802	1020668	124	A	0.99999	But because it's not predictable, that column, that set of neurons that normally represents A, was not previously prepared by an alpha beta signal.
1020764	1033968	125	A	1	And so the alpha beta signal is relatively low in an unpredictable context, releasing the inhibition that the deep layers exert on superficial layers and as a result, causing more gamma, more spiking and more feed forward output.
1034064	1044868	126	A	0.74611	In other words, what we are hypothesizing here is that predictive coding and this error computation comes about as a failure in predictive inhibition.
1044964	1053540	127	A	1	And as a result of the lack of these mechanisms being in place during an unpredictable stimulus, there is an enhanced gamma output.
1053620	1058168	128	A	1	And that's what we call a prediction error, or that's what we interpret as a prediction error.
1058344	1066628	129	A	0.99989	So here's the predictive routing model one more time in a predictable stimulus, top down inputs prepare the column to receive a stimulus.
1066744	1070236	130	A	0.71449	That preparation leads to inhibition, less feed forward output.
1070348	1077040	131	A	0.99998	In an unpredictable case, those mechanisms aren't in place, as a result, more feed forward gamma output.
1077700	1078784	132	A	0.99992	So that's part one.
1078822	1088560	133	A	0.79336	That's our cortical neurophysiological hypothesis then, that we call predictive routing of how we believe predictive coding is implemented in the brain.
1088720	1105176	134	A	1	And next I want to turn to a little bit more about how these rhythms are actually produced in the brain, because one of the things that we noticed from just placing our laminar electrodes into cortex is that independent of where we put our probe.
1105208	1108696	135	A	0.99996	So here's an example of prefrontal cortex activity.
1108808	1116420	136	A	0.99998	We would see these high frequency gamma waves and superficial layers and slower frequency alpha beta waves in these deep layers.
1116600	1125980	137	A	1	And you can do this analysis very easily and quickly to reveal this, what we call spectrolaminer pattern.
1126140	1139680	138	A	1	And what this is, is simply dividing each contact on the probe, dividing the power that you observe at that contact by the maximum, by the contact with the maximum power along the probe.
1139760	1148948	139	A	1	And what this does is it normalizes power such that a value of one is the layer that had the most power at that particular frequency band.
1149044	1152036	140	A	1	And so, if you look here on the x axis, this is frequency.
1152148	1157512	141	A	0.99997	So these red colors are tracking which particular layer has more power at that frequency.
1157576	1162984	142	A	0.99997	So you see more of this low and high gamma power in the superficial layers.
1163032	1170960	143	A	0.99998	So that's above zero on the y axis and more of this alpha beta activity in the deeper layers of the cortex.
1172020	1185088	144	A	0.96	And so in a large scale survey of cortex, together with Bob DeSimone's Lab and Diego.
1185184	1190368	145	A	0.98	And so I did this partially while I was at MIT, when I was a postdoc with Earl Miller.
1190384	1191236	146	A	0.92	And I continued this.
1191258	1192928	147	A	0.99911	Now at Vanderbilt.
1193024	1198484	148	A	0.9807	So this was a really cross institutional study and involved multiple labs.
1198532	1207784	149	A	1	And the reason that that was important is that most labs specialize in being a prefrontal cortex lab, or a V four lab, or an lip lab, et cetera.
1207912	1217724	150	A	1	And relatively few investigators had actually done the necessary work to be able to record with these laminar probes in multiple areas simultaneously.
1217852	1230324	151	A	1	And so, therefore, by coordinating and pooling data from multiple experiments, we were able to record from a total of 14 areas in this study that we have now in review.
1230522	1240176	152	A	1	And what we found was that independent of the area, we found a spectral laminar pattern that was highly conserved across areas.
1240288	1250004	153	A	1	And so here it is from zero to 150 Hz for area V four in the sensory cortex, seven A in parietal cortex, prefrontal cortex in the front of the brain.
1250132	1260780	154	A	0.84167	Everywhere we looked, we found that there was this enhanced gamma power in these red lines here in superficial layers, and enhanced alpha beta power in the deeper layers.
1262400	1275340	155	A	0.88	And what we then turn to next is, first of all, well, let's really confirm at a histological anatomical level that it's really these layers.
1275500	1279660	156	A	0.99997	Is it layer one, is it layer two, is it four that expresses gamma?
1279820	1281408	157	A	1	And the same question for beta.
1281424	1290544	158	A	0.87395	Let's really confirm that that is in fact the case, because it seemed like a very prominent hypothesis and a very prominent observation.
1290592	1292730	159	A	0.99997	We wanted to really confirm it.
1293180	1296376	160	A	0.99437	So that's the first part of this, part two.
1296478	1305336	161	A	1	And then we're going to get into which specific mechanisms might generate these oscillations and how does that inform computational modeling?
1305448	1313688	162	A	0.98	And so then this was work done in my lab at Vanderbilt, led by a very talented undergraduate student, actually, Max Lichtenfeld.
1313864	1317032	163	A	0.99	And so we performed these histological reconstructions.
1317096	1330412	164	A	0.99843	Here's the probe, an example probe where we performed these tiny electrolytic lesions in particular areas while we were recording here's the overlay of the laminar boundaries.
1330476	1332740	165	A	0.99991	So in red here, this is layer four.
1332890	1348456	166	A	1	And then, of course, we had the electrophysiology so we could look at the gamma power, gamma relative power, the beta relative power, and the point at which they cross over, actually, we determined was pretty consistent in layer four.
1348638	1352920	167	A	0.76	And of course, then we also mapped on the other features of these things to the layers.
1353900	1367630	168	A	1	And so here's what we found is that the crossover, the point at which the gamma profile in red and the beta profile in blue, the point at which they cross over, at which their powers are equal, that tended to land in layer four.
1367940	1375970	169	A	1	The peak gamma power tended to land in layer two or three, and the peak beta power tended to land in layer five or six.
1377220	1388736	170	A	1	And so we mapped these distances between these different electrophysiological signatures or distinct profiles to the different layers.
1388768	1404360	171	A	1	And we did this for several different probes and for several different animals until we were able to get a very nice distribution here, which confirmed that indeed, the gamma beta crossover is consistent with being at laminar position zero.
1404430	1413724	172	A	0.99999	We called the middle of layer four, whereas this gamma is at the boundary between layer two, three and beta at the boundary between layer five and six.
1413922	1418784	173	A	1	And so here is our current toy model of what we think is going on.
1418902	1444200	174	A	0.69414	So we think that there's different inhibitory neurons that are interacting with their excitatory cell partners to generate fast frequency gamma activity in the superficial layers and in turn that there is another type of interneuron that is generating with slower time constants this alpha beta rhythmic activity.
1445180	1460060	175	A	0.99962	So in order to examine this, we again turn to anatomy, we again turn to this question, well then, which exact inhibitory neurons are most prominent therefore in the layers that express these different frequencies?
1460480	1476844	176	A	1	And in order to perform this work, what we did is we quantified the laminar expression of three distinct interneuron subtypes that are known to account for over 90% of the inhibitory interneurons in the primate brain.
1476972	1484656	177	A	1	And those inhibitory neuron subtypes are parvalbumin positive calretin, calbindin positive.
1484768	1502116	178	A	1	And importantly, previous computational modeling work had really singled out the parvalbumin cell class as the critical class for generating these gamma oscillations because of their fast time constants and strong synapses onto the cell bodies of excitatory neurons.
1502308	1529148	179	A	1	And so again we perform this painstaking histological analysis where you perform different stains, mounting cover, slipping microscopy, semiautomated thresholding and cell counting in order to be able to then really have a quantitative view on which layers have which cell types that are most associated with these frequencies.
1529324	1531604	180	A	1	And so here's what this data then looks like.
1531642	1545210	181	A	0.99999	We have the gamma and alpha beta electrophysiology here, and then at the same time we have the presence of different neuron types with the three inhibitory cell classes here.
1545660	1553684	182	A	0.67	And then we can perform an analysis to determine which of these cell classes is most strongly associated with the gamma.
1553812	1578956	183	A	1	And here's what we found that in both the low gamma and the high gamma across over 14 regions, what we found quite significantly was that it was really the parvalbumin cell counts shown here as a function of laminar depth that were giving us the best explanation for the laminar profile of the gamma rhythmic activity.
1579068	1587990	184	A	1	Both when you take a very wide band as well as when you perform a low versus high gamma split, it comes out in both ways.
1589640	1593428	185	A	0.99621	So how can this inform computational models of oscillations?
1593524	1596250	186	A	0.96442	Well, here's what we think is going on then.
1596620	1609016	187	A	0.99966	We collaborated with several people here on this work, including Sanchez Toto et al and computational modelers in Spain.
1609128	1617404	188	A	0.99	And what we did was we performed an analysis where we took different interneurons with different types of connectivity.
1617452	1631472	189	A	0.99995	So these PV, these parvalbumin interneurons were modeled as having strong inhibitory connections to the pyramidal cell class and strong self inhibition, which has been important for gamma oscillations previously.
1631616	1645156	190	A	1	And when you hook them up in these particular ways, sure enough, and you measure the spectral output of these neurons, these p two neurons, superficial parameter neurons, sure enough, they express gamma.
1645268	1656780	191	A	1	And when you put in different types of interneurons with slower time constants and different types of connections to these deep layer neurons, sure enough, they come out with more alpha beta oscillations.
1657680	1676524	192	A	0.99982	So indeed, this anatomical work could produce even more in the future, even more accurate models of how these interneurons work together and with parameter cells across different layers in order to express these oscillations.
1676572	1696120	193	A	0.99986	So this is really a work in progress and one of the first steps towards this and our ultimate aim is to really pull together this rich anatomical and neurophysiological data together with computational models to be able to approximate the laminar structure of cortex to a better and better degree.
1699420	1707816	194	A	0.99969	This next part here, I'll talk a little bit about a causal test now of the predictive routing model with propofol anesthesia.
1707848	1710190	195	A	0.98851	So this will be the last part of the talk here.
1711280	1713608	196	A	0.99	And so we were interested in anesthesia.
1713704	1732704	197	A	1	I got interested in anesthesia actually through my work and contact with Jake Donahue over here, who is a very talented MD PhD student at MIT at the time and was being co mentored by Emory Brown and Earl Miller, who was also my mentor.
1732832	1736740	198	A	0.98	And so we became interested in this topic for the following reason.
1736890	1761656	199	A	0.9651	Well, first of all, as surprising as this may seem, if you go into a surgical clinic and you're administered an anesthetic such as propofol, well, it turns out that the anesthesiologist may not know exactly the cortical mechanisms and the systems level mechanisms for how that anesthetic is actually working in the brain.
1761768	1773968	200	A	1	And it's actually to this day remains more often than not the case that there's actually no intraoperative monitoring of brain state.
1774134	1778784	201	A	0.99725	It's far and few between the anesthesiologists that are actually doing that.
1778822	1793796	202	A	0.94	And so Emory Brown, who's an anesthesiologist himself, is really pushing for more and more adoption of simple tools like EEG and spectral estimation methods by the clinic.
1793908	1808712	203	A	0.99	And so our work was clinically motivated, but it was also motivated by the ability to test this predictive routing model when activity, especially in prefrontal cortex areas, is relatively silenced.
1808856	1823890	204	A	1	And so in these experiments, we administered propofol to again these rhesus macaques and we recorded brain activity there's, these local field potentials and spiking activity in the awake state as well as in the unconscious state.
1824340	1836710	205	A	1	And what we first noticed is that in the unconscious state, there were these slow rhythmic bouts of activity at about 1 cycle per second, or slightly little faster, a little slower than that.
1837240	1838704	206	A	0.99999	Those are the slow frequencies.
1838752	1855630	207	A	0.61	And these slow frequencies organize these massive bouts of spiking, which could sometimes be very synchronous across cortex, but that there were long periods of silence in between these bouts of spiking in the unconscious state.
1856400	1867420	208	A	1	And so propofol anesthesia, we found is accompanied by, again, these strong increases in slow frequency activity, which create alternating on and off periods for spiking.
1867840	1873852	209	A	0.84953	There's reduced spiking activity throughout the network, but the strongest reductions are in prefrontal cortex.
1873996	1877452	210	A	1	And sensory areas are relatively spared.
1877516	1884956	211	A	1	So they're still quite reduced in their excitability in the unconscious state, but prefrontal cortex is more inhibited.
1885148	1892208	212	A	0.99824	There is also, we found reductions in cross area synchrony and very pronounced reductions in the alpha beta band.
1892384	1901204	213	A	1	And so as a result, we thought we could actually use this model, this propofol anesthetic model, in order to test certain aspects of predictive routing.
1901252	1903176	214	A	0.99996	Because what's going on here?
1903198	1910140	215	A	0.99364	We have lower order cortex that's hypothesized to feed forward prediction errors to higher order cortex.
1911840	1916540	216	A	1	And in turn, these higher order areas might feed back their predictions.
1916900	1925580	217	A	0.99756	But as a result of propofol, these higher order areas are profoundly impaired and very reduced in their spiking activity.
1925660	1931724	218	A	1	And the alpha beta rhythm is also the synchrony between areas is highly reduced.
1931772	1933620	219	A	0.99981	So what's going to happen in this case?
1933690	1943524	220	A	0.99991	Well, if you think from the point of view of simply everything is going down, then sensory areas in a response to an unpredictable stimulus should also just go down.
1943642	1953236	221	A	0.99997	But if you think from a predictive coding or a predictive routing point of view, the function of these higher order areas is to create feedback predictions that inhibit activity.
1953348	1970716	222	A	0.99997	So in the absence of those feedback inhibitory activities, you might actually hypothesize that there would be an enhancement of the feed forward response when that feed forward response is characterized by an unpredictable stimulus or prediction error.
1970828	1978952	223	A	1	And so we sought to test this out using the simple sensory prediction paradigm where we have a tone stimuli.
1979116	1984580	224	A	0.997	These tone stimuli could either be repeated or occasionally there could be an oddball stimulus.
1987240	2002920	225	A	0.7	And what we would expect is that there would be enhanced feedback predictions when stimuli were repeatable and predicted, and that the occasion of an oddball would signal an enhanced gamma feed forward signal.
2003500	2015900	226	A	0.9998	So we performed the auditory stimulation task, both in the awake state as well as after there was an administration of propofol leading to loss of consciousness.
2016240	2035536	227	A	0.56	And here's what we found in the local state, just as we found in the visual cortex for an unpredictable visual stimulus, as in the visual cortex, so in the sensory cortex, my PhD student Sophie Shang, who performed this analysis, found an enhanced gamma.
2035648	2037888	228	A	0.96576	So right at the time of the local oddball.
2037904	2047956	229	A	0.81642	So we have time here on the x axis frequency on the y axis, and spectrogram hot colors mean more activity to an unpredictable stimulus.
2047988	2054928	230	A	0.61185	So there was an enhanced gamma response to this unpredictable stimulus, decreased alpha beta to the unpredictable stimulus.
2054964	2059768	231	A	0.99996	Or set another way, when the stimulus was predicted, there was more alpha beta.
2059864	2067264	232	A	1	And here's what happened in the anesthetized state when we performed this exact same contrast, we lost the.
2067302	2071324	233	A	0.94164	Predictable alpha beta signal and instead everything was enhanced.
2071372	2077068	234	A	0.99991	So there was a decrease in frequency towards the low gamma range.
2077244	2096232	235	A	0.86526	So the cortex just essentially went into a constant ringing in the gamma frequency range, which to our surprise was much stronger in power compared to the gamma that we saw being enhanced during an unpredictable stimulus in the awake state.
2096366	2111052	236	A	0.98	And the way we interpret this is that in the absence of this inhibitory predictive alpha beta signal, this gamma signal becomes uncontrolled and enhances itself in the local anesthetized state.
2111106	2115230	237	A	0.99987	Here in area TPT is a sensory area, should have mentioned that.
2115600	2119148	238	A	0.99732	So now to conclude, we propose predictive routing.
2119244	2137728	239	A	0.99992	So predictive routing is a neurophysiologically inspired implementation of predictive coding, which stresses the importance of these alpha beta signals for implementing predictions and inhibiting sensory areas and areas of the brain that are experiencing a predictable stimulus.
2137824	2142772	240	A	0.99998	In the absence of that, you get an enhanced feed forward gamma output.
2142916	2159660	241	A	1	And this distinction between gamma and beta across layers we found was ubiquitous across cortex, really suggesting that something like this may in fact be truly a canonical circuit motif that's repeated across the brain.
2160640	2174156	242	A	0.79	And these alphabetarhmic predictive preparation or inhibition we found, we observed was lost in the unconscious state, with unconsciousness being mediated by propofol.
2174348	2188080	243	A	0.99999	By the way, it's one of the most often used anesthetics, and that as a result of this loss of predictive alpha beta, there was an enhanced gamma modulation to these unpredictable inputs.
2188240	2193200	244	A	0.99964	In other words, the sensory cortex was in a disinhibited state.
2193370	2205836	245	A	0.98	And so with that, I'd like to thank my many collaborators and the Bostos lab at Vanderbilt, as well as collaborators on the anatomy and collaborators at MIT, as well as my financial support.
2206018	2223728	246	A	1	And lastly, we just started the lab about two years ago, we're still in recruiting stage, so you guys can check out my website, my ex Twitter feed, and email me if interested in contributing to this line of research.
2223894	2227392	247	A	0.99	And so with that, I'll turn it over in case there are any questions.
2227526	2228880	248	A	0.9998	Thank you for your attention.
2230040	2230790	249	B	0.9912	Awesome.
2231160	2243530	250	B	0.99981	Thank you andre, I'll just ask one quick question from the chat, dave Douglas asks, does propofol change the activity of neuronal microtubules in any interesting way?
2249480	2250496	251	B	0.99993	Thanks Andre.
2250608	2260730	252	B	0.96688	I'll just ask one question from the chat Dave Douglas asks, does propofol change the activity of neuronal microtubes in any interesting way?
2262780	2290256	253	A	1	I haven't looked into the microtube kind of hypothesis, that's one of the hypotheses advocated for many years by people like Stuart Hammerhoff, and there has been some recent work done by George Masure, I believe, and so you should go check out some of his papers on that topic, but I haven't looked into that.
2290358	2309240	254	A	1	And I remain somewhat skeptical to the quantal explanation for consciousness, but mostly because the mechanism doesn't appear at first glance to be very biologically reasonable.
2309900	2317016	255	A	0.78	And also that there's essentially not very much data on it, but that may change in the coming years.
2317118	2319770	256	A	0.99457	So something to look out for.
2320400	2321052	257	B	0.97128	Great.
2321186	2342530	258	B	1	One other question more generally, how do you see experimental work in the active inference ecosystem, and how do you see the synthesis of theoretical and in principle, work with this kind of real wet lab and real recordings on the neurons type analysis that you're doing here?
2343220	2345280	259	A	0.99977	Yeah, so it's a great question.
2345350	2353088	260	A	1	I think that what we need to be doing as a community is having more interactions between theorists and experimentalists.
2353184	2367192	261	A	1	And so we wouldn't have performed, for example, this experiment here if we hadn't already been inspired by biological and theoretical models of predictive coding and of active inference as well.
2367246	2395512	262	A	1	And so that's really what we need, is to make not only hypotheses that are turned into great theoretical and computational infrastructures and models, but we also need to be thinking about if we care about the biology and we care about trying to figure out the brain, then we should also be trying to map those things onto neurobiology and psychology.
2395676	2396004	263	A	0.75805	Right?
2396042	2420712	264	A	1	And so that involves them both considering the neurobiological elements that may implement and mediate active inference in the brain, as well as the psychological and cognitive constructs that we think are going to be particularly sensitive to capture certain elements of the theory.
2420856	2440752	265	A	0.98	And so I remain very welcoming to that type of and in fact, there's going to be a postdoc joining the lab soon, eli Sinesh, who has been working very deeply in the active inference community.
2440886	2457216	266	A	0.98	And so we'll have an opportunity there to both work on theory guided data analysis, but also perform more theoretically guided experimental designs that can go further into the neurobiological implementation.
2457328	2475844	267	A	0.98	And so this was here what I've presented really simply the first and small, somewhat step towards linking the neurobiological implementation level with the algorithmic and computational level of predictive coding and active inference.
2475892	2485184	268	A	1	And so the more interactions that we can have between the communities, the better that will be.
2485302	2504976	269	A	0.69	I think what would be somewhat of a shame is if the active inference community went way too far into just pure theory and delved into increasing areas that were divorced from the biology.
2505168	2527500	270	A	0.9999	So that's, of course, one of the great critiques, right, of the deep learning and more machine learning, purely machine learning driven approaches, is that they took a little bit of biological inspiration, but then started using algorithms like Backprop that were very biologically unrealistic.
2527840	2532652	271	A	1	And so, of course, active inference is a response to that in certain ways.
2532786	2543084	272	A	0.57436	But in order to continue being that, I think that there needs to be indeed a tight dialogue between experimentalists and theorists.
2543132	2546356	273	A	1	And so if you have any particular ideas, I'd be happy to hear them.
2546378	2558820	274	A	0.99698	Please reach out to me by email or through X, which you can find here on the slide.
2559660	2560680	275	B	0.79848	That's really cool.
2560750	2561272	276	B	0.99963	That's awesome.
2561326	2563204	277	B	0.99265	You're going to be working with Eli.
2563252	2564312	278	B	1	And one final question.
2564366	2566040	279	B	0.99994	This is from Alexandra.
2566460	2573820	280	B	0.9999	Is it possible to detect the contribution of Glia to the neural firing rate of the field potentials?
2575760	2579470	281	A	0.99981	That is a question that I have not considered yet.
2580240	2590316	282	A	0.99895	So we normally do not consider Glia to be active in the network, but of course, that is likely to be an oversimplification.
2590428	2593036	283	A	0.99995	We know that they can have interactions with neurons.
2593148	2601380	284	A	0.9998	We know that they can also have different levels of excitability, and of course, that's how they can regulate neurons metabolically.
2601960	2616040	285	A	0.99942	But as far as the contributions of Glia directly to the local field potential, I am not aware of how to determine whether or not they make a significant contribution.
2618140	2621032	286	A	1	I actually haven't seen any work on that.
2621086	2622570	287	A	0.99999	But thank you for the question.
2623180	2635612	288	A	0.9973	It's always good to reconsider our core assumptions, right, about the cell types that are most important to capture.
2635756	2637952	289	A	0.97088	So certainly something to think about.
2638006	2638816	290	A	0.99931	Thank you.
2638998	2639680	291	A	0.99917	Thank you.
2639750	2640160	292	A	0.99	All right.
2640230	2641244	293	B	0.99996	Thank you, Andre.
2641372	2642304	294	B	0.99995	Super cool work.
2642342	2643648	295	B	1	And good luck with everything.
2643814	2649580	296	B	0.82708	Till next bye.
