This, hopefully, would, we hope, allow us to gain some insights into the future states of Gaia.

This concerns how humans possess an innate cognitive disposition towards nature. But on the other hand we see the lack of action to protect the Earth. In the presentation I'm going to make my way slowly towards getting to that.	The relation of humanity to the natural world is essentially one of dependence	Understanding the dilemma of biophilia
304578	517410	05:04	The Gaia hypothesis is that 3.8 billion years that life has persisted on Earth and conditions have remained remarkably constant. The emphasis is not how one individual organism evolves or species evolves, but the whole Earth as a system. The Amsterdam Declaration on Earth system science precisely endorsed this view.	The Gaia hypothesis is a modification of the canonical Darwinism	The Gaia Hypothesis
518360	641320	08:38	 Gaia hypothesis offers glimpse of a fundamentally different way of thinking of the planet. Can be seen much more as a framework or a method of investigation rather than a falsifiable empirical claim. These particular frameworks should be judged by their usefulness and not by their purported correctness with usefulness.

642460	982470	10:42	The Fiang principle is a methodology to understand overserved patterns of behavior. It applies the free energy principle as the tool and methodology to analyze interdependent dynamics between living systems and planetary processes. The key point here is a balanced interaction between sensory and active states.

984040	1321620	16:24	The Gaia meets the requirements to be formalized as part of an active inference system. What we want is to have healthy, well adjusted adaptive systems and human behavior particularly that leads to the imbalance. We want to identify and develop interventions to rectify any potential maladaptive responses.	So now I want to apply the Fionergy principle to the Guy hypothesis	The Fionergy Principle and the Gaia hypothesis
1324680	1515490	22:04	A weakness of the free energy principle actually speaks in favor of its application to the Gaia hypothesis. The affordances are not determined solely by the physical properties of the environment, but also by the organism's goals, abilities and previous experiences. Any affordance whatsoever that we might think of that we have as living systems are afforded by the sun.	Raja and colleagues say Markov blanket does not capture all biological affordances	The Markov Blanket and the Gaia hypothesis
1516500	1906430	25:16	According to the frequencies principle, living beings have a natural tendency to act upon their environment to prevent dissipation of their integrity. If the free energy principle holds, then the observed contradictory behavior is a maladaptive state. Current lack of pro environmental behavior as a pathology of the human species that must receive treatment.	Free energy principle says living beings act upon environment in order to remain alive	Maladaptive Behavior of Human beings
1907280	2069980	31:47	Active inference can bring out or to overcome the climate crisis. If the free energy principle holds, then it seems that there is maladaptive behavior of the collective of the human species. I would really like to see more applied in the future for the climate Crisis and the Earth.	Active inference could be applied to climate crisis and Earth ecosystems	Active Inference in the Climate Crisis
