1690	2960	A	0.7583765983581543	Greetings in S.
6580	7330	B	0.5208580493927002	Hello.
8500	9250	A	0.7317204475402832	Welcome.
10500	11292	B	0.6762325167655945	Hi, Daniel.
11356	12210	B	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
13060	19260	A	0.9859002232551575	Yes, well, we're really looking forward to your presentation.
19340	22210	A	0.587436854839325	You can share your slides and go for it.
23060	23810	B	0.7671424746513367	Great.
31260	34250	B	0.8109061121940613	It can you see it?
35020	35624	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
35742	36472	A	0.9716436862945557	Looks great.
36526	37290	A	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
37660	38984	B	0.7395557761192322	All right, good.
39102	41768	B	0.9884728789329529	So thank you so much for having me.
41854	48732	B	0.9920825958251953	I'm really happy to present this paper today, and particularly because it's the very first time that I present this work.
48866	56190	B	0.9530941843986511	So I'm really looking forward to any feedback and any reactions to this work.
57440	73460	B	0.8405300378799438	OK, so the aim of this paper was to apply the free energy principle to analyze the interdependent dynamics between living systems on the one hand, and nonliving planetary processes.
73880	81300	B	0.779553234577179	And this, hopefully, would, we hope, allow us to gain some insights into the future states of Gaia.
81380	94860	B	0.7839272618293762	And by Gaia we're going to mean the Earth and formulate some predictions and devise potential interventions to alleviate future dysfunction on the planet.
96320	96828	B	0.7123860716819763	Okay?
96914	110560	B	0.9174959659576416	So then the lineup for the presentation is I'm first going to go over, in brief, the theory, the concept of Gaia, so known as the Gaia hypothesis.
111300	126400	B	0.7848007678985596	Then I'm going to go into just giving some essentials on the free energy principle, which I'm assuming that it's not really necessary, but just for the sake of the flow of my argument.
126480	132848	B	0.7675915956497192	Then I'm just going to present some things on the free energy principle and specifically on self organizing interacting systems.
133024	145320	B	0.8716933131217957	And then I'm going to apply the free energy principle to the Gaia poses is in a sort of like comparison analysis, as in how do they, if at all, complement each other for epistemic gain?
145660	162000	B	0.8422507047653198	And then after having done that, this should be should allow us to inform or to gain some insights as per the human behavior in relation to Gaia or the planet Earth.
163220	165250	B	0.7167601585388184	Okay, so let's see how it goes.
165620	173028	B	0.862096905708313	So first I want to introduce the notion of biophilia, which plays a fundamental role in this work.
173194	183770	B	0.9116741418838501	So biophilia came first, or came more prominently in this particular book here, and it's quite interesting.
184620	191332	B	0.8023001551628113	The idea is that the relation of humanity to the rest of the natural world is essentially one of dependence.
191396	194940	B	0.7317646145820618	And this is very much already in the literature and the free energy principle.
196400	209068	B	0.8046506643295288	But more than that, there is this view of the necessity of a continued survival and flourishing that is utterly contingent upon the state and functioning of the environment.
209164	215152	B	0.7372123003005981	So we're talking about things like very utilitarian things like survival, flourishing, mental health, right?
215206	217564	B	0.8109399676322937	So individuals interact with the environment.
217692	239400	B	0.8605220317840576	So to achieve that, but then on top of that, we wanted to add another conceptual layer which is or concerns how humans possess an innate cognitive disposition towards nature, which is known and developed in this particular other field of work as biophilia.
240060	250904	B	0.7501065731048584	And this is the idea of the natural psychological disposition of humans to seek out and connect with other living organisms and the natural environment.
251032	256700	B	0.6936827301979065	So that's kind of like the idea that is encapsulated in the whole framework and theory under biophilia.
259360	272352	B	0.5027820467948914	So then this seems to if that's the case of as things are described by biophilia, then that seems to bring us to a dilemma.
272496	284376	B	0.7624155879020691	On the one hand, we have these natural tendencies, so to speak, of humans to engage with the natural world in a very positive and constructive way.
284478	289444	B	0.6768999695777893	And on the other hand we see the lack of action to protect the Earth.
289492	293664	B	0.7805678844451904	And here we have in mind particularly the case of the climate crisis.
293812	302780	B	0.7337408065795898	So in the presentation I'm going to make my way slowly towards getting to that and to better understand the dilemma.
303920	304476	B	0.7123860716819763	Okay?
304578	309628	B	0.9000716209411621	So let's go in brief over the Gaia hypotheses.
309804	320368	B	0.5116091966629028	So this is a concept that comes more prominently in James Loflock's book Gaia a New Look at Life on Earth.
320544	335880	B	0.7499033808708191	And the idea there is that 3.8 billion years that life has persisted on Earth and conditions have remained remarkably constant and favorable across a huge range of parameters.
337020	347260	B	0.8862295746803284	The Gaia hypothesis is that this consistency or constancy is a natural product of evolution.
348320	359312	B	0.8933885097503662	In a modification, however, of the canonical Darwinism, the Gaia hypothesis somewhat modifies canonical Darwinism how?
359446	377712	B	0.7676167488098145	Well, by thinking that rather than evolution of the individual organisms on an inert environment, what evolves is the whole Earth system with its living and nonliving parts existing as a tight coupled entity.
377776	388410	B	0.5812059044837952	So this is the kind of like, so to speak, refreshing or new way of thinking that somewhat reformulated a little bit of Darwinism, right?
388780	398748	B	0.8315767645835876	The emphasis is not how one individual organism evolves or species evolves, but the whole Earth as a system.
398914	423940	B	0.7794508934020996	So that's quite interesting because, for example, the view that the combined genetic wealth of information of the whole system becomes much more prominent here than the Darwinistic kind of view and this acquires characteristics that are conductive to its continued existence and in turn affect changes on the environment.
424920	442810	B	0.8585156798362732	So then, seen as a whole organism or as a whole system, one can look at Gaia or the Earth as a complex system which appears to have the goal of regulating the climate and the chemistry at a comfortable state of life.
443280	459570	B	0.6964046359062195	And these views and these ideas have come to gain more official expression in 2001 with the Amsterdam Declaration on Earth system science precisely endorsing this view on the planet Earth as a whole system.
460500	472836	B	0.8585049510002136	So then the Gaia hypothesis is a complex system in various ways because it changes in an adaptive and nonlinear way.
473018	478580	B	0.8846781849861145	It also displays dynamical emergent and sudden tipping behavior.
479400	488360	B	0.9144794940948486	And when bifurcation points are reached, the new tractor states form, new tractor states are formed.
488860	496670	B	0.8036197423934937	And this means that it also self organizes and there is interdependence between the processors of the system.
497840	517410	B	0.9614732265472412	And finally, the Gaia hypothesis seems to be quite interesting and extraordinary in the sense that it brings together so many different fields such as ecology, climate science, cybernetics, complex systems theory, chaos, mathematics and philosophy of mine and that's just a few.
518360	519124	B	0.4896698594093323	All right.
519242	531688	B	0.9016645550727844	So then the idea is of the Gaia hypothesis is that we could look at the planet from orbit or as it is known, the overview effect.
531854	544668	B	0.8134000897407532	And the Gaia hypothesis offers this glimpse of a fundamentally different way of thinking of the planet, of thinking that in fact dominated mostly by human history.
544754	557164	B	0.8045796751976013	So it's a little bit of like that very inspiring clip by Karl Sagan, the Pale blue dot whereby the world is considered.
557292	569030	B	0.851179301738739	So throughout the human history there's typically a tendency for the world or the planet to be considered from a single living organism, though, rather than an it.
569720	578870	B	0.8301304578781128	So that's the idea of overview effect and taking this overview effect to look at the planet as this whole living system rather than an it.
580200	580612	B	0.7123860716819763	Okay?
580666	589764	B	0.8844428658485413	So then we can think about the Gaia hypotheses as like Newtonian physics or even as the free energy principle.
589892	600220	B	0.7509961724281311	The Gaia hypotheses can be seen much more as a framework or a method of investigation rather than a falsifiable empirical claim.
600800	615148	B	0.7936004996299744	So in this sense, these particular frameworks, they are and should be judged by their usefulness and not by their purported correctness with usefulness.
615244	635940	B	0.7098932266235352	Importantly, usefulness is to be determined by factors such as parsimony, coherence and consistency plus its empirical and epistemic power to explain phenomena, produce new facts and so on in a given context and at a given time frame.
636020	641320	B	0.9000352025032043	So that's the stance that we think that should be taken on the Gaia hypothesis.
642460	642856	B	0.7200906276702881	All right?
642878	655224	B	0.8146757483482361	So now having said a few words on the Gaia hypothesis now I'm going to just prepare the stage by saying a few words on the Fiang principle which, given the topic of this conference, needs no introduction.
655272	658830	B	0.873386561870575	But for these purposes I must mention just a few things.
659360	673396	B	0.8785406351089478	So the Fiang principle, we take it to be the case as well that it is a methodology to understand overserved patterns of behavior sorry, observed patterns of behavior in the natural world.
673578	685990	B	0.8917945027351379	So then we apply the free energy principle as the tool and methodology to analyze these interdependent dynamics between living systems and planetary processes, right?
686300	711600	B	0.8382469415664673	Kind of like these goggles, these methodological, technical, scientific goggles that you put on to gain insights into the future states of Gaia or the Earth such as to make future formulate predictions and devise potential interventions in this particular case with the care of alleviating future potential or present dysfunction.
713460	735160	B	0.5651167035102844	Okay, so the free energy principle very much aligns with this thinking by Ewan Schwellinger and the view that the second law of thermodynamics or under the second law of thermodynamics that open systems like us should tend to dissipation.
736780	755180	B	0.752047598361969	However interestingly, there are displays of this super cool thing, the negantropy, which are pockets of the universe where order and bodily integrity are maintained in the face of the surge towards chaos or towards entropy or towards dissipation.
755520	765010	B	0.914604902267456	And this view of the pockets of the universe is incredibly interesting because this is where we find self organizing systems like us.
765460	792804	B	0.659762978553772	And what is so peculiar that distinguishes these self organizing living systems from nonliving systems is that they have the capacity of acting upon and exchanging matter, energy or information with the environment in order to seemingly defy the second law and therefore or thereby avoid dissipation and chaos and entropy.
792932	794700	B	0.8820506930351257	So that's extraordinary.
795440	820260	B	0.6781682372093201	So then active inference becomes this very useful tool to tell us or to explain elucidate how these systems seemingly defy the second law, how they resist entropy, how the self organizing systems combat entropy through the interaction, maintaining their integrity via homeostasis.
821560	824480	B	0.8267167210578918	So then they maintain this energetic integrity.
824560	833400	B	0.7333105802536011	They utilize energy to stay within a specific range of states that is vital for their survival and preserving their existence.
834220	849130	B	0.8558115363121033	And they also engage with these feedback cycles which are the feedback actions like drinking when thirsty or moving away from heat signify working, accomplished by bound energy, contrasting with the free energy.
849820	858210	B	0.7610673904418945	They also define the thermodynamics, as I just mentioned, by seemingly challenging the law, they minimize entropy and safeguard their free energy.
858660	878100	B	0.8184370398521423	And finally this behavior that we observe in these self organizing living systems in striving to minimize free energy is or agrees with a certain principle that we know, which is the free energy principle.
879240	879844	B	0.7123860716819763	Okay?
879962	896504	B	0.6223530173301697	So then, as I said earlier and as we know but just to keep in mind then active inference becomes a very useful tool to understand and make predictions about these coupling dynamics taking place between interacting systems, living systems.
896552	911440	B	0.8962888717651367	Internal states is both operationally closed and thermodynamically open to the external states creating this distinct boundary which we usually mathematically capture with Markov blanket.
912020	918690	B	0.8430148363113403	And then this interaction unfolds through the immediate of active and sensory states.
919320	932392	B	0.6792349815368652	Then the key point here to keep in mind is that what we want to have for adaptation and well being is that there is a balanced interaction between sensory and active states.
932526	948860	B	0.5042539834976196	And this is because it is within the interaction between sensory and active states that so to speak, all of the important things happen in order for the system to be well adjusted attuned adapted to the environment.
950640	953400	B	0.6868889331817627	So living systems avoid this dissipation.
953480	966480	B	0.7407240271568298	They want to remain alive, they do everything in their power, they navigate their environments in order to avoid this dissipation which is also or can be also said to minimize free energy.
966630	977748	B	0.8337756991386414	And they avoid their dissipation by doing either one of the two things either by changing the model or changing the world, by acting upon the world.
977914	982470	B	0.5532526969909668	And this is extremely crucial for the point that I want to make later on.
984040	998652	B	0.8741078972816467	So now I want to apply the Fionergy principle to the Guy hypothesis and see how that comes together in identifying and developing and why do I want to do that?
998706	1001916	B	0.514292299747467	I want to do that because I've also already mentioned it.
1001938	1018236	B	0.5855960845947266	But I'm just going to refresh it because I want to identify and develop interventions to rectify any potential maladaptive responses, namely actions which are antithetical to maintaining the integrity of the system.
1018358	1037620	B	0.5288428068161011	What we want is to have healthy, well adjusted adaptive systems and human behavior particularly that leads to the imbalance within the Markov blanket states, is or could be considered sometimes maladaptive or pathological.
1037700	1053160	B	0.912380039691925	And this will be the last point I'm going to make in the presentation, but for now want to focus on how does the French principle deal with the Gaia hypothesis as a self organizing system like Ruth?
1053240	1053820	B	0.7101963758468628	Just saying.
1053890	1060128	B	0.8733316659927368	The Gaia meets the requirements to be formalized as part of an active inference system.
1060294	1072912	B	0.6791552901268005	It exists in a non equilibrium steady state, which means that its processes and states must persist over time within a range of states that are far from equilibrium.
1072976	1074992	B	0.7267007827758789	That means resisting entropy.
1075136	1083160	B	0.8818531632423401	And the Gaia is also distinguishable from its largest scale cosmic environment such as other planets and the rest of the universe.
1084140	1092760	B	0.8847869038581848	It is also defined by the conditional independence that we were just talking about between the internal and external stage which influence each other only vicariously.
1093740	1111456	B	0.820086658000946	So then we can taking that into consideration, we can even see that some of the people have already done this kind of like line of reasoning, they've already run it through and they did that by employing Markov blanket to analyze the Earth's climate system dynamics, which is quite interesting.
1111558	1137176	B	0.9018944501876831	What they did was they looked at metabolic rates of the biosphere and they represented them as internal states and space weather as external states and then they looked at active states as mirrored greenhouse effect shifts and sensory states as echoed ocean driven temperature changes and then internal and external states.
1137358	1143640	B	0.8637269735336304	The idea here is that they indirectly influenced each other through ocean's delayed response.
1144240	1151740	B	0.8843169808387756	Then Earth's climate is interpreted as anticipatory minimizing variational, free energy.
1151890	1173408	B	0.57735276222229	So we take this work and we want to take it a step further agreeing with this work and building upon this work which shows climate change, we wanted to look at the more broad understanding of Gaia through the lenses of the free energy principle.
1173584	1187924	B	0.564730167388916	So instead of focusing on climate change, which is very brilliantly done by these researchers, we wanted to then scale it up and apply the free energy principle to understand the Gaia.
1188052	1205048	B	0.8718323707580566	So then one can think of the internal states as the biosphere geographical processes and the external states as everything that is beyond the system, such as the outer atmosphere, Celicia bodies and molten core.
1205224	1224716	B	0.8796934485435486	Then we can think of sensory states as the external environment impact such as the Earth rotation, orbit, tides affected by the sun, moon, planets, plate tectonics, climate, weather influenced by solar radiation, space weather, etc.
1224748	1245480	B	0.8945534825325012	So and then we can think of the active states as Earth's adaptability and adjusting properties from external influence such as gravitational force, altars orbits, magnetic field interacts with solar winds or emission of detectable radiation influences distant objects.
1245560	1247500	B	0.7736907601356506	That's a few examples.
1248160	1250670	B	0.8373109102249146	So then I want to focus on the active states.
1251440	1270950	B	0.9005004167556763	Active states then through this lens, active states then embody its primary mechanism for self regulation, representing its efforts to remain within the bounds required for ongoing existence based on predictions about the present and future states of the system.
1272600	1294430	B	0.8693077564239502	For instance, the current levels of greenhouse and albedo effects, soil PH and the number of living organisms reflect the predictive attempts of the Gaia system to adapt to anticipated effects of solar events, volcanic eruptions, ocean salinity changes, and other environmental factors in the future.
1295280	1303992	B	0.8160156011581421	So it is in this context that the role of life itself assumes a paramount importance in the self regulation of the biosphere.
1304136	1321620	B	0.8815351128578186	Because the role of life itself, and particularly as we are going to focus on next, the human life, has a particular influence on all of these sort of already natural dynamics going on in the gaia.
1324680	1340532	B	0.818094789981842	This allows us, before we move into the human effects, this allows us to make one final point before we move there, which is to address the criticism that has been made in this paper by Vicente Haja on the Markov blanket trick.
1340676	1360764	B	0.7196515202522278	And what they have identified is that a purported weakness of the free energy principle what we say is that a weakness of the free energy principle that is identified in this paper actually speaks in favor of its application to the Gaia hypothesis.
1360812	1362930	B	0.760624885559082	And let me just try to explain that.
1363700	1378208	B	0.6994444131851196	So Raja and colleagues, they rightly point out that Markov Lincolns do not automatically capture every relevant property of biological systems, relational properties such as affordances.
1378384	1389764	B	0.751012921333313	And by affordances they mean what the environment offers, the animal, what it provides, or furnishes, either good or evil fall into this bracket.
1389812	1401630	B	0.7108291387557983	So what they're saying is that Markov blanket do not automatically capture every relevant aspect of biological system such as affordances, right?
1403040	1428256	B	0.9054980278015137	And we want to point out that however, affordances correspond to Gaia as one rung in the ladder of the Nested Marco blankets within the system in question at every level ranging up from, say, cells, organs, animals, ecosystems, solar systems, the whole cosmos.
1428288	1438280	B	0.8389371633529663	And how is it that we think that this particular framework that we bring here does have or solve or address the notion of affordances?
1438940	1443000	B	0.49239784479141235	Our solar system is one that affords a living planet.
1444240	1447704	B	0.7723396420478821	So the affordance available is an environment.
1447832	1453704	B	0.8153224587440491	In an environment are not determined solely by the physical properties of the environment.
1453752	1478916	B	0.7599640488624573	And we think that this is the point that we would like to address in HaHa's paper, is that the affordances are not determined solely by the physical properties of the environment, but also by the organism's goals, abilities and previous experiences and in this case, of the sun.
1479098	1492168	B	0.8834080696105957	So what is meant here is that the sun is what has the furnaces for or what affords anything else to happen on the planet at whatever each scale, right?
1492254	1503032	B	0.8203153014183044	The physical properties of the sun as well as the goals and abilities of the organisms on earth shape the affordances that the sun provides.
1503176	1513600	B	0.8010454177856445	So it's a quite interesting way of thinking that any affordance whatsoever that we might think of that we have as living systems, they are afforded by the sun.
1513670	1515490	B	0.6967025399208069	So that's the idea.
1516500	1542330	B	0.8944198489189148	Okay, so now having gone through how the female G principle somewhat speaks to and contributes to understanding the Gaia hypotheses, then we want to focus on how human behavior has a profound effect on the dynamics that already existing in the natural world.
1542940	1543690	A	0.7123860716819763	Okay?
1544780	1553512	B	0.8953208923339844	So according to the frequencies principle, living beings have a natural tendency to act upon their environment to prevent dissipation of their integrity.
1553576	1556296	B	0.6314075589179993	So that's what we do in order to remain alive.
1556488	1565884	B	0.8223245143890381	There are therefore two ways for a thing like us to minimize its free energy and thereby maintain our own integrity upon evidence.
1565932	1572492	B	0.8650217652320862	As we navigate the world and gather and observe evidence, we have two options.
1572566	1573652	B	0.7598991394042969	One is to change the model.
1573706	1577750	B	0.7435921430587769	The other one is to change the world by acting upon it, like I just said before.
1578360	1580064	B	0.6588371396064758	So then why is this relevant?
1580112	1596780	B	0.6076956987380981	Well, this is relevant because there is the possibility that in the ways in which living systems and in this particular case human beings interact and adapt to the world, there is the possibility that we see maladaptive behavior.
1597760	1599404	B	0.7917185425758362	And how would that be?
1599442	1639572	B	0.5633611679077148	Well, if it is the case that there is a rejection of the information available so as to remove the imperative for action or if it is the case that possessing the information available but we still remain or refrain from taking action, then there seems to be if the free energy principle is correct if the free energy principle is to be correct, that systems, living beings tend to act upon the world in order to remain alive and if it is the case that one rejects that kind of information and does not take action to remain alive, such as the information of the climate crisis, then we might be looking at maladaptive behavior.
1639716	1653656	B	0.5817617774009705	So if the free energy principle holds, then the observed contradictory behavior is a maladaptive state or should be seen as a maladaptive state that arises from an imbalance within the Markov blanket.
1653848	1657500	B	0.6670539379119873	And how do we see this imbalance within the Markov blanket?
1657580	1671280	B	0.7949218153953552	We see it to put it in very, very simple terms, we see it as an insulation of internal states that are not being affected by the information available outside of the system.
1671430	1677124	B	0.8807664513587952	So the influences or the interactions are occurring between internal, active and sensory states.
1677242	1691640	B	0.5929520726203918	And this is an imbalance that results in an insulation or an echo chamber effect in internal states that are impermeable to the information from or potentially existing in the external states that demands action.
1693420	1695610	B	0.7939074635505676	So then some food for thought.
1696560	1698316	B	0.800888180732727	What can we make of this?
1698418	1699912	B	0.8590182065963745	The free energy principle?
1700056	1718076	B	0.7232991456985474	If we are to use the free energy principle to model the dynamics of the relationships between humans and the environment then we think that it is possible to see the current lack of pro environmental behavior as a pathology of the human species that must receive treatment.
1718188	1723136	B	0.6653360724449158	We label this condition as Biophilia Deficiency Deficiency Syndrome.
1723248	1733240	B	0.8001766800880432	Biophilia Deficiency Syndrome and it is important for us to focus on that to construct some validity.
1733660	1751596	B	0.5572803020477295	Is useful to consider in this case other applications of the free energy principle that may be useful as an analogous case of pathology mainly conducted in psychiatry and neurology and in here and very short because I don't have time.
1751698	1758748	B	0.49051007628440857	The idea is to see it as a failure to assign the right way or prediction to prediction errors.
1758844	1774656	B	0.5483108758926392	So then the free energy principle from this point of view this is a persuasive pathology because doing nothing is a base optimal response in the face of pathological attention to various sources of evidence.
1774688	1777460	B	0.6419771909713745	So evidence is ignored.
1778840	1791716	B	0.879058301448822	So concluding and recapping according to the free energy principle living systems possess a biological encoded inclination to interact with the environment in order to survive and adapt to the environment.
1791908	1804220	B	0.5183042883872986	And despite the climate change being a pressing issue and the information being available the evidence being available proactive measures to reverse its effects are not giving the priority they deserve.
1805360	1816236	B	0.5340089797973633	This state of affairs seems to show very clearly a divergence from a natural inclination that we call biophilia or that is existing in the literature as biophilia.
1816348	1823876	B	0.8900122046470642	This discrepancy between the expected and the observed actions can be understood in the framework of the free energy principle or so we think.
1823978	1833210	B	0.8831199407577515	As an illness, it implies that systems, including human societies may form erroneous inferences that prevent them from effectively addressing the problem at hand.
1834140	1849324	B	0.7160011529922485	Now, thinking about future directions and this is my last slide current ecological imbalances could be thought of as a stuck state that require an active disturbance to bring about some change.
1849522	1858252	B	0.7434590458869934	A stuck state is a state that a system is at a local minimum where the system is at and won't get out of that state unless it is disturbed.
1858396	1866416	B	0.880381166934967	So that's the principle in complex systems theory and we think that that's how this particular state should be looked at.
1866438	1868064	B	0.831716001033783	But that's for future research.
1868262	1875200	B	0.8871436715126038	And what we would be calling is we would be calling for amounts to the kind of homeostatic awakening.
1875280	1892970	B	0.7161770462989807	So the sort of like getting out of this stuck state would require some kind of like omniostatic awakening a deliberately induced disruptive shift in the trajectory reflecting a prioritization of the planetary homeostasis over infinite growth or staying in the same place.
1893740	1895464	B	0.758599042892456	And yeah, this is my last slide.
1895512	1896428	B	0.9793016910552979	Thank you so much.
1896514	1900700	B	0.8214545845985413	I would like also to acknowledge my co author Casper Montgomery.
1901120	1902700	B	0.9891228079795837	Thank you so much for your attention.
1905440	1906430	A	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
1907280	1909104	A	0.5906266570091248	Well, a lot of ways to go.
1909142	1926790	A	0.8951355814933777	I'll just ask one question just in the years that you've been in the game how do you see the active inference ecosystem and the ways also that it's being applied to ecosystems evolving, like, over what timescales or in what ways does that really present itself to you?
1927960	1932484	B	0.7934393286705017	Slow, sadly slow.
1932612	1936410	B	0.5792078971862793	I think there's a lot of work that needs to be done.
1937180	1951260	B	0.8457842469215393	We try to do this particular one here to apply employ active inference to the planet or the Earth as a living system precisely to bring out or to overcome.
1953520	1962508	B	0.5380103588104248	One is to look at this problem of the climate crisis as what we think it is, which is more of a pathology.
1962684	1971300	B	0.7009057402610779	If the free energy principle holds, then it seems that there is maladaptive behavior of the collective of the human species.
1972360	1982730	B	0.8495601415634155	So I think that there's a lot of work that can be done and that would very much be useful in the climate crisis in general.
1983980	1992840	B	0.9835191369056702	There is some other work that came out more recently by Maxwell and colleagues as well on the ecosystems, which is really cool.
1992910	2007970	B	0.7358850240707397	And I would also mention that one, and I really hope that we can pursue this line of research and employee active inference in the free energy principle to this particular case.
2009540	2029700	B	0.9698712825775146	One of the things that really attracts me to the free energy principle is the capacity that it has to bring to the forefront certain laws of physics, but also the living systems navigating and interacting with their environments, which I find much more appealing than any computational framework per se.
2029770	2042840	B	0.9423400163650513	So that's what I find that it's a very useful conceptual toolkit that I think that I would really like to see more applied in the future for the climate crisis and the Earth.
2044460	2045016	A	0.7671424746513367	Great.
2045118	2050840	A	0.9876225590705872	Well, thank you so much for building on that line of work and for sharing it with us tonight.
2052540	2054216	B	0.9890522360801697	Thank you so much for having me.
2054318	2055240	A	0.6996942758560181	Till next time.
2055310	2056090	A	0.639849066734314	See you.
2056660	2057552	B	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
2057686	2059680	A	0.4864290952682495	Bye bye.
2063940	2069010	A	0.9276018738746643	All right, well, great talk by an S.
2069700	2069980	A	0.5137447118759155	Bye.
