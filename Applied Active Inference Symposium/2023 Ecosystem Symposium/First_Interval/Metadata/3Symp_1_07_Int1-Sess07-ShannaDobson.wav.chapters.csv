I'll message Shanna make sure that everything's good with the audio.	Next session is going to be with Shanna Dobson	Dark Imaginarium: Shared Intelligence as an Infinity Curiosity type
83900	389210	01:23	Aims to define dark consciousness as a mixed frequency state of being self aware or conscious while simultaneously being in a deep sleep. Could it be possible to sustain a waking state without consciousness or a conscious state in a non waking state?	Dark consciousness is a mixed frequency state of being self aware or conscious	 ontological commitment to dark consciousness
390780	718736	06:30	So what if dark was the simultaneity of a becoming that eludes the present? Is dark a resolution issue but resolution is merely breaking translational symmetry? I'm going to formally define dark consciousness as being conscious while simultaneously being in deep sleep.	Dark consciousness is the simultaneity of a becoming that eludes the present	Deleuze: Dark Consciousness and the Paradox of Infinite
718768	1052700	11:58	FEP asks: What does FEP specifically say about dark matter, even dark in the way that I'm using the term? Can we do some sort of dark general adversarial network to look at something like a dark brain?	So periodic time measures duration topologically as total disconnectedness	Dark Matter and the Peatic Clock
1053120	1352220	17:33	The Qubit Pedagogy is a new model pedagogy infused with heavy principles of quantum mechanics. It will encourage AI to explore dark reflexivity is what I call fractal identity. The AI could also develop new dark cognition types that correlate with the new types of delta waves.	Chris Fields: If you wish to model fractals, you can use diamond	Dark Quantum Reality Monitoring Network
1352560	1763970	22:32	Dark Imaginarium is a meta Curiosity algorithm that can create its own Infinity Curiosity algorithms. Could develop inversions of current brainwaves and their hybrid combinations. Could also predict non human species cognition types such as octopus thought or dragonfly attention. Could extend human cognition.	Dark Imaginarium is a meta Curiosity algorithm that can create Infinity Curiosity algorithms	Dark Imaginarium
1771460	1822610	29:31	Scott David says he loves the presentation, lots of Fodder for Rumination. Perhaps dark energy is our perception of the fact of information increase under free energy principle processes. I don't really know where they go, but hopefully it's portals to something like that.

1823220	1906840	30:23	Scott David: Does fractal identity reveal the recursivity of rhetoric language consciousness informing individual identity from community identity inputs? David: If you can construct identity without before after, then that's sort of what I'm trying to do. But maybe fractal is something sort of like you're both at the same time.	Scott David: Does fractal identity reveal recursivity of rhetoric language consciousness	Does Fractal Identity Reveal Identity?
1908880	1935680	31:48	Well, this is truly food for thought, and I really hope people can live with the darkness, take it and run with it, because there's so many fun ways to go. So you're always welcome back. And talk to you later.	I hope people can live with the darkness and run with it	Darkness and the Light
