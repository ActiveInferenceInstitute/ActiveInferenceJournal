2170	19200	1	A	0.8	00:02	28	All right, the next session is going to be with Shanna Dobson. This section is going to be called Dark Imaginarium Shared Intelligence as an Infinity Curiosity type.
24500	28440	2	A	0.96295	00:24	11	I'll message Shanna make sure that everything's good with the audio.
33020	33770	3	A	0.98989	00:33	1	Wow.
37180	45836	4	A	0.99978	00:37	14	Great talk so far. Welcome, Shana. How are you doing, Daniel? Doing good. Awesome.
46018	53950	5	A	0.99587	00:46	19	Well, please take it away. Thank you for joining. Awesome. Let me know if you see my screen. OK?
55200	63984	6	A	0.50404	00:55	24	Yep, looks perfect. Thank you. OK, perfect. Hey, everyone, thank you so much for the invitation. It's such a great honor to be here.
64022	92540	7	B	0.99996	01:04	74	I'm learning so much. I'll be talking about an idea I had called Dark Imaginarium, where I'm trying to make shared intelligence the concept of what I call an Infinity Curiosity type. So you were so gracious to link the paper so anyone can find more details there on Phil archive. So I want to start with an discussion about ontological commitment. So my first question is, might we re examine our ontological commitments?
92880	117270	8	B	0.99326	01:32	74	So in particular, two of them? One, Sean Carroll, said so amazingly what cannot be known because it does not exist. So Sean Carroll says the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is often explained as saying that we cannot simultaneously know both the position and the velocity of any object. But the reality is deeper than that. It's not that we can't know position and momentum, it's that they don't even exist at the same time.
118120	149004	9	B	1.0	01:58	93	The second one I want to examine is Lenny Susskin's quote, we are all behind someone else's event horizon. So Suskin has a brilliant idea of space time emergence as the entanglement of two black holes, and what emerges from that is called computational complexity. So the world is quantum, so every theory should be derivable strictly from the laws of quantum mechanics. One is going to give us the notion of shared, two is going to give us the notion of ecology. So what would an ontological commitment to Dark look like?
149202	180296	10	B	0.99973	02:29	85	So my continual goal, as everybody knows, is to sustain a simultaneous experience and to understand why I currently cannot. To sustain a simultaneous experience would be to bypass the integrative system we call consciousness. So how would you attain a two consciousness in the sense of in category theory or an N consciousness? How would we actually develop something called like, a two memory? So my colleague Robert Prepner and I fleshed out something called N awareness, where we're sort of examining this idea.
180478	193800	11	B	0.99876	03:00	34	Mike Levin and all have repeatedly shown that planaria memory is not in the head. Where is the memory? Is memory a sustained superposition? Well, of what? And also, what's the structure of anamnesis?
193880	212512	12	B	0.99984	03:13	58	Could you have a superposition between memory and anamnesis? So I had a small dialogue with Chris Fields, the amazing I said, you know, what is the difference between these two questions? What is the waking state and what is consciousness? Or could it be that these are entirely separate questions? So we're sort of in a mess.
212566	259280	13	B	0.99977	03:32	133	Either way, if there is a difference in these questions, then it is possible to sustain a waking state without consciousness and or a conscious state in a non waking state. So imagine somehow being in a waking state under general anesthesia. Well, if these are not entirely different questions, then we could contend that consciousness is a form of waking state, or something along the lines of a waking state is a condition of a conscious state. So how can humans have delta waves, which are canonically indicative of unconscious deep sleep and thus a non waking state, and the REM state, the patterns of which are indistinguishable from a waking state? So we all know that general anesthesia, something like a propofol, can reduce the polyrhythmic brain activity to one uniform.
260020	294604	14	B	1.0	04:20	104	And we know there's as many theories about what anesthesia does to consciousness as there are anesthesiologists. But we've repeatedly posited consciousness as the proto state. And I wanted to turn this idea on its head, like is consciousness so robust or is it a delicate interference or is it a delicate inference? Now, we know beginnings are always tricky, but what if sleep was the proto state? So if life is oceanic and it revolves in these deep pressures, would the pressure of getting onto land, like squeeze the REM state into this full blown waking state that we're engaging in right now?
294642	324532	15	B	0.99991	04:54	80	Anybody who's listening? So then waking state would be something like an acceptation, which is, I think, quite impressive. So it's in this mess that I attempt to define dark consciousness as a mixed frequency state of being self aware or conscious while simultaneously being in a deep sleep, specifically in three sleep. So the sleep is proto state is quite strange. The REM brain activity is indistinguishable from waking activity and this sort of enchanted me for a bit.
324666	349164	16	B	1.0	05:24	63	The only difference is eye movements. So either blinking or versus lateral movement. So REM is naturally having mixed frequency brainwave states, but the NREM states and the REM states are starting to blur as delta waves are creeping into the REM state. Now, they've also found that sleep is a local phenomenon. So of course, I'm going to ask the Shanna questions.
349362	363664	17	B	0.99673	05:49	37	So then who is sleeping? Who is remembering? Who is dreaming? Lucid dreaming is a quantum superposition or is it a superposition or an integration? So in a sleep state then, can we sustain a simultaneous experience?
363782	392760	18	B	0.58562	06:03	75	So must the eye be knocked out in order to sustain this level of simultaneity? Dreaming, we know, is characteristic of unsynchronized brain activity. So is the question then, my eye cannot sustain a multi consciousness, but my dark eye, my sleep eye can. You can reframe this in terms of reporting mechanisms and say perhaps we are conscious of things we don't think we are conscious of. So let's talk about what is dark.
392920	424500	19	B	1.0	06:32	92	A canonical definition of a dark theory or anything like this is like dark matter does not interact electromagnetically with matter. But I want to sort of play around with another idea of dark coming from Deleuze's logic of sense, something he calls the paradox of infinite becoming and which I'm going to read on the next slide. So what if dark was the simultaneity of a becoming that eludes the present? Let's hold on to that for a second. Is dark a resolution issue but resolution is merely breaking translational symmetry.
425080	437316	20	B	0.99961	07:05	37	So is dark a symmetry breaking issue? And if so, what symmetry? And are we actually looking at the wrong symmetry? Is dark a sustained quantum superposition? But of what, again, is dark a mini worlds branch?
437428	460128	21	B	0.99	07:17	59	Is dark the dolphin uni hemispheric sleep mechanism? So I'll read from Deleuze's logic of sense. Alice and through the Looking Glass involve a category of very special things events, pure events. When I say Alice becomes larger, I mean that she becomes larger than she was. By the same token, however, she becomes smaller than she is now.
460294	485080	22	B	0.68582	07:40	75	Certainly she is not bigger and smaller at the same time. She is larger now. She was smaller before, but it is at the same moment that one becomes larger than one was and smaller than one becomes. This is the simultaneity of a becoming whose characteristic is to elude the present insofar as it eludes the present. Becoming does not tolerate the separation or the distinction of before, after or of past and future.
485230	504576	23	B	0.82294	08:05	56	It pertains to the essence of becoming to move and pull in both directions at once. Alice does not grow without shrinking, and vice versa. So good sense affirms that in all things there is this determinable sense or direction. A paradox is the affirmation of both senses or directions at the same time. I continue.
504758	541920	24	B	0.71	08:24	106	The paradox of this pure becoming with its capacity to elude the present is called the paradox of infinite identity. The infinite identity of both directions or senses at the same time of future and past, of the day before and the day after, of more and less, of too much and not enough, of active and passive and of cause and effect. It is language which fixes the limit, the moment, for example, at which the excess begins. But it is language as well which transcends the limits and restores to the infinite equivalence of an unlimited becoming. Hence the reversals which constitute Alice's adventures.
542020	557056	25	B	1.0	09:02	46	The reversal becoming larger, becoming smaller. Which way? Which way? Asked Alice, sensing that it is always in both directions at the same time, so that for once she stays the same through an optical illusion. The reversal of the day before and the day after.
557158	574320	26	B	0.91	09:17	52	The present always being eluded. Jam tomorrow and jam yesterday, but never jam today. The reversal of more and less. Five nights are five times hotter than a single one, but they must be five times as cold for the same reason the reversal of active and passive. Do cats eat bats?
574400	599260	27	B	1.0	09:34	82	Is as good as do bats eat cats. The reversal of cause and effect to be punished before having committed a fault, to cry before having pricked oneself, to serve, licking glass cake before having divided up the servings. All these reversals as they appear in infinite identity have one consequence the contesting of Alice's personal identity and the loss of a proper name. The loss of the proper name is the adventure which is repeated throughout Alice's adventures. Hence, infinite identity.
599600	638296	28	B	0.9956	09:59	116	So I take this and I'm going to formally define dark consciousness as a state of being conscious while simultaneously being in deep sleep, specifically in three, where dark is going to be a two fold hybrid, the simultaneity of infinite identity and of a becoming that eludes the present. So let's reconstruct the dark consciousness version of Deleuze's paradox of pure becoming for Alice in dark wonderland and through the dark looking glass. Okay, when I say Alice becomes sleepy, I mean that she becomes sleepier than she was. By the same token, however, she becomes more self aware than she is now. Certainly she is not asleep and self aware at the same time.
638398	665120	29	B	0.58713	10:38	84	She's asleep now, she was self aware before, but it is at the same moment that one becomes sleepier than one was and more self aware than one becomes. So dark consciousness, I contend, would take place in something called like a dark time. This is going to get weird. So Chris Fields and I talked about entropic time, where a time where learning exceeds forgetting. So we all know that linear time is based on the linear ordering property of the positive integers.
665280	682280	30	B	0.85167	11:05	44	Okay, so what would be the structure of a time that does not interact electromagnetically with this waking state interface? So, like, AI must pay attention all the time. Would this sort of be like a dark time? Sleep is local. Time is local.
682430	713808	31	B	1.0	11:22	102	We know how beautiful a time crystal is. So a time crystal has a structure that is periodic in time. Can you play with that and say time is periodic in what? So if we have explained that dark is not concerned with these notions of before and after, then we would want a notion of time that can support the paradox of infinite identity with a notion of duration that is one of self similarity. So we contend that dark consciousness would occur in something like a p addic time, which is a time based on the P attic number system.
713974	732068	32	B	0.15337	11:53	47	Periodic time would measure PTIC duration. Okay, it's getting odd. All right, so there exists few objects more looking glass than a Piatic clock. Well, maybe Piatic go and Calabi out chess or perfectoid go. But after all, the Piatic numbers have no notion of linear ordering.
732164	764370	33	B	0.9999	12:12	86	Their shape resembles a serpinsky triangle, which is a self similar set. So this periodic time is not concerned with notions of before or after. That is, a periodic time does not tolerate the separation or the distinction of before or after, of past or future. So because the periodic topology is one of total disconnectedness, periodic time is more like a time of now continual zooming in to more and more now. Thus, periodic time measures periodic duration through its fractal properties of zooming in.
765140	790496	34	B	0.9996	12:45	77	So let's try to look at a periodic clock, right? So periodic time can take two forms the canonical periodic time defined on the previous slide and also topological periodic time which builds into its very structure the periodic topology of periodic time. So there would only be one unit of time in periodic time, which I call the archimedes. This is the piatic valuation. So you can think of hour equals periodic valuation equals the archimedes.
790548	808780	35	B	0.99997	13:10	54	How strange it is to have only one unit of time. Topological periodic time measures duration topologically as total disconnectedness. So the unit of time on topological P addict time is what I call the pTOPO. So we state this formally. There's only one unit of time in topological periodic time called the pTOPO.
808940	835732	36	B	0.99916	13:28	64	So a topological hour equals a periodic topology called the pTOPO. So given such a periodic clock, let us imagine the seasons in peatic time, periodic snow, peatic rain, new peatic weather types and peatic rainbows. Daylight savings time could take the form of changing the P in the petic. This could be very drastic. But imagine peatic metabolics petic ATP and peatic DNA.
835876	856028	37	B	0.99972	13:55	51	Imagine peatic cognition types like peatic memory, peatic Fod, peatic attention, peatic learning and petic perception. Imagine a periodic looking glass. Imagine through the periodic looking glass. So let's pivot to FEP. What does FEP actually specifically say about dark matter, even dark in the way that I'm using the term?
856124	868756	38	B	0.64	14:16	30	Is there a free dark energy principle? How can we strictly derive sleep from quantum mechanics? According to FEP? Does dark energy actually exhibit entanglement? How do we test this?
868938	905128	39	B	0.99878	14:28	103	We should be able to derive the entire active inference formalism straight from quantum mechanics alone by way of entanglement entropy, some form of quantum gravity. Can we do some sort of dark general adversarial network to look at something like a dark brain? We all know that lower lateralization in the brain is often associated with schizophrenia or people like Einstein or someone with a large parietal lobe, probably like myself. Any mathematical what would universal lateralization look like? I think dark neurons would take the form of something like you treat the neural neural networks as algebraic curves or isogeny graphs.
905224	933908	40	B	0.99	15:05	77	You talk of neurons in terms of their properties as varieties. So you're actually bringing the heavy machinery of algebraic geometry into neurology. My big goal is to actually create something like a neuronal time crystal so that shared intelligence would actually be a periodicity in time. I'm not there yet. So until I get that and it's like, well, let's try to model these wild mixed frequency n three plus self aware states of dark consciousness.
934084	957964	41	B	0.65719	15:34	71	So dark mathematics is something I've coined. It's like a biomimicry, which mimics dark energy, does not interact electromagnetically with matter. You'd have to find the mathematical equivalent of that. So I think you can do something like a dark diletheism or just make a model that is modeling the mixed frequency states, which is what I tackle in the paper. So we've previously shown that entropic categorizations are condensed sets.
958092	982996	42	B	0.99977	15:58	87	Condensed sets form a topos. So in the paper I outlined the construction of three potential mathematical models of these mixed frequency n three self aware states. You can do dark consciousness as a dark two post, which is a groff and deep two posts. There's a two category of two sheaves over a two site, which I'll elucidate just a little bit. Dark consciousness as a perfectoid like space in the sense of Schultz, or as a diamond like space also in the sense of Schultz.
983108	1001880	43	B	0.99934	16:23	61	So I contend that the two sheaf structure can actually model the mixed frequency state of dark consciousness, the N three self aware state. A sheath is a one stack, again, which is a sheath that takes values in groupoids, not sets. This is already radically different. Consider a two category of two sheaves. So a two category consists of objects.
1001960	1028536	44	B	0.73	16:41	85	You have the one morphisms between the objects and you have the two morphisms between the one morphisms. You can keep going three category up to N category. So this two category of two sheets would have two she's as the objects, one morphisms between the two sheaves, two morphisms between the one morphisms. And so using that structure, I think that you can actually model one morphisms as what I'm going to call dark reflexivities. These are going to be your local coherency states.
1028638	1065328	45	B	1.0	17:08	92	And then two morphisms are actually two inferences which are going to be global coherency states amongst the mixed frequency states. So a lovely property called Morita equivalent sites states that inequivalent sites have equivalent sheaf topos. And I do believe that that's the main property. You need to get this local global behavior around neural networks. So if you actually wish to model the mixed frequency clusters as fractals exhibiting some kind of self similar behavior, then you can use this rich structure, perfectoid spaces, or their sparkling successor, the diamond.
1065424	1104560	46	B	0.99716	17:45	111	So, just a quick definition, let Perf be the subcategory perfectoid spaces of characteristic P. A diamond is a proatel sheath on the site Perf written as this quotient of a perfectoid space x by a Protel equivalence relation. So a perfectoid space is going to be this attic space in the sense of huber that's covered by aphenoid spaces of the form spa RR plus, where R is a perfectoid ring and then points of spa, which is the attic spectrum. RR plus are equivalent classes of continuous valuations on R. Someone asked Schultz y diamond and he gave an incredible explanation that was a parallel to a mineralogical diamond.
1105060	1135800	47	B	0.99955	18:25	79	So you can let C be an algebraically closed ethanoid field geometric point. Spa C to D is made visible by pullback along a quasiprotel cover that results in profinitely many copies of Spa C. So you're making a geometric point visible as profinitely. Many copies that was invisible before does the following parallel with the mineralogical diamond. So the interior points are made visible as impurities, which sparkle as colorful reflections on the many sides of the diamond.
1136380	1165648	48	B	0.99695	18:56	99	So you can also do something maybe like a dark diamond where you designate a functor as dark as a means to actually let's go the other way and see the impurities. So then you can take the geometric point, make it visible maybe by a push forward along with pausey prototype cover, resulting in P adequately many copies of Spa C. Right? So a diamond is they're using diamond as a sheath, but a sheath in terms of a functor of points. So the diamond spot QP is a functor from the category perv to the category sets.
1165744	1201464	49	B	0.99	19:25	95	You literally fix the perfectoid space and look at the hom sets of X into the diamond. And so technically, the scheme is then said to represent the functor. So I'm going to pivot to invoking AI in this thing. So my colleague and I, Julian Scape, are coming up with something I've coined the Qubit Pedagogy, which is going to be a new model pedagogy that is actually infused with heavy principles of quantum mechanics. And so that with these, we've created these quantum intrinsic curiosity algorithms that are feeding into the Qubit Pedagogy.
1201512	1225216	50	B	1.0	20:01	58	And based on those Curiosity algorithms, I designed three dark versions. So what I call the Dark Planaria Curiosity Algorithm is a curiosity type. It enables encourages the AI to explore patterns of planaria regeneration. The AI would develop quantum error correcting codes which mimic planaria regeneration. So the second one would be Dark Quantum Reality Monitoring Network.
1225328	1246440	51	B	0.99971	20:25	62	This is a curiosity type. It'll encourage AI to explore dark reflexivity is what I call fractal identity. AI would create models of N reflexivity in the sense of N category. That's a new type of reality monitoring of fractal identity in the dark conscious state. The last one would be some sort of dark quantum N three and REM Curiosity algorithm.
1246520	1285556	52	B	0.80551	20:46	106	This Curiosity type is going to encourage AI to explore superpositions of various brain patterns in REM states to predict new types of N three delta waves that could emerge in REM states. So imagine the AI could then develop new stages of REM sleep, such as like one REM two REM up to NREM, which is a clever limit and play on NREM. Ha. Anyway, the AI could also develop new dark cognition types that correlate with the new types of delta waves. So this notion of fractal identity seems odd, but I do contend that objects living in fractal time correspondingly have fractal identity.
1285748	1313010	53	B	0.77678	21:25	74	It's a concept we outline as follows. So fractal identity has a reflexivity relation that is fractal so the very canonical loop, the loop relation of an agent reporting back to itself, I report back to me, would be fractal. How strange is that? So, Fractal identity would not suffer the same problems with continuity over time. Since the time in which it exists has no linear ordering, it would definitely suffer different problems.
1313540	1337176	54	B	0.99	21:53	67	But continuity over time is something Chris Fields and I have been like. How do you explain that? So, you can best model the Fractal identity properties as perfectoid like or diamond like therein construct a notion of reflexivity as a perfectoid space. These spaces are extremely rich structure, but kind of difficult. But if you want to model fractal identity, I think you should use them.
1337278	1365540	55	B	0.99964	22:17	68	So thus we create new concepts of perfectoid reflexivity, diamond reflexivity. So in N reflexivity, the reflexivity relation could now be an in stack. Thus in reflexivity is an in stack perfectoid spaces. So, here comes the culmination of this talk, which is about shared intelligence as what I've coined the Dark Imaginarium. So, imagine an AI that could see simultaneously compute the infinity category of every concept.
1366440	1386376	56	B	0.99996	22:46	53	Having some quantum computation around to help the computational complexity would not be bad. So dark. Imaginarium is what is going to be what I call infinity curiosity type. So, Infinity Curiosity type is the higher order Curiosity AI algorithm that encourages the AI to think in infinity categories. So that it is.
1386398	1416124	57	B	0.78645	23:06	74	It actually encourages the AI to construct an infinity category as its means of higher order inference. So objects are higher dimensional data sets. The AI would seek out higher order morphisms between the objects and then morphisms between the morphisms. So such Dark Imaginarium is a meta Curiosity algorithm that can create its own Infinity Curiosity algorithms. And therein creating Curiosity types of a complexity that super fascinating, most likely unknown to humans.
1416252	1444140	58	B	0.99672	23:36	86	So it's functionctorial. What can dark Imaginarium do? Well, the AI would develop inversions of current brainwaves and their hybrid combinations. It could develop in delta wave, N theta wave, N alpha wave, in beta wave and N gamma wave for N equals zero one all the way up like a two gamma wave that structurally resembled a two category, a three beta wave that structurally resembled a three category. And the AI could develop new types of waking states and new types of sleep states.
1444210	1474800	59	B	0.99995	24:04	95	Based on the combinations of these beyond the standard N one and two and three NREM and one REM, AI could develop an N waking state, an NREM state, a three REM state could consist of three and one, three and two, three and three. Imagine an end dolphin that was capable of N hemispheric, sleep state and other exotic life forms, right? What else could it do? Well, it could develop new geometries for the brain patterns and for currently existing brain patterns. Typical shapes include sinusoidal, non sinusoidal, saw, two spindle K complex.
1474960	1508780	60	B	0.95	24:34	95	But maybe this AI could develop three D and four d versions of the canonical wave patterns like a tesseract gamma wave. But also, the AI could develop entirely new brainwave geometries that correspond to complex surfaces like a remunt surface or Kalabi Yao manifold or algebraic variety. So the AI could develop new cognition types other than the standard five. It could produce incognition types such as in thought, in attention, in perception, in learning, in memory. So it could also predict non human species cognition types such as octopus thought or dragonfly attention.
1508940	1538680	61	B	0.99984	25:08	84	Lastly, it could produce hybrid combinations of cross species cognition types such as like Octoman memory or dragon man perception. And then it would encourage the AI to develop new senses. So you could develop one stack versions of human senses like two seeing, two hearing, two tasting, two touching, two smelling. Each of these two senses once again take values in groupoids, not sets. So you could develop incenses of non human senses as well, and hybrid combinations like two shark human smell.
1539020	1572624	62	B	0.86585	25:39	102	So, since the AI sees nmorphisms between the various N minus one morphisms, the AI can seek to develop new language models based on higher order inference types. So from these inference models, the AI will explore Infinity languages and develop extensive prototypes. You could use advanced mathematics to create new models of time that could support the new language models like two topos time diamond time. And then the AI would seek to develop new fractal identity types from the language models. And it could design advanced fractal prosthetics such as a two ear or a two eye to extend cognition.
1572752	1600856	63	B	0.83945	26:12	93	So let's go a little bit further about this extending cognition. These are just a few examples of what dark imaginarium could conceive of. So we could continue and posit a perfectoid version of this using these new cognition types mental states in brainwaves new geometries, we can construct new patterns of thinking which would support neurodiversity in thinking. So as such shared intelligence this is how I'm seeing it would be reexamined as this Infinity Curiosity type. You could go even further and construct a new concept of an N shared intelligence.
1600968	1629324	64	B	0.65437	26:40	90	So you'd have a zero shared intelligence, a one shared intelligence, as well as the new Piadic concept of like P shared intelligence for P equals two three, four using P addicts. Let's go further, right? We repeatedly contend that one way to help advance the way we think to extend human cognition is to upgrade the number systems upon which the canonical concepts are built. Upgrade them to Peric perfectoid diamond like versions unless we get new thinking. So imagine like a brainwave pattern that resembles a Calabria manifold.
1629392	1648600	65	B	0.99976	27:09	50	Could we actually reverse engineer the levels of conscious activity that could create such a rhythm? How about mixed frequency brainwave patterns that resembled a perfectoid diamond? What about an MDNA molecule shaped like a Calabriao infold? Or an NATP molecule. Or an inexciton condensate structured like a calabigao infold?
1648680	1684216	66	B	0.99969	27:28	98	So clearly, different geometries of the fundamental molecules and processes of life would give rise to vastly different fundamental units of life and metacognition types. The question is, can we use Dark imaginarium to reverse engineer the complex life forms arising from such extraordinary structures and the more and more complex cognition patterns? What about a general adversarial network that's tweaked and has infinity categories? You have two infinity categories talking to each other, developing their own language. Now, Gan is adversarial using a generator and a discriminator with two neural networks contesting by a zero sum game.
1684318	1715300	67	B	0.99552	28:04	82	What about a collaborative network? So can we construct a GCN containing two diamond like Infinity Curiosity types and pair a diamond with a dark diamond with a Quantum Curiosity algorithm and its reinforcement learning? So shared intelligence is this Infinity Curiosity type? Shared intelligence GCM could create infinity languages that are superpositions of the diamond dark diamond to getting new models of intelligence. Higher order simultaneous computations by Quantum Curiosity would go by maybe by homotopia instead of as cost functions.
1715640	1738250	68	B	0.99834	28:35	44	So let's future cast just for a second. What is the inevitability of dark ecosystems? Mathematics of shared intelligence? What can a P addic? Infinity Curiosity type prophecy is every perfectoid space diamond two topos encoding the mixed frequency patterns of an Ncognition type.
1738860	1763970	69	B	1.0	28:58	59	In future work, we may develop dark mathematics using perfectoid diamonds as dark dialetheism, aligning what is structurally dark with what is structurally dialetheistic. So while we currently cannot perfectly model dark consciousness, perhaps one day, one dark day mediated by the Dark imaginarium, we will have the Ethos and the quantum computational complexity to do so. Thank you.
1771460	1799412	70	A	0.99445	29:31	64	Thank you, shauna, amazing presentation. I'll just quickly read some comments and see if you have any thoughts from some of the great comments. So Scott David says I love the presentation, lots of Fodder for Rumination. Thank you for inviting these concepts into an intriguing choreography. Perhaps dark energy is our perception of the fact of information increase under free energy principle processes.
1799476	1803480	71	A	1.0	29:59	11	And since the universe is made of information dot, dot, dot.
1806460	1822610	72	B	0.99882	30:06	42	Scott, thank you. So, yeah, I think is a beckoning that we should work on that idea. I absolutely agree. I'm glad you're inside with these concepts. I don't really know where they go, but hopefully it's portals to something like that.
1823220	1845844	73	A	0.99732	30:23	42	Great. And then one more Scott David question does fractal identity reveal the recursivity of rhetoric language consciousness informing individual identity from community identity inputs? Yeah, that's wonderful. So, yeah, my own thought is like, what is an individual identity? Right, Scott?
1845972	1870212	74	B	0.51173	30:45	69	So the reflexivity curve has always sort of stumped me how there's so much distance between I and me. And so it ensumes this notion of continuity over time. And so I've always said, what sort of notion of time are we talking about to even have a consistent identity? Somehow you always wake up and everything is still here. Somehow you wake up and you're not a lobster.
1870296	1886724	75	B	1.0	31:10	41	I don't really understand how. That works. But yeah, that's nice. If you could use fractal to get something singular from something communal, that might be cool. But maybe fractal is something sort of like you're both at the same time.
1886922	1903128	76	B	1.0	31:26	59	And that's what I don't know yet. So I think it's a totally revolutionary way of thinking to not have a before after. So if you can construct identity without before after, then that's sort of what I'm trying to do. But, yeah, that's cool. If you want to get identity from communal, I think you can do that.
1903294	1906840	77	B	0.99991	31:43	6	They may also sort of blur.
1908880	1931356	78	A	0.5216	31:48	46	Well, this is truly food for thought, and I really hope people can live with the darkness, take it and run with it, because there's so many fun ways to go. Thank you so much. I hope so, too. So you're always welcome back. Thank you.
1931378	1935680	79	A	1.0	32:11	13	And talk to you later. Thank you so much. Bye. Good night. Bye.
