2010	92260	00:02	All right. Would you like to present and then we'll discuss? Great. Can you see the presentation? Not yet. Should I just start? Yeah, go for as long as you want, and then anyone can ask questions in the live chat.	Nikki: Would you like to present and then we'll discuss	The First Intermission
92330	227770	01:32	My presentation today will be on advances in machine theory of mind and theory ofmind. Sophistication, which is basically the depth of recursivity of beliefs that you can have about another person's mental states. Current ideas for implementing theory ofMind sophistication using active inference.

228770	424490	03:48	 Theory of mind was introduced by Primac and Woodcherf in 1978. It is the ability to impute mental states to himself and others as a system of inferences. The opposite side is called simulation theory of theory of mind, which posits that we use the same cognitive and neurological resources for understanding and predicting other agents.	What is theory of mind and how does it relate to social cognition	What is Theory of Mind?
428030	929600	07:08	The technical reason for developing computational models of theory of mind is to improve artificial social intelligence. Theory of mind models can be used to understand relevant social variations in clinical populations. There is also a need for connecting this dynamic implementational level to individual level social cognition.	Why would we be interested in creating computational models of theory of mind	Mathematics of Theory of Mind
932450	1190080	15:32	Haika is based on the Asian theory of mine by Baker et al. It adds this formalization of belief resonance which is the incorporation of beliefs about another's intentions with top down predictions. These ideas are relevant for developing active inference theory of mind.	Hierarchical active Inference for collaborative agents recently published	Active Inference for Collaborative Agents
1193100	1399080	19:53	Inferences about the self and others at different timescales facilitates interpersonal minimization of surprise and thereby optimal social decision making. These self representations could be seen as representations that inform our inferences and predictions on the fly.	Inferences about the self and others can help predict other people's behavior	Inferring the Self and Others in a Predictive Social Cogn
1400140	1515580	23:20	Key idea for both of these papers is the emergence of group behaviors from local interactions. Kaufman et al. show that you can create a system of free energy minimizing agents with some minimal properties of social intelligence. And thereby, this is a simple model of how adaptive behaviors could emerge from agents with very simple social abilities.	Two interesting papers describe the emergence of group behaviors from local interactions	Group Intelligence and Theory of Mind
1530020	1717070	25:30	Proposal for how social cognition shapes inculturation more generally. According to proposal, thinking through other minds is a property of multiple interacting agents. As this profits interactional processing, agents learn to infer each other's expectations to optimize collective behavior.	A new proposal looks at how social cognition shapes inculturation more generally	Think Through Other Minds
1718480	1909172	28:38	Sophistication is the depth of reclusivity that can be utilized for fear of mind of the form. Vada et al. uses a Bayesian model of sophisticated theory of minds with Ktom agents. The promise of modeling theoretical mind sophistication would be to investigate how people flexibly switch between different social strategies.

1909236	2155160	31:49	The Matching pennies game is a game farm economics with a very simple format. The challenger hides a penny in one of the two hands. Experiments have shown that there is a strong social framing effect in the game. This simple setup is very suited for studying fear of mind in these kinds of simple competitive interactions.

2157600	2697940	35:57	How do we distinguish between focal agents and simulated agents? Can we simulate other agents in a way that is computationally efficient? I'm very much open to feedback and comments on how this could work.	How do we distinguish between focal agents and simulated agents	Inference with recursivity
2699580	2822490	44:59	Great presentation. Very comprehensive review of a lot of the different theory of mind options. Well, if anyone has questions, they can write it in live chat. What do you want to explore?	Very comprehensive review of a lot of different theory of mind options	A Theory of Mind at the Conference
2825740	3120950	47:05	How does the structure that you laid out for the generative model capture some of those features of recursivity without falling into the trap of just theory of mind all the way down?
