1690	2960	1	A	0.96945	00:01	3	Greetings in S.
6580	19260	2	B	0.53966	00:06	15	Hello. Welcome. Hi, Daniel. Thank you. Yes, well, we're really looking forward to your presentation.
19340	23810	3	A	0.99977	00:19	10	You can share your slides and go for it. Great.
31260	38984	4	B	0.53174	00:31	13	It can you see it? Yes. Looks great. Thank you. All right, good.
39102	81300	5	B	0.99882	00:39	91	So thank you so much for having me. I'm really happy to present this paper today, and particularly because it's the very first time that I present this work. So I'm really looking forward to any feedback and any reactions to this work. OK, so the aim of this paper was to apply the free energy principle to analyze the interdependent dynamics between living systems on the one hand, and nonliving planetary processes. And this, hopefully, would, we hope, allow us to gain some insights into the future states of Gaia.
81380	132848	6	B	1.0	01:21	107	And by Gaia we're going to mean the Earth and formulate some predictions and devise potential interventions to alleviate future dysfunction on the planet. Okay? So then the lineup for the presentation is I'm first going to go over, in brief, the theory, the concept of Gaia, so known as the Gaia hypothesis. Then I'm going to go into just giving some essentials on the free energy principle, which I'm assuming that it's not really necessary, but just for the sake of the flow of my argument. Then I'm just going to present some things on the free energy principle and specifically on self organizing interacting systems.
133024	183770	7	B	1.0	02:13	110	And then I'm going to apply the free energy principle to the Gaia poses is in a sort of like comparison analysis, as in how do they, if at all, complement each other for epistemic gain? And then after having done that, this should be should allow us to inform or to gain some insights as per the human behavior in relation to Gaia or the planet Earth. Okay, so let's see how it goes. So first I want to introduce the notion of biophilia, which plays a fundamental role in this work. So biophilia came first, or came more prominently in this particular book here, and it's quite interesting.
184620	217564	8	B	1.0	03:04	84	The idea is that the relation of humanity to the rest of the natural world is essentially one of dependence. And this is very much already in the literature and the free energy principle. But more than that, there is this view of the necessity of a continued survival and flourishing that is utterly contingent upon the state and functioning of the environment. So we're talking about things like very utilitarian things like survival, flourishing, mental health, right? So individuals interact with the environment.
217692	256700	9	B	0.96249	03:37	87	So to achieve that, but then on top of that, we wanted to add another conceptual layer which is or concerns how humans possess an innate cognitive disposition towards nature, which is known and developed in this particular other field of work as biophilia. And this is the idea of the natural psychological disposition of humans to seek out and connect with other living organisms and the natural environment. So that's kind of like the idea that is encapsulated in the whole framework and theory under biophilia.
259360	302780	10	B	0.99827	04:19	101	So then this seems to if that's the case of as things are described by biophilia, then that seems to bring us to a dilemma. On the one hand, we have these natural tendencies, so to speak, of humans to engage with the natural world in a very positive and constructive way. And on the other hand we see the lack of action to protect the Earth. And here we have in mind particularly the case of the climate crisis. So in the presentation I'm going to make my way slowly towards getting to that and to better understand the dilemma.
303920	347260	11	B	0.6797	05:03	75	Okay? So let's go in brief over the Gaia hypotheses. So this is a concept that comes more prominently in James Loflock's book Gaia a New Look at Life on Earth. And the idea there is that 3.8 billion years that life has persisted on Earth and conditions have remained remarkably constant and favorable across a huge range of parameters. The Gaia hypothesis is that this consistency or constancy is a natural product of evolution.
348320	423940	12	B	0.99848	05:48	144	In a modification, however, of the canonical Darwinism, the Gaia hypothesis somewhat modifies canonical Darwinism how? Well, by thinking that rather than evolution of the individual organisms on an inert environment, what evolves is the whole Earth system with its living and nonliving parts existing as a tight coupled entity. So this is the kind of like, so to speak, refreshing or new way of thinking that somewhat reformulated a little bit of Darwinism, right? The emphasis is not how one individual organism evolves or species evolves, but the whole Earth as a system. So that's quite interesting because, for example, the view that the combined genetic wealth of information of the whole system becomes much more prominent here than the Darwinistic kind of view and this acquires characteristics that are conductive to its continued existence and in turn affect changes on the environment.
424920	488360	13	B	0.99398	07:04	124	So then, seen as a whole organism or as a whole system, one can look at Gaia or the Earth as a complex system which appears to have the goal of regulating the climate and the chemistry at a comfortable state of life. And these views and these ideas have come to gain more official expression in 2001 with the Amsterdam Declaration on Earth system science precisely endorsing this view on the planet Earth as a whole system. So then the Gaia hypothesis is a complex system in various ways because it changes in an adaptive and nonlinear way. It also displays dynamical emergent and sudden tipping behavior. And when bifurcation points are reached, the new tractor states form, new tractor states are formed.
488860	544668	14	B	0.94	08:08	117	And this means that it also self organizes and there is interdependence between the processors of the system. And finally, the Gaia hypothesis seems to be quite interesting and extraordinary in the sense that it brings together so many different fields such as ecology, climate science, cybernetics, complex systems theory, chaos, mathematics and philosophy of mine and that's just a few. All right. So then the idea is of the Gaia hypothesis is that we could look at the planet from orbit or as it is known, the overview effect. And the Gaia hypothesis offers this glimpse of a fundamentally different way of thinking of the planet, of thinking that in fact dominated mostly by human history.
544754	589764	15	B	0.99512	09:04	98	So it's a little bit of like that very inspiring clip by Karl Sagan, the Pale blue dot whereby the world is considered. So throughout the human history there's typically a tendency for the world or the planet to be considered from a single living organism, though, rather than an it. So that's the idea of overview effect and taking this overview effect to look at the planet as this whole living system rather than an it. Okay? So then we can think about the Gaia hypotheses as like Newtonian physics or even as the free energy principle.
589892	642856	16	B	1.0	09:49	102	The Gaia hypotheses can be seen much more as a framework or a method of investigation rather than a falsifiable empirical claim. So in this sense, these particular frameworks, they are and should be judged by their usefulness and not by their purported correctness with usefulness. Importantly, usefulness is to be determined by factors such as parsimony, coherence and consistency plus its empirical and epistemic power to explain phenomena, produce new facts and so on in a given context and at a given time frame. So that's the stance that we think that should be taken on the Gaia hypothesis. All right?
642878	711600	17	B	0.99928	10:42	158	So now having said a few words on the Gaia hypothesis now I'm going to just prepare the stage by saying a few words on the Fiang principle which, given the topic of this conference, needs no introduction. But for these purposes I must mention just a few things. So the Fiang principle, we take it to be the case as well that it is a methodology to understand overserved patterns of behavior sorry, observed patterns of behavior in the natural world. So then we apply the free energy principle as the tool and methodology to analyze these interdependent dynamics between living systems and planetary processes, right? Kind of like these goggles, these methodological, technical, scientific goggles that you put on to gain insights into the future states of Gaia or the Earth such as to make future formulate predictions and devise potential interventions in this particular case with the care of alleviating future potential or present dysfunction.
713460	794700	18	B	0.60953	11:53	156	Okay, so the free energy principle very much aligns with this thinking by Ewan Schwellinger and the view that the second law of thermodynamics or under the second law of thermodynamics that open systems like us should tend to dissipation. However interestingly, there are displays of this super cool thing, the negantropy, which are pockets of the universe where order and bodily integrity are maintained in the face of the surge towards chaos or towards entropy or towards dissipation. And this view of the pockets of the universe is incredibly interesting because this is where we find self organizing systems like us. And what is so peculiar that distinguishes these self organizing living systems from nonliving systems is that they have the capacity of acting upon and exchanging matter, energy or information with the environment in order to seemingly defy the second law and therefore or thereby avoid dissipation and chaos and entropy. So that's extraordinary.
795440	858210	19	B	0.99973	13:15	126	So then active inference becomes this very useful tool to tell us or to explain elucidate how these systems seemingly defy the second law, how they resist entropy, how the self organizing systems combat entropy through the interaction, maintaining their integrity via homeostasis. So then they maintain this energetic integrity. They utilize energy to stay within a specific range of states that is vital for their survival and preserving their existence. And they also engage with these feedback cycles which are the feedback actions like drinking when thirsty or moving away from heat signify working, accomplished by bound energy, contrasting with the free energy. They also define the thermodynamics, as I just mentioned, by seemingly challenging the law, they minimize entropy and safeguard their free energy.
858660	918690	20	B	0.54	14:18	114	And finally this behavior that we observe in these self organizing living systems in striving to minimize free energy is or agrees with a certain principle that we know, which is the free energy principle. Okay? So then, as I said earlier and as we know but just to keep in mind then active inference becomes a very useful tool to understand and make predictions about these coupling dynamics taking place between interacting systems, living systems. Internal states is both operationally closed and thermodynamically open to the external states creating this distinct boundary which we usually mathematically capture with Markov blanket. And then this interaction unfolds through the immediate of active and sensory states.
919320	977748	21	B	0.99992	15:19	137	Then the key point here to keep in mind is that what we want to have for adaptation and well being is that there is a balanced interaction between sensory and active states. And this is because it is within the interaction between sensory and active states that so to speak, all of the important things happen in order for the system to be well adjusted attuned adapted to the environment. So living systems avoid this dissipation. They want to remain alive, they do everything in their power, they navigate their environments in order to avoid this dissipation which is also or can be also said to minimize free energy. And they avoid their dissipation by doing either one of the two things either by changing the model or changing the world, by acting upon the world.
977914	1037620	22	B	0.99	16:17	124	And this is extremely crucial for the point that I want to make later on. So now I want to apply the Fionergy principle to the Guy hypothesis and see how that comes together in identifying and developing and why do I want to do that? I want to do that because I've also already mentioned it. But I'm just going to refresh it because I want to identify and develop interventions to rectify any potential maladaptive responses, namely actions which are antithetical to maintaining the integrity of the system. What we want is to have healthy, well adjusted adaptive systems and human behavior particularly that leads to the imbalance within the Markov blanket states, is or could be considered sometimes maladaptive or pathological.
1037700	1074992	23	B	0.99	17:17	88	And this will be the last point I'm going to make in the presentation, but for now want to focus on how does the French principle deal with the Gaia hypothesis as a self organizing system like Ruth? Just saying. The Gaia meets the requirements to be formalized as part of an active inference system. It exists in a non equilibrium steady state, which means that its processes and states must persist over time within a range of states that are far from equilibrium. That means resisting entropy.
1075136	1143640	24	B	1.0	17:55	165	And the Gaia is also distinguishable from its largest scale cosmic environment such as other planets and the rest of the universe. It is also defined by the conditional independence that we were just talking about between the internal and external stage which influence each other only vicariously. So then we can taking that into consideration, we can even see that some of the people have already done this kind of like line of reasoning, they've already run it through and they did that by employing Markov blanket to analyze the Earth's climate system dynamics, which is quite interesting. What they did was they looked at metabolic rates of the biosphere and they represented them as internal states and space weather as external states and then they looked at active states as mirrored greenhouse effect shifts and sensory states as echoed ocean driven temperature changes and then internal and external states. The idea here is that they indirectly influenced each other through ocean's delayed response.
1144240	1224716	25	B	0.97854	19:04	160	Then Earth's climate is interpreted as anticipatory minimizing variational, free energy. So we take this work and we want to take it a step further agreeing with this work and building upon this work which shows climate change, we wanted to look at the more broad understanding of Gaia through the lenses of the free energy principle. So instead of focusing on climate change, which is very brilliantly done by these researchers, we wanted to then scale it up and apply the free energy principle to understand the Gaia. So then one can think of the internal states as the biosphere geographical processes and the external states as everything that is beyond the system, such as the outer atmosphere, Celicia bodies and molten core. Then we can think of sensory states as the external environment impact such as the Earth rotation, orbit, tides affected by the sun, moon, planets, plate tectonics, climate, weather influenced by solar radiation, space weather, etc.
1224748	1294430	26	B	0.0	20:24	139	So and then we can think of the active states as Earth's adaptability and adjusting properties from external influence such as gravitational force, altars orbits, magnetic field interacts with solar winds or emission of detectable radiation influences distant objects. That's a few examples. So then I want to focus on the active states. Active states then through this lens, active states then embody its primary mechanism for self regulation, representing its efforts to remain within the bounds required for ongoing existence based on predictions about the present and future states of the system. For instance, the current levels of greenhouse and albedo effects, soil PH and the number of living organisms reflect the predictive attempts of the Gaia system to adapt to anticipated effects of solar events, volcanic eruptions, ocean salinity changes, and other environmental factors in the future.
1295280	1321620	27	B	0.99997	21:35	60	So it is in this context that the role of life itself assumes a paramount importance in the self regulation of the biosphere. Because the role of life itself, and particularly as we are going to focus on next, the human life, has a particular influence on all of these sort of already natural dynamics going on in the gaia.
1324680	1389764	28	B	0.86431	22:04	145	This allows us, before we move into the human effects, this allows us to make one final point before we move there, which is to address the criticism that has been made in this paper by Vicente Haja on the Markov blanket trick. And what they have identified is that a purported weakness of the free energy principle what we say is that a weakness of the free energy principle that is identified in this paper actually speaks in favor of its application to the Gaia hypothesis. And let me just try to explain that. So Raja and colleagues, they rightly point out that Markov Lincolns do not automatically capture every relevant property of biological systems, relational properties such as affordances. And by affordances they mean what the environment offers, the animal, what it provides, or furnishes, either good or evil fall into this bracket.
1389812	1447704	29	B	0.99923	23:09	108	So what they're saying is that Markov blanket do not automatically capture every relevant aspect of biological system such as affordances, right? And we want to point out that however, affordances correspond to Gaia as one rung in the ladder of the Nested Marco blankets within the system in question at every level ranging up from, say, cells, organs, animals, ecosystems, solar systems, the whole cosmos. And how is it that we think that this particular framework that we bring here does have or solve or address the notion of affordances? Our solar system is one that affords a living planet. So the affordance available is an environment.
1447832	1513600	30	B	0.99558	24:07	147	In an environment are not determined solely by the physical properties of the environment. And we think that this is the point that we would like to address in HaHa's paper, is that the affordances are not determined solely by the physical properties of the environment, but also by the organism's goals, abilities and previous experiences and in this case, of the sun. So what is meant here is that the sun is what has the furnaces for or what affords anything else to happen on the planet at whatever each scale, right? The physical properties of the sun as well as the goals and abilities of the organisms on earth shape the affordances that the sun provides. So it's a quite interesting way of thinking that any affordance whatsoever that we might think of that we have as living systems, they are afforded by the sun.
1513670	1556296	31	B	0.98946	25:13	82	So that's the idea. Okay, so now having gone through how the female G principle somewhat speaks to and contributes to understanding the Gaia hypotheses, then we want to focus on how human behavior has a profound effect on the dynamics that already existing in the natural world. Okay? So according to the frequencies principle, living beings have a natural tendency to act upon their environment to prevent dissipation of their integrity. So that's what we do in order to remain alive.
1556488	1580064	32	B	1.0	25:56	66	There are therefore two ways for a thing like us to minimize its free energy and thereby maintain our own integrity upon evidence. As we navigate the world and gather and observe evidence, we have two options. One is to change the model. The other one is to change the world by acting upon it, like I just said before. So then why is this relevant?
1580112	1657500	33	B	0.99958	26:20	204	Well, this is relevant because there is the possibility that in the ways in which living systems and in this particular case human beings interact and adapt to the world, there is the possibility that we see maladaptive behavior. And how would that be? Well, if it is the case that there is a rejection of the information available so as to remove the imperative for action or if it is the case that possessing the information available but we still remain or refrain from taking action, then there seems to be if the free energy principle is correct if the free energy principle is to be correct, that systems, living beings tend to act upon the world in order to remain alive and if it is the case that one rejects that kind of information and does not take action to remain alive, such as the information of the climate crisis, then we might be looking at maladaptive behavior. So if the free energy principle holds, then the observed contradictory behavior is a maladaptive state or should be seen as a maladaptive state that arises from an imbalance within the Markov blanket. And how do we see this imbalance within the Markov blanket?
1657580	1698316	34	B	0.99994	27:37	94	We see it to put it in very, very simple terms, we see it as an insulation of internal states that are not being affected by the information available outside of the system. So the influences or the interactions are occurring between internal, active and sensory states. And this is an imbalance that results in an insulation or an echo chamber effect in internal states that are impermeable to the information from or potentially existing in the external states that demands action. So then some food for thought. What can we make of this?
1698418	1751596	35	B	1.0	28:18	119	The free energy principle? If we are to use the free energy principle to model the dynamics of the relationships between humans and the environment then we think that it is possible to see the current lack of pro environmental behavior as a pathology of the human species that must receive treatment. We label this condition as Biophilia Deficiency Deficiency Syndrome. Biophilia Deficiency Syndrome and it is important for us to focus on that to construct some validity. Is useful to consider in this case other applications of the free energy principle that may be useful as an analogous case of pathology mainly conducted in psychiatry and neurology and in here and very short because I don't have time.
1751698	1804220	36	B	1.0	29:11	120	The idea is to see it as a failure to assign the right way or prediction to prediction errors. So then the free energy principle from this point of view this is a persuasive pathology because doing nothing is a base optimal response in the face of pathological attention to various sources of evidence. So evidence is ignored. So concluding and recapping according to the free energy principle living systems possess a biological encoded inclination to interact with the environment in order to survive and adapt to the environment. And despite the climate change being a pressing issue and the information being available the evidence being available proactive measures to reverse its effects are not giving the priority they deserve.
1805360	1858252	37	B	0.87223	30:05	138	This state of affairs seems to show very clearly a divergence from a natural inclination that we call biophilia or that is existing in the literature as biophilia. This discrepancy between the expected and the observed actions can be understood in the framework of the free energy principle or so we think. As an illness, it implies that systems, including human societies may form erroneous inferences that prevent them from effectively addressing the problem at hand. Now, thinking about future directions and this is my last slide current ecological imbalances could be thought of as a stuck state that require an active disturbance to bring about some change. A stuck state is a state that a system is at a local minimum where the system is at and won't get out of that state unless it is disturbed.
1858396	1895464	38	B	0.99949	30:58	95	So that's the principle in complex systems theory and we think that that's how this particular state should be looked at. But that's for future research. And what we would be calling is we would be calling for amounts to the kind of homeostatic awakening. So the sort of like getting out of this stuck state would require some kind of like omniostatic awakening a deliberately induced disruptive shift in the trajectory reflecting a prioritization of the planetary homeostasis over infinite growth or staying in the same place. And yeah, this is my last slide.
1895512	1902700	39	B	0.99997	31:35	22	Thank you so much. I would like also to acknowledge my co author Casper Montgomery. Thank you so much for your attention.
1905440	1936410	40	A	0.99016	31:45	73	Thank you. Well, a lot of ways to go. I'll just ask one question just in the years that you've been in the game how do you see the active inference ecosystem and the ways also that it's being applied to ecosystems evolving, like, over what timescales or in what ways does that really present itself to you? Slow, sadly slow. I think there's a lot of work that needs to be done.
1937180	1951260	41	B	0.99924	32:17	30	We try to do this particular one here to apply employ active inference to the planet or the Earth as a living system precisely to bring out or to overcome.
1953520	2007970	42	B	1.0	32:33	125	One is to look at this problem of the climate crisis as what we think it is, which is more of a pathology. If the free energy principle holds, then it seems that there is maladaptive behavior of the collective of the human species. So I think that there's a lot of work that can be done and that would very much be useful in the climate crisis in general. There is some other work that came out more recently by Maxwell and colleagues as well on the ecosystems, which is really cool. And I would also mention that one, and I really hope that we can pursue this line of research and employee active inference in the free energy principle to this particular case.
2009540	2054216	43	B	1.0	33:29	112	One of the things that really attracts me to the free energy principle is the capacity that it has to bring to the forefront certain laws of physics, but also the living systems navigating and interacting with their environments, which I find much more appealing than any computational framework per se. So that's what I find that it's a very useful conceptual toolkit that I think that I would really like to see more applied in the future for the climate crisis and the Earth. Great. Well, thank you so much for building on that line of work and for sharing it with us tonight. Thank you so much for having me.
2054318	2059680	44	A	0.96553	34:14	9	Till next time. See you. Thank you. Bye bye.
2063940	2069980	45	A	0.98	34:23	9	All right, well, great talk by an S. Bye.
