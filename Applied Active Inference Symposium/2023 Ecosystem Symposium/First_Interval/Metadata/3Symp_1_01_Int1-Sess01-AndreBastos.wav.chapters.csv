48270	209596	00:48	Researchers suggest that predictive coding is implemented via predictive routing. They train rhesus macaque monkeys on tasks that are more or less predictable. And then they use multilaminar probes to record across different layers. These oscillations in this communication are intimately linked to the interaction between inhibitory cells and excitatory neurons.	The title of the presentation is multilaminar Multi Area Recordings	Multilaminar Multi Area Recordings in predictive coding
209778	310664	03:29	P predictive coding is a hypothesized circuit that is especially rich in higher order areas. If there's a mismatch, that's a prediction error and the prediction error is sped forward. It can be used to drive models, drive these internal representations in order to be better over time.	Predictive coding can be used to drive models, drive internal representations	Predictive coding in the brain
310792	663100	05:10	Researchers looked at the difference between predictable and unpredictable sensory stimuli. They found that neurons were much more excitable when they were processing an unpredictable stimulus compared to predictable stimulus.	We used monkeys to train on a delayed match to sample task	Brain activity differences between unpredictable and predictable stimuli
663520	1088560	11:03	Predictive coding theory predicts that neurons that are more sensitive to unpredictable stimuli are more prepared to receive the stimulus. We think that this prediction circuit exists but uses these oscillations in order to implement what is predicted.	We tested whether enhanced signals during unpredictable samples are more present in superficial layers	Predictive coding and its neural circuitry
1088720	1696120	18:08	High frequency gamma waves and superficial layers and slower frequency alpha beta waves in these deep layers. We found a spectral laminar pattern that was highly conserved across areas. Next we'll get into which specific mechanisms might generate these oscillations and how does that inform computational modeling.	High frequency gamma waves and superficial layers and slower frequency alpha beta waves in deep layers	How do brain oscillations occur?
1699420	2230790	28:19	This next part here, I'll talk a little bit about a causal test of the predictive routing model with propofol anesthesia. As a result, these higher order areas are profoundly impaired and very reduced in their spiking activity. Emory Brown is pushing for more adoption of simple tools like EEG and spectral estimation methods by the clinic.

2231160	2563204	37:11	Andrei: Does propofol change the activity of neuronal microtubules in any interesting way? How do you see experimental work in the active inference ecosystem? What we need to be doing as a community is having more interactions between theorists and experimentalists.	How do you see experimental work in the active inference ecosystem	Andreas on the Active Inference Community
2563252	2637952	42:43	Is it possible to detect the contribution of Glia to the neural firing rate of the field potentials? That is a question that I have not considered yet. It's always good to reconsider our core assumptions, right, about the cell types that are most important to capture.	Is it possible to detect the contribution of Glia to neural firing rate	Does Glia affect the neural firing rate?
2638006	2649580	43:58	Thank you. Thank you, Andre. Super cool work. And good luck with everything. Till next bye.	Thank you. Super cool work. All right. And good luck with everything	A Taste of Andre
