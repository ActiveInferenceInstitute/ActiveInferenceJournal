18876	20070	2	A	0.9997	Welcome Avel.
20410	24466	3	A	0.5913	We have Avel Guénin-Carlut with “Embedded normativity.”
24578	26600	4	A	0.99844	So thanks Avel to you.
31370	31782	5	B	0.99932	Hello.
31836	32774	6	B	0.99994	Can you hear me?
32892	33670	7	A	0.75206	Yep.
38810	41150	8	B	0.97	And can you see the slides?
41730	44350	9	A	1	I only see the top left of the slide.
45490	49870	10	B	0.94	You only see the top just yeah.
49940	50462	11	A	0.99927	Try again.
50516	51280	12	A	0.99986	Thank you.
52710	54834	13	B	0.58168	Okay, about now?
54872	55310	14	A	0.78908	Yep.
55390	55922	15	A	0.99975	Looks great.
55976	56820	16	A	0.99982	Thank you.
57670	58740	17	B	0.5153	Okay, good.
59270	61630	18	B	0.99416	So I am Avelina Carlo.
61790	65102	19	B	0.91029	I'm interested in multiscale collective organization.
65246	68360	20	B	0.99995	This is why I came to active in France to begin with.
68810	80878	21	B	0.99	And the core question I've been asking is basically when we look at human organization, there is creative evolution, there is a change through time of the specific patterns that are enacted.
80914	83530	22	B	0.99	And this is very hard to account for.
83680	89770	23	B	1	And I have been trying to pin down more and more specifically what exactly is going on and how to model it.
89920	94554	24	B	0.99284	So this specific work is a work I wrote in the context of my PhD.
94602	108478	25	B	1	Of course, which is funded by the Escape Project, a project in cognitive archaeology that's interested in how the archaeological landscape shape cognition and vice versa.
108654	111086	26	B	1	The title of it is automated.
111118	111742	27	B	0.38033	No activity.
111806	114050	28	B	0.78977	An active inference of agency.
114630	120760	29	B	0.67454	An active inference account of agency being flesh because you will see very quickly why.
121130	127266	30	B	0.9996	So first we will go through the existing work on anchor cognition in the context of active inference.
127378	133850	31	B	0.56018	Then we'll try to expose the concept of embedded Motivity, which we introduce here and what it means.
133920	143130	32	B	1	And then we'll look at the more semiotic question around the externalization and utilization of normativity in cultural landscapes.
143470	146890	33	B	0.99201	So first encouraged cognition in active in France.
147490	149482	34	B	0.98172	So we know active inference.
149546	151070	35	B	1	I will go quickly over it.
151140	155410	36	B	1	I still need to do it because there are lookers that are not familiar.
155750	169446	37	B	0.92664	So active inference say that agents continuously predict the specific queues sensory cues they will see, and they predict the action or policy they will not take.
169548	178150	38	B	1	And they basically enact an ongoing stream of expectation that they reconstruct given upcoming signal.
178570	190714	39	B	0.9999	So this is best Akotin four in this schema which shows the agent as the nickel system, which engage through environment, through action and cessations.
190842	207780	40	B	1	And all of these specific domains, they minimize a specific function that is called free energy and whose minimization basically means there is a prerogative process going on.
208550	215250	41	B	0.98	And a core property of active inference is that it dissolves agency as we typically understand it.
215320	221218	42	B	0.99992	We don't have agents that have like an internal monologue that drives them to take decision.
221394	224182	43	B	0.99997	We have a conscious anticipation of what's going on.
224236	228460	44	B	1	And whatever an agent anticipates itself to do, it will do.
228830	237450	45	B	0.99	And so this goes for computationally satisfying but very deflationary notion of what is going on with agency.
238510	247230	46	B	0.99995	So the question then comes what is the relation between an agent and the cognitive landscape in which it evolves?
247970	297850	47	B	1	I will present very rapidly again the framework of Skill and a pioneered by Brunborg, Kierstein and Reidfield, and which says that Skill agents, which we understand as agents that understand what is going on around them, they will basically experience the world as a landscape of affordances, which is opportunities for actions and their cognition pretty much reduces to the experience of this landscape and adaptive engagement with it, which basically maximize the grip the agent has on the system and essentially for reasons we will not go over because it's math the very existence experience of this landscape.
298010	301594	48	B	1	It is equivalent to the existence of constraints over attention.
301722	314290	49	B	1	The attention that the agent gives to thing which translates the embodied expectation that are two times embodied bad the embodied expectation that the agent enacts.
314950	335642	50	B	1	And so this becomes very interesting when we cross it with the existence of enculturation in humans because the basic experience we have of affordances, of what we can do it is shaped culturally, it is shaped by interaction wherein we learn with other humans about what we do, what we can do and what we can do.
335776	341382	51	B	0.98	And this means that the basic human experience, it's thoroughly encultured.
341446	357780	52	B	0.9168	It's embedded in what Ramshed called landscape of cultural fondencies and it is embedded in cultural and material regimes of attention so ways to pay attention to things.
358390	369298	53	B	0.99	And this is a figure that comes, I believe, from this year on thinking throughout the minds where it shows basically how the action installation cycle.
369394	383370	54	B	0.99999	When we have several agents, they build a common environment that has epistemic cues on how the world is like and we are enculturated to pay attention to things in a certain manner that makes it so.
383440	397322	55	B	0.99999	We perceive and enact this landscape and so the uncultured constraint over the flow of attention because of what we saw just before the deflationary account of agency.
397466	415560	56	B	1	It means that the very expensive landscape, cultural landscape that is collectively enacted, it effectively integrates intentionality, it effectively integrates normativity in a way that clashes strongly with classical account of both.
416810	425298	57	B	0.99979	So, given this state of the art, let us look at what I mean specifically by embedded normativity.
425474	432040	58	B	0.99986	So embedded Motivity is a kind of normativity, I think you have got it.
432490	454606	59	B	0.99981	So normativity it means basically the criterions by which we judge things to be good and bad in the context of biological system they will look for specific, I don't know, chemical concentration and they will avoid other this is the phenomenon of chemotaxis, this is pretty basic and this is a form of normativity.
454798	475046	60	B	0.99994	But for humans we will typically think of laws, cultural norms, culturally shared way to judge behavior and again, at least in the context of law and choice theory we typically think there is an agent, he has access to information and will think what should I do?
475148	484010	61	B	0.6	And he will judge rationally about what is good and what is bad based on a collection of values which are internal to the agent.
484160	485820	62	B	0.99999	This is not how it works.
488030	499002	63	B	0.99999	What I call embodied Motivity is by contrast regimes of normal activity where it is the norms and value that guide the agent's behavior.
499146	501850	64	B	1	It is embedded in the material and cultural environment.
501930	519190	65	B	0.99998	So basically the agent projects a specific set of norms and value in the very experienced fitness environment and it will perceive the locus of normativity as the environment and not as a form of internal judgment.
521850	526502	66	B	0.99999	Let us look at what can exactly how embedded Motivity work.
526556	528310	67	B	0.65	It will be more concrete.
528650	533194	68	B	0.99974	So first we can materially constrain people to do things.
533312	539862	69	B	0.99949	So for example, there are roads, you can go off roads but it's harder and you can't really do that if you are a chariot.
540006	565050	70	B	0.99997	So when you have a specific pattern of roads which is constructed by cities you are pretty much constrained to follow the roads materially and for this we will talk of structural embedding and there is another regimes of mezzanomativity where we build on environments that will basically cue you suggest you into adopting specific norms and specific values.
565230	575666	71	B	0.99797	For example, Escape thinks that vertical patterns in archaeological culture they are somehow embedded within what we'd call vertical norms.
575698	584090	72	B	0.87734	So hierarchy and certification in social relationship and for this specific form of embedding we can talk of semantic embedding.
585230	599130	73	B	0.56669	What must be very clear is that we don't have structural embedding on one side and semantic embedding there are basically two mechanism, complementary mechanism in which embedded normativity occurs.
599290	611678	74	B	0.99996	If we look at city so this is impression of sumerian culture city states we have matter organization that prompts specific kind of behavior.
611774	619800	75	B	0.99963	So for example, we have a bridge and this bridge allow you constrain you to go through the river in a specific way if you are on foot.
620250	623922	76	B	0.99914	But these material constraints it is perceivable.
623986	629318	77	B	0.6065	So by seeing the bridge you will also see that you can navigate the world in this specific way.
629484	632934	78	B	0.99996	So you don't have a sparration between semantic and structural embedding.
632982	651482	79	B	0.99998	We just have two ways in which constraints of our behavior that are embedded in the environment work, and something that is core to the account of embedded non activity is, again, that it is not internal.
651546	661426	80	B	0.99977	But we need to go into more detail about what we mean by not being internal, because, of course, we're talking about agency agents constrain what agents do.
661448	668046	81	B	0.58644	It's not outside what it is is embedded.
668078	674946	82	B	0.412	In Motivity is a regime of the multivity where the norms and value, they stem from the experience of Fordance.
675058	684650	83	B	0.99875	For example, if I see fire I will not think about hey, could I put my hand in it and get my hand burn?
685550	686822	84	B	1	I think it would be painful.
686886	688074	85	B	1	I won't do that.
688272	693040	86	B	0.99994	If I even think about putting my hand in the fire I will immediately feel bad.
693410	697200	87	B	1	The normativity it's embedded in my experience of the world.
697650	706130	88	B	0.91	I feel like the fire or more specifically the possibility of putting my hand in the fire is intrinsically bad.
706200	711860	89	B	1	I do not feel there is a possibility that is neutral and then I judge to be bad.
712310	721794	90	B	0.99997	But of course this judgment does not occur outside even if I feel like it's about my affordances.
721922	728040	91	B	1	It emerges from the engagement I have with the material and cultural niche in which I find myself.
728970	742030	92	B	1	And if we want to untangle what this means precisely we will have to go into more detail into what I call the externalization internalization of many normativity.
742370	748400	93	B	0.99966	So let us look at something very simple how normativity work for embodied agents.
749010	761570	94	B	0.80315	So embodied agents, they do things hopefully in a niche that is material and this niche will be marked by the activity of my agent.
761640	773814	95	B	1	And these marks, they can then act as constraints either through structural or cementing embedding in the agent's firmament because they basically signify that in the past I wanted to do that.
773852	775800	96	B	0.99998	Maybe doing that is good.
776330	795178	97	B	0.99998	For example, we have centuries with I don't know if centuries English word but web path if animals that have legs this is actually important walk on a specific path, they will compact the earth and it will become improper to grow anything, even grass.
795354	819430	98	B	1	And you will have paths that will emerge that are pretty neat, it's pretty visible and that tell you hey, not only this earth is compact and allow you to walk on it without effort but also this has been widely judged to be a good outline for navigation in this specific environment.
819850	835850	99	B	0.52651	So the very experience of a path basically invites you you perceive the affordance of walking through the path and this is something that again can result from your own activity that can be written into development by your own activity.
837070	844790	100	B	1	And so this begs the question of how okay, there exists embedded nomativity but how do we embed nomativity?
844870	847520	101	B	1	What is the activity of embedding mativity like?
848210	852118	102	B	1	And the word I will use for that is externalization.
852314	860994	103	B	0.99893	We perceive the world because we externalize specific causes of sensation into an imagined objective external world.
861192	865358	104	B	0.99896	So when we see the path, we see a path.
865454	872726	105	B	0.51622	We do not see compact earth that we then compute to mean that other things have worked on it.
872748	874786	106	B	0.9999	We just see hey, there is a path.
874978	880650	107	B	0.99	And this is because we have externalized a specific cognitive kind which is the path.
881710	903578	108	B	0.97	And this is argument that several people made here lene Steiner, which if I remember well, worked on the production of devices that help blind people see things through, I believe an array of repetitive device on their shoulder.
903754	918710	109	B	0.99995	So the core argument they make is that if you give people that they will start seeing things, they will start perceiving things as being before them rather than having vibration on the shoulder and then thinking about what does it mean.
918860	937050	110	B	0.9	And so the basic argument is that perception is just picture of what cause we infer, what is the structure we infer of our environment given the existence of a specific coupling device that relates action to sensation and vice versa.
937870	943566	111	B	0.99	And this critically relies on the internalization of specific.
943748	948186	112	B	0.99993	We could say a lot of things that I will say priors specific, priors knowledge and perception.
948378	958820	113	B	0.99668	So me seeing the path as a path relies on me having the prior knowledge that there is such a thing as paths and I should be expecting to see them around.
959830	967658	114	B	0.98	And so you have duality of externalization and internalization in the production of embedded mativity.
967774	982250	115	B	1	I can only see norms out there if I've internalized integrated a specific apparatus of perception that entails that there are indeed those specific norms that are embedded in those specific affordances.
983230	989770	116	B	0.56	And so this produce a more general question of semantics, particularly of information theory.
990130	994000	117	B	0.99989	How do reading and writing and reading maturity works?
995330	1010450	118	B	0.99978	So when I extend lies I treat the world as having specific natural categories that I pretty much imagine and I can use them because I imagine them as an extended memory that allow me to read and write normative cues.
1010870	1014826	119	B	0.50761	This can be letters, pure signs.
1014878	1019234	120	B	0.99912	But as far as I'm concerned here, all signs are at least implicitly normative.
1019282	1021960	121	B	0.50761	There about how you should interpret the sign.
1022730	1034234	122	B	1	And this means that we can experience specific landscape of forensics and we can write things out there.
1034272	1038966	123	B	1	We can write normative cues, bio behavior that will then constrain further behavior.
1039078	1046670	124	B	1	But nothing tells us that we can communicate through this.
1046740	1050810	125	B	1	The communication, it works because of the internalization of prayers.
1050890	1067122	126	B	0.99999	If a given community of agents have internalized a specific set of prayers that is, a set of prayers that enable externalization of numerative cues, then only it can use the environment as a way to write and read.
1067176	1072040	127	B	0.83831	Normative queues as embedded normativity thing.
1072730	1077106	128	B	1	And this communication, it can be read in terms of information theory.
1077138	1079110	129	B	0.82	Of course it can be read in terms of semantics.
1079190	1101166	130	B	0.9999	But what is critical to analyze that the process of internalization there is no trust system there is no private key that allow you to be sure that the way you internalize norms is very specifically the way in which the Emily Mativity was encouraged to begin with.
1101268	1112180	131	B	0.99981	There is a loss, or there is ambiguity, or there is I'd rather say it like this an active demarch of reconstruction, of given prayers by the agent.
1112710	1131318	132	B	1	And so this gap between the intent of other communicants and my intent, my understanding of what they meant by their active engagement with the world, it builds a tiny gap in information that is somehow enough to drive the open ended evolution of cultural landscape.
1131494	1144350	133	B	0.98	And this is something that I do not think is embedded in active in France and I think is of major interest to research, to the research at least in the evolution of open end evolution of cultural landscape.
1144770	1156130	134	B	0.99919	So to sum up things, I just presented a paper that is called anomaly Motivity and that speaks unsurprisingly of embedded normativity.
1157350	1170786	135	B	1	First major point is that if active inference is correct, then our notion of agency is dissolved essentially in the notion that we can perceive and enact cognitive landscape.
1170898	1172600	136	B	0.38869	Umvelt, if you want.
1173690	1184918	137	B	0.98	And given that this is the case, we will experience the norms and value that guide our behavior as a property of the cognitive landscape.
1184934	1194830	138	B	0.88538	We experience the affordance that we can perceive and this specific regime of normativity I call embedded normativity.
1195970	1200702	139	B	1	And the third thing is that you have a critical thing going on.
1200756	1231110	140	B	1	You have a semiotically constraining thing going on in the externalization and internalization of regimes of embedded mativity because those two things they respectively enable embedded Motivity to exist, to have a causal power and they enable also the open ended evolution of the norms that are embedded in a given landscape in a given material landscape and therefore the open end evolution of the asseted, cultural or committee landscape.
1231690	1233046	141	B	0.99994	So thank you.
1233228	1243520	142	B	1	I will enroll my references slides in case someone really needs to know what the reference is and is ready to move around the video for this.
1244210	1245920	143	B	0.99	And do you have questions?
1247570	1248174	144	A	0.99954	Awesome.
1248292	1248686	145	A	0.9999	Thank you.
1248708	1257730	146	A	0.65111	Avel, while people are typing any questions, could you maybe just give a little introduction to the active inference for the Social Sciences course?
1257800	1265334	147	A	0.96396	Like, what brought you to want to facilitate this effort and where are we at and where do you want it to go?
1265372	1266840	148	A	0.99787	What do you want it to be for?
1270840	1272630	149	A	0.44	Oh, mute and then continue.
1276280	1277076	150	B	0.99983	Good point.
1277178	1277990	151	B	0.99678	Thank you.
1278520	1301020	152	B	1	The Active Inference Institute organizes and kerose Research organize a course on active inference in the social science that is based essentially in explaining the basic demarch, the basic hypothesis and the consequences of the cultural landscape formalism that I hinted at slightly in this presentation.
1302000	1321300	153	B	1	The goal of the course is to give basic ontology that is an interface between complexity science, let us say physics, written large cognitive science and social science to afford interdisciplinary collaboration in the social science and in the study of the evolution of human societies.
1321720	1325956	154	B	1	And I think it is cool, but I'm biased because I've missed it.
1325978	1332150	155	B	0.85188	So maybe you should ask Daniel, which is absolutely unbiased, whether the course is cool.
1333340	1335176	156	A	0.52309	I've been enjoying it a lot.
1335358	1339320	157	A	0.99994	We just finished last week with my section on collective behavior.
1339900	1345100	158	A	1	First we had the introduction lecture from you, then Ben White on the basics of being an active agent.
1345250	1350776	159	A	1	And we have Lorena and Mao's sections upcoming, as well as your more dedicated session.
1350888	1362304	160	A	0.99125	Yeah, it's been a really fun experience and it's going to provide a really useful missing piece in the ecosystem, I guess.
1362342	1363890	161	A	0.99998	Just one question.
1364900	1373984	162	A	1	How do we take some of these topics you're bringing in about the embedded normativities and think about them digitally?
1374112	1387540	163	A	0.66481	Like, are we talking about conceptual embeddedness in information environments and or are we talking about the ergonomics of sitting at our desk?
1387620	1405920	164	A	1	Or how do we bring that kind of pleasure path stigma g on the ground into the digital are we talking about something that's embodied and embedded in the information space or are we still talking about bodies?
1409440	1415720	165	B	0.99916	So if we talk about humans, we talk about bodies with the brain that do things in a mature environment.
1415880	1423740	166	B	0.97434	But your question is I'm not sure understood is how can we bring this specific concept in the study of digital phenomena?
1423820	1424476	167	B	0.67	I cannot.
1424588	1426160	168	B	0.96239	Twitter internet.
1426660	1427696	169	A	0.99313	Is that it?
1427798	1428160	170	A	0.91403	Yeah.
1428230	1440848	171	B	0.60676	Okay, so you have basically the whole study on the affordances, the discipline of design has incorporated a while ago the national affordance in its structure.
1441024	1448340	172	B	0.99	And most of the study in the digital design centers are on what platforms afford or do not afford.
1449000	1459452	173	B	0.99	And you have richer stance when you take into account not what you can do with a specific interface, but what the specific interface invites you to do.
1459586	1484884	174	B	0.99972	Given a set of cultural written large, it can be self learning, but given a set of power that you share with the platform in a way that is formal but indirect yes.
1484922	1490004	175	B	1	I would look at it in terms of user interface design.
1490202	1496810	176	B	1	I think this concept specifically is useful for interface design.
1498380	1505572	177	B	0.54616	Then you have implicitly the question of the flow that platforms such as, I don't know, twitter.
1505636	1515736	178	B	0.99096	Facebook how specific structure environments bring specific collective dynamics that may be a bit richer.
1515928	1518108	179	B	0.99997	Not richer specifically, but that may go in.
1518114	1530028	180	B	0.83	A direction that the user face question do not go into and that can still be modeled in terms of constraints and therefore in terms of embedded normativity.
1530204	1531952	181	B	0.99995	Is that on point?
1532006	1533270	182	B	0.47868	We'll go to your question.
1536280	1542992	183	A	0.99994	Yeah, that's interesting about what the interface does and then what it invites.
1543056	1544730	184	A	1	It might invite things.
1546060	1551880	185	A	0.99998	In order for that invitation to be fulfilled, it has to actually provide that possibility.
1552380	1556924	186	A	0.99997	But it might invite things that aren't relationally possible.
1557042	1564476	187	A	0.99675	Like there might be a wall which invites climbing to a given observer, yet they cannot climb it.
1564658	1584244	188	A	1	And then on the other side is a capacity that isn't invited and that is the adjacent possible of tool use where something that was being used for this purpose, it's like all of a sudden it just fell out of someone's hand.
1584282	1588016	189	A	1	They grasped it a different way, it invited a different engagement.
1588048	1597450	190	A	0.97	And then that can become re entrenched and that points to that sequential making and breaking of new spaces that your work has featured over the last few years.
1598300	1599240	191	B	0.69891	Yes, exactly.
1599310	1612620	192	B	0.99998	This work has been developed while thinking about tool use, while thinking about cognitive archaeology, while thinking about the experience of cities, the way urbanism prompts specific behavior.
1613600	1618590	193	B	0.99957	But if I can get back on the Internet thing, I'd like to make it more specific.
1619060	1623760	194	B	0.99308	So the interface design, as far as I know is focused on interface.
1624420	1632068	195	B	0.99946	That is not surprising, but in doing so it is focused on specific fordance and what you can do.
1632234	1637952	196	B	1	You have another layer in ecological psychology, which is the layer of solicitation.
1638016	1653156	197	B	0.98473	So, for example, Twitter does something very specific, which is when you log in, it shows you the number of notifications you have, then it removes it and you have to wait to know which were those notification.
1653268	1658652	198	B	0.87	And you have to wait not 1 second, not 1 minute, but a random amount of time.
1658786	1661704	199	B	0.99995	So this is what they call dark patterns.
1661752	1667816	200	B	0.96841	They are patterns in design that are explicitly designed to create addiction.
1667928	1682804	201	B	0.9999	So this is a layer you can't afford in affordance, because from an affordance perspective there is just a moment you can access the information and then a moment you can't, and then the moment you can again, there is nothing going on.
1682922	1695768	202	B	0.99999	If you don't look at intrinsic motivation and the way specific structure, environment is perceived, the semantics, maybe the meaning that given landscape has for an agent.
1695934	1708764	203	B	0.99	And even if you look at this, you are still looking at the platform in a way that is embedded from the specific patterns, that specific patterns of things that people do on the platform.
1708962	1726640	204	B	0.99964	If you have Twitter without the aggressive QRTs and the way to aggressively signal that you are in whatever it is, is going on, you don't have Twitter much, you have Mastodon maybe that has very similar affordances and very dissimilar solicitation.
1727460	1732356	205	B	0.98611	So this is why you have to take multiscale account of things.
1732378	1745640	206	B	1	And when you take multiscale account of things you have to look at the semiotics basically behavior, how specific coordination occur at specific scales around specific communication, specific message passing.
1746220	1767290	207	B	1	And once you look at how specific message become meaningful to specific agent, you have a problem basically because this is subjective, this is constructed through the activity of the agent and whatever is the range of time you are looking at, you will have the construction of new possibilities of adjustment possibles as you put it.
1767900	1776720	208	B	0.79	And and yeah, this is the big question that I think we are missing at the moment in active inference.
1778260	1778864	209	A	0.99992	Awesome.
1778982	1780620	210	A	0.99903	Well, thank you for this presentation.
1780700	1787810	211	A	0.99997	Thanks for the social sciences work and we're all looking forward to seeing how the projects play out.
1788980	1789536	212	B	0.9991	Thank you.
1789558	1790428	213	B	0.9243	Goodbye.
1790604	1791420	214	A	0.97327	Farewell AVO.
