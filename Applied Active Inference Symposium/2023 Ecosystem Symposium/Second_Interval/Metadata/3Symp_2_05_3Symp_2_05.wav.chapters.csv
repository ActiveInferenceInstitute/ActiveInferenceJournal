Following this 30 minutes presentation, we'll have Avel Gwynen Carlo on embedded Normativity.	Ralph Kaufman will give a presentation on Gaia, an active powered network	Gaia: an active powered network for planetary sense-making
108026	178810	01:48	How do we make sense of what's going on in our planet and all scales? And how do we use that understanding to survive as a species? I plan to convince you that this is the single most important thing you could ever be working on. And I'm doing this because we need your help.	I'm going to talk about the single most important application of active entrance	Active Entrance

The design goal is to build resilience and stabilization into our biosocial economic system. And how this connects to other architectures that already exist in the world.	The Guy Consortium is developing a decentralized AI network for planetary decision support and automation	A decentralized network for the future of humanity
843190	1159670	14:03	Our main focus as an organization has been on modeling agroecological projects like regenerative agriculture and agroforestry. The concept is that we have project nodes that correspond to many farms that are also connected to a common metaanalysis model. This can be used to validate claims about projects performance and to estimate future performance.

1160280	1540428	19:20	We have some proof of concepts that we can actually build active agents that are made of active agents. How does this scale to global goals and how does this actually get used for scalably building into the fabric of decisions in our society. And we need your help to tackle the remaining challenges.	What we should be refocusing on is creating and refining solutions everywhere	Solving the Climate Crisis with Active Agents
1540604	1643008	25:40	How will you deal with the challenges of scaling given the dependence on real world entities like humans for major metacrisis domains? Ultimately, this needs to be an enabler. This needs to meet people where they are. Change is not going to happen overnight.	How will you deal with the challenges of scaling given the dependence on humans	Scaling to a Metacrisis
1643094	1846400	27:23	What are the greatest challenges or frictions for the Gaia Consortium? It's going to take a while to build trust with everybody. We are very early stage, very formative, and still very client. We want to engage with you on different paths, forward.	What are currently the greatest challenges for Gaia as an organization	What are the greatest challenges facing the Gaia Consortium?
