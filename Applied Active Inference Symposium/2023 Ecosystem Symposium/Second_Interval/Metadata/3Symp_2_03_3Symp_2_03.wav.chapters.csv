Let us know how we can support.	Our next session is with Bert DeVries and Dmitri Baghev	Inference Agents: User-Friendly Design

What we are about what we've been working on is to try to automate the inference task.	We are interested in developing a toolbox for active inference	Inventing a neural network with active inference

Any serious model is factorized, like the brain is almost empty.	Bayesian inference involves computing very large sum of products	Bayesian Inference with message passing
1077430	1589490	17:57	Message passing is the most effective way of doing inference. Some very clever people have written very clever algorithms of doing this much faster. But a better system is what we call reactive message passing.	Message passing is the most effective way of doing inference	Inclination with message passing
1589650	1793420	26:29	In order to automate inference, you must do message passing. Arctinfur works in the way that I've just discussed. It tries to minimize constraint, better free energy. Now, it's not done, but it's functional and like to show some demos.	In order to automate inference, you must do message passing	Infer automating with the ARX Toolbox
1793950	2468080	29:53	Baghaiv: In order to automate active inference, we need to automate Bayesian inference. We use reactive message passing to run actual variational Bayesian inferred. Our goal is eventually to be able to deploy these kind of systems, not just prototype.

2474760	2901796	41:14	Bert: We are working to make active inference in real time. We need a really good toolbox that really automates this. Arcs Infer will be one of the first toolboxes to do that. And once we have a toolbox like that then we can actually deploy agents in the field.	Bias Lab is working on making active inference real time	Inferring with active inference
