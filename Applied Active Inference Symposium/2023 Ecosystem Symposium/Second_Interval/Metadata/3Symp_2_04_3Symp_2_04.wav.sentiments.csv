10880	11430	A	0.5664745569229126	Right.
14640	15790	A	0.4896697998046875	All right.
20680	34000	A	0.8703470230102539	For the next interval, we are in the section hosted by the Active Inference Institute on our recent paper, active Inference Institute and the Active Inference Ecosystem.
34160	37624	A	0.7998773455619812	So two short messages.
37712	43836	A	0.8873054385185242	First, if you're in the live chat, I'll post the link right now to the paper.
44018	48680	A	0.8082595467567444	And this can be more of like a conversational interval.
48840	61788	A	0.8865545988082886	So if you have any questions about the ecosystem or the institute or any of the stuff that we're talking about, let's make it a conversation.
61964	62912	A	0.7381213903427124	And then second message.
62966	82090	A	0.5731909871101379	If there are any co authors on this paper who are listening to this stream, then message me on discord or post in the YouTube live chat or just check your calendar, and I expect some others to join in as we go.
84060	85508	A	0.8330117464065552	Welcome, Pablo.
85684	91864	A	0.8017453551292419	We'll be hearing in a little bit from you as a presenter.
91992	101970	A	0.9202404022216797	Is there anything that you want to just bring up or reflect on before I share the screen with the paper and we just walk through it, explore it and hear questions?
109140	114350	A	0.6268246173858643	It okay.
127500	128712	A	0.7811155915260315	I'll bring in the paper.
128766	138116	A	0.6273165941238403	And again, anyone watching live, please just feel free to write any questions, and I'm just going to bring it so that Pablo.
138148	143720	A	0.8479848504066467	You're not going to see the paper, but it's on the live stream.
146700	150850	A	0.8075199127197266	All right, cool.
159090	160400	A	0.49129629135131836	Well, here we go.
161090	173662	A	0.9757065773010254	This is a paper that had an awesome co authorship and even broader circles beyond the listed co authors of collaboration and contribution.
173726	189480	A	0.785329282283783	So just like everything that has happened and will happen in our work, it was massively participatory and a real learning by doing and a real enactment moment.
190570	199590	A	0.9023023843765259	The first version was released three days ago on Saturday, August 19, and I'll briefly just list all the authors.
199670	209662	A	0.7778798341751099	First, we had the institute as the first author so that the citation can always remain like institute et al.
209796	213498	A	0.8632382750511169	Institute, comma active Inference institute.
213674	220194	A	0.8660169243812561	And we also had Andrea Guire, John Boyk, Lieber Burian, matthew Brown, RJ Corday, scott David david S.
220232	237298	A	0.9256207346916199	Douglas, Pablo Fernandez Macchia, Daniel Friedman, holly Grimm, Avele Gwynen, carlo Maria, Louisa Ayenico, virginia Blue Knight, alexandra Mikhailova, Ali Ramju Adil Razi, jacob Smith, rene Tamari, dean Tickles and Alex Viakin.
237394	261280	A	0.8278361558914185	So this includes everyone from founders and officers and board of directors and formal participants on different projects and different roles as volunteers or facilitators or interns, and also people who are continuing to join the fun and show up and makes the institute in our field what it is and what it can be, what we want it to be.
264210	268398	A	0.5387020707130432	There's a table of contents for those who like to click through.
268564	271806	A	0.9058446884155273	And just broadly, there's going to be a preamble on active inference.
271838	290150	A	0.7345015406608582	But outside of the preamble, this paper is not conceptual, it is not technical, it is not philosophical, although perhaps it can be read in all of those ways, but it's quite a logistical, historical, and vision oriented position document.
291610	295814	A	0.8799757361412048	After getting some of the active inferences out of the way in the preamble.
295942	320900	A	0.8235560059547424	We're going to turn to the institute itself in terms of our vision, values, principles, and how we see moving through the challenges that we're facing right now onto the specific history of the institute, our current organization model in terms of our governance and leadership structure, as well as the institute units, the organizational units that support all the work we do.
321350	340950	A	0.8401505947113037	We then turn out to the community and ecosystem growth and development and go through some details of different roles that our stakeholders and participants in our space and some of the tools that we use today for managing information and message passing.
341450	355850	A	0.8147356510162354	We talk a little bit about our communications plan, internal and external, both sides of the blanket, and point towards some of the types of support, infrastructure and administration that we do and that we will offer for the active inference ecosystem.
356010	375058	A	0.6685115098953247	We frame that in terms of continual deployment, continual development and quality, performance and growth evaluations across multiple scales, close with some discussion and then provide an appendix that overviews a variety of the open source services that the Institute has provided over the past.
375224	377762	A	0.736875057220459	So let's just jump in.
377816	386162	A	0.5472791790962219	I'm actually going to jump into the open source services first and overview them before we jump back up to the top and look at the big picture.
386306	399978	A	0.9206854104995728	Because this is really to appreciate the work of so many contributors who stepped up in the uncanny valley, in the gray zone, in the ecosystem, as it's forming, as it's always forming, and really made it happen.
400064	410814	A	0.577106773853302	And so many people we know are out there scribbling or taking notes or printing out papers by Friston at all or struggling and asking questions, are there applications of this?
410852	411662	A	0.6878092288970947	How would this matter?
411716	412814	A	0.5614160895347595	Why would this matter?
412932	414350	A	0.8949224352836609	Is there a code version of this?
414420	415918	A	0.8542435765266418	How do you connect the dots between these?
416004	417906	A	0.7883865833282471	Like, those are what we ask every day.
417928	426594	A	0.7553197741508484	And so when people can combine their regimes of attention into a synthetic intelligence outcome, then we go so far.
426792	432786	A	0.8029571175575256	So the first category of works that the Institute has developed are educational.
432978	436102	A	0.8010155558586121	We've done video live streams since the end of 2020.
436156	439270	A	0.7968745827674866	Till now, more than 370 live streams.
439610	445686	A	0.8456140160560608	All live streams are curated in terms of their transcript.
445878	456140	A	0.752453625202179	And we increasingly are developing automated and semiautomated methods for transcription, translation, sub, captioning, language modeling and so on.
456670	458702	A	0.8673183917999268	We've had textbook groups actually.
458756	465390	A	0.8619439005851746	Now, as of now, we have three completed cohorts of the active inference textbook group, the 2022 textbook.
465970	474946	A	0.7288643717765808	We have two courses that are being offered that are produced by external content developers, and both of these have only started in the last three, four months.
475048	486162	A	0.8622050881385803	First is Chris Fields's, physics is Information Processing, and second is the work spearheaded by Avel and co organized with Kairos Research, active inference in the social sciences.
486226	492414	A	0.9809743762016296	Both of these are like awesome and great learning experiences, as we heard from earlier in the symposium.
492482	511962	A	0.91866135597229	We're working with Sanjeev Namjoshi on his incredible textbook, although almost to call it a textbook is to either think more broadly about textbooks than one has or constrain what it really is that he's doing, because it's such a unique, real research development, full spectrum effort.
512026	516880	A	0.9727063775062561	So I'm really looking forward to seeing how this plays out in 2024.
517570	527886	A	0.6577503085136414	Until then, for those who want to get involved with the testing that we do and we've developed the Active Inference Ontology, which is a critical resource for the ecosystem.
527998	538870	A	0.6851695775985718	It enables us to center accessibility, rigor and applicability across languages and settings by knowing what it is that we're talking about when we talk about active inference.
539530	548380	A	0.6751715540885925	On the research side, we've also developed the Ontology in a research direction in terms of research on and about and with active inference itself.
549390	559082	A	0.9166037440299988	As far as software goes, our primary development, first off, has been the documentation and connecting the dots around some of these other incredible packages that others are developing.
559226	580322	A	0.5944395065307617	For example, just in this symposium, we've heard from some of the core developers and open source contributors to Pymdp, the Python package for generative modeling, as well as just a couple of minutes ago from Bert de Fryes and Dmitry Bagueev coming from the Julia language RX and FIR side.
580376	583486	A	0.6041363477706909	And both of those are some of the leading packages for applying active inference.
583518	586786	A	0.7160492539405823	So we do a lot of work to connect those dots and make it more accessible.
586898	591362	A	0.5849093198776245	Not everybody is going to jump in with all 6ft to a programming language.
591506	603446	A	0.7566177845001221	And what we've done with Active Blockfriends, with the work of Jacob Smekal and others, is to wrap generative models from active inference inside of the complex systems modeling framework Catcat.
603638	626690	A	0.5318735837936401	We've developed notation interoperability systems that actually let us pull back one layer from the implementational details themselves, for example, of RX infer or of Pymdp, so that we can bring it halfway to where the ontology and the visualization and the natural language exists, and then use language models and other techniques to deploy it in an implementation fashion.
627030	629650	A	0.6126164197921753	We've developed a host of research publications.
630570	651002	A	0.9651399254798889	We support people in all of their different stages of their career, different seasons of life, and some really creative work has been directly produced through an institute project or somebody who knows may have gotten good ideas or good feedback just by hanging out, being in the game.
651136	662170	A	0.8942947387695312	And we performed literature metaanalyses to help grapple with the scope and the quantity and the quality of what is unfolding before our eyes or before our antenna.
662250	678770	A	0.6044628024101257	Again, even as we only so partially sample this ocean of information, we're active in standard setting and continue to develop our qualification standards for active inference that could be the basis of education, research and professional development.
679610	692338	A	0.5203273892402649	We provide a variety of mentorship and facilitation service type activities, including volunteer program, internship program, distributed facilitation, and applied active inference symposia.
692514	698950	A	0.8106040358543396	These activities, just as all others that we're describing above, are open source, and they're also open to your participation.
699030	720942	A	0.9385764002799988	So if you can follow some of those suggestions by JF time boxing and prioritize and pay attention and be active, all those fun things that he said, and you're looking to do it in a semi structured way with a volunteer program, or in a more structured way with the internship, then I heartily encourage people to get involved.
721086	722100	A	0.7040001153945923	Act now.
722950	731182	A	0.9056528806686401	And in terms of governance activity, we have a scientific advisory board as well as a board of directors.
731326	736946	A	0.9242490530014038	And together with the officers, those groups constitute the formal governance structure of the Institute.
736978	744586	A	0.8941711187362671	But there's also so much more to it, and we look forward to understanding what ecosystem governance can look like in the coming years.
744768	746534	A	0.9595526456832886	So welcome, Dean.
746662	749354	A	0.8132340312004089	I just summarized the work itself.
749552	752310	A	0.6822202205657959	That was the preamble.
752470	761278	A	0.9010458588600159	And now if you'd like to say hi, you or Pablo, before we jump into more sections of the paper or look at more questions that people have asked, how goes it?
761284	763998	A	0.897252082824707	Or what was your experience of working with the paper?
764084	770420	A	0.8307061195373535	Or what brings you onto this strange stream at this opportune time?
773030	790840	B	0.8365391492843628	Basically why I'm here is because for the first time, even as an acting board member with the Institute, I was able to get a better sense of the kind of depth that we aspire to.
791370	805478	B	0.6318244338035583	And I'm not sure whether or not we are going to be I really don't know what directions we're going to be going in the next coming months, weeks, years, et cetera.
805654	815694	B	0.816753089427948	But I have a better sense now, as a result of participating in this development exercise, of what the potential is than I probably had at any time.
815732	820882	B	0.6336766481399536	And I've been with the Active Inference Institute for a couple of years, so that's saying something.
820936	832438	B	0.8417155742645264	I think we had to get to this point to be able to write this document, and now it's acting as a bit of a springboard now which way we go and how we land.
832524	839480	B	0.8177025318145752	I'm not still certain about what that looks like, but I think that's part of what the really interesting thing is.
839930	846166	B	0.823253870010376	We seem to have moved away from the dock, and now the real journey begins.
846278	848380	B	0.7791013717651367	So that's my take on it so far.
850190	867114	A	0.8576054573059082	Moving away from the dock, dock pushing off, using it as a springboard, continuing the adventure, leaving the preprint behind, continuing to version it as a living document and also wayfinding outside of the doc.
867242	868110	B	0.7197482585906982	Pablo.
874290	875566	A	0.5226976275444031	Oh, wait, I don't hear you yet.
875588	876270	A	0.7197482585906982	Pablo.
878850	880990	C	0.6810936331748962	Sorry, I was mute.
881410	881894	C	0.5208580493927002	Hello.
881972	890710	C	0.9697322845458984	It was a great experience to go through the document and review it and reread it and thinking about it.
890860	901880	C	0.9889616370201111	Actually, it's a living document, which is super exciting, and I keep taking notes and hopefully act on it in the future.
903530	929666	C	0.9767550826072693	And it's been a super experience to find so many people with the same interest, same interest and some values that I really think are going to be the basis of organizations on the future.
929848	932760	C	0.9821825623512268	So I think we are doing something very cool here.
934170	934726	A	0.84200119972229	Cool.
934828	943640	A	0.8388523459434509	All right, well, let's just walk through some of the sections in the 25 minutes that we have.
944430	949258	A	0.5385005474090576	Again, the paper is being shown on the stream, but Dean And probably don't see it.
949424	954890	A	0.8765727281570435	So we kicked off with a preamble.
955390	972302	A	0.7822424173355103	We wanted to introduce active inference as briefly as we could and point towards the fundamental first principles and physics based nature of active inference and initially point towards its integrative capacity in principle.
972446	979090	A	0.8056458234786987	And then in the second paragraph, there's about 104 citations in this paragraph.
979430	987160	A	0.8052070736885071	And that's where it's really only a sampling of the domains, 21 domains here.
987530	999558	A	0.850320041179657	So it's a place where we can point to where is active inference being applied, or how is active inference being applied, or how is it different or better than another approach in a given setting?
999654	1011550	A	0.7712396383285522	Which isn't to say that it does everything in all settings for all people at all times and all of that, but this is to say that here's where one can look to find out more and even just building.
1011620	1013600	A	0.5147966146469116	This and bringing it all together.
1014210	1024820	A	0.8699360489845276	We see so many opportunities for epistemic resources in the ecosystem and having real time literature analyses and all these kinds of services that we want to provide.
1027750	1053398	A	0.7315949201583862	Starting on page five, we turn to the institute itself and we write as of August 2023, the Active Inference Institute is a registered nonprofit organization tasked with identifying, establishing, and managing the sustainable implementation of administrative and governance functions to give components of the active inference ecosystem coherent forms and reliable channels of communication.
1053574	1062058	A	0.5764657855033875	Two, publishing and licensing protocols that establish open and fair use and effective dissemination of community products within and beyond the ecosystem.
1062234	1072014	A	0.6246552467346191	Three, services at the scale of individual humans and the community at large so that stability is protected while risk and uncertainty are minimized within the ecosystem.
1072062	1082834	A	0.5232645869255066	And four, organization and operation of cyber and cognitive security systems that ensure productivity, inclusivity accessibility, and safety in discourse.
1082882	1093734	A	0.7555333971977234	In collaboration, figure one gives a graphical representation, just one of how we are now.
1093852	1102678	A	0.5110260844230652	And for those who want to dig more, check out the 2022 Active Inference textbook where you'll also find a golden ring.
1102854	1107326	A	0.8336232304573059	And we kind of took that graphical motif and ran with it.
1107348	1110846	A	0.9606041312217712	Had a lot of fun and a lot of interpretations there.
1111028	1117200	A	0.915252149105072	So just here looking at figure one, Dean or Pablo just want to add anything?
1121040	1122140	A	0.7568445205688477	Yeah, Dean.
1124400	1141028	B	0.7595036625862122	So one thing about the building of this document with a whole bunch of authors, it's often not made explicit, but there are two aspects to learning about yourself.
1141114	1149780	B	0.5227499008178711	One is to actually throw some stuff down on paper because you believe certain things need to be included.
1149940	1153864	B	0.8368307948112488	And then the second part is the consolidation process.
1154062	1180012	B	0.8848922848701477	And I think one of the most interesting consolidation processes was this graphic, because I think what it does is it tries to condense as much as possible and yet still remain coherent around what the relational aspects that we are trying to make available are, as opposed to, this is what we've captured.
1180076	1184610	B	0.7049558758735657	Now look what our graphic designer came up with.
1185160	1196336	B	0.8675490617752075	So if you've had a chance to kind of look at this and really analyze it and think about the layers and think about, okay, so what's the background here?
1196458	1197956	B	0.8337540626525879	What's the foreground?
1198148	1201880	B	0.8819664716720581	Does this representation allow for a swapping?
1202220	1217980	B	0.7330327033996582	Can we have things that appear to be background or fundamental basis stuff that could actually be things that we are addressing in the moment versus those things which we look at as particulars, that, in fact, are generalities?
1218320	1220428	B	0.5589376091957092	So, again, it's one of those things.
1220594	1221340	B	0.5666733384132385	I don't know.
1221410	1231760	B	0.7992660999298096	Daniel probably knows whether it's a Where's Waldo's thing or some sort of artist that came up with some strange twist on things.
1231830	1244336	B	0.7600350975990295	But the bottom line is, spend a few minutes, have a look, because you'll want to go through your own building of what these relationships are, and you'll also want to be able to consolidate.
1244528	1258120	B	0.7718521952629089	I wasn't there when this representation was built, but I do know that I want to be able to both look at it, do a comparative analysis to what I think the Institute should be, and then be able to consolidate.
1260700	1261160	A	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
1261230	1261464	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1261502	1270430	A	0.7360073328018188	Just a few notes on this and to give a visual overview, since it may be clearer to see this than go through the prose that essentially describes it as much later on.
1271200	1278624	A	0.7466610074043274	The golden ring represents the active inference ecosystem, and I think we could talk about golden rings for a long time to come.
1278742	1288464	A	0.7683048248291016	But coming in from the ecosystem on the bottom bottom for the reader, not from the other side of the table, are the projects.
1288512	1292368	A	0.6528273820877075	And all the projects are participatory endeavors.
1292464	1299112	A	0.9001007676124573	They're happening behind, on, and in front of the golden ring, depending on how you look at it.
1299246	1315576	A	0.7289512753486633	And that is the appendix and all of those different projects that we talked about and all of the iterations and new threads that I know that we're going to see in an hour and I know that we're going to see in a month and in a year and in a century.
1315768	1330576	A	0.7756903171539307	And those projects are being supported through two units, kind of like a department, but an organizational unit, one centered on education and one centered on research.
1330758	1335464	A	0.8660599589347839	The education unit is called Educe, and the research unit is called Reinforce.
1335532	1343460	A	0.8137931227684021	So right there you kind of have active inference, in case that wasn't clear coming from the Institute scale.
1344120	1355844	A	0.652432382106781	Supporting the unit scale are a variety of functions such as funding and partnerships, communications and hierarchical processes such as the construction of enabling systems.
1355972	1359688	A	0.7789162397384644	And at the institute scale, other than administrative functions.
1359784	1383090	A	0.7908025979995728	We have the officers, the day to day operators of the work, the board of directors, which is the formal governing body, and the scientific advisory board where we really want to call out broadly and have people who may have or may have not thought that they would find themselves in a scientific advisory board, for example, in 2024.
1383540	1384944	A	0.6361137628555298	This is your invitation.
1384992	1399204	A	0.8507544994354248	And we really want to have a vibrant scientific advisory board who serves liaison type roles with different sectors and just gives periodic, super valuable, high leverage insight.
1399332	1407130	A	0.830426812171936	And then, I guess, depending on how you think about it, as all things we have just a few terms.
1407820	1416424	A	0.8278856873512268	They don't just represent bricks in the wall, but it's more of like the fibers we weave.
1416552	1426290	A	0.8454464673995972	And some of these are already things that we do every day courses, educational groups, events, live streams, ontology research.
1426660	1436624	A	0.6373345255851746	Others of these are things that we know will be coming into place in the coming years and we know that the tapestry is just going to continue to expand.
1436672	1437860	A	0.9870310425758362	So it's really exciting.
1439160	1447104	A	0.7161842584609985	On Page Six, we have another figure and this is just another way to represent some of the functions that we serve in the ecosystem.
1447152	1461020	A	0.8648511171340942	This isn't the only or the final or a fixed representation of the functions that we have or the only way to slice and dice or any of that, but just to connect some of the dots between the functions that we do and want to serve for the ecosystem.
1461600	1471700	A	0.8483520150184631	So starting from the broadest, let's just say where the listener is, where you are right now is in the space of awareness.
1471800	1474240	A	0.7258880734443665	And that happens through communication.
1474740	1491830	A	0.7756643295288086	Some people who become aware through a search or a language model or a video suggestion or a friend or happenstance or synchronicity or however, some fraction of the aware will pursue education.
1492440	1501610	A	0.8676331639289856	And about education we have and will continue to produce the materials, documentation ontology courses, live streams and so on.
1502700	1507700	A	0.7900444269180298	Education is produced and rests upon a commons.
1507780	1509168	A	0.8115571737289429	It's an epistemic commons.
1509204	1511240	A	0.675946831703186	It's a verified information environment.
1511400	1513388	A	0.7483794689178467	And that is really the space.
1513474	1520220	A	0.7809268236160278	The wildlife preserve, as I know Dean likes to refer to it not jokingly at all.
1520370	1532960	A	0.8896877765655518	And underneath the commons is the support that does sit between a participatory commons and a formal governing kernel.
1533300	1549208	A	0.8760489225387573	That support in the coming years may go many directions, but we know it's going to involve all of our favorite things like hardware, software, information, behavior, narrative, and more.
1549374	1570296	A	0.6203378438949585	And then we have the regular institute scale governance, partnership sponsor and donor relationships such that we can first find a type of stability or sustainability and then more actively play a regenerative role in our ecosystem.
1570408	1581520	A	0.6975635886192322	We want to dispense micro grants to people and we want to explore paid internships and be able to meet people where they are in their active inference journey.
1581860	1591270	A	0.8100016713142395	And things have been happening to that end and through many means since 2021.
1592440	1593556	A	0.8771478533744812	On page six.
1593658	1596100	A	0.9397609829902649	Pablo or Dean want to add any thoughts?
1599520	1605260	C	0.9882981181144714	I'm super excited about the governance, the education on the game and tools.
1608000	1613104	A	0.8509411215782166	In an hour we're going to see the first active inference game.
1613222	1614850	A	0.9850614666938782	This is very fun.
1617220	1623824	A	0.8404533863067627	On seven, we describe our vision, our values and our principles.
1623872	1640680	A	0.7315076589584351	And just to read the top level on the values and principles, they are active inference and exploration, integrity and inclusivity, dynamic internal modeling, anticipatory behavior, and continuous development.
1641980	1646548	A	0.9108938574790955	On page eight, we talk about some priorities and challenge areas.
1646724	1649464	A	0.681597113609314	These are challenges across multiple scales.
1649512	1657736	A	0.7155762910842896	They're challenges that individual people face in their journey to learn and apply in so many different backgrounds.
1657848	1660088	A	0.6899226307868958	These are challenges of national interest.
1660194	1663808	A	0.6338269114494324	These are challenges of global emergency as well.
1663974	1674790	A	0.7405604124069214	These challenges are educational in nature, for example, related to scientific literacy and workforce development and just general professionalization in changing times.
1675480	1697400	A	0.8081648945808411	On the research side, there are some priorities and challenge areas related to the fundamentals of cognitive science and grounding the cognitive science in physics, getting that integrative first principles framework that we expect and prefer about information science and diverse intelligences.
1697840	1706430	A	0.5717104077339172	Things are faster and different than they have been, and active inference is perfectly poised for sense making and decision making in that space.
1707680	1711890	A	0.6688858866691589	User experience, accessibility, and sociotechnical design.
1712420	1718876	A	0.7736763954162598	This is a major open question across different settings, so it's not uniquely held to the institute.
1718988	1736280	A	0.8623219728469849	However, we really do believe and really will commit to exploring new kinds of ergonomics and onboardings and experience so that we can come through and be how we want to be.
1736430	1740088	A	0.7420713901519775	From the first time somebody enters the game.
1740254	1766690	A	0.5302870273590088	Where we can highlight accessibility, meeting people in the language that they prefer to listen to and speak at the language, in computer language or at the math level that reflects somebody's preference in that moment as well as being able to use augmented and synthetic intelligence systems to ramp up and even push the frontier of what augmented people and other kinds of collective intelligence systems can do.
1767140	1772800	A	0.7822021245956421	Cyber and cognitive security, these also are broader topics.
1773300	1776784	A	0.7659929394721985	We've worked on these topics from an active inference perspective.
1776832	1777700	A	0.7391530871391296	Many have.
1777850	1787930	A	0.511235773563385	And we think that this is going to become increasingly relevant as things do become more and more challenging and uncertain in certain ways out there.
1788780	1794840	A	0.8325534462928772	Scaling the active inference ecosystem we've heard about this from the narrow and technical side.
1794910	1803484	A	0.864957332611084	We had estimates of the computational complexity of sophisticated inference about how many computer operations have to happen for a given calculation to play out.
1803602	1805144	A	0.8618386387825012	And that's sometimes called scaling.
1805192	1812770	A	0.5486940741539001	Active inference, like, okay, it took 1 minute on 1GB of data, so how many minutes is it going to take on this computer with this much data?
1813140	1827552	A	0.5206336975097656	Scaling the active inference ecosystem, though, is a broader question, and that's where we come to more of the social fabric and the real sense of belonging that we all want to have and co create and provide for others in the ecosystem.
1827696	1831632	A	0.7605254650115967	And so this kind of scaling is really transdisciplinary.
1831696	1833444	A	0.6744450926780701	It's really skin in the game.
1833642	1835712	A	0.5925671458244324	It's as real as it gets.
1835866	1854584	A	0.638079822063446	And applying active inference, some applications we've heard from today, some applications are cited in the early pages of this paper, and more and more come through every day, and we support at the Institute various applications of active inference.
1854712	1857230	A	0.8792324066162109	Dean, what can you add in there?
1860480	1861724	B	0.669516384601593	Okay, my mute is off.
1861762	1862396	B	0.7732179760932922	Good.
1862578	1872450	B	0.925424337387085	So here's something that never came up in the writing of the document, but I think it's kind of interesting, and I'm curious what you guys have to think about this.
1874420	1878192	B	0.8749208450317383	175 years ago, an institution came and formed together.
1878246	1880480	B	0.8806517124176025	It's called the Smithsonian Institute.
1880640	1898520	B	0.6244152188301086	Now, I don't know if 175 years from this conversation today, they'll be the equivalent of whatever the Active Inference Institute is 175 years forward, but I think it's okay to start thinking in those terms.
1898590	1921440	B	0.7504220008850098	It doesn't mean that we follow in their footsteps, necessarily, but I think it means that we have a long term view and that the things that we write about ourselves now have some shelf life, have some real sense of, well, there are things that we can and we cannot change.
1921510	1932576	B	0.7781373262405396	But if you look at the front page, the landing page of the Smithsonian Institute, the first thing that they say is welcome, which is what we say about the Active Inference Institute.
1932688	1938980	B	0.5786702036857605	And then they say, the Smithsonian Institution is the world's largest museum education and research complex.
1939140	1942920	B	0.7838234305381775	We are a community of learning and an opener of doors.
1943500	1945960	B	0.6433281302452087	Join us on a voyage of discovery.
1947260	1957660	B	0.8060941100120544	So in three sentences, they kind of sum themselves up, what's the formula for not just existing for 175 years, but being a force?
1959440	1977380	B	0.8049776554107666	And I think, again, Daniel, whatever you decide to highlight in the document today, what I think we're really trying to do is say, do the words that we put out now, will they continue to resonate with people for decades to come?
1977450	1989930	B	0.6752598881721497	And again, I don't want to sound all hand wavy, but I want to hold up an example of a place that really did set itself up to be something that people could return to again and again and again.
1990540	1998728	B	0.6806796193122864	And I don't think there's anything wrong with aspiring to having that kind of place, that kind of respect.
1998904	2009820	B	0.5665197372436523	And I think that the things that you're pointing to right now, hopefully we're preparing properly.
2010800	2014530	B	0.6944377422332764	So that's what I'm taking away at this point.
2016260	2021120	A	0.8550419807434082	We know about that preparation measurement cycle from Chris Fields, don't we?
2021270	2021970	B	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
2024420	2026000	A	0.7722361087799072	We go on, talk a little.
2026070	2026416	A	0.5585340261459351	Oh, yeah.
2026438	2026924	A	0.7602256536483765	Please, Pablo.
2026972	2027472	C	0.535232424736023	Go.
2027606	2028516	C	0.576865553855896	No, no, definitely.
2028618	2029668	C	0.7494814395904541	I completely agree.
2029754	2033350	C	0.7585048079490662	I've been thinking about that for a long time.
2035180	2046890	C	0.881276547908783	You want to build and act for the best of the future, and I think to reflect that on the paper, it's super important.
2048560	2051390	C	0.6594403982162476	Yeah, definitely up to do that.
2051920	2054492	A	0.6637534499168396	Yeah, way ahead.
2054546	2058056	A	0.9159256815910339	We describe some paths that we want to take and the history of the Institute.
2058088	2059368	A	0.8184612393379211	We describe our origins.
2059384	2079620	A	0.9727485775947571	But I actually wanted to come to figure three and four on page eleven to speak to building one of the most amazing and encouraging things has been the all ages, all time zone, active build, contribute mindset.
2080760	2092244	A	0.6121034026145935	An earlier version of myself, I might have thought, like people who do variational Bayesian methods in machine learning, they're going to have no issue onboarding to active inference.
2092292	2097396	A	0.7733957171440125	It's just going to be like as simple as saying, yeah, it's a variational Bayesian model with action.
2097508	2099524	A	0.8256322145462036	So it's just signal processing on the inbound.
2099572	2101156	A	0.8194419741630554	It's just control theory on the outbound.
2101188	2106908	A	0.724939227104187	But if you're familiar with variational Bayes and variational free energy, this isn't changing it that much.
2106994	2110388	A	0.8731356263160706	Oh, yeah, we use a particular partition and it's related to the free energy principle.
2110424	2112130	A	0.6178290247917175	But don't worry too much, you'll get there.
2112900	2152632	A	0.6059087514877319	I thought that that would be the path for so many and future analyses will reveal what they do or don't reveal, but what we found in our enacted work as it really played out that there was inclusion and unique contributions to conversations ranging from philosophy of science to fundamentals of statistics and metascience and the role of quantitative studies and social systems.
2152696	2178500	A	0.7803664803504944	All these amazing topics and people who just scampered so rapidly through what could be seen as prerequisite from a disciplinary perspective was facilitated by the recognition that one was already in the space and in the way that they needed to be to be an active inference.
2179720	2189320	A	0.7663816213607788	And that was not written out before and even now the traces are barely recorded, but it will become to be understood more fully.
2193100	2203516	B	0.8687814474105835	And to your point, Daniel, I think especially what the pie chart shows is the actual spectrum aspect of this.
2203618	2213120	B	0.8786556124687195	So I know that right now that maybe the neuroscience and the psychology piece take up a bigger portion.
2213460	2234070	B	0.7504168152809143	But I think one of the things that we're trying to promote is the idea that you can come from just about any background as opposed to, oh, all paths lead to, as you said, an earlier version of you said, oh, okay, well, I can see where everything is going to where the confluence is going to.
2234440	2246200	B	0.6555572152137756	No, I think what this demonstrates is that it's actually becoming more distributed the longer we continue to exist.
2247600	2261616	A	0.8413327932357788	Yeah, this figure, of course, I'm super happy with everything that we were able to do, but this figure is almost a little bit like a paper target that we're just going to blow out later.
2261798	2273060	A	0.788921594619751	Because it was a fraction of only people who had formal affiliations listed, which means only people for whom we had done full literature based pulling up their information.
2273130	2279060	A	0.555059015750885	So it doesn't even represent the actual participation profile.
2279400	2283620	A	0.8589950203895569	This is more like the invitation list for live streams.
2284440	2294148	A	0.8358059525489807	So we are going to see another long tail that covers the part that's not the long tail.
2294244	2320768	A	0.7032951712608337	I believe the rest of the paper continues along possibilities, challenges, next steps, more about the institute organization, various other pieces of information that potentially eager stakeholders or participants or donors or liaisons or other people would like to learn more about.
2320854	2322964	A	0.5424135327339172	It's there to engage with.
2323002	2332180	A	0.528020441532135	We want people to hop into our discord and continue the conversation or email us or otherwise get involved.
2332520	2345624	A	0.6321974992752075	It's why we called this symposium enacting Ecosystems of Shared Intelligence at the, of course, relevant suggestion of Karl Friston, because we really do want to enact it.

2357624	2367120	A	0.9414997100830078	So I will leave the closing word first to Dean, then Pablo, and then we'll go to Raph's presentation.
2368820	2385960	B	0.8661858439445496	Well, just real quick, again, if you want a consolidated document that speaks to the now but also points to a direction that none of us really know is certain, but is also really exciting, have a look at the doc.
2389340	2390360	A	0.8124393224716187	Pablo?
2393020	2393576	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
2393678	2415520	C	0.862932026386261	I'm here to make sure that I act as one of those people of all backgrounds and perspectives that has taken advantage through one year of learning and working on this institute, and hopefully see you in 1 hour.
