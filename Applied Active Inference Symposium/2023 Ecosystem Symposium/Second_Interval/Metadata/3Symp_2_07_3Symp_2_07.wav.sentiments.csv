650	6910	A	0.4970909059047699	This is the big question that I think we are missing at the moment in active inference.
8450	9054	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
9172	10778	B	0.982644259929657	Well, thank you for this presentation.
10874	17920	B	0.978772759437561	Thanks for the social sciences work and we're all looking forward to seeing how the projects play out.
19170	19646	A	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
19668	20538	A	0.5620948672294617	Goodbye.
20714	22030	B	0.5756955146789551	Farewell, AVO.
24970	25880	A	0.4896697998046875	All right.
27850	38082	B	0.8952997922897339	The next presentation is with Pablo Fernandez Macchia.
38226	40150	B	0.9778091311454773	So welcome back, Pablo.
41050	44618	A	0.5227627158164978	Hello here.
44784	48730	B	0.5700761079788208	Okay, I did take us on an adventure of curiosity.
49470	50182	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
50336	52766	A	0.8029432892799377	I'm going to start sharing my screen.
52868	55440	A	0.5609815120697021	Let me know if everything is all right.
58770	61440	B	0.884271502494812	Should be perfect.
62210	62922	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
63076	63780	A	0.84200119972229	Cool.
66150	75220	A	0.9797049760818481	So this is one of my favorite memes and probably most of you know it.
76250	99286	A	0.5244760513305664	This reference is the cave of Platon and to me it was kind of fine treated truth that now with active inference seems like we are closer to demonstrate.
99318	101200	A	0.5723750591278076	That how it is.
101970	129814	A	0.5925660729408264	So the first time that I start act and surf at the Institute, this was kind of my feeling or my face was looking into something that it was complex, scary and look interesting.
130012	137880	A	0.8355917930603027	So I went why I decided to go through it.
141150	152160	A	0.6430675983428955	I envision a world where people is driving by stronger incentives that motivate them to reduce uncertainty in the systems they are part of.
153410	157710	A	0.8494471311569214	My approach is through games which are going to go later.
157860	167358	A	0.8647384643554688	But I really on this talk, want to encourage all kinds of persons or people that are curious.
167454	173780	A	0.5173835158348083	And I want them to act and get involved in the community.
174150	186694	A	0.5825671553611755	Because you may find that for now most of the actors are scientists and very well on reputed people.
186892	195722	A	0.5352195501327515	And you might think that you are not a part of it, but very far away from that.
195856	196934	A	0.7408283352851868	The Institute.
197062	199270	A	0.5492770075798035	Encourage the opposite.
199350	209520	A	0.9789398312568665	So I'm super glad to have been through this journey and I wanted to share a little bit of my background and then we go to the game.
212390	214430	A	0.8340214490890503	Here is the second and last meme.
214510	218702	A	0.7865000367164612	The world you were raised to survive is no longer exist.
218846	233960	A	0.9363310933113098	We are on digital revolution and with this digital revolution it comes a bunch of different things that are evolving and hopefully bring us to a better world.
235610	236934	A	0.8276011943817139	Okay, who I am?
237052	237894	A	0.7048125863075256	I'm Pablo.
237942	238854	A	0.7971116304397583	My name is Pablo.
238902	246890	A	0.8282743692398071	But more defined or what best define me is my action and my experiences.
253010	269090	A	0.4095253050327301	I think role gameplays and sports movies are super important and as a kid I was dyslexic and the system didn't fill my necessities.
269430	272274	A	0.9672763347625732	So I really hated school.
272472	278118	A	0.9794458746910095	But I love learning and it's something that I've been doing all my life.
278204	292860	A	0.6327498555183411	And it's curious how a system that is designed to give you knowledge and to help you with the learning, in my case it didn't work at all.
295390	299020	A	0.709876298904419	That's a little starting point.
299630	320770	A	0.9648730158805847	I believe in the copy transformation and combine of things and on my adulthood everything shifted and I became successful, professional and I love it.
320840	321650	A	0.6698806285858154	Teams.
323590	344010	A	0.5813047885894775	What I do for a living is product manager and what I do on my pet projects site projects, call it as you want is related to gaming and gamifying organizations and experiences.
346510	358750	A	0.49974656105041504	Nowadays I trust more my intuition which is something that it really was broken during my childhood and you will see a little bit more about that.
358900	361200	A	0.6048202514648438	Here are some things of my interest.
361570	383720	A	0.883999764919281	Licenses like open science which is the case of the Institute philosophy that's the first meme education, governance, family, art, love, communication, technology and nature and a bunch of other things that I will be happy to share any other time.
385210	395850	A	0.613785445690155	One of the questions that Daniel asked me for this talk is what was exciting for me about all this, what right?
395920	414594	A	0.5559756755828857	And for me, when I give talks, I like to share a view of the last hundred years and the Industrial revolution and how the ones that were on this world before us did something right.
414792	427270	A	0.5542914271354675	I'm sure that we all know big mistakes or big things that have failed or that could be better through iterations.
427610	435160	A	0.9751165509223938	But on data it's very promising and very good.
435770	463540	A	0.8790652751922607	I think it's inspiring to have the basic education, how it grows, the vaccination, what it did for us, democracy and how poverty dropped draxily, how literacy it grew and because all these things, child mortality just went very low.
465670	472610	A	0.9750615954399109	So basically the future of education is what makes me be excited.
475430	477858	A	0.7563318610191345	How I ended up on this ecosystem.
478034	485654	A	0.526852011680603	It's super random and I'm going to explain it in hopefully two to five minutes.
485852	491500	A	0.8679574131965637	I as a product manager and very interested on technology.
491950	499850	A	0.7123603820800781	I heard about Blockchains back in 2015 and I didn't understood anything at all.
500000	509934	A	0.6299500465393066	And then back in 2017 I heard about a I didn't start them, did not play that game.
510052	521410	A	0.8535391092300415	But it was raising a fun thing to consider, which is digital assets and ownership of those digital assets.
522790	542410	A	0.48470133543014526	For now, we didn't have a technology that could scale and that was good enough to ensure that the digital assets that you own were you yours and you had the freedom of transaction on them.
542560	554910	A	0.49898985028266907	I did understand that very fast and because I'm a game player and as a game player you always have your different assets and do things with them.
554980	566206	A	0.6764577031135559	And as well, I have been collecting music and all kind of digital assets.
566398	576710	A	0.5162366032600403	I bought this very famous collection of punks and sold them very fast before I could be a millionaire.
577610	582038	A	0.702843427658081	But due to in 2021 I decided that I wanted to build something.
582204	596342	A	0.90400230884552	And then back then I went through this beautiful project that was the first art saw on Ethereum, which one of the artists it was Daniel Friedman.
596486	631638	A	0.5614580512046814	So I, as a curious person and person that has been working with artists, I always like to know what is the driver of those artists, what they do, and try to get in their walls, to understand better and to get as much information as I can before I decide to encourage or collect or just always deeper on music or art.
631724	636150	A	0.9678942561149597	For me, is very nice thing to do.
636300	643818	A	0.6919954419136047	So I discovered these cards and education was one of them.
643904	653790	A	0.5856210589408875	And I went through Flickr which is where it was the first at least that I found place where it was.
653860	654874	A	0.6147569417953491	And the license.
654922	678150	A	0.9869778752326965	It was Creative Commons license of not commercial use but it was an open license which I been part of Creative Commons community for a very long time since I was working with musicians and I think it's one of the best things that happened to the internet.
680010	686742	A	0.5261724591255188	These are some of the pragmatic things that the audience cares about.
686876	692010	A	0.8167088627815247	Hopefully we will have some of these on our games.
693870	696460	A	0.5255476832389832	AI for sure is going to be there.
698510	709690	A	0.8632200956344604	Free energy principle is going to be one of the things that hopefully we help to minimize and to make it funnier.
709770	716100	A	0.8054232001304626	Games or happier games and games that help organizations to be better.
717350	721122	A	0.8480963110923767	The human factor, it's super important for me.
721176	729494	A	0.81297367811203	And implementation and action I learned by doing and it's one of the values that the Institute encouraged more.
729612	738140	A	0.6715703010559082	So I just jump on things and try to understand them through doing and sharing as I'm doing now.
739470	748154	A	0.8546794056892395	Here are the epistemics and collective is one of them that I'm as well.
748352	778978	A	0.904067873954773	Super interest agents, of course, practical and curiosity which is the adventure that I have the feeling that I'm being involved all my life and that I encourage always my two girls to be curious and to open things and look behind the doors and just be an active.
779154	787000	A	0.780455470085144	Here are some values that I like to point which are exploration, the culture of curiosity that I did mention a lot.
788830	794538	A	0.5520549416542053	Continuous learning because that experience on the school.
794624	805150	A	0.7777032256126404	I think I just keep going and keep going and it's something that sometimes bad experiences could turn out in good habits.
806290	809360	A	0.6932059526443481	Learning by doing, as I already told.
811010	813246	A	0.5410321950912476	Integrity and inclusivity.
813358	818194	A	0.5618851780891418	Honesty, accountability, a big one.
818392	821540	A	0.7274787425994873	Trying to be professional on everything that you do.
822790	826022	A	0.7699441909790039	For me, I started as human being.
826076	835590	A	0.9037997126579285	Curious people of all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome to the Institute.
837530	847770	A	0.6864338517189026	I would be very happy to be the link and to speak with someone that has doubts or if I couldn't help.
847840	850650	A	0.7455238699913025	I think I could help on the very early stage.
851490	855230	A	0.6183436512947083	If you're not very technical person, I think I could help.
855300	861214	A	0.6210669875144958	There we are learning by doing.
861332	879560	A	0.9887380599975586	I would love to everyone that's on the stream, I'm going to share this link which is a new game that we are testing and I'm excited to share it with you.
881210	885714	A	0.7714508175849915	It's the adventure of Curiosity and here Daniel.
885762	891180	A	0.7940107583999634	I'm going to copy and paste the link.
893070	894154	A	0.9647946953773499	It would be awesome.
894272	894602	B	0.584351658821106	Okay.
894656	896582	B	0.7817980051040649	There's a tiny typo on your slides.
896646	898730	B	0.760417640209198	It just ends with a curiosity.
900370	901070	A	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
901140	905230	B	0.7930375933647156	But I'm going to paste it into the YouTube live chat.
906450	908062	A	0.7883908748626709	Okay, thank you.
908196	910714	A	0.8387073278427124	Yeah, I told you I'm a Dyslexic.
910762	914834	A	0.8340210318565369	I have all kind of titles throughout my life.
915032	916226	A	0.7661429643630981	Sorry for that.
916248	923650	A	0.8320525884628296	I always try to improve share the.
923800	926774	B	0.7917212247848511	Yeah, I put it in the YouTube chat so people can head over there.
926812	927382	B	0.5025529861450195	All right, yeah.
927436	928854	B	0.9170831441879272	Could you tell us about this platform?
928972	931240	B	0.8554219603538513	And this is the first active game?
932650	953566	A	0.5440489649772644	Yes, we started thinking on how to do game a while ago and we decided to go with this picture that explains how it works.
953668	968340	A	0.8392341732978821	Actually it's simple and you have four pieces, the internal state, external state, and in the middle you have the sensory state and the active state.
968710	972334	A	0.7600479125976562	So here is the mission.
972382	984040	A	0.7787094116210938	You have some instructions that you can read and would be fun if you go through them and you can go either way.
984490	1009600	A	0.5202456116676331	And here we are going to go through the sensory state where you're going to listen to a music where some notes you can censor that are not in the famous song for Elise.
1011700	1032730	A	0.8690295219421387	So you have to take notes and you can go and you can see that we are on the Markov blanket which saw everything very delineate as Dali would paint it.
1033420	1067110	A	0.7381893396377563	And here is your active part of the game where you have to do something which is add the different notes that your professor, music professor is telling you don't miss because you probably on the external state are trying to play the music.
1067480	1088360	A	0.7411765456199646	So you have to infer that you are missing some notes and go to the active state and start walking through the right node.
1089020	1098350	A	0.7235826253890991	If I miss the node, I just follow into the nothing and come back into my internal state.
1098880	1104930	A	0.7324023246765137	So probably would have to go back and sensor again.
1107380	1118576	A	0.6616020202636719	And once I take the right actions and the right nodes, I can go and solve the puzzle.
1118768	1139996	A	0.7070021033287048	And the idea here is to have a tool, gaming tool to explain so you can experience how this active inference on free energy works.
1140178	1166752	A	0.6266852617263794	And once you go to the end of that adventure, which I'm not going to finish because it's something that players should do, you're going to have a door where you have to put the sequence in low case of what were the missing notes.
1166896	1185832	A	0.9437100887298584	And it's going to allow you to come inside the treasure room where you will have feedback, feedback that you can send us and we will be very happy to have it.
1185966	1193832	A	0.7829613089561462	And then if you have a wallet, you will be able to have digital asset.
1193976	1206080	A	0.6078517436981201	If not, we will add information to help people to go from web two to web three and to get those digital assets.
1206820	1217190	A	0.9539126753807068	And here to be developed would be future adventures that I would be very happy to do.
1218680	1229370	A	0.8682591915130615	So this was pretty much the presentation and hopefully we have new players in the coming days.
1230460	1232072	A	0.9629741311073303	Hope you have fun.
1232206	1265460	A	0.8948580622673035	And I really encourage anyone to discover and play with all these ideas and thoughts and experiments and feelings that I have the gut feeling that are going to revolutionize how we understand the world and how we can improve in it by reducing uncertainty.
1266040	1275476	A	0.6919023990631104	So thank you and I don't know, Daniel, if you have any comments or something in this last ten minutes.
1275658	1278424	B	0.870640754699707	Oh, yeah, we can definitely talk for a few minutes.
1278542	1283656	B	0.9541717767715454	I'm seeing many fun comments and questions in the chat so people can post it.
1283678	1288330	B	0.7984582781791687	Yeah, the gameplay is smoother on even a normal computer.
1288940	1294510	B	0.954566478729248	It may look choppy on the live stream, but it's quite a nice playing experience.
1295040	1302848	B	0.881224513053894	Maybe just a little context like how did you get into building these worlds or what kind of tools are these?
1303014	1309932	B	0.571304202079773	And we obviously don't see them in today's mainstream educational and research offerings.
1309996	1320950	B	0.6573787927627563	But what could that even be to bring together this kind of immersion and role playing with education research?
1323400	1338440	A	0.679786205291748	Yes, I we playing role games and role games you have very diverse kind of players.
1338880	1360640	A	0.6961002349853516	So I was playing with guys like me, had a struggle through the school and guys that end up being researchers like yourself because they were very good in those environments.
1362980	1376240	A	0.9722312688827515	For me, it was like we are sharing a lot of cognitive values and information and they are really having fun with me.
1376410	1388440	A	0.5748100280761719	So what the academia is telling me is not what I'm feeling outside academia.
1388880	1411776	A	0.9254916310310364	So that through the years it became more and more clear that was one of the drivers to have a very diverse kind of friends and that one of the most important things for me to learn.
1411878	1426550	A	0.9196858406066895	It was having fun and to be a good professional, I have to be enjoying what I'm doing and to enjoy what I do, it has to have that gamify feeling of it.
1428060	1453952	A	0.5054735541343689	In 2021, I just went straight to explore that road because Blockchains, what can do is have a persistent sea of objects and attributions to those objects and to those wallets that you can add and build on top of them.
1454086	1465220	A	0.7113544344902039	It's like having a huge database for a game purpose and then you figure out that a game is kind of our organization.
1465560	1482650	A	0.8621970415115356	So you need rules, you need to share values, you need to have what we are building now, which is the cecian cedo which you agree with the players, what's going to be about and how it's going to work.
1483100	1512848	A	0.7733089327812195	And we are building this fantastic storytelling of how kind of world where it was in the early 20s compared to what's happening now in this imaginary world that's complementary to what's happening in real life.
1513014	1518164	A	0.801038384437561	And we are just exploring those areas for three years.
1518362	1527380	A	0.8130348920822144	And once I got into the Institute, we started serving these ideas.
1527460	1535530	A	0.9680946469306946	You send us to do a system thinking course that it was super cool.
1536860	1553820	A	0.5258572697639465	We explore and learn and this document that I can share, it was very important for us to understand and we find out the necessity to be able to compute what we are doing.
1553890	1576356	A	0.6042724251747131	So we start focusing more on ontology on all the bricks that you need to understand to build the skeleton of something that could last for decades, which is the idea.
1576458	1590590	A	0.506445586681366	And we are trying to build it so everyone can copy, paste, fork it and do whatever they want with the game, adapt it to their own organizations and use it on their favor.
1591200	1594670	A	0.9055745005607605	And we are just exploring and having fun.
1597840	1598572	B	0.9799191951751709	That's awesome.
1598626	1602832	B	0.7255154848098755	And there's so many pieces there.
1602886	1620000	B	0.5930384397506714	It's true about the fun and the curiosity, those intrinsic motivations like being 6 hours deep into counting ants in the desert or 5000 pipette pushes deep or whatever it is in the trenches and in the last mile.
1620080	1626580	B	0.5436275005340576	And it can be easy to lose sight.
1627260	1659036	B	0.6052828431129456	But when we lose sight and when we put out the fire and the spark, it's a cold, dark night, and no career or status or extrinsic valuation is going to provide simply the joy and the deeper meaning of to two people going on a little adventure running around this space, being inside active inference rather than active inference.
1659068	1666996	B	0.6646100282669067	Being like this high speed train that's leaving anyone behind or you're on the outside and it's taking these twists and turns and you're getting thrown off.
1667098	1686024	B	0.48352786898612976	It's like it is cool and air conditioned in this space and people play and watch a lot of games where they wield violent arms and not even like saying whether that's good or bad.
1686062	1700456	B	0.8150099515914917	It's just it is a genre to want to have a camera either in a character's head first person perspective or a camera in a second or a third person perspective, which you can switch between here and those kinds.
1700488	1724432	B	0.5080367922782898	Of topics about egocentric versus allocentric navigation and our ability to have a perspective swap on ourself and be able to take that kind of like out of body situational awareness in real spatial settings and just to be able to cruise through this space and it's like, yeah, there's no right way to boomerang.
1724576	1726524	B	0.8168073296546936	You could go from external to sensory.
1726592	1728010	B	0.8126428127288818	You could go here or there.
1731180	1738330	B	0.6010860800743103	It's an appetizer and a fertilization that we've really just never seen.
1741920	1743180	A	0.6095885634422302	Okay, yeah.
1743250	1746110	A	0.9862514138221741	Thank you very much, Daniel, for this.
1748240	1750460	B	0.8271933794021606	Any last thoughts or comments?
1751520	1758400	A	0.593055009841919	No, just enjoy while we are here, which is, I think, our mission.
1760260	1761024	A	0.4896697998046875	All right.
1761142	1762332	B	0.885748028755188	Thank you, Pablo.
1762476	1775890	B	0.9694780111312866	I'm sure everyone's going to really enjoy this and let's also, of course, continue to develop these games and continue to offer these on ramps and have times where we're meeting up in these spaces and playing around.
1777740	1778392	A	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
1778446	1779636	A	0.6378887891769409	All right, bye.
1779748	1780600	B	0.5942320823669434	Farewell.
1786320	1787230	A	0.4896697998046875	All right.
1792800	1793992	B	0.6700859069824219	Welcome, Mahault.
1794136	1795050	B	0.6928064823150635	This will be the.
