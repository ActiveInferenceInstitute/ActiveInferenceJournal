16580	16792	1	A	0.9954	Welcome,
16846	20280	2	A	0.36337	Raf, also co author on the paper.
20350	23370	3	B	0.97587	So how are you doing?
24380	25176	4	B	0.99901	I'm good.
25278	26490	5	B	0.94338	What about you?
27260	28200	6	A	0.9998	Pretty good.
28270	32170	7	A	0.99997	Other than this brief interval of white light, I'm just hanging out.
35260	36036	8	B	0.98166	Fantastic.
36068	38730	9	B	0.99525	So I'm trying to figure out here how I can.
39460	46112	10	B	0.91124	I'm using a different slide software, so I need to make sure that I can pull this up in the right way.
46166	47520	11	B	0.99482	So give me just a quick second.
47590	49010	12	A	0.92823	Yeah, great.
50100	50512	13	B	0.9674	Cool.
50566	57044	14	A	0.98625	So just just to read off what's coming while you figure that out.
57242	66410	15	A	0.99991	So right now we have Ralph Kaufman, and this presentation is going to be Gaia, an active powered network for planetary scale sense making.
66780	72308	16	A	0.56357	Following this 30 minutes presentation, we'll have Avel Gwynen Carlo on embedded Normativity.
72484	73656	17	A	0.99878	That looks perfect.
73758	74810	18	A	0.65627	That's perfect.
76140	76888	19	B	0.99995	Awesome.
77054	77736	20	A	0.89012	All right.
77838	79710	21	A	0.99999	Thanks, Raf, to you.
80080	80924	22	B	0.99765	Thank you.
81042	85310	23	B	0.95664	All right, I was going to try to see if I could blow this up to full screen, but.
87200	88860	24	A	1	I got it on the stream.
90180	91244	25	A	0.99903	Looks good on the stream.
91292	92290	26	A	0.99996	Go for it.
92820	93376	27	B	0.99987	Cool.
93478	95890	28	B	0.99987	So I'm just pulling up my notes here.
96580	101440	29	B	0.99885	All right, so let me just test that this moves.
103000	104660	30	B	0.991	Did I just move the slide?
106760	107268	31	B	0.99777	Great.
107354	107892	32	B	0.99718	Cool.
108026	110836	33	B	0.96087	All right, so as I said, hi, everyone.
110938	116804	34	B	0.99956	It's a huge pleasure to be here and thank you so much to Daniel and everybody else in the Institute for organizing this.
116922	121636	35	B	0.99672	I'm going to talk about what I think is the single most important application of active entrance.
121748	126616	36	B	0.99791	Not as a detriment to the others, but it's sort of upstream of everything else.
126718	133448	37	B	1	And that is how do the 8 billion of us humans make sense of what's going on in our planet and all scales?
133544	137740	38	B	1	And how do we use that understanding to survive as a species?
138640	145488	39	B	0.99985	So this presentation here is a bit of a technical presentation and it has a lot of content.
145654	153152	40	B	0.95589	It's going to move pretty fast and assume that you're familiar with some concepts, but I'm going to try to leave time for Q A at the end.
153286	160672	41	B	0.99087	So first of all, I'm going to talk about the motivation behind what we're doing, in particular the concepts of the meta crisis and the third attractor.
160816	167952	42	B	0.99949	Then I'll give an overview of our network architecture and the application so far and cover the many remaining challenges.
168096	173528	43	B	0.99	And last but not least, I plan to convince you that this is the single most important thing you could ever be working on.
173614	176408	44	B	1	And I'm doing this because we need your help.
176574	178810	45	B	0.99993	So that's a taster of what we have.
180480	184040	46	B	1	As I said, let's jump right into it with the motivation.
184200	187310	47	B	0.99	And what greater motivation could there be?
187760	204624	48	B	0.99989	If you haven't heard of the metacrisis, it's a term that it's originally from Doctor Who, but it was borrowed by thinker called Daniel Schmuckenberger to talk about the total risk for humanity and the biosphere that is posed by the combination of three factors.
204752	212548	49	B	1	The first being the increasing interconnectedness of everything from climate to food security to national security.
212634	214936	50	B	1	To biodiversity and everything in between.
215118	232328	51	B	1	The second being the risks associated with self evolving technology, including runaway artificial intelligence and the third being the increasing omnipresence of coordination failures personified as the god of coordination failures moloch.
232504	249424	52	B	0.98	And so the combination of these three factors as hypothesized by Schmuckenberger will lead to either one of two attractors, one of them being chaotic breakdown of all structure and the second being a reversal to oppressive authoritarian control.
249622	255270	53	B	1	And obviously both of those qualify as that in my book, I assume in yours as well.
255880	263744	54	B	0.99859	So the question of course is can we actually find a third attractor that is positive sum as opposed to negative sum?
263872	267192	55	B	1	And rather the question is can we design it?
267326	276520	56	B	0.98845	So what I claim, and what we as the Guy Consortium claim, is that yes we can and we can design this attractor.
277920	297584	57	B	0.66	The design goal is basically to build resilience and stabilization into our biosocial economic system and to do this subject to multilevel system constraints like the planetary boundaries desirability, meaning it has to be something that people actually want so they will help it happen.
297782	300112	58	B	0.99997	So it needs to preserve standards of living and so on.
300166	304512	59	B	1	And it needs to be feasible, it needs to be achievable from our current initial conditions.
304656	324856	60	B	1	And of course there's a lot of design complicators in the mix, some of which partial observation, there's a lot of information asymmetry going on, there's a lot of uncertainty about how the pieces of the world system work from a scientific perspective, there's obvious computability constraints associated to this.
325038	329292	61	B	1	And last but not least, you can't really control what happens.
329346	333500	62	B	0.89297	In most cases we can only create incentives, recommendations and nudges.
334240	337470	63	B	0.99304	So easy, right?
338000	351436	64	B	0.68	Of course it's not easy, but we think we can do it if we apply the sum of the principles from cybernetics that we already know and apply them in a decentralized positive sum composable way.
351558	361620	65	B	0.98927	So what we're talking about here is decentralized network, a decentralized hybrid AI human network for planetary scale decision support and automation.
363580	370520	66	B	0.9992	It recognizes that we will have human and artificial agents interacting by the billions in an open network.
371820	384270	67	B	0.79904	Its goal is to facilitate both continuance or model alignment and coherence or goal alignment at multiple levels or scales up to the global scale, meaning the survival of the system as a whole.
384720	392972	68	B	0.99664	It will need to feature built in incentives and governance and it will need to be privacy preserving, intrinsically.
393116	399404	69	B	0.9971	So the below listed participants are participants, founders of the consortium.
399452	400930	70	B	0.93925	I'm going to talk about it later.
402580	405668	71	B	0.95027	So this is the framing, this is the motivation for what we're doing.
405834	420644	72	B	0.89	And now I'm going to give a whirlwind tour of the architecture so far and I'm going to cover mostly what we've built, the version of this architecture that we've built so far, thinking about this explicitly.
420772	426288	73	B	1	And then I'm going to talk about how this connects to other architectures that already exist in the world, just very briefly.
426484	439580	74	B	0.79172	So we've been framing this as an architecture for building decentralized digital twins, which are local models of real world systems that run in network.
440160	448304	75	B	0.83	And the role that such digital twins play is that they help us understand the costs and benefits of strategies and projects that happen in the real world.
448422	455648	76	B	0.86	And in our organization, Digital Gaia, we started out caring primarily about agroecology.
455744	474840	77	B	0.99466	So how do you actually make better decisions, meaning better recommendations, negotiations, valuations, investments into a farm, into a forest, into bio landscape, to make it better, to make it more likely to survive and thrive.
475580	482760	78	B	0.99057	So, as practical implementation, it needs to tackle several real world challenges.
482840	488190	79	B	1	First of all, it needs to handle distributed, non IID data.
488740	489964	80	B	0.99979	Data is sparse.
490012	494000	81	B	0.95463	It's heterogeneous, it's private, it's potentially unreliable.
494740	501320	82	B	0.99984	It needs to enable localized collaborative forecasting and planning, personalized planning and privacy preserving.
501420	509780	83	B	0.98249	It needs to accept the fact that it won't be able to directly control, but only recommended nudge, as we discussed.
510920	523480	84	B	0.96	And the outline of what we came up with is this concept of the Guy Network, which is a mesh of AI agents called natural entities, or Ants for short, that act as proxies for real world systems.
523980	532472	85	B	0.99872	Each ant runs on an engine called Tengor, which it uses to inquire, learn, plan, and allocate resources.
532616	536220	86	B	0.93	And ants communicate in a language called the Guy Protocol.
537760	541468	87	B	0.99956	They use this language to independently interact with their environments and each other.
541634	556020	88	B	0.98	And if we do this right I'll show a bit more of this later, but if we do this right, the Guy network's behavior approximates a single composite agent that handles, that interacts with and couples with its global environment.
557480	557892	89	B	0.9905	Cool.
557946	567412	90	B	0.96005	So just to give you an overview of how this works under the hood, the Fangor engine is really the heart of our architecture.
567476	571844	91	B	1	And the core loop that is mentioned here is a typical active inference loop.
571892	577000	92	B	0.99326	But to make this work in very heterogeneous and distributed context, there's lots of work involved.
577420	581740	93	B	0.96997	So just some highlights that I think are going to be particularly interesting for this crowd.
582240	588760	94	B	1	First of all, so as I said, the same core engine needs to be able to work for very heterogeneous contexts.
588840	592572	95	B	0.99751	So each agent has access to a library of generative models.
592716	602260	96	B	0.97	And these models are specified using a Python based probabilistic programming DSL, and they declare what context they're appropriate for using a shared ontology.
602600	612676	97	B	0.99802	Using that ontology, Fangorn can then select the most appropriate model to use online, given the configurations, like project configurations and the kinds of observational data available.
612778	632684	98	B	0.94051	So using a model that's appropriate for farm or for forest, what kind of farm, what kind of forest, what kind of ecosystem, what kind of their context energy project I'm going to get into the examples right now because there's more on the applications later on.
632882	638712	99	B	0.99934	So we end up with a network of heterogeneous agents, but that's okay.
638786	649388	100	B	0.99986	They actually form a single model in a formal sense because they're all connected hierarchically by a system of hyperparators.
649564	655248	101	B	0.97	And this means that Fangor needs to support inference of generic hierarchical generative models.
655344	660340	102	B	1	And we actually do this automatically using approximate posteriors with structural constraints.
662040	669060	103	B	0.95	And so we have this global model that connects all the nodes and describes general facts that apply over multiple contexts.
669140	677092	104	B	1	And this means the whole network needs to jointly perform inference over this global model using a peer to peer or federated algorithm.
677236	684392	105	B	0.9995	So initially the way this works is initially the network sets the global posterior to be the same as the global prior.
684536	696124	106	B	0.99993	Each node then independently performs local optimization of the variational free energy and then passes the parameters of the new global solution to the peers in the network where they use it as a hyperprior.
696172	701228	107	B	1	And this works over a broad range of topologies and under pretty general constraints.
701324	719400	108	B	1	And by the way, I'd like to mention that there's a lot of overlap and interaction between the stuff that I'm talking about here and some of the other presentations that you're seeing today and I wasn't able to reference them explicitly in this talk, but I'm sure you're going to see the connections cool.
719470	740080	109	B	0.99707	So what it turns out is that the shared parameters that represent our global model are effectively stored by the network stored in a federated parameter store, meaning that each node stores their own local parameters, they're private stuffed about their own local context and multiple nodes store copies of the global parameters.
741140	750952	110	B	1	And this architecture, because it supports heterogeneous local models, it actually allows us to introduce another kind of nodes which we call ant mood nodes.
751116	756468	111	B	0.99938	These are nodes that aggregate scientific and empirical information using a meta analysis model.
756634	771316	112	B	1	And we actually are able to use that meta analysis model to constrain our project level models or ants using quote unquote imported knowledge that wasn't directly observed by them, which is left to right in this picture.
771428	773384	113	B	0.99993	But this actually also goes two ways.
773502	782780	114	B	0.99935	So empirical findings from the project, what actually works on the ground for this particular project also informs the ant modes posteriors which is the right to left.
782850	790720	115	B	1	And so we actually have a complete cycle of science and empirics all implemented using hierarchical active inference.
792420	803368	116	B	0.9982	So finally, just among the global parameters that network learns by federated inference are the precisions associated with data coming from the different data providers.
803484	811990	117	B	1	And this gives each node a way to consume data without trusted ground truth and basically to learn together which sources they can rely on it for what?
812680	815584	118	B	0.99984	This is just some of more core features.
815632	819300	119	B	0.64598	We're working on integrating many other capabilities into this architecture.
819380	840800	120	B	0.99994	Not going to go through all of this, but basically what we're finding is that we have all the building blocks to turn this into a full feature decision network complete with its own internal knowledge economy, meaning that contributions get attributed and rewarded in proportion to the free energy reduction that they afford.
842660	843120	121	B	0.81473	Cool.
843190	855424	122	B	0.70616	So, jumping into applications, as I mentioned, our main focus as an organization has been on modeling agroecological projects like regenerative agriculture and agroforestry.
855552	858710	123	B	1	And this exercises all the constraints that we've talked about so far.
859160	867556	124	B	0.99985	So again, I'm not going to go into full detail, but just to give an overview of what is the anatomy of generative model for a farm or forest.
867668	880248	125	B	0.99967	So start at the bottom right with observables that are things that we can measure about that ecosystem, about that local context like the plant count and size, vegetation indices from satellite data and so on.
880414	896396	126	B	0.99999	These are linked to latent states which form a nonlinear dynamical system that's parameterized by the policy the the things that modulate the latent states like agricultural interventions and practices.
896588	907136	127	B	0.64694	You can think of the timing of planting and harvesting, what kinds of crops or trees get planted, what products like pesticides get applied or not, and more as well as covariates.
907168	911910	128	B	0.92546	So external events like weather, physical risks, wildfire, drought and so on.
912920	921224	129	B	1	And so there's some scientific and measurement parameters that go into this as well.
921342	925492	130	B	0.99892	Things like the effect sizes of the various actions and covariance.
925636	935980	131	B	1	And these local parameters are conditionally dependent on a set of global parameters which, as we discussed, they link information between different ends and different sources of knowledge.
939040	950080	132	B	0.24	The same global parameters are used in the meta analysis model and they actually establish the link between what is found to happen on the ground and what is reported in the literature.
952020	968888	133	B	0.99993	I'm not going to go into this because I think I'm going to run a bit long, but basically the concept is that we have these project nodes that correspond to many farms and they're each on independent nodes in the network that are also connected to this common metaanalysis model.
969054	979464	134	B	1	And together these nodes, they incorporate academic studies, expert knowledge and locally relevant context.
979512	1000748	135	B	0.99987	They do so privately, so only processing the local data locally and through this parameter sharing they actually jointly and iteratively estimate the global posterior in a cycle forever, for as long as there is new data about the project, as long as there's new studies and new expert knowledges.
1000844	1004948	136	B	0.97974	So all of this is happening basically in an online way.
1005114	1009956	137	B	1	And again, the topology can vary, but the principles remain the same.
1010138	1033480	138	B	0.99913	So, just to show a little bit of how this works, this is just two epochs of the global posteriors and this is just location and scale for two parameters the slope and the intercept of the relationship between a vegetation index and the tree biomass in one given hectare of forest.
1033640	1037052	139	B	0.73	And as you can see, this converges pretty quickly.
1037106	1040640	140	B	0.99976	It's comparable to local only methods.
1041780	1049600	141	B	1	And just to highlight how this can be used, also the limits of how this can be used to estimate source reliability.
1049940	1052084	142	B	0.99055	Here's a really successful example at the left.
1052122	1059284	143	B	0.38234	It's pretty straightforward to use this to estimate reliability of satellite data.
1059482	1070730	144	B	1	And for other cases, like very local, very context specific data, you actually need more data or more data from more independent sources that we had in this demo here.
1072700	1080204	145	B	0.99977	Another very useful use case of this is, as we discussed, we don't have direct control over what happens at a form.
1080242	1082332	146	B	0.85071	We can only recommend and nudge often.
1082386	1091616	147	B	0.91702	We also like a node gets sued up, gets sued up for an existing project that has already happened and we want to find out what actions were taken in the past.
1091718	1098592	148	B	1	And the same generative model can be used to estimate what happened in the past.
1098646	1106580	149	B	0.99225	In this example, it infers when planting started and when harvests started for different fields.
1108040	1109828	150	B	0.99963	So bringing it all together.
1109914	1119780	151	B	0.8	One of the applications that we've been using, we've been working on it actually uses all this machinery together to validate claims about projects performance and to estimate future performance.
1119860	1122920	152	B	0.95406	We've deployed this in real world projects.
1124220	1130088	153	B	1	The examples here in this photo are by are relevant to Agroforestry farms in Colombia.
1130264	1147570	154	B	0.97	And we found that this actually helps the project developers and their funders to come to a shared understanding of how successful the project is, how much it's worth in terms of its impact and its fundability, whether it should be scaled up or needs to change course.
1148100	1153812	155	B	0.99995	What is the quality of the strategy versus other potential strategies for natural regeneration and so on?
1153946	1158800	156	B	0.99983	So it's actually useful on the ground for decision making in this context.
1158960	1159670	157	B	0.99997	Cool.
1160280	1168712	158	B	0.99984	So finally I want to talk about the end state and going back to our original motivation of solving everything.
1168846	1170328	159	B	0.6	I forgive you for your thinking.
1170414	1171112	160	B	0.99999	This is nice.
1171166	1180636	161	B	0.99999	But hey, we've been kind of in this downward spiral towards the metacrisis for a long time and what you're telling me doesn't even come close to solving everything.
1180738	1186152	162	B	0.99	And you're right, there's a lot of moving pieces that need to be built and connected.
1186216	1187550	163	B	0.99958	But here's the good news.
1188400	1189528	164	B	0.99966	We can do this.
1189634	1192924	165	B	0.91764	There's no mystery here and we don't need perfection.
1192972	1208432	166	B	1	I love this quote from Edward Fulbrook that says that to define a policy, we don't need exact empirical measures or optimality, if one jumps from an airplane, it may be nice to have an ultimate, but what one really needs is a parachute.
1208576	1213344	167	B	0.99985	So there is only so much that we can get in terms of diminishing returns.
1213392	1219960	168	B	1	What we should be refocusing on is creating and refining solutions everywhere and connecting them everywhere.
1221100	1233740	169	B	1	And you might be thinking about how does this actually scale to global goals and how does this actually get used for scalably building into the fabric of decisions in our society.
1234320	1242240	170	B	0.98947	So about scaling to global goals, I again won't be able to get into the details, but maybe Connor mentioned this in his presentation earlier.
1242660	1251524	171	B	0.99983	We have actually some proof of concepts that we can actually build active agents that are made of active agents.
1251642	1261428	172	B	0.99989	So we've shown in this paper here that a collective of interacting active agents is able to perform approximate inference at the ensemble level.
1261594	1273684	173	B	1	And that this further that this happens through specific mechanisms that are mediated by cognitive capabilities like theory of mind and goal alignment.
1273812	1283260	174	B	0.99998	They work together to improve collective performance by eliminating ambiguity through actively exploiting diversity.
1284080	1286060	175	B	0.99924	So that's one.
1286130	1298928	176	B	1	And the other question is how do we actually build this kind of stuff into not just these ad hoc decisions, but into really the fabric of decision making that is our global economic system.
1299094	1319160	177	B	0.89124	So, talking about here work that I did with Casper Hesp, this is a game that highlights the ability of ants just like the ones that we just described to infer true system state and use it to credibly incentivize long term positive outcomes in an externality happy scenario.
1319900	1330824	178	B	0.99992	This theme we were able to show that it works even with adversarial bot strategies and even with high uncertainty and intentional misinformation.
1330952	1348800	179	B	0.99629	So you can actually get these ends to work with budgets and incentives to drive decision making that internalize externalities and compensates for collusion and generates long term positive outcomes.
1349940	1350752	180	B	0.76402	That's not all.
1350806	1360592	181	B	0.99995	There are other solutions that have been around for longer than ours that apply similar principles to global decision making problems in the real world at scale.
1360656	1370468	182	B	0.99988	This is one case study from our partners at Cognizance that they developed for the COVID pandemic and this is not using Active infrastormalism.
1370564	1379240	183	B	0.9999	This is a combination of traditional recurrent neural networks for prediction and evolutionary optimization for prescription.
1379400	1382524	184	B	1	And it's actually able to achieve some pretty amazing stuff.
1382562	1389070	185	B	0.72837	It discovers a pareto front between prevention of cases and economic cost.
1390800	1393932	186	B	0.83873	It's also a showcase for hybrid human AI intelligence.
1393996	1407812	187	B	0.99951	They did an initial version of this model, then they launched an XPRIZE, they got a bunch of contributions for other models and then they did a meta model that discovered a better pareto front and even better.
1407866	1411476	188	B	0.99999	This tool has actually been used to advise policy in the real world.
1411578	1420650	189	B	0.99607	So it's actually very exciting that we're working with them and connecting the dots, because we need to connect the dots, we need to bring it all together.
1421900	1437496	190	B	0.99999	This illustration here is just, I think, a subset of the effects of the climate change crisis, which is just one aspect of the metacrisis on humans, on our society and the economy.
1437688	1445180	191	B	1	And so we actually need to be able to deploy solutions that work across many different domains and to connect these dots.
1445340	1446528	192	B	1	This means two things.
1446614	1451968	193	B	1	The first is interoperability aligning decisions across context so that we don't get unintended consequences.
1452064	1460080	194	B	1	And second is reusability so being able to transport and transfer learning and structure across contexts.
1460160	1472280	195	B	0.98314	So for instance, using that evolutionary approach from the COVID example in our agricultural context or in many other possible contexts, and this takes the form of libraries, of components, APIs and so forth.
1473500	1475224	196	B	0.99424	So that's what we're working on.
1475262	1476772	197	B	0.99172	So we're launching this consortium.
1476836	1484750	198	B	0.99962	We just put up the website a few minutes ago, and we have the goal of having a minimal but functionally complete implementation by the end of next year.
1486160	1487628	199	B	0.99	And this is an open project.
1487714	1499868	200	B	0.99994	We are working on this at our organization called Digital Guy, but we're also launching this open consortium that welcomes contributors from anywhere, both active inference experts and non experts.
1500044	1503244	201	B	0.98	And we need a lot of contributors.
1503292	1509300	202	B	0.99982	We need all of you because this is the most important thing that we could ever be working on together.
1509450	1512320	203	B	1	And we need your help to tackle the many remaining challenges.
1512400	1518856	204	B	0.99899	So if you want to help us build the planetary brain, please go to Gaiaconsortium.org or reach out to me.
1518878	1520344	205	B	0.6223	You know where to find me.
1520542	1525780	206	B	0.99	And together we can design, build, and learn what it takes to achieve planetary regeneration.
1525940	1526810	207	B	0.99255	Thank you.
1529180	1529904	208	A	0.31669	Barath.
1529972	1532780	209	A	0.9912	Thanks for the great presentation.
1533680	1540428	210	A	0.54492	I'll post the link to Gaia Consortium into the YouTube live chat.
1540604	1544560	211	A	0.99787	But let me get a few quick questions in.
1544630	1547488	212	A	0.91404	So here we go.
1547574	1549904	213	A	1	First question.
1550102	1554100	214	A	0.99977	This is from Marco Lynn.
1557400	1560148	215	A	1	I agree with the critical importance of such a project.
1560314	1576520	216	A	0.99966	How will you deal with the challenges of scaling given the dependence on real world entities like humans, dependence on real world entities like humans for major metacrisis domains such as geopolitics, sociocultural fragmentation, and other particularly hard sense making domains?
1578720	1579912	217	B	1	First of all hi, Marco.
1579976	1581196	218	B	0.95408	Yeah, thanks for the question.
1581298	1586104	219	B	1	And I 100% agree that I'm not claiming that this is sufficient.
1586152	1587820	220	B	0.92007	I'm just claiming that it's necessary.
1588580	1608032	221	B	0.99976	We do have a lot of ideas and a lot of energy that we want to put into exactly what you described, how to weave what we're doing into the existing incentive landscapes, whether they're market incentives or policy incentives.
1608176	1611808	222	B	0.99998	But ultimately, this needs to be an enabler.
1611824	1613860	223	B	0.6412	This needs to meet people where they are.
1613930	1620184	224	B	1	And we need to be cognizant that change is not going to happen overnight, at least not right now.
1620222	1620424	225	B	0.99945	Right.
1620462	1626312	226	B	0.85043	Typically these things take a while to mature and then they snap into place.
1626366	1634616	227	B	1	And we're already finding some of this happening in some of the domains that we're working on where nothing happened for a very long time and then bam, hockey stick.
1634728	1640172	228	B	0.99	And we believe that the same can happen pretty much anywhere.
1640236	1641840	229	B	0.99771	So we're very optimistic.
1642500	1643008	230	A	0.99565	Great.
1643094	1647040	231	A	0.99984	What are currently the greatest challenges for Gaia as an organization?
1647540	1653208	232	A	0.97	I love that kind of ambiguous question, like, is that the Gaia Consortium as an organization or is it Gaia?
1653324	1654980	233	A	0.93467	But let's hear both.
1655050	1660420	234	A	0.99996	What are the greatest challenges or frictions for the Consortium and for the bigger picture.
1662760	1666504	235	B	0.4159	Going to I'm not going to talk about the technical stuff for change.
1666542	1670424	236	B	0.99641	I'm going to talk about the more meta stuff.
1670462	1679180	237	B	0.85	And it's actually very related to what your previous presentation, Daniel, about that paper about the Institute talked about.
1679250	1706788	238	B	0.99	And it's really related to building out this common, what we were calling the common cognitive kernel for sense making and decision making and relatedly breaking through this culture of sort of suspicion and surf wars and getting people trying to stake their claim to something.
1706954	1713976	239	B	0.97875	So we are, and always have been extremely open, but it's kind of hard anyway to build trust.
1714078	1721192	240	B	0.99915	So we're aware that it's going to take a while to build this trust with everybody.
1721326	1730796	241	B	0.32	And I think the only answer to that is really to be as participatory and transparent as possible.
1730898	1740690	242	B	0.76001	Also being humble and knowing where we don't have the answer and asking people to help us.
1742660	1743504	243	A	0.99999	Awesome.
1743702	1746720	244	A	0.99998	Any closing words or thoughts?
1749620	1762804	245	B	0.6827	Well, if there are no further questions, again, I thank you all for paying attention and I'm going to be reaching out a lot more.
1762842	1765072	246	B	0.96555	You're going to hear a lot more about this consortium.
1765136	1766496	247	B	1	As I said, it was just formed.
1766528	1769428	248	B	0.53205	They just put up a website in time for this presentation.
1769524	1782060	249	B	0.99987	By the way, thanks so much to Mahi and of course, Steve and everybody else who's been part of forming and getting this ball to start rolling.
1782720	1789524	250	B	0.99957	We are very early stage, very formative, and still very client.
1789672	1804756	251	B	0.94682	So I just gave you my perspective on a bunch of these things, the shape of it that has come from our work on this so far, and even not all of it.
1804778	1807270	252	B	0.99992	Just a piece that we could cover in 20 minutes or so.
1807960	1810928	253	B	0.99996	But we are very plural.
1811024	1824776	254	B	0.67839	We want to engage with you on different paths, forward, different opportunities to build things, to experiment, to connect the dots, to learn together.
1824958	1846400	255	B	1	And ultimately, we really just want to provide a platform, a convening space, a protocol in the classic sense of the world, a word of a shared language, a shared means of communication, a shared means of understanding, to find together what we need to do to actually build this third attractor.
1847220	1850796	256	A	0.99909	Awesome call Gaia trim tab.
1850988	1852370	257	B	0.99832	Thank you exactly.
1853780	1856048	258	B	0.99901	Thanks so much, Daniel, and see you guys soon.
1856134	1858400	259	A	0.57668	Bye bye.
1860980	1861970	260	A	0.96994	All right.
1864380	1865700	261	A	0.99971	What a cool presentation.
