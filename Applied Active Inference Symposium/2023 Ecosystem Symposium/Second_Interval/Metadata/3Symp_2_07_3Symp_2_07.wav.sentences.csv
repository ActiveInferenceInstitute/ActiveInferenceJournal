24970	25880	8	B	0.95381	All right.
27850	38082	9	B	1	The next presentation is with Pablo Fernandez-Maquieira.
38226	40150	10	B	0.99181	So welcome back, Pablo.
41050	44618	11	A	0.99447	Hello here.
44784	48730	12	B	0.5739	Okay, I did take us on an adventure of curiosity.
49470	50182	13	A	1	Yes.
50336	52766	14	A	0.71443	I'm going to start sharing my screen.
52868	55440	15	A	1	Let me know if everything is all right.
58770	61440	16	B	0.9988	Should be perfect.
62210	62922	17	A	0.79	Yes.
63076	63780	18	A	0.99895	Cool.
66150	75220	19	A	0.99921	So this is one of my favorite memes and probably most of you know it.
76250	99286	20	A	0.94547	This reference is the cave of Platon and to me it was kind of fine treated truth that now with active inference seems like we are closer to demonstrate.
99318	101200	21	A	0.97735	That how it is.
101970	129814	22	A	0.78252	So the first time that I start act and surf at the Institute, this was kind of my feeling or my face was looking into something that it was complex, scary and look interesting.
130012	137880	23	A	0.99876	So I went why I decided to go through it.
141150	152160	24	A	0.65	I envision a world where people is driving by stronger incentives that motivate them to reduce uncertainty in the systems they are part of.
153410	157710	25	A	1	My approach is through games which are going to go later.
157860	167358	26	A	0.99998	But I really on this talk, want to encourage all kinds of persons or people that are curious.
167454	173780	27	A	1	And I want them to act and get involved in the community.
174150	186694	28	A	1	Because you may find that for now most of the actors are scientists and very well on reputed people.
186892	195722	29	A	1	And you might think that you are not a part of it, but very far away from that.
195856	196934	30	A	1	The Institute.
197062	199270	31	A	0.87171	Encourage the opposite.
199350	209520	32	A	0.99311	So I'm super glad to have been through this journey and I wanted to share a little bit of my background and then we go to the game.
212390	214430	33	A	0.89222	Here is the second and last meme.
214510	218702	34	A	1	The world you were raised to survive is no longer exist.
218846	233960	35	A	0.63525	We are on digital revolution and with this digital revolution it comes a bunch of different things that are evolving and hopefully bring us to a better world.
235610	236934	36	A	0.79371	Okay, who I am?
237052	237894	37	A	0.57082	I'm Pablo.
237942	238854	38	A	0.99973	My name is Pablo.
238902	246890	39	A	0.98715	But more defined or what best define me is my action and my experiences.
253010	269090	40	A	0.96	I think role gameplays and sports movies are super important and as a kid I was dyslexic and the system didn't fill my necessities.
269430	272274	41	A	0.5248	So I really hated school.
272472	278118	42	A	0.64292	But I love learning and it's something that I've been doing all my life.
278204	292860	43	A	0.63	And it's curious how a system that is designed to give you knowledge and to help you with the learning, in my case it didn't work at all.
295390	299020	44	A	0.94782	That's a little starting point.
299630	320770	45	A	1	I believe in the copy transformation and combine of things and on my adulthood everything shifted and I became successful, professional and I love it.
320840	321650	46	A	0.99127	Teams.
323590	344010	47	A	0.99997	What I do for a living is product manager and what I do on my pet projects site projects, call it as you want is related to gaming and gamifying organizations and experiences.
346510	358750	48	A	0.96732	Nowadays I trust more my intuition which is something that it really was broken during my childhood and you will see a little bit more about that.
358900	361200	49	A	0.99998	Here are some things of my interest.
361570	383720	50	A	0.61374	Licenses like open science which is the case of the Institute philosophy that's the first meme education, governance, family, art, love, communication, technology and nature and a bunch of other things that I will be happy to share any other time.
385210	395850	51	A	1	One of the questions that Daniel asked me for this talk is what was exciting for me about all this, what right?
395920	414594	52	A	1	And for me, when I give talks, I like to share a view of the last hundred years and the Industrial revolution and how the ones that were on this world before us did something right.
414792	427270	53	A	0.99915	I'm sure that we all know big mistakes or big things that have failed or that could be better through iterations.
427610	435160	54	A	0.99986	But on data it's very promising and very good.
435770	463540	55	A	1	I think it's inspiring to have the basic education, how it grows, the vaccination, what it did for us, democracy and how poverty dropped draxily, how literacy it grew and because all these things, child mortality just went very low.
465670	472610	56	A	0.99987	So basically the future of education is what makes me be excited.
475430	477858	57	A	0.97318	How I ended up on this ecosystem.
478034	485654	58	A	0.96503	It's super random and I'm going to explain it in hopefully two to five minutes.
485852	491500	59	A	0.51	I as a product manager and very interested on technology.
491950	499850	60	A	0.99	I heard about Blockchains back in 2015 and I didn't understood anything at all.
500000	509934	61	A	0.76	And then back in 2017 I heard about a I didn't start them, did not play that game.
510052	521410	62	A	0.99999	But it was raising a fun thing to consider, which is digital assets and ownership of those digital assets.
522790	542410	63	A	0.99955	For now, we didn't have a technology that could scale and that was good enough to ensure that the digital assets that you own were you yours and you had the freedom of transaction on them.
542560	554910	64	A	1	I did understand that very fast and because I'm a game player and as a game player you always have your different assets and do things with them.
554980	566206	65	A	1	And as well, I have been collecting music and all kind of digital assets.
566398	576710	66	A	1	I bought this very famous collection of punks and sold them very fast before I could be a millionaire.
577610	582038	67	A	0.99987	But due to in 2021 I decided that I wanted to build something.
582204	596342	68	A	1	And then back then I went through this beautiful project that was the first art saw on Ethereum, which one of the artists it was Daniel Friedman.
596486	631638	69	A	0.97762	So I, as a curious person and person that has been working with artists, I always like to know what is the driver of those artists, what they do, and try to get in their walls, to understand better and to get as much information as I can before I decide to encourage or collect or just always deeper on music or art.
631724	636150	70	A	0.99995	For me, is very nice thing to do.
636300	643818	71	A	0.99834	So I discovered these cards and education was one of them.
643904	653790	72	A	0.99	And I went through Flickr which is where it was the first at least that I found place where it was.
653860	654874	73	A	0.89	And the license.
654922	678150	74	A	0.919	It was Creative Commons license of not commercial use but it was an open license which I been part of Creative Commons community for a very long time since I was working with musicians and I think it's one of the best things that happened to the internet.
680010	686742	75	A	0.99373	These are some of the pragmatic things that the audience cares about.
686876	692010	76	A	0.8834	Hopefully we will have some of these on our games.
693870	696460	77	A	0.45	AI for sure is going to be there.
698510	709690	78	A	1	Free energy principle is going to be one of the things that hopefully we help to minimize and to make it funnier.
709770	716100	79	A	0.99994	Games or happier games and games that help organizations to be better.
717350	721122	80	A	1	The human factor, it's super important for me.
721176	729494	81	A	0.67	And implementation and action I learned by doing and it's one of the values that the Institute encouraged more.
729612	738140	82	A	0.99976	So I just jump on things and try to understand them through doing and sharing as I'm doing now.
739470	748154	83	A	0.99998	Here are the epistemics and collective is one of them that I'm as well.
748352	778978	84	A	0.99997	Super interest agents, of course, practical and curiosity which is the adventure that I have the feeling that I'm being involved all my life and that I encourage always my two girls to be curious and to open things and look behind the doors and just be an active.
779154	787000	85	A	0.99998	Here are some values that I like to point which are exploration, the culture of curiosity that I did mention a lot.
788830	794538	86	A	0.99055	Continuous learning because that experience on the school.
794624	805150	87	A	1	I think I just keep going and keep going and it's something that sometimes bad experiences could turn out in good habits.
806290	809360	88	A	0.99993	Learning by doing, as I already told.
811010	813246	89	A	0.89113	Integrity and inclusivity.
813358	818194	90	A	0.83053	Honesty, accountability, a big one.
818392	821540	91	A	0.99994	Trying to be professional on everything that you do.
822790	826022	92	A	0.99998	For me, I started as human being.
826076	835590	93	A	0.9974	Curious people of all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome to the Institute.
837530	847770	94	A	0.99	I would be very happy to be the link and to speak with someone that has doubts or if I couldn't help.
847840	850650	95	A	1	I think I could help on the very early stage.
851490	855230	96	A	0.80797	If you're not very technical person, I think I could help.
855300	861214	97	A	0.99695	There we are learning by doing.
861332	879560	98	A	1	I would love to everyone that's on the stream, I'm going to share this link which is a new game that we are testing and I'm excited to share it with you.
881210	885714	99	A	0.81161	It's the adventure of Curiosity and here Daniel.
885762	891180	100	A	0.87844	I'm going to copy and paste the link.
893070	894154	101	A	0.94383	It would be awesome.
894272	894602	102	B	0.6425	Okay.
894656	896582	103	B	0.72619	There's a tiny typo on your slides.
896646	898730	104	B	0.99996	It just ends with a curiosity.
900370	901070	105	A	0.67503	Thank you.
901140	905230	106	B	0.92402	But I'm going to paste it into the YouTube live chat.
906450	908062	107	A	0.65703	Okay, thank you.
908196	910714	108	A	0.99866	Yeah, I told you I'm a Dyslexic.
910762	914834	109	A	1	I have all kind of titles throughout my life.
915032	916226	110	A	0.9985	Sorry for that.
916248	923650	111	A	0.98	I always try to improve share the.
923800	926774	112	B	0.99745	Yeah, I put it in the YouTube chat so people can head over there.
926812	927382	113	B	0.96339	All right, yeah.
927436	928854	114	B	0.99983	Could you tell us about this platform?
928972	931240	115	B	1	And this is the first active game?
932650	953566	116	A	1	Yes, we started thinking on how to do game a while ago and we decided to go with this picture that explains how it works.
953668	968340	117	A	0.99996	Actually it's simple and you have four pieces, the internal state, external state, and in the middle you have the sensory state and the active state.
968710	972334	118	A	0.99581	So here is the mission.
972382	984040	119	A	1	You have some instructions that you can read and would be fun if you go through them and you can go either way.
984490	1009600	120	A	1	And here we are going to go through the sensory state where you're going to listen to a music where some notes you can censor that are not in the famous song for Elise.
1011700	1032730	121	A	0.99813	So you have to take notes and you can go and you can see that we are on the Markov blanket which saw everything very delineate as Dali would paint it.
1033420	1067110	122	A	1	And here is your active part of the game where you have to do something which is add the different notes that your professor, music professor is telling you don't miss because you probably on the external state are trying to play the music.
1067480	1088360	123	A	0.99729	So you have to infer that you are missing some notes and go to the active state and start walking through the right node.
1089020	1098350	124	A	0.99999	If I miss the node, I just follow into the nothing and come back into my internal state.
1098880	1104930	125	A	0.99933	So probably would have to go back and sensor again.
1107380	1118576	126	A	1	And once I take the right actions and the right nodes, I can go and solve the puzzle.
1118768	1139996	127	A	0.63	And the idea here is to have a tool, gaming tool to explain so you can experience how this active inference on free energy works.
1140178	1166752	128	A	1	And once you go to the end of that adventure, which I'm not going to finish because it's something that players should do, you're going to have a door where you have to put the sequence in low case of what were the missing notes.
1166896	1185832	129	A	1	And it's going to allow you to come inside the treasure room where you will have feedback, feedback that you can send us and we will be very happy to have it.
1185966	1193832	130	A	1	And then if you have a wallet, you will be able to have digital asset.
1193976	1206080	131	A	0.99998	If not, we will add information to help people to go from web two to web three and to get those digital assets.
1206820	1217190	132	A	1	And here to be developed would be future adventures that I would be very happy to do.
1218680	1229370	133	A	0.99986	So this was pretty much the presentation and hopefully we have new players in the coming days.
1230460	1232072	134	A	0.99996	Hope you have fun.
1232206	1265460	135	A	1	And I really encourage anyone to discover and play with all these ideas and thoughts and experiments and feelings that I have the gut feeling that are going to revolutionize how we understand the world and how we can improve in it by reducing uncertainty.
1266040	1275476	136	A	0.99821	So thank you and I don't know, Daniel, if you have any comments or something in this last ten minutes.
1275658	1278424	137	B	1	Oh, yeah, we can definitely talk for a few minutes.
1278542	1283656	138	B	0.77778	I'm seeing many fun comments and questions in the chat so people can post it.
1283678	1288330	139	B	0.74224	Yeah, the gameplay is smoother on even a normal computer.
1288940	1294510	140	B	0.98938	It may look choppy on the live stream, but it's quite a nice playing experience.
1295040	1302848	141	B	0.99999	Maybe just a little context like how did you get into building these worlds or what kind of tools are these?
1303014	1309932	142	B	1	And we obviously don't see them in today's mainstream educational and research offerings.
1309996	1320950	143	B	0.99989	But what could that even be to bring together this kind of immersion and role playing with education research?
1323400	1338440	144	A	1	Yes, I we playing role games and role games you have very diverse kind of players.
1338880	1360640	145	A	0.75358	So I was playing with guys like me, had a struggle through the school and guys that end up being researchers like yourself because they were very good in those environments.
1362980	1376240	146	A	0.99999	For me, it was like we are sharing a lot of cognitive values and information and they are really having fun with me.
1376410	1388440	147	A	0.71284	So what the academia is telling me is not what I'm feeling outside academia.
1388880	1411776	148	A	0.3968	So that through the years it became more and more clear that was one of the drivers to have a very diverse kind of friends and that one of the most important things for me to learn.
1411878	1426550	149	A	0.99991	It was having fun and to be a good professional, I have to be enjoying what I'm doing and to enjoy what I do, it has to have that gamify feeling of it.
1428060	1453952	150	A	0.99998	In 2021, I just went straight to explore that road because Blockchains, what can do is have a persistent sea of objects and attributions to those objects and to those wallets that you can add and build on top of them.
1454086	1465220	151	A	0.97018	It's like having a huge database for a game purpose and then you figure out that a game is kind of our organization.
1465560	1482650	152	A	0.99242	So you need rules, you need to share values, you need to have what we are building now, which is the cecian cedo which you agree with the players, what's going to be about and how it's going to work.
1483100	1512848	153	A	0.92	And we are building this fantastic storytelling of how kind of world where it was in the early 20s compared to what's happening now in this imaginary world that's complementary to what's happening in real life.
1513014	1518164	154	A	1	And we are just exploring those areas for three years.
1518362	1527380	155	A	1	And once I got into the Institute, we started serving these ideas.
1527460	1535530	156	A	0.52698	You send us to do a system thinking course that it was super cool.
1536860	1553820	157	A	0.70906	We explore and learn and this document that I can share, it was very important for us to understand and we find out the necessity to be able to compute what we are doing.
1553890	1576356	158	A	0.99997	So we start focusing more on ontology on all the bricks that you need to understand to build the skeleton of something that could last for decades, which is the idea.
1576458	1590590	159	A	1	And we are trying to build it so everyone can copy, paste, fork it and do whatever they want with the game, adapt it to their own organizations and use it on their favor.
1591200	1594670	160	A	0.99	And we are just exploring and having fun.
1597840	1598572	161	B	0.99997	That's awesome.
1598626	1602832	162	B	1	And there's so many pieces there.
1602886	1620000	163	B	0.75179	It's true about the fun and the curiosity, those intrinsic motivations like being 6 hours deep into counting ants in the desert or 5000 pipette pushes deep or whatever it is in the trenches and in the last mile.
1620080	1626580	164	B	1	And it can be easy to lose sight.
1627260	1659036	165	B	0.99924	But when we lose sight and when we put out the fire and the spark, it's a cold, dark night, and no career or status or extrinsic valuation is going to provide simply the joy and the deeper meaning of to two people going on a little adventure running around this space, being inside active inference rather than active inference.
1659068	1666996	166	B	0.99773	Being like this high speed train that's leaving anyone behind or you're on the outside and it's taking these twists and turns and you're getting thrown off.
1667098	1686024	167	B	0.99574	It's like it is cool and air conditioned in this space and people play and watch a lot of games where they wield violent arms and not even like saying whether that's good or bad.
1686062	1700456	168	B	0.74086	It's just it is a genre to want to have a camera either in a character's head first person perspective or a camera in a second or a third person perspective, which you can switch between here and those kinds.
1700488	1724432	169	B	1	Of topics about egocentric versus allocentric navigation and our ability to have a perspective swap on ourself and be able to take that kind of like out of body situational awareness in real spatial settings and just to be able to cruise through this space and it's like, yeah, there's no right way to boomerang.
1724576	1726524	170	B	0.99987	You could go from external to sensory.
1726592	1728010	171	B	0.99882	You could go here or there.
