19290	19920	1	B	0.86371	All right.
20930	22202	2	B	0.99995	Welcome, Mahault.
22346	31338	3	B	0.99994	This will be the final of the presentation sessions in the symposium.
31514	38218	4	B	0.99883	This is Mahault Albarracin with the presentation “Shared protentions in active inference.”
38314	41040	5	B	0.99502	So, thank you, Mahault, to you.
42810	48070	6	B	0.76	And you're the first to join with an AI Steward/Guardian.
50010	50758	7	A	0.99899	Awesome.
50924	52342	8	A	0.99274	Shall I share my screen?
52476	53160	9	B	0.99692	Yes.
55150	56140	10	A	0.79353	Let's do.
58030	58970	11	A	0.99682	Just a second.
59040	60970	12	A	0.99991	I'm looking for a window.
61710	63340	13	A	0.97	I think this will do.
64830	66720	14	A	0.56127	Okay, so can you see the screen?
67250	67710	15	B	0.99603	Yes.
67780	68254	16	B	0.9997	Looks good.
68292	69214	17	B	0.99999	Thank you.
69412	69918	18	A	0.9999	Awesome.
70004	80014	19	A	0.999	So, unfortunately, I imagine that you are seeing the entire screen and not just the presentation.
80062	81266	20	A	1	I apologize about that.
81368	82162	21	B	0.83	I got it.
82296	83054	22	B	0.98828	It's cropped.
83102	83970	23	B	1	I got it.
84120	85102	24	A	0.97853	Okay, wonderful.
85166	86020	25	A	0.96622	Thank you.
87510	93714	26	A	0.9977	All right, so welcome to the presentation on Shared Potential under Active Inference.
93762	96550	27	A	0.99934	We're going to cover a lot of topics.
97370	102680	28	A	0.96377	Shall I introduce myself a little bit, or have you already done that?
104170	104822	29	A	0.99746	Awesome.
104956	106686	30	A	0.69632	So, my name is Mawal Bahasa.
106738	110118	31	A	0.52113	I'm a PhD student in cognitive computing.
110214	120990	32	A	1	I work in active inference in the interaction between social sciences, philosophy, consciousness, science, and artificial intelligence.
122850	127306	33	A	0.98966	We're going to start a presentation on potential and active inference.
127338	128946	34	A	0.98969	So I'm going to define a lot of terms.
129048	134210	35	A	0.9997	It's going to deal into philosophy, terms that are very deep.
135430	137010	36	A	0.8	And so let's get started.
137080	140260	37	A	1	If you will just give me one small second.
147730	149006	38	A	0.83	And we're back.
149188	159018	39	A	0.99886	So, shared potential is a term derived from phenomenology, and it refers to the shared anticipation of future events among a group of individuals.
159194	167890	40	A	0.99999	This philosophical study of experience and consciousness becomes particularly interesting when we consider it in the context of active inference.
168230	178866	41	A	0.99999	When we combine these two concepts, we get a powerful tool for understanding how groups of individuals can coordinate their actions and work towards a common goal.
179058	181638	42	A	0.99999	This is the main focus of the discussion today.
181724	186490	43	A	0.99996	So imagine a group of people planning a trip.
186830	192170	44	A	0.99999	They all share a common goal to have a successful and enjoyable trip.
192750	197130	45	A	0.49124	This shared goal forms the basis of their shared potential.
197550	205710	46	A	0.99737	They all anticipate future events related to the trip, such as booking tickets, packing their bags, and visiting various attractions.
206210	211994	47	A	0.81377	As they start to take actions towards their goal, they're also engaging in active inference.
212122	218306	48	A	0.85728	They're making predictions about what will happen next and then adjusting these predictions based on what actually happens.
218408	223922	49	A	0.99995	So, for example, they might predict that a certain flight will be the cheapest based on their past experiences.
224066	229266	50	A	0.62363	But when they actually check the prices, they find that another flight is cheaper.
229458	233030	51	A	0.99998	So they adjust their prediction and book the other flight.
233370	241580	52	A	0.99937	This constant cycle of prediction and adjustment, guided by their shared potential, helps the group coordinate their actions and make their trip a success.
242830	252270	53	A	0.99991	So we're going to delve deeper into the concepts and explore the role of past experiences known as retentions in shaping our current knowledge and future predictions.
260240	263208	54	A	0.99989	Let's explain first the concept of retentions.
263384	271170	55	A	0.99994	Retention is a key component of time consciousness that retains the past trajectory of a temporal object.
272180	280160	56	A	0.69635	It's the preservation of the content of a now past hyletic datum in our present consciousness.
280900	289140	57	A	0.68	A highletic datum refers to the raw, uninterpreted sensations that arise in our consciousness.
290060	301000	58	A	0.7842	When we retain these data, we are essentially keeping a record of past sensations and experiences that can inform our present and our future actions.
302720	311710	59	A	0.99356	In active inference, we can formalize retention by thinking of moments as binning of states which are bound to a hierarchical state.
312160	320130	60	A	0.99321	This way, retention is seen as the bidding which becomes the current state, informing the next expected state.
320980	329990	61	A	1	To further connect retention with active inference, we can consider the way in which retention plays a role in updating an agent's belief and generative model.
330680	339190	62	A	1	The past experiences influence the current expectations and actions, thus shaping the agent's understanding of the world and the future.
340440	344660	63	A	0.99995	So let's consider a practical example to illustrate this concept.
344820	349690	64	A	0.99997	If you had a good experience at a particular restaurant, you might choose to go there again in the future.
350060	353476	65	A	0.99984	Your past experience influences your future decision.
353668	358216	66	A	0.99882	In hostile temporal phenomenology, we would think about much shorter timescale.
358248	366430	67	A	0.99997	But if we extend this concept, we can see a much larger structure wherein the retention is simply the past state.
366880	370272	68	A	0.9017	It's like having a mental note that says this place is good.
370406	374050	69	A	0.96	And this is how an example of retention works in your everyday life.
374820	385780	70	A	0.80105	They're not merely representation or memories, but presentations of a temporarily extended present which distinguishes them from recollections.
386120	391690	71	A	1	This involves the presentation of some already constituted content in conscious experience.
393100	405100	72	A	0.65661	Retentions also play a crucial role in mapping past knowledge onto current beliefs, contributing to the development of shared narratives or goals that we will delve into in the rest of the presentation.
406160	411964	73	A	0.99908	They can be former now points and the current awareness of the past and far.
412162	420640	74	A	0.64827	Sedimented retentions can be engraved in scripts or deep temporal priors or more fluid deontic cues.
422020	430900	75	A	0.99999	This phenomenon corresponds to a specific application of message passing between agents in the present moment and in the sensorium.
431960	441960	76	A	0.93556	Retentions and protensions may also emerge jointly within a group, forming a collective understanding that transcends individual perspectives.
445270	455266	77	A	0.81579	Protensions, as we saw, refer to the anticipation of future events based on past experiences and current knowledge.
455458	457718	78	A	0.96468	It's thus forward looking.
457804	461640	79	A	0.98667	It's the forward looking counterpart to retention which is backward looking.
462250	467080	80	A	0.97117	Retention is the anticipation of future trajectories of a temporal object.
468010	475180	81	A	0.99497	It's the process of looking ahead, predicting what's to come based on what has been and what currently is.
475790	483600	82	A	0.99984	So in active inference, it could be formalized by considering the future states that are expected based on the current state and past states.
485010	488990	83	A	0.25492	Protension is thus the anticipation guiding the next action.
490770	503380	84	A	0.70198	We can consider the way in which protension plays a role in updating an agent's beliefs and generative models influencing the actions and thus shaping the agent's understanding of the world and the future.
504150	510802	85	A	0.99988	So for instance, if you see Dark Cloud in the sky, you might anticipate that it's going to rain and decide to carry an umbrella.
510946	514050	86	A	0.99999	This anticipation of future events is potential.
514210	520730	87	A	0.63682	It's also going to determine whether or not you're wet when you go outside and therefore whether or not you expect to be wet.
521230	524700	88	A	0.62448	Your brain is constantly making predictions about what's going to happen next.
525710	535550	89	A	0.99987	So let's put this in the context of temporal flow which ties together those concepts of primal impressions and we will see retention and protention.
537570	547220	90	A	0.99856	Temporal flow is the structure that represents the continuous progression of time from the past through the present and into the future.
549110	558470	91	A	0.99976	Agents are constantly revising their generative models and they do this by integrating the observations which we could refer to here as primal impressions.
559690	566920	92	A	0.57604	This updating process is a balancing act between maintaining the predictive density of the agent's current beliefs and adapting to new information.
568890	577370	93	A	0.94438	Retentions and pretensions structure time for a given agent creating a framework that shapes their perception and anticipation.
578110	591402	94	A	0.99996	Different agents or systems will exhibit varying qualities and quantities of retention and potential which resembles something like Mike Levin's concept of cognitive light codes.
591546	600290	95	A	0.99614	So given the presence of retention we can anticipate a protentional horizon not merely as an arbitrary expectation.
602710	616710	96	A	0.99591	Are thus the point at which agents beliefs about the world are updated to match their current observations which leads to a more accurate understanding of the environment and allows for more effective goal directed behavior.
617870	626650	97	A	0.99004	Primal impressions are the fulfillment of a potential which is the time bound nexus of perception and existence.
630050	634350	98	A	1	It is the resolved probability that redefines the local gradient.
635330	638430	99	A	0.99782	It's in primal impression that reality collapses.
639410	645300	100	A	1	The primal impression is thus modeled as the essential Bayesian cognitive moment.
646070	657010	101	A	0.83	It is the juxtaposition of prior beliefs or retention with ongoing sensory information in an unfolding future oriented present or retention.
658410	668990	102	A	0.99141	So now we have a description of temporal thickness from feminine ominnology which is compatible with generative modeling and active inference agents for hospital.
669090	677740	103	A	0.9955	This flow of conscious experience is primarily made up of sensations that well up in a raw uninterpreted form that we called earlier hyletic data.
678190	681550	104	A	0.99625	So this data is the now phase of a temporal object.
681700	686910	105	A	1	It is formatted according to the identic or cognitive laws of consciousness.
687570	690320	106	A	0.99999	This is specifically relative to inner time.
692690	706470	107	A	0.85173	We can understand how temporal flow structures how agents are able to make choices, act to self evidence, connect the passive structure with the active component of decision making or goal pursuit.
707050	711670	108	A	0.99992	Individuals have drives and teleology insofar as they have preferences.
712330	723770	109	A	0.9999	These preferences are protented goals reached towards by what we would call potentially the fiat wherein the fiat constitutes the will to act towards a desire.
724350	734830	110	A	0.99536	So the fulfillment of a pretension by fiat drives the agent towards a teleology across a trail set in a retentional extension.
735490	737018	111	A	0.99999	More information is amassed.
737034	741600	112	A	0.96998	So the longer your retention, more information can be caught in a moment.
742450	755590	113	A	0.99999	As individuals amass enough information they can then find a structure to the information which becomes a map rather than a territory and is computationally more efficient than the sum of all the information amassed.
757050	761618	114	A	0.99998	This new state of information may lead individuals closer to a shared goal.
761714	776570	115	A	1	The information amassed turns into an emergent whole of the retention, which grabs focus at the present moment because it seems to bring signals to the model that the potential goal is closer and is computationally simpler to retain.
779410	790290	116	A	0.9999	So sharing of retentions and potentials among group members in a social context can facilitate coordination and the achievement of a shared goal.
790950	803750	117	A	0.99999	By aligning their beliefs about the past or retentions and expectations about the future or potentials, group members can better predict each other's actions and intentions.
804330	808170	118	A	0.99999	This allows them to work together more effectively.
810190	818050	119	A	0.90015	In some cases, group members may have retentions and potentials that align naturally due to common experiences or understanding.
818230	839330	120	A	0.99991	Even without active communication, however, group members often actively communicate their retentions and protensions, aligning their beliefs and expectations through dialogue and interaction, thereby enhancing their ability to predict each other's actions and intentions.
840230	852470	121	A	0.99	Retentions and protensions may also emerge jointly within the group, not confined to any individual agents, unvelt forming a collective understanding that transcends individual perspectives.
853610	867130	122	A	0.99703	This complex interplay of individual and collective dynamics can be explored further in hierarchical generative models encompassing resonant, cognitive models, communication and even joint emergence.
869950	880590	123	A	1	The structure of time consciousness encapsulated in retention and protension thus plays a significant role in the emergence of shared potentials.
881270	894290	124	A	0.99935	As agents retain and process similar elements from their environment, they can cocompute shared potentials by mapping each other's cognitive pathways and building upon one another's trails.
894890	912490	125	A	0.99651	This process is formalized by Bayesian updating the relationship between the topology of protensions and the expectation gradient, as well as the role of retention in mapping past knowledge on the current beliefs plays a role in development of shared narratives and goals.
915070	923580	126	A	0.78809	We can use this to get a deeper insight into the processes that drive the emergence of collective behavior and the development of shared understanding among agents.
925550	934980	127	A	0.99999	There is no better way to do it than using active inference by extending generative models of individual agents to account for the beliefs and goals of other agents.
935830	938178	128	A	0.99993	This is akin to theory of mind.
938344	943860	129	A	0.99	It enables them to anticipate and adapt to the actions of their peers by offloading to the group.
946150	950870	130	A	0.90675	So we discussed a little bit's earlier shared goals.
951610	958246	131	A	0.61998	Potential goals are future oriented objectives that individuals or groups strive to achieve.
958438	965270	132	A	0.56103	They're not just mere desires, but they're actively pursued through the act of will that we called earlier fiat.
965430	970254	133	A	1	The fulfillment of a pretension drives the agent towards a teleology that trail set.
970292	978522	134	A	0.99999	We discussed the fulfillment of a prediction entails less surprise and therefore the agent self evidences.
978586	989342	135	A	1	By seeking to accurately predict their surroundings, agents select a series of actions or policies which generate transitions between states that produce expected observations.
989486	997334	136	A	0.99995	So through the choice of policy, an individual can reach their potented goal by minimizing the expected free energy that a given policy affords them.
997372	1001538	137	A	0.99999	This seems pretty central and simple in terms of active inference.
1001714	1007030	138	A	0.54351	So farther potentials are represented by the policies of longer time death.
1007370	1013050	139	A	1	In a hierarchical model, this corresponds to a policy tied to a higher level action in a slower timescale.
1013470	1029390	140	A	0.85	The choice of policies driven by the expected free energy of that higher order policy or the entire multiscale generative model is based on the agent's preferences, allowing an agent to conduct gold directed behaviors across temporal scales.
1031430	1041620	141	A	0.97296	So this is where we can cash out Jeff Yoshimi's trail sets where agents assimilate actions into the anticipated continuity of objects in their surrounding world.
1041990	1049266	142	A	0.98897	This simulation ensures a smoother understanding of the environment and helps agents adapt effectively.
1049458	1053362	143	A	0.91615	Near potentials act as the near present contextual.
1053426	1061130	144	A	0.99996	Proximity and the far pretensions rely on passive synthesis of deontic cues which are sedimented retentions in the environment.
1063630	1073306	145	A	1	The preferences of the agents aligned by policies correspond to attracting sets which in the sociocognitive setting can be instantiated as narratives.
1073498	1087860	146	A	1	Having shared narrative is a necessary aspect of any exchange between artifacts, people, institutions that have some kind of attracting set generalized synchrony which we will discuss a little bit later as well.
1089030	1094370	147	A	0.99978	So a team working on a project has a potential goal to complete the project successfully.
1095590	1099110	148	A	1	The shared narrative might be the project plan that guides their actions.
1099450	1105080	149	A	0.99983	It's like everyone in the team has a shared story about what they're trying to achieve and how they're going to do it.
1107550	1113530	150	A	1	The relationship between current states and future observations is captured within the B matrix transitions.
1114590	1120314	151	A	0.99985	This matrix represents the probability of transitioning to a new state based on the current state.
1120432	1129950	152	A	0.9889	So the B matrix transition and the A matrix is utilized to determine which new observations is most likely to occur given the current state and potential transitions.
1130930	1139490	153	A	0.99964	In the Cerulean framework, the expectation gradient structure plays a crucial role in defining the depth and fulfillment of pretensions.
1140870	1149000	154	A	0.67744	This structure represents the varying degrees of certainty and confidence agents have in their predictions about future states.
1149530	1154354	155	A	1	The topology thus and the arrangements is interrelation.
1154482	1155160	156	A	0.9819	Sorry.
1155850	1163610	157	A	0.99996	There is an interrelation between the potentials or the arrangements of future expectations which is proportional to the expectation gradient.
1164030	1168380	158	A	1	The higher the gradient, the more detailed and accurate the potentials are likely to be.
1170050	1181040	159	A	1	The potential horizon represents thus the static states of the expected futures of the temporal object while the continuation horizon is the amalgamated trail of the temporal object.
1182130	1190690	160	A	0.9853	Potential and continuation horizons are carried in protensions while the imminent horizon consists of the primal impressions.
1193430	1204150	161	A	0.99968	So agents can coordinate through coconstruction where agents or individuals interact and collaborate to build this shared understanding and shared goals.
1204730	1220810	162	A	0.99771	This process is deeply interconnected within a complex web where agents typically coexist with other agents or subjects forming a collective often referred to as multiagent groups, swarm ensembles or Samblage.
1221650	1229630	163	A	0.99999	By aligning their beliefs to the signal found within their niche they can better adapt to the environment and develop a shared understanding of their surroundings.
1231650	1237570	164	A	0.99868	Sharing information with other agents is beneficial as it allows them to trust one another and pool their resources.
1237990	1246550	165	A	0.6886	This collaborative approach is preferable to a conflict driven scenario in which every other agent is perceived as a potential source of risk and surprising.
1246890	1255670	166	A	1	By sharing information agents could collectively construct a more accurate representation of their environment leading to more effective decision making and action.
1256330	1263740	167	A	0.99974	Through these interactions, shared narratives and goals can emerge from a coconstruction of the world and each agent's generative model.
1264350	1277040	168	A	0.99998	So these narratives and goals are the result of dynamic process that in fact can be mathematically modeled through the equations that we introduce in the paper that this presentation is based on but that I will present a little bit later.
1278050	1286100	169	A	0.99996	They capture the process of mutual learning where agents adapt their generative model based on the information gathered from their interactions with others.
1287350	1291570	170	A	0.99954	Agents may start off with slightly or greatly divergent generative model.
1291720	1300790	171	A	0.88914	So in order to minimize surprise there will be a natural alignment within a group as agents adapt to the evolving dynamics of their environment and social contexts.
1301530	1305240	172	A	0.99999	For example, again, consider this team working on the project.
1305610	1313706	173	A	1	Even if you have your own understanding of the model or of the project you'll interact and share information and learn from each other and then adapt the model.
1313888	1319210	174	A	0.80614	Over time, you'll develop a shared understanding of the project and a shared goal for its completion.
1320270	1322738	175	A	1	This is an instance of coconstruction.
1322934	1326990	176	A	0.99926	It's like building a house together where everyone contributes to the final structure.
1328210	1336610	177	A	1	The emergence of shared narratives and the learning and recognition of them may be made more efficient through certain mechanisms such as language.
1337270	1347830	178	A	0.99993	In an experiment illustrated in a paper that Karl Rozan two agents share the same sensorium ask each other's questions.
1347900	1353910	179	A	1	I think it's a paper on 20 questions and Emma Holmes with a shared narrative entailing a common language.
1354410	1360490	180	A	0.99999	This illustrates the marked efficiency and the minimization of free energy simply by having a shared language, a common ground.
1362110	1370010	181	A	0.99988	So shared potentials are common future anticipations or goals that emerge among groups of individuals through coconstruction.
1370430	1375470	182	A	1	It allows them to better anticipate each other's actions and intentions and work towards a common goal.
1376290	1393650	183	A	0.86731	It's strongly tied to the conscious efforts of individuals to work towards that goal and to effectively create an organizational structures where we're engaged in a conversation in an exchange assuming that this exchange is meant to align our generative models.
1394550	1396786	184	A	0.99996	So think of for instance, a football team.
1396968	1399558	185	A	0.99995	Again, they have a shared potential to win the match.
1399644	1403878	186	A	0.99991	They anticipate each other's moves and adapt their strategies based on the ongoing game.
1404044	1409660	187	A	0.95725	Everyone in the team has a shared vision of victory and they're constantly adjusting their actions to make it happen.
1412350	1418006	188	A	0.63952	So individuals infer each other's mental states by observing cues which they can attribute to hidden causes.
1418118	1423454	189	A	0.97829	They use their own model or models that they have learned to recognize about others.
1423652	1431360	190	A	0.99999	This process is known as generalized synchrony entailing mutual predictability, and can be interpreted as a collective minimization of free energy.
1433170	1439630	191	A	1	In a group setting, individuals create cues in the world that direct other agents attentions towards the same signals.
1439790	1447270	192	A	0.98845	Their models of the world align by sharing similar goals and similar environments and by reinforcing patterns of sampling reality.
1448570	1454658	193	A	0.9997	So we could try to represent this through polynomials and morphisms.
1454834	1462330	194	A	0.99999	Each agent's interaction with the environment corresponds to a morphism, and the collective interaction of all agents can be represented as a polynomial.
1463390	1481342	195	A	0.80614	So if a polynomial p is defined, morphism between two polynomials, p and q, consists of a pair of functions, f and g, such that f maps p of one to q of one and g maps P of I to q of the quantity one.
1481476	1494420	196	A	0.96963	This morphism must satisfy the commutative requirements, meaning that the following diagram commutes p of I maps to q of the quantity I and p of one maps to q of one.
1495430	1502454	197	A	0.9999	So we could see how we could create a framework to further explore the cooperative and competitive dynamics among agents.
1502652	1520170	198	A	0.52807	For multiple agents indexed by I with boundaries p and share environment boundary q, their interaction can be represented by a morphism of polynomials, which allows us to understand the shared potential in multiagent systems and provides a foundation for further exploration of cooperative dynamics.
1522770	1530270	199	A	0.99723	We allow each agent to predict not only its own behavior, but also the behavior of its companions and the environment's response to their actions.
1532230	1547810	200	A	0.98273	So the dynamics of shared predictions are really useful here and can be properly cashed out mathematically through recursive cognition and prediction on the shared environment of the agent's actions and response to each other's actions.
1549030	1554018	201	A	0.99993	We can use sheep's theoretic and topos theoretical approaches to understand multi agent systems.
1554114	1558210	202	A	0.61	A multi agent system is a system where multiple individuals or entities interact.
1558290	1564250	203	A	0.99788	So for example, a traffic system can be considered a multi agent system where different vehicles interact.
1564670	1572666	204	A	0.87	A topos is a category that has both spatial and logical structure, allowing for the expression of logical propositions and deductions within it.
1572768	1578800	205	A	0.99967	So we can use these approaches to construct a coherent understanding of the world from the perspective of multiple agents.
1579250	1589170	206	A	1	The internal universe of agents, which can be seen as mathematical objects containing beliefs, perceptions and predictions of individual agents, are represented using topoi.
1590950	1601030	207	A	0.57169	These internal universes provide a foundation for understanding and representing the complex interactions and shared understanding among multiple agents in this dynamic environment.
1602170	1609574	208	A	0.99992	We try to construct a consensus topos by patching together the internal universes or topoi of multiple agents.
1609692	1614650	209	A	0.71	And the idea is to use the sheep theoretic and topos theoretic structures to build a shared understanding.
1618040	1627400	210	A	0.99939	So we can thus derive the synchronization of goal oriented actions among agents over time and leverage mathematical insights for category theory and generalized generative models.
1627820	1635080	211	A	0.99999	This connection is the mechanism through which the group synchronizes over time and ultimately achieves their objective.
1635440	1640344	212	A	0.93026	Agents within the system might possess varying levels of certainty in achieving the objective.
1640472	1646312	213	A	0.99999	Some may choose to expend less energy, temporarily decelerating their progress towards the desired outcome.
1646456	1657250	214	A	0.71187	This variation in certainty and approach leads to the emergence of different roles within a group, with some agents focusing on computational tasks while other monitor outcomes or engage in different actions themselves.
1657940	1665300	215	A	1	The nested and distributed structure of generative models in active inference allows for the integration of both short term and long term goals.
1665640	1673220	216	A	0.99988	Agents with similar compatible preferences can coordinate their actions by aligning their policies and working towards common narratives.
1673640	1683690	217	A	0.99654	So this alignment reduces the overall expected free energy of their joint actions, increasing the likelihood of achieving shared goals and facilitating the sharing of goals and expectation among group members.
1686000	1692056	218	A	0.99735	They can learn, which allows them to learn essential role in shaping agents preferences and strategies.
1692088	1696952	219	A	0.6279	Over time, agents can gather new experiences and update their generative model.
1697026	1700080	220	A	0.99997	They refine their preferences and methods for achieving goals.
1700820	1707440	221	A	0.99998	They can influence the formation and modification of shared narratives by having different perspective over different parts of a goal.
1708900	1717380	222	A	0.99983	Here, the concept of generalized synchrony is manifested when all agents have learned compatible or harmonized aspects of the overall generative model.
1717530	1725000	223	A	0.93	The synchronization is rooted in the retentional and potential dynamics of agents and can be more accurately described using mathematical models.
1728000	1735080	224	A	0.57895	So, in conclusion, we tried to shed light on the concept of shared potential goals and multiagent systems.
1735240	1742560	225	A	0.98487	We've emphasized the importance of understanding this concept as it plays a crucial role in the coordination synchronization of agents actions and intentions.
1743620	1752956	226	A	0.69644	We in the future continuously highlight the role of cues in the environment and how they can be simple like marks on the road or more complex like symbols and language.
1753148	1762440	227	A	0.77	The queues become carriers of passive synthesis, far pretensions and far retention, and become ways to minimize free energy as they minimize the amount of any individual has to compute.
1762940	1776510	228	A	0.92	It also allows us to delve into the concept of other evidencing in which the environment is in effect the self and others must learn to navigate in terms of others and self.
1778000	1783432	229	A	0.99965	We've provided mathematical models to an equations to analyze dynamics of shared potentials more accurately.
1783496	1794000	230	A	0.99999	In terms of category theory, we've explored the dynamics of shared retentions and potentials in hierarchical generative models which reflect the complex interplay of individual and collective dynamics.
1794740	1803380	231	A	0.70883	We've encapsulated the structure of time consciousness and how this allows agents to co compute shared potentials by mapping each other's cognitive pathways.
1805320	1817940	232	A	0.99529	So our approach basically begins an examination of hospital temporal phenomenology integrated with a hierarchical active inference model, polynomial morphisms and home polynomials.
1818020	1825000	233	A	0.99998	This enables recursive cognition and prediction of not only an agent's actions, but also the environment's response to these actions.
1826220	1828692	234	A	0.99968	So I think this comes to the end, Daniel.
1828756	1830890	235	A	1	I think I'm literally at 30 minutes.
1831580	1834164	236	B	0.99988	Thank you, impeccable.
1834292	1836770	237	B	0.99993	Thank you, Mahault it.
1837620	1840428	238	B	0.99837	Yeah, great presentation.
1840524	1841244	239	B	0.99992	Awesome topic.
1841292	1846210	240	B	0.99801	So thank you for joining and looking forward to seeing how the work continues to develop.
