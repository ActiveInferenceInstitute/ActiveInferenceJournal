17890	18742	A	0.6084125638008118	Next up.
18876	20070	A	0.7370091676712036	Welcome Avel.
20410	24466	A	0.7415563464164734	We have Avel Gwenen carlo with embedded normativity.
24578	26600	A	0.9326874017715454	So thanks Avel to you.
31370	31782	B	0.5208580493927002	Hello.
31836	32774	B	0.8097810745239258	Can you hear me?
32892	33670	A	0.560655415058136	Yep.
38810	41150	B	0.8423942923545837	And can you see the slides?
41730	44350	A	0.8149014115333557	I only see the top left of the slide.
45490	49870	B	0.6871075630187988	You only see the top just yeah.
49940	50462	A	0.7239255309104919	Try again.
50516	51280	A	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
52710	54834	B	0.8371052145957947	Okay, about now?
54872	55310	A	0.560655415058136	Yep.
55390	55922	A	0.9716436862945557	Looks great.
55976	56820	A	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
57670	58740	B	0.7295194268226624	Okay, good.
59270	61630	B	0.875866711139679	So I am Avelina Carlo.
61790	65102	B	0.8601805567741394	I'm interested in multiscale collective organization.
65246	68360	B	0.6835532188415527	This is why I came to active in France to begin with.
68810	80878	B	0.8925400972366333	And the core question I've been asking is basically when we look at human organization, there is creative evolution, there is a change through time of the specific patterns that are enacted.
80914	83530	B	0.8840105533599854	And this is very hard to account for.
83680	89770	B	0.8801879286766052	And I have been trying to pin down more and more specifically what exactly is going on and how to model it.
89920	94554	B	0.9268127083778381	So this specific work is a work I wrote in the context of my PhD.
94602	108478	B	0.7327337265014648	Of course, which is funded by the Escape Project, a project in cognitive archaeology that's interested in how the archaeological landscape shape cognition and vice versa.
108654	111086	B	0.6222413182258606	The title of it is automated.
111118	111742	B	0.723888099193573	No activity.
111806	114050	B	0.7738730907440186	An active inference of agency.
114630	120760	B	0.776084303855896	An active inference account of agency being flesh because you will see very quickly why.
121130	127266	B	0.9104222655296326	So first we will go through the existing work on anchor cognition in the context of active inference.
127378	133850	B	0.9004125595092773	Then we'll try to expose the concept of embedded Motivity, which we introduce here and what it means.
133920	143130	B	0.8176611065864563	And then we'll look at the more semiotic question around the externalization and utilization of normativity in cultural landscapes.
143470	146890	B	0.6813868880271912	So first encouraged cognition in active in France.
147490	149482	B	0.8332245349884033	So we know active inference.
149546	151070	B	0.528327465057373	I will go quickly over it.
151140	155410	B	0.5293388962745667	I still need to do it because there are lookers that are not familiar.
155750	169446	B	0.7430856227874756	So active inference say that agents continuously predict the specific queues sensory cues they will see, and they predict the action or policy they will not take.
169548	178150	B	0.8972684144973755	And they basically enact an ongoing stream of expectation that they reconstruct given upcoming signal.
178570	190714	B	0.6986614465713501	So this is best Akotin four in this schema which shows the agent as the nickel system, which engage through environment, through action and cessations.
190842	207780	B	0.7471932172775269	And all of these specific domains, they minimize a specific function that is called free energy and whose minimization basically means there is a prerogative process going on.
208550	215250	B	0.8031777739524841	And a core property of active inference is that it dissolves agency as we typically understand it.
215320	221218	B	0.6299116611480713	We don't have agents that have like an internal monologue that drives them to take decision.
221394	224182	B	0.8102098107337952	We have a conscious anticipation of what's going on.
224236	228460	B	0.8548986911773682	And whatever an agent anticipates itself to do, it will do.
228830	237450	B	0.614675760269165	And so this goes for computationally satisfying but very deflationary notion of what is going on with agency.
238510	247230	B	0.8656284809112549	So the question then comes what is the relation between an agent and the cognitive landscape in which it evolves?
247970	297850	B	0.7568541169166565	I will present very rapidly again the framework of Skill and a pioneered by Brunborg, Kierstein and Reidfield, and which says that Skill agents, which we understand as agents that understand what is going on around them, they will basically experience the world as a landscape of affordances, which is opportunities for actions and their cognition pretty much reduces to the experience of this landscape and adaptive engagement with it, which basically maximize the grip the agent has on the system and essentially for reasons we will not go over because it's math the very existence experience of this landscape.
298010	301594	B	0.7883561849594116	It is equivalent to the existence of constraints over attention.
301722	314290	B	0.5849189162254333	The attention that the agent gives to thing which translates the embodied expectation that are two times embodied bad the embodied expectation that the agent enacts.
314950	335642	B	0.6893323659896851	And so this becomes very interesting when we cross it with the existence of enculturation in humans because the basic experience we have of affordances, of what we can do it is shaped culturally, it is shaped by interaction wherein we learn with other humans about what we do, what we can do and what we can do.
335776	341382	B	0.6125180125236511	And this means that the basic human experience, it's thoroughly encultured.
341446	357780	B	0.8542278409004211	It's embedded in what Ramshed called landscape of cultural fondencies and it is embedded in cultural and material regimes of attention so ways to pay attention to things.
358390	369298	B	0.8985802531242371	And this is a figure that comes, I believe, from this year on thinking throughout the minds where it shows basically how the action installation cycle.
369394	383370	B	0.7556421160697937	When we have several agents, they build a common environment that has epistemic cues on how the world is like and we are enculturated to pay attention to things in a certain manner that makes it so.
383440	397322	B	0.8367277979850769	We perceive and enact this landscape and so the uncultured constraint over the flow of attention because of what we saw just before the deflationary account of agency.
397466	415560	B	0.552990734577179	It means that the very expensive landscape, cultural landscape that is collectively enacted, it effectively integrates intentionality, it effectively integrates normativity in a way that clashes strongly with classical account of both.
416810	425298	B	0.8201271295547485	So, given this state of the art, let us look at what I mean specifically by embedded normativity.
425474	432040	B	0.7108132243156433	So embedded Motivity is a kind of normativity, I think you have got it.
432490	454606	B	0.6327335238456726	So normativity it means basically the criterions by which we judge things to be good and bad in the context of biological system they will look for specific, I don't know, chemical concentration and they will avoid other this is the phenomenon of chemotaxis, this is pretty basic and this is a form of normativity.
454798	475046	B	0.8673988580703735	But for humans we will typically think of laws, cultural norms, culturally shared way to judge behavior and again, at least in the context of law and choice theory we typically think there is an agent, he has access to information and will think what should I do?
475148	484010	B	0.8585027456283569	And he will judge rationally about what is good and what is bad based on a collection of values which are internal to the agent.
484160	485820	B	0.9222072958946228	This is not how it works.
488030	499002	B	0.8838136196136475	What I call embodied Motivity is by contrast regimes of normal activity where it is the norms and value that guide the agent's behavior.
499146	501850	B	0.8134365677833557	It is embedded in the material and cultural environment.
501930	519190	B	0.8714185953140259	So basically the agent projects a specific set of norms and value in the very experienced fitness environment and it will perceive the locus of normativity as the environment and not as a form of internal judgment.
521850	526502	B	0.8682121634483337	Let us look at what can exactly how embedded Motivity work.
526556	528310	B	0.6869939565658569	It will be more concrete.
528650	533194	B	0.5397217273712158	So first we can materially constrain people to do things.
533312	539862	B	0.593144953250885	So for example, there are roads, you can go off roads but it's harder and you can't really do that if you are a chariot.
540006	565050	B	0.8545852303504944	So when you have a specific pattern of roads which is constructed by cities you are pretty much constrained to follow the roads materially and for this we will talk of structural embedding and there is another regimes of mezzanomativity where we build on environments that will basically cue you suggest you into adopting specific norms and specific values.
565230	575666	B	0.7696196436882019	For example, Escape thinks that vertical patterns in archaeological culture they are somehow embedded within what we'd call vertical norms.
575698	584090	B	0.8946084976196289	So hierarchy and certification in social relationship and for this specific form of embedding we can talk of semantic embedding.
585230	599130	B	0.8112249374389648	What must be very clear is that we don't have structural embedding on one side and semantic embedding there are basically two mechanism, complementary mechanism in which embedded normativity occurs.
599290	611678	B	0.8154994249343872	If we look at city so this is impression of sumerian culture city states we have matter organization that prompts specific kind of behavior.
611774	619800	B	0.880291759967804	So for example, we have a bridge and this bridge allow you constrain you to go through the river in a specific way if you are on foot.
620250	623922	B	0.7930216193199158	But these material constraints it is perceivable.
623986	629318	B	0.5671887993812561	So by seeing the bridge you will also see that you can navigate the world in this specific way.
629484	632934	B	0.6131986379623413	So you don't have a sparration between semantic and structural embedding.
632982	651482	B	0.8478190302848816	We just have two ways in which constraints of our behavior that are embedded in the environment work, and something that is core to the account of embedded non activity is, again, that it is not internal.
651546	661426	B	0.7845054864883423	But we need to go into more detail about what we mean by not being internal, because, of course, we're talking about agency agents constrain what agents do.
661448	668046	B	0.7980040907859802	It's not outside what it is is embedded.
668078	674946	B	0.8472884297370911	In Motivity is a regime of the multivity where the norms and value, they stem from the experience of Fordance.
675058	684650	B	0.6156226396560669	For example, if I see fire I will not think about hey, could I put my hand in it and get my hand burn?
685550	686822	B	0.9264131188392639	I think it would be painful.
686886	688074	B	0.5794290900230408	I won't do that.
688272	693040	B	0.9460535645484924	If I even think about putting my hand in the fire I will immediately feel bad.
693410	697200	B	0.7358859181404114	The normativity it's embedded in my experience of the world.
697650	706130	B	0.9679944515228271	I feel like the fire or more specifically the possibility of putting my hand in the fire is intrinsically bad.
706200	711860	B	0.8024882078170776	I do not feel there is a possibility that is neutral and then I judge to be bad.
712310	721794	B	0.564363956451416	But of course this judgment does not occur outside even if I feel like it's about my affordances.
721922	728040	B	0.8472082614898682	It emerges from the engagement I have with the material and cultural niche in which I find myself.
728970	742030	B	0.8311489224433899	And if we want to untangle what this means precisely we will have to go into more detail into what I call the externalization internalization of many normativity.
742370	748400	B	0.8020444512367249	So let us look at something very simple how normativity work for embodied agents.
749010	761570	B	0.537794291973114	So embodied agents, they do things hopefully in a niche that is material and this niche will be marked by the activity of my agent.
761640	773814	B	0.8928950428962708	And these marks, they can then act as constraints either through structural or cementing embedding in the agent's firmament because they basically signify that in the past I wanted to do that.
773852	775800	B	0.6243740916252136	Maybe doing that is good.
776330	795178	B	0.5312709212303162	For example, we have centuries with I don't know if centuries English word but web path if animals that have legs this is actually important walk on a specific path, they will compact the earth and it will become improper to grow anything, even grass.
795354	819430	B	0.8951854109764099	And you will have paths that will emerge that are pretty neat, it's pretty visible and that tell you hey, not only this earth is compact and allow you to walk on it without effort but also this has been widely judged to be a good outline for navigation in this specific environment.
819850	835850	B	0.7672096490859985	So the very experience of a path basically invites you you perceive the affordance of walking through the path and this is something that again can result from your own activity that can be written into development by your own activity.
837070	844790	B	0.6649255156517029	And so this begs the question of how okay, there exists embedded nomativity but how do we embed nomativity?
844870	847520	B	0.9058740139007568	What is the activity of embedding mativity like?
848210	852118	B	0.68558269739151	And the word I will use for that is externalization.
852314	860994	B	0.8039189577102661	We perceive the world because we externalize specific causes of sensation into an imagined objective external world.
861192	865358	B	0.792158305644989	So when we see the path, we see a path.
865454	872726	B	0.5942087769508362	We do not see compact earth that we then compute to mean that other things have worked on it.
872748	874786	B	0.7364953756332397	We just see hey, there is a path.
874978	880650	B	0.7795231938362122	And this is because we have externalized a specific cognitive kind which is the path.
881710	903578	B	0.8234864473342896	And this is argument that several people made here lene Steiner, which if I remember well, worked on the production of devices that help blind people see things through, I believe an array of repetitive device on their shoulder.
903754	918710	B	0.633577823638916	So the core argument they make is that if you give people that they will start seeing things, they will start perceiving things as being before them rather than having vibration on the shoulder and then thinking about what does it mean.
918860	937050	B	0.835338830947876	And so the basic argument is that perception is just picture of what cause we infer, what is the structure we infer of our environment given the existence of a specific coupling device that relates action to sensation and vice versa.
937870	943566	B	0.7594566345214844	And this critically relies on the internalization of specific.
943748	948186	B	0.8829450011253357	We could say a lot of things that I will say priors specific, priors knowledge and perception.
948378	958820	B	0.848598837852478	So me seeing the path as a path relies on me having the prior knowledge that there is such a thing as paths and I should be expecting to see them around.
959830	967658	B	0.8472400307655334	And so you have duality of externalization and internalization in the production of embedded mativity.
967774	982250	B	0.8076503872871399	I can only see norms out there if I've internalized integrated a specific apparatus of perception that entails that there are indeed those specific norms that are embedded in those specific affordances.
983230	989770	B	0.8650240302085876	And so this produce a more general question of semantics, particularly of information theory.
990130	994000	B	0.8595672845840454	How do reading and writing and reading maturity works?
995330	1010450	B	0.7203258872032166	So when I extend lies I treat the world as having specific natural categories that I pretty much imagine and I can use them because I imagine them as an extended memory that allow me to read and write normative cues.
1010870	1014826	B	0.8525082468986511	This can be letters, pure signs.
1014878	1019234	B	0.8682036399841309	But as far as I'm concerned here, all signs are at least implicitly normative.
1019282	1021960	B	0.8452898263931274	There about how you should interpret the sign.
1022730	1034234	B	0.7997894883155823	And this means that we can experience specific landscape of forensics and we can write things out there.
1034272	1038966	B	0.876702070236206	We can write normative cues, bio behavior that will then constrain further behavior.
1039078	1046670	B	0.5602729320526123	But nothing tells us that we can communicate through this.
1046740	1050810	B	0.6897425651550293	The communication, it works because of the internalization of prayers.
1050890	1067122	B	0.8833505511283875	If a given community of agents have internalized a specific set of prayers that is, a set of prayers that enable externalization of numerative cues, then only it can use the environment as a way to write and read.
1067176	1072040	B	0.7096436619758606	Normative queues as embedded normativity thing.
1072730	1077106	B	0.8343138098716736	And this communication, it can be read in terms of information theory.
1077138	1079110	B	0.8289315104484558	Of course it can be read in terms of semantics.
1079190	1101166	B	0.7557091116905212	But what is critical to analyze that the process of internalization there is no trust system there is no private key that allow you to be sure that the way you internalize norms is very specifically the way in which the Emily Mativity was encouraged to begin with.
1101268	1112180	B	0.720844566822052	There is a loss, or there is ambiguity, or there is I'd rather say it like this an active demarch of reconstruction, of given prayers by the agent.
1112710	1131318	B	0.7283247709274292	And so this gap between the intent of other communicants and my intent, my understanding of what they meant by their active engagement with the world, it builds a tiny gap in information that is somehow enough to drive the open ended evolution of cultural landscape.
1131494	1144350	B	0.4964231550693512	And this is something that I do not think is embedded in active in France and I think is of major interest to research, to the research at least in the evolution of open end evolution of cultural landscape.
1144770	1156130	B	0.7926970720291138	So to sum up things, I just presented a paper that is called anomaly Motivity and that speaks unsurprisingly of embedded normativity.
1157350	1170786	B	0.8302264213562012	First major point is that if active inference is correct, then our notion of agency is dissolved essentially in the notion that we can perceive and enact cognitive landscape.
1170898	1172600	B	0.8132073879241943	Umvelt, if you want.
1173690	1184918	B	0.8801822066307068	And given that this is the case, we will experience the norms and value that guide our behavior as a property of the cognitive landscape.
1184934	1194830	B	0.8645936846733093	We experience the affordance that we can perceive and this specific regime of normativity I call embedded normativity.
1195970	1200702	B	0.7987673878669739	And the third thing is that you have a critical thing going on.
1200756	1231110	B	0.8321080207824707	You have a semiotically constraining thing going on in the externalization and internalization of regimes of embedded mativity because those two things they respectively enable embedded Motivity to exist, to have a causal power and they enable also the open ended evolution of the norms that are embedded in a given landscape in a given material landscape and therefore the open end evolution of the asseted, cultural or committee landscape.
1231690	1233046	B	0.9191112518310547	So thank you.
1233228	1243520	B	0.8369980454444885	I will enroll my references slides in case someone really needs to know what the reference is and is ready to move around the video for this.
1244210	1245920	B	0.8074475526809692	And do you have questions?
1247570	1248174	A	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
1248292	1248686	A	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
1248708	1257730	A	0.8741589784622192	Avel, while people are typing any questions, could you maybe just give a little introduction to the active inference for the Social Sciences course?
1257800	1265334	A	0.9112822413444519	Like, what brought you to want to facilitate this effort and where are we at and where do you want it to go?
1265372	1266840	A	0.8449147939682007	What do you want it to be for?
1270840	1272630	A	0.5627004504203796	Oh, mute and then continue.
1276280	1277076	B	0.7077426314353943	Good point.
1277178	1277990	B	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
1278520	1301020	B	0.8896470069885254	The Active Inference Institute organizes and kerose Research organize a course on active inference in the social science that is based essentially in explaining the basic demarch, the basic hypothesis and the consequences of the cultural landscape formalism that I hinted at slightly in this presentation.
1302000	1321300	B	0.7262248992919922	The goal of the course is to give basic ontology that is an interface between complexity science, let us say physics, written large cognitive science and social science to afford interdisciplinary collaboration in the social science and in the study of the evolution of human societies.
1321720	1325956	B	0.4508247971534729	And I think it is cool, but I'm biased because I've missed it.
1325978	1332150	B	0.6821056604385376	So maybe you should ask Daniel, which is absolutely unbiased, whether the course is cool.
1333340	1335176	A	0.9805713891983032	I've been enjoying it a lot.
1335358	1339320	A	0.9249297976493835	We just finished last week with my section on collective behavior.
1339900	1345100	A	0.9091343283653259	First we had the introduction lecture from you, then Ben White on the basics of being an active agent.
1345250	1350776	A	0.5762056112289429	And we have Lorena and Mao's sections upcoming, as well as your more dedicated session.
1350888	1362304	A	0.9790298938751221	Yeah, it's been a really fun experience and it's going to provide a really useful missing piece in the ecosystem, I guess.
1362342	1363890	A	0.7475517392158508	Just one question.
1364900	1373984	A	0.9130367040634155	How do we take some of these topics you're bringing in about the embedded normativities and think about them digitally?
1374112	1387540	A	0.8024294376373291	Like, are we talking about conceptual embeddedness in information environments and or are we talking about the ergonomics of sitting at our desk?
1387620	1405920	A	0.8090595602989197	Or how do we bring that kind of pleasure path stigma g on the ground into the digital are we talking about something that's embodied and embedded in the information space or are we still talking about bodies?
1409440	1415720	B	0.8385120034217834	So if we talk about humans, we talk about bodies with the brain that do things in a mature environment.
1415880	1423740	B	0.7175666093826294	But your question is I'm not sure understood is how can we bring this specific concept in the study of digital phenomena?
1423820	1424476	B	0.8341280221939087	I cannot.
1424588	1426160	B	0.6987693905830383	Twitter internet.
1426660	1427696	A	0.7486425042152405	Is that it?
1427798	1428160	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1428230	1440848	B	0.878162145614624	Okay, so you have basically the whole study on the affordances, the discipline of design has incorporated a while ago the national affordance in its structure.
1441024	1448340	B	0.6368629336357117	And most of the study in the digital design centers are on what platforms afford or do not afford.
1449000	1459452	B	0.5596047043800354	And you have richer stance when you take into account not what you can do with a specific interface, but what the specific interface invites you to do.
1459586	1484884	B	0.7043407559394836	Given a set of cultural written large, it can be self learning, but given a set of power that you share with the platform in a way that is formal but indirect yes.
1484922	1490004	B	0.8174625039100647	I would look at it in terms of user interface design.
1490202	1496810	B	0.9169188141822815	I think this concept specifically is useful for interface design.
1498380	1505572	B	0.7072892785072327	Then you have implicitly the question of the flow that platforms such as, I don't know, twitter.
1505636	1515736	B	0.688385009765625	Facebook how specific structure environments bring specific collective dynamics that may be a bit richer.
1515928	1518108	B	0.855513870716095	Not richer specifically, but that may go in.
1518114	1530028	B	0.7851675748825073	A direction that the user face question do not go into and that can still be modeled in terms of constraints and therefore in terms of embedded normativity.
1530204	1531952	B	0.8508390784263611	Is that on point?
1532006	1533270	B	0.8431466221809387	We'll go to your question.
1536280	1542992	A	0.666047215461731	Yeah, that's interesting about what the interface does and then what it invites.
1543056	1544730	A	0.8057976365089417	It might invite things.
1546060	1551880	A	0.7999470829963684	In order for that invitation to be fulfilled, it has to actually provide that possibility.
1552380	1556924	A	0.649657666683197	But it might invite things that aren't relationally possible.
1557042	1564476	A	0.5740545988082886	Like there might be a wall which invites climbing to a given observer, yet they cannot climb it.
1564658	1584244	A	0.6574814319610596	And then on the other side is a capacity that isn't invited and that is the adjacent possible of tool use where something that was being used for this purpose, it's like all of a sudden it just fell out of someone's hand.
1584282	1588016	A	0.5611163973808289	They grasped it a different way, it invited a different engagement.
1588048	1597450	A	0.856273889541626	And then that can become re entrenched and that points to that sequential making and breaking of new spaces that your work has featured over the last few years.
1598300	1599240	B	0.5172197222709656	Yes, exactly.
1599310	1612620	B	0.7145385146141052	This work has been developed while thinking about tool use, while thinking about cognitive archaeology, while thinking about the experience of cities, the way urbanism prompts specific behavior.
1613600	1618590	B	0.679807722568512	But if I can get back on the Internet thing, I'd like to make it more specific.
1619060	1623760	B	0.8289983868598938	So the interface design, as far as I know is focused on interface.
1624420	1632068	B	0.614740788936615	That is not surprising, but in doing so it is focused on specific fordance and what you can do.
1632234	1637952	B	0.7071663737297058	You have another layer in ecological psychology, which is the layer of solicitation.
1638016	1653156	B	0.6382376551628113	So, for example, Twitter does something very specific, which is when you log in, it shows you the number of notifications you have, then it removes it and you have to wait to know which were those notification.
1653268	1658652	B	0.49519890546798706	And you have to wait not 1 second, not 1 minute, but a random amount of time.
1658786	1661704	B	0.6451196074485779	So this is what they call dark patterns.
1661752	1667816	B	0.6218584179878235	They are patterns in design that are explicitly designed to create addiction.
1667928	1682804	B	0.6549505591392517	So this is a layer you can't afford in affordance, because from an affordance perspective there is just a moment you can access the information and then a moment you can't, and then the moment you can again, there is nothing going on.
1682922	1695768	B	0.6591338515281677	If you don't look at intrinsic motivation and the way specific structure, environment is perceived, the semantics, maybe the meaning that given landscape has for an agent.
1695934	1708764	B	0.8421057462692261	And even if you look at this, you are still looking at the platform in a way that is embedded from the specific patterns, that specific patterns of things that people do on the platform.
1708962	1726640	B	0.6767461895942688	If you have Twitter without the aggressive QRTs and the way to aggressively signal that you are in whatever it is, is going on, you don't have Twitter much, you have Mastodon maybe that has very similar affordances and very dissimilar solicitation.
1727460	1732356	B	0.8377450704574585	So this is why you have to take multiscale account of things.
1732378	1745640	B	0.8880841135978699	And when you take multiscale account of things you have to look at the semiotics basically behavior, how specific coordination occur at specific scales around specific communication, specific message passing.
1746220	1767290	B	0.6592058539390564	And once you look at how specific message become meaningful to specific agent, you have a problem basically because this is subjective, this is constructed through the activity of the agent and whatever is the range of time you are looking at, you will have the construction of new possibilities of adjustment possibles as you put it.
1767900	1776720	B	0.5683119297027588	And and yeah, this is the big question that I think we are missing at the moment in active inference.
1778260	1778864	A	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
1778982	1780620	A	0.982644259929657	Well, thank you for this presentation.
1780700	1787810	A	0.978772759437561	Thanks for the social sciences work and we're all looking forward to seeing how the projects play out.
1788980	1789536	B	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
1789558	1790428	B	0.5620948672294617	Goodbye.
1790604	1791420	A	0.5108422636985779	Farewell AVO.
