57670	143130	00:57	Avelina Carlo: I'm interested in multiscale collective organization. The title of it is automated. An active inference of agency. First we will go through the existing work on anchor cognition in the context of active inference. And then we'll look at the more semiotic question around the externalization and utilization of normativity in cultural landscapes.

143470	237450	02:23	Active inference say that agents continuously predict the specific queues sensory cues they will see, and they predict the action or policy they will not take. A core property of active inference is that it dissolves agency as we typically understand it.

238510	415560	03:58	 Skill agents experience the world as a landscape of affordances, which is opportunities for actions. Their cognition reduces to the experience of this landscape and adaptive engagement with it. It is equivalent to the existence of constraints over attention.

416810	835850	06:56	What I call embodied Motivity is a kind of normativity. It is embedded in the material and cultural environment. The agent projects a specific set of norms and value in the very experienced fitness environment. There are two ways in which constraints of our behavior work.	Embodied Motivity is a kind of normativity that is not internal	Inherent Normativity and Embodied Motivity
837070	1248174	13:57	We perceive the world because we externalize specific causes of sensation into an imagined objective external world. You have duality of externalization and internalization in the production of embedded mativity. This is of major interest to research in the evolution of open end evolution of cultural landscape.

1248292	1362304	20:48	The Active Inference Institute organizes a course on active inference in the social science. The goal of the course is to give basic ontology that is an interface between complexity science and social science to afford interdisciplinary collaboration. I've been enjoying it a lot.

1362342	1791420	22:42	How do we take some of these topics you're bringing in about the embedded normativities and think about them digitally? I would look at it in terms of user interface design. Specific structure environments bring specific collective dynamics that may be a bit richer.	Mastodon: I think this concept is useful for interface design	Exploring the Embedded Normativities of Digital Systems
