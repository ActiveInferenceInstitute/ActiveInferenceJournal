JF symbolic implementation does not use statistical distributions. It uses the symbolic and the logical inference.	Multi agent active inference and multiscale alignment, current developments	Applied Active Inference
102560	401064	01:42	Connor Hines is a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior. He is also a researcher at the Versus AI research lab. He will give an overview of the current state of the field in multiscale active inference. What we need to do to move forward as a field.	Connor Hines will give a talk on multiscale active inference	McMultiscale Active Inference
401112	1116080	06:41	Multiscale active inference is the idea that any active inference agent could be simultaneously composed of nested active inference agents. This has huge implications for the engineering and the natural sciences. If we can figure out this multiscale endeavor, then we can engineer distributed systems of multiaging intelligence.	The third applied active inference symposium focuses on multiscale active inference	Multiscale Active Inference
1116580	1269670	18:36	The first real rigorous attempt to show that multiscale active inference generally works is in one section of this free energy principle for a physics monograph from 2019. The Lagrangian of the system at one scale can be expressed as a function of the Lagrangians at other scales. But there's not a global link to Bayesian mechanics and active inference.	The first attempt to show that multiscale active inference generally works is	Multiscale Inverse Inference
1270680	1782550	21:10	Two papers attempted to address mapping between local and global inference processes. These are really good steps in the direction of a formal theory of collective intelligence. But there's still issues with these. They only deal with issue with inference at the global level, not active inference. This could be key to facilitating optimality at different scales.
