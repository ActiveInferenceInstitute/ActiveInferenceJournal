This is the final session of the active ecosystem symposium	The Final Session of the ActiveEcosystem Symposium
154236	276000	02:34	Kurt Chamongle uses his background in mathematical physics to analyze various theories of everything that are proposed. These include both the theoretical physics side of grand unification with gravity and dualities other schemes, as well as attempting to understand what constitutes consciousness. You can find the podcast by typing in theory of everything onto YouTube or whatever podcast catcher you have.	Kurt Chamongle hosts an all star panel discussing consciousness theories	Panel
276610	784830	04:36	Bertovis: What have you been working on in the past few months and what excites you about it? Lemke: I'm really excited about the ways in which the whole active inference model might help me at least think about what's going on. Friston: Yes, that's going to be the title of my next book.	What have you been working on in the past few months and what excites	What's Been Working On In the Past Few Months?
785280	994800	13:05	In the context of active inference, I have mostly focused on precision psychiatry and social physiology. And on the other side, I'm very interested also in multi agent systems. How we can think about artificial intelligence in this kind of more co constitutive way and through a developmental and cultural lens.	So in the context of active inference, I have mostly focused on precision psychiatry and social physiology	Less Solipsistic, More Creativity in AI
996740	1304710	16:36	Karl: We frequently hear in these circles the brain as a predictive machine. Is that to be interpreted as implying conscious experience is a predictiveMachine as well? And if not, why not? Karl: One of the big limits is that it's a powerful predictive machine that can shape what actually happens to us.	Karl: Where does the brain as a predictive machine have its limits	The Brain as a Predictive Machine
1305880	1460212	21:45	The ability to predict is the essence of intelligent decision making. But that's very hard in a computer. This is what kind of kills us in our current way of implementing active inference. It might be a key to building or to scaling up active entrance agents.	The ability to predict is the essence of intelligent decision making	Predictive Decision-Making
1460266	1926430	24:20	Karl Dumas: How active inference at the lens enables us to get another sense of what nondualist views on consciousness are saying. He says science of consciousness doesn't necessarily have to put the primacy on people. Dumas says we should be careful about the limits of brain as predictive machine.	Karl Dumas: Active inference can help us notice differences between experiences	Inventing the Limits of Consciousness
1928800	2163380	32:08	Raphael: What are some of the recent advancements or breakthroughs in your respective fields that you find particularly promising. Karl: We're also starting to see some convergence on different ways to get. At. Least the same shape of answers. In just the past couple years robots or computers seem to be just as good, if not exceeding us.	Question: What are some recent advancements or breakthroughs in your respective fields	Top AI and Machine Learning Professions
2165500	2436880	36:05	What is impressive is the diversity of advances and applications. Once you've gone scale free, you then start to ask deep questions about how you couple one scale to another scale. Another important and pragmatic advance is something that Bert mentioned, which is democratization of this technology.	What is impressive about quantum information theory is its diversity of applications	The Future of Inference
2437540	2883420	40:37	In a scale invariant context, or nested with nested scales, for example, you have to deal with the separation of temporal scales. How do you put the timing of your messages when you make a move or when you listen to a patient? Could we use less computational power to compute a less accurate message?	Karl: I have a question for Bert about reactive message passing	Quantum scale invariance and
2884080	3229160	48:04	Guillaume: Why is it that embracing our inability to control what happens in our lives can actually be the very source of healing? He asks: How can we build in sophisticated translation layers that take some of this burden from ourselves and even the world as value? Guillaume.	Guillaume: Surrendering to a higher power can heal many wounds	Surrender to the Higher Power
3229310	3308192	53:49	There were theoretical progress that were very interesting. I really liked also the development of a more multi agent perspective of active insurance. One thing that I'm still struggling with is how to get outside the checkerboard.	I really liked the development of multi agent perspective of active insurance	Active Insurance: The recent breakthrough
3308326	3500940	55:08	The application of active inference to morphogenesis. How to scale up active inference and how to connect with electrophysiology and clinical data. It's also something very important to anchor the theory in the real world.	One very interesting breakthrough was the application of active inference to morphogenesis	Active Inference and its applications in science
3502080	3613830	58:22	Gim, I thought one of your units is precision psychiatry. And by precision you can read precision in the sense that Bert was talking about. Much of the mathematical explanation for addiction rests upon a failure to get that course grading that precision estimation right. I wonder whether it be worthwhile revisiting addiction and psychopathology.	Gim says precision psychiatry explores the pathology of getting precision wrong	In the Psychology of Precision Psychiatry
3615080	3950700	1:00:15	The computational explanation for Parkinson's disease is assigning too much precision to the evidence that you're not moving before you move. I see this also with people who have productivity tools. The ways in which we seem, like obsessed with certain types of data and we're missing the big picture.	Karl: I love this idea of the pathology of precision	The Pathological Disease of Precision
3951140	4170390	1:05:51	Active inference could be a complete breakthrough in in engineering. In order to make it successful in engineering, we need to build an application that impresses. If we become really good at implementing minimization, we will be able to build great engineering design cycles.	Active inference could be a complete breakthrough in in engineering	Inactive Inference: A Science Loop
4171880	4273430	1:09:31	One of my critiques of mental health treatment today is that there's not enough encouragement of patients to act differently in the world. Instead, it often ends up being kind of this world building between therapists and patients. I think that's more true now in modern rich nations than ever before.	Anna, do you mind expanding on what you said about acting in mental health therapy	Activism in Mental Health Treatment
4275960	4380650	1:11:15	We're facing a huge mental health crisis now. I think a big part of it is the fact that people are not having embodied experiences. And also the experiences that they are having are these kinds of very quick fixes and fast pleasures. I'm excited about in the field of addiction medicine is mutual support.	In your field, where is the largest gap that you would like to see closed	What is the largest gap in mental health care?
4382860	4466390	1:13:02	Is there a correlation between the rise in mental health and a certain trait of people? The more time people spend in the virtual world, the more likely they are to suffer from depression, anxiety and other mental health problems. If anyone has any comments or questions, please just raise your physical hand.	The more time people spend online, the more likely they suffer from mental health problems	Is There a Correlation Between Mental Health and Online Use?
4466840	5139080	1:14:26	Young people are disproportionately affected by things like climate grief because they're the ones that are going to be alive to deal with it. A scale free model of health and mental health particularly would be great. There's a whole empty space out there yet to be explored.	Karl: Young people are disproportionately affected by climate grief	Active Inference and the Metacrisis
5140810	5235720	1:25:40	You all have 30 seconds to 60 seconds to speak directly to the audience. What is the message that you what closing message do you have? They're a curious person. They're interested in active inference. They also want to lead better lives, hopefully, and do something propitious.	You have 30 seconds to 60 seconds to speak directly to the audience	Speaking Directly to the People
5237260	5528480	1:27:17	Karl: If you want something to do, you should go and watch the live streams and get involved with this ecosystem. Do a lot of sports. It's good for you. And being kind to each other would be the best advice to everyone. Farewell to the panelists.	Daniel: Go work out. It's good for you. And then, yeah, what should I tell people	A Taste of the Active Inference Institute
