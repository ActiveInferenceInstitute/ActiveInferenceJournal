16260	19056	2	B	0.94	All right, the next session is going
19078	24640	3	B	1	to be the final session of this symposium.
25140	32130	4	B	0.99952	It's been a really incredible journey, and I think this final session is going to be great as well.
32500	52672	5	B	0.99981	So we have a whole panel here, and people can use their cameras (even though I'm not), if they want to, Welcome, everyone! I'll just introduce the facilitator, Curt Jaimungal.
52756	73504	6	B	0.99226	So Curt is a legend in the ActInf ecosystem and has done incredible work with a variety of researchers and curious individuals in the space, so we could think of no one better to host this conversation and bring it all together.
73702	76630	7	B	0.99761	So, Curt, I'll pass it to you.
77320	79472	8	B	0.83848	You'll keep an eye on the live chat.
79536	82992	9	B	0.99997	Anyone can call it if they need any supports.
83056	86912	10	B	0.87232	Otherwise, thanks, everybody, for joining.
86976	90624	11	B	1	And we don't see you yet, Curt.
90672	93896	12	A	0.4	But yeah, it would it be all right if I left and then came right back?
93918	95480	13	A	1	For whatever reason, my camera is not working.
95550	96072	14	B	0.99816	Sounds good.
96126	96776	15	B	0.99901	Sounds good.
96878	99800	16	A	0.99113	Okay, I'll be right back in about 25 seconds.
103200	104990	17	B	0.59253	Well, welcome, everyone.
109310	111420	18	B	0.99996	We will get started in just a second.
120590	126970	19	A	0.19295	It's so odd.
127130	128638	20	A	1	I apologize for that.
128724	132080	21	A	0.99853	Okay, well, you can hear my voice, at least.
132470	136100	22	A	0.54607	Yes, just give me a moment.
139030	139778	23	A	0.76827	Boy.
139944	146902	24	A	0.99511	Okay, well, we'll do what we can.
147036	154102	25	A	0.50035	Okay, so you all can't see me, but that's all right.
154236	160810	26	A	0.99767	So we have this all-star panel here today, which to me means my invitation must have been a mistake, but I'll take it.
160880	162950	27	A	0.99993	Thank you to the Active Inference Institutes!
163030	166730	28	A	1	And I'll go around this virtual zoom table and introduce everyone briefly.
167150	178714	29	A	0.95471	Karl Friston is the Wellcome Principal Research Fellow and Scientific Director at the Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging and professor of Neurology at University College London.
178842	181630	30	A	0.99619	He's also the chief scientist at VERSES.
182290	187266	31	A	0.97195	Anna Lembke is chief of the Stanford Addiction Medical… (Sorry.)
187368	191134	32	A	0.99927	Medicine Dual Diagnosis Clinic at Stanford University.
191262	196790	33	A	0.99934	Her popular books include “Drug Dealer, MD” and “Dopamine Nation.”
197450	203222	34	A	0.38521	Rafael Kaufmann is CTO of Digital Gaia and the onboard… (sorry.)
203276	208970	35	A	1	And is on the board of directors of the Active Inference Institute.
209390	219530	36	A	0.76491	Bert de Vries is a professor at Eindhoven University of Technology, where he directs the BIASlab research team and also works with industry.
220130	236820	37	A	0.89491	Guillaume Dumas is an associate professor in computational psychiatry of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Montreal and the Director of the Precision Psychiatry and Social Physiology Laboratory in CHU Saint
237510	238162	38	A	0.83098	(Sorry.)
238296	240002	39	A	0.9968	In the CHU
240056	241522	40	A	0.98895	Sainte-Justine Research Center.
241656	253458	41	A	0.84968	He's also affiliated with Mila (or Mila), which is Quebec's Artificial Intelligence Institute; and other art, science, and consciousness service initiatives.
253554	260918	42	A	0.99842	My name is Curt Jaimungal, and I use my background in mathematical physics to analyze various Theories of Everything that are proposed.
261014	270534	43	A	0.99994	These include both the theoretical physics side of Grand Unification with gravity, and dualities, other schemes; as well as attempting to understand what constitutes consciousness.
270662	276000	44	A	1	You can find the podcast by typing in “Theories of Everything” onto YouTube or whatever podcast catcher you have.
276610	278206	45	A	0.99586	So my question to everyone,
278308	284738	46	A	1	the initial question, is: What have you been working on in the past few months, and what excites you about it?
284904	288590	47	A	0.98397	We'll start with Bert.
288670	293490	48	A	1	You seem to be smiling; and your name sounds like mine.
293490	337210		C		[Bert is accidentally muted.]
337210	337960	49	C	0.72448	Okay.
338670	342734	50	C	0.69	All right, so my name is Bert de Vries. And, yeah,
342772	347470	51	C	1	I lead a lab in an electrical engineering department.
347890	351502	52	C	0.95	And so our lab is called BIASlab, as you mentioned.
351636	358500	53	C	0.99116	So we are interested in Bayesian inference in general, but more specifically in doing it as fast as possible.
359030	369602	54	C	0.95	That has lots of applications outside active inference, also for signal processing and other control systems, but definitely, of course, also for active inference.
369746	388090	55	C	0.88775	So half our work over the past few months, but even over the past few years, has been on developing a toolbox to support or to get as far as we can go with trying to do real time Bayesian inference or real time free energy minimization and trying it in applications.
388990	396966	56	C	0.99904	So that's the work – that I try to lead a team of PhD students who do the real work,
397008	402480	57	C	1	of course. I walk around with a cup of coffee, but that's what they've been working on.
404070	404482	58	A	0.94474	Great!
404536	406500	59	A	0.93	And Professor Lembke, please.
409270	426920	60	D	1	Yeah, well, what I've been working on in the last, I don't know, year or so, is spending a lot of time thinking about how it is that a faith framework - in particular, surrender to a higher power - improves people's lives.
427610	434054	61	D	1	And I've been really struggling to come up with a way of talking about this that is inclusive.
434182	447710	62	D	0.6861	Thinking about it, talking about it.  It gets to a kind of core piece of it that I'm interested in, which is not so much whether or not God exists and what the proof is or not of whether God exists.
448050	456740	63	D	1	But really, what is it that changes in people's lives when they undergo a spiritual transformation, when they surrender to a higher power?
457830	461940	64	D	0.99956	Why do their lives get better, when they DO get better?
462310	466430	65	D	0.95	And I'm really new to the active inference world.
466520	470930	66	D	0.99	Daniel Friedman is the one who's introduced me to these ideas.
471010	481180	67	D	0.99963	I'm really excited about the ways in which the whole active inference model might help me (at least) think about what's going on there.
482990	484314	68	D	0.99236	And that's what I'm working on.
484352	487500	69	D	0.99937	It's a little weird, but that's what I'm interested in.
488830	489290	70	A	0.99802	Great.
489360	495310	71	A	0.63388	Professor Friston. (You're muted.)
496690	499150	72	E	0.99793	Yes, that's going to be the title of my next book:
499220	506240	73	E	0.95319	“Karl, You're on Mute!” Retro from the... possibly the future.
507910	515698	74	E	1	I generally work on what I'm told to work on, so I'm just trying to list what I've been working on in the past few months.
515864	516894	75	E	0.7268	Interestingly,
517022	533930	76	E	0.99	it actually starts with Daniel Friedman and his fascination, along with Axel Constant, for evolutionary explanations that speak to many of the scale free issues that we've been hearing about in the prior session.
534430	536650	77	E	0.99675	So that's what I was working on, really,
536720	551658	78	E	1	a scale free approach to understanding temporally nested processes as free energy minimizing processes as a kind of active inference, and how that would lead to a variational synthesis of evolution.
551834	576600	79	E	0.99	And then I was told to work on belief sharing by Mahault and colleagues at VERSES, and worked on that in the context of synthetic language and tried to establish a really simple proof of principle that communication was an emergent property of any free ensemble, free energy minimizing system.
577690	599950	80	E	0.95	And just to open brackets, just to make the observation, it struck me time and time again during the session today how important communication is, whether we're talking about Bert's passing messages or responding to "you've got a new posterior," or we're talking about the kind of communication that Mahault was talking about.
600020	601726	81	E	0.74139	Well, everybody's been talking about.
601828	612770	82	E	0.98	It does seem to be really, indeed, the Gaia notion of overconnectivity and too much communication or the wrong kind of communication.
613830	626200	83	E	0.58	It does strike me that's quite central to both the theme of the workshop and the specific presentations that we've heard.
626570	648634	84	E	1	And then in the past few weeks, working on stuff I think that Bert would be more interested in, which is fast and frugal message passing schemes that enable the evaluation of the expected free energy, not to suffer from the limitations imposed by deep tree searches.
648682	673602	85	E	0.84618	So possibly Ashwin has spoken about this earlier on, but you're using ideas from dynamic programming, backwards induction, to try and take the pressure off the message passing to get fast and efficient evaluations of the expected free energy in sort of single unit, single agent active inference.
673746	675480	86	E	1	What have I been doing this week?
676650	677720	87	E	0.58571	Can't remember.
678490	679960	88	E	0.99843	That's what I've been doing.
680830	681386	89	A	0.989	Great.
681488	683500	90	A	0.60466	Rafael Kaufmann, please.
688880	690030	91	A	0.99947	Just a moment.
693200	694750	92	A	0.99977	Can everyone else hear?
695680	696430	93	A	0.57538	Okay.
699800	700980	94	F	1	What about now?
701130	702580	95	A	0.72	Yeah, great.
702650	703590	96	F	0.58	Yeah, thanks.
704200	705830	97	F	0.66491	It's contagious, I think.
706200	712520	98	F	0.79361	So I've also been drinking a lot of coffee as I've been caring for my now nine month old daughter.
714060	715188	99	A	0.42305	Congratulations.
715364	715992	100	F	0.99959	Thank you.
716046	741352	101	F	0.97221	So aside from sleep deprivation, what I've been doing is (I told you guys about this in the session earlier today) but in a nutshell, we've been working on what we call the Gaia Protocol, or the Gaia network, which is this open approach for building a common engine.
741506	763592	102	F	0.99952	You can think of it as a common runtime and a common language with the building blocks of shared decision making in the context of the Med [?] crisis, and getting to a set of building blocks for decision making that don't kill us all.
763646	765290	103	C	0.90682	So that's kind of it.
766140	769480	104	A	0.66256	Rafael, how much coffee is a lot of coffee?
770620	776140	105	F	0.97149	Well, it's espresso, so I don't think it's quite comparable to American coffee.
776960	777870	106	A	0.98	All right.
778400	780990	107	A	0.99	And Guillaume Dumas, please.
781520	782316	108	G	0.99012	Yes, sure.
782418	783630	109	G	0.99998	Can you hear me?
784080	784830	110	A	0.99949	Yes.
785280	786028	111	G	0.68445	Okay.
786194	792944	112	G	0.99927	So in the context of active inference, I have mostly focused on, well, the two big topics of my lab.
792982	796236	113	G	0.93507	So precision psychiatry and social physiology.
796268	796608	114	G	0.84844	So.
796694	816120	115	G	0.99958	On the precision psychiatry side, Nynke Boiten presented earlier in this symposium our work on trying to model theory of mind to being able to evaluate, through digital phenotyping, the level of sophistication of interaction in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders.
816460	829180	116	G	0.99	And that connects with also our interest in the social mind and how we can connect our understanding of how we deal with other people but with also ourselves.
829600	847996	117	G	0.99	And so that connects with other work at the Mila, with deep learning architecture, with higher order function in humans, where we're trying to combine different theories of consciousness, such as global neural workspace and attention schema theory.
848028	854816	118	G	1	And in the context of attention schema theory, there is this kind of recycling of self and other mechanisms.
854848	859396	119	G	0.96896	So that's one big work.
859498	864820	120	G	0.99	And on the other side, I'm very interested also in multi agent systems.
864900	880200	121	G	0.98	And so with Natalie Castell, who's going to join us soon, we've been working on creativity and the emergence of cultural norms in multi agent systems with the idea of applying that to climate action.
880360	897948	122	G	1	And also a new project that is starting here with NFRF [[New Frontiers in Research Fund]] of a big Canadian project on Indigenous knowledge and how we can think about new narrative around AI and typically a less solipsistic and individualistic way of dealing with AI.
898124	901590	123	G	0.99211	So that's the two main fields of research.
902600	910260	124	A	0.99949	Can you explain what you mean by less solidistic, less solipsistic when it comes to AI.
911900	925008	125	G	0.97	The Californian view of AI, because the narrative is mainly driven by U.S. and California right now, tends to circle around optimization, profits...
925124	933400	126	G	0.95	I mean, even OpenAI states that AGI is about optimizing profitable human tasks.
933480	936460	127	G	0.99793	They put like profitable in their definition.
937460	945040	128	G	0.60732	In the case of Indigenous systems of knowledge, we are more talking about community sustainability;
945780	951280	129	G	1	and the view already only in the application is less individualistic.
951440	963732	130	G	1	But also in the cognitive science point of view, we have the outcore computationalism that could say the brain is just like a computer in a very restrictive sense.
963866	984412	131	G	1	And so AI, like, typically those transformers that are massively used right now, are kind of like "brain in a vat" in a very silicon sense, while we are embodied systems that are constituted by our interaction with others.
984466	994800	132	G	1	And so, in a way, how we can think about artificial intelligence in this kind of more co-constitutive way and through a developmental and cultural lens.
996740	1003620	133	A	0.59093	Mm-hmm! Okay, now, speaking of the brain as a computer, we frequently hear in these circles "the brain as a predictive machine."
1004120	1008820	134	A	0.99301	So where does this, the (quote unquote) "brain as a predictive machine," have its limits?
1009160	1016200	135	A	0.99	And also, is that to be interpreted as implying conscious experience is a predictive machine as well?
1016350	1017672	136	A	0.93	And if not, why not?
1017806	1023930	137	A	0.91463	So I think, Karl, you'd be a great person to start this off, and then we'll go around the table again.
1025200	1032220	138	E	0.99	Yeah, I was mindful of Mahault's presentation the past half hour and the notion of temporal thickness.
1033440	1039756	139	E	0.67135	I'm sure that's got a lot to do with the necessary conditions for the kind of consciousness
1039868	1043810	140	E	0.99991	(I'm guessing) you're referring to - that freedom from the moment.
1044820	1057156	141	E	1	And if one reads prediction in its sort of psychological or protension nature in terms of being able to predict what will happen in the future,
1057338	1072250	142	E	1	I think that's going to be sort of a key bright line between things that do not possess certain kind of sentience and things that do.
1072620	1085720	143	E	1	And that bright line just rests basically upon - well, from perspective of active inference - having a generative model that includes the consequences of your own actions in the future.
1085890	1096956	144	E	0.97122	So just by having consequences you're now talking about the future. And the consequences in the future now become random variables.
1096988	1099072	145	E	0.71801	Therefore you have to infer them.
1099206	1107350	146	E	1	Which leads you directly to the notion of planning as inference, which means that bright line is just a difference between things that plan and do not plan.
1108120	1132124	147	E	1	And I would guess that that's where you probably want to start in terms of foregrounding the role of prediction as being an aspect of self organization and its sort of reading under active inference that characterizes conscious things from non conscious things, namely the ability to plan.
1132242	1133470	148	E	0.99994	Does that make sense?
1136820	1138048	149	A	0.91	I have follow up questions;
1138134	1145680	150	A	0.99858	we'll get to them at some point. But for now, Anna, do you have any comments on that, and Bert as well afterward?
1148100	1153968	151	D	0.95108	Well, I'm new to this field so I'm just familiarizing myself even with the language.
1154144	1157348	152	D	1	But I can respond to the question.
1157434	1172808	153	D	0.87	The brain is a predictive machine in terms of the work that I do clinically and the kind of psychopathology that I see when I'm working with patients, I work primarily with narrative, the stories that they tell about their lives.
1172974	1197292	154	D	1	And one of the recurring themes I've seen through my work is that when patients tell stories in which they are perpetually the victims of other people's actions or the world, that tends to be a predictive model for them so that they will then go out into the world and unconsciously create scenarios which will perpetuate their victimhood.
1197436	1211876	155	D	1	And that part of getting into wellness is to stop seeing themselves as entirely the victim of other people or circumstance, instead begin to appreciate what they contribute to their life problems.
1212058	1235064	156	D	0.99995	So I guess when I think of the limits of the brain as a predictive machine, I think in some ways one of the big limits is that it's a very powerful predictive machine that actually allows us to subsequently shape what actually happens to us and or our perceptions of what happens to us, which then can perpetuate a false narrative.
1235192	1238860	157	D	1	And I'll just give one small example from my own life.
1239010	1252068	158	D	0.99953	I've had my conflicts with my mother and one of my beefs about her is that she's a very poor communicator and that whenever I email her I either get a cryptic response or no response at all and it drives me crazy.
1252234	1264264	159	D	1	And about five years ago she sent an email, asked me some questions, I wrote her back and responded and it was clear to me that that required yet a response from her which I never got.
1264462	1271656	160	D	1	And that then perpetuated my narrative about her as a very poor communicator and many other negative things.
1271838	1278044	161	D	1	And then about three months after I sent that email, I found the email in my draft box.
1278162	1281212	162	D	0.99992	So I had never actually responded to my mother's email.
1281266	1282940	163	D	1	I hadn't actually sent the email.
1283090	1304710	164	D	1	And that was, for me, just a personal, wonderful example of the ways in which our actions can actually be manipulated to support our models and perpetuate falsehoods about the world that we live in.
1305880	1306340	165	A	0.98	Right.
1306410	1310452	166	A	0.98	And I have a quick question, Bert, just for Anna before we get to you.
1310506	1312148	167	A	0.99458	So you use the word narrative there.
1312234	1313968	168	A	0.9999	How are you defining the word narrative?
1314064	1315208	169	A	0.99996	Is it the same as model?
1315294	1316644	170	A	0.95371	Is it a sequence of events?
1316692	1319480	171	A	0.74	Like, what is the specific definition of narrative?
1319900	1322264	172	D	1	I never really thought about it in those terms.
1322382	1340080	173	D	1	But when I talk about narrative, I'm talking about the stories that people tell about their lives, because that's sort of my data and also about models, because what I've discovered about self narrative is it's not just a way to organize the past.
1340150	1342512	174	D	1	It also becomes a roadmap for the future.
1342646	1350290	175	D	0.9999	That's the language that I use, but I see it maps very nicely onto Ural's language of modeling the world.
1351380	1351952	176	A	0.99	I see.
1352006	1353510	177	A	0.51753	Professor DeVries, please.
1354520	1362550	178	C	0.99	Yeah, it's clear that the ability to predict is the essence of intelligent decision making.
1363720	1365324	179	C	0.53	Yeah, I have a different background.
1365392	1365624	180	C	0.99	Right.
1365662	1368824	181	C	0.99897	I'm not a psychiatrist, so I think about these things in different way.
1368862	1378584	182	C	1	The thing that I think about when I think about prediction is I would assume that brain predicts far ahead, that things get less accurate.
1378632	1378892	183	C	1	Right.
1378946	1383032	184	C	0.99999	If I predict that I want to go three quarters around a roundabout.
1383096	1390160	185	C	1	I don't care about the centimeter where my car goes when I'm around there, I just want to get in the right lane.
1390660	1398520	186	C	1	And I would assume that the brain doesn't takes less computations if you care about things less precisely.
1398700	1401030	187	C	0.74	But that's very hard in a computer.
1402520	1411232	188	C	0.99999	This is what kind of kills us, I think, in our current way of implementing active inference.
1411376	1420788	189	C	0.99998	When we want to predict a deep hat, we don't care about the accuracy, but we don't know how to do it much cheaper when things are less accurate.
1420964	1426590	190	C	0.59	And so that's a problem that we need to be working on.
1429920	1446370	191	C	0.72	It might be a key to building or to scaling up active entrance agents if we can actually compute messages that we want to know that we don't care about, if they are less precise, that we also spend much less computation on them.
1448440	1449092	192	A	0.94427	Thank you.
1449146	1450580	193	A	0.78	Now, Professor Kaufman.
1453480	1456150	194	F	1	I am not a professor, but I'll answer anyway.
1457400	1458576	195	F	0.48915	Can just call me Rafa.
1458608	1459460	196	E	0.40246	Rafa.
1459800	1460212	197	F	0.97	Yeah.
1460266	1472100	198	F	0.98866	So there's so many really interesting avenues here, and it's not often that I get the pleasure of discussing this kind of stuff with this kind of diverse crowd.
1472260	1479724	199	F	1	But I've been interested in these questions for a pretty long time.
1479762	1504932	200	F	1	And I think what comes to mind is how active inference at the lens, for instance, it enables us to get another sense of what nondualist views on consciousness are saying when they get us experientially to notice the difference.
1504986	1517370	201	F	0.99999	Between what we actually perceive and between the different various different processes or things that are going on in our head and our tendency to lump them all together into the same okay.
1518940	1521690	202	F	0.99999	This is my experience that I'm immersed in.
1523360	1543490	203	F	0.55346	So noticing being able to notice the difference between the process of perceiving and acting and to an extent, it's automated, and the narrative or the various narratives that are going on in parallel in my head, whether I'm aware of them or not.
1545140	1562650	204	F	0.98	And our ability to just put kind of seemingly arbitrary manner levels on top of it, to try to make sense of it all and to force that experience of having multiple narratives and multiple framings going on at the same time make sense of that experience.
1565900	1566328	205	A	0.63352	In a.
1566334	1570184	206	F	0.71427	Way that aligns with our presuppositions about how things are.
1570302	1573530	207	F	0.99846	So I think that's super interesting.
1573840	1587004	208	F	0.71	I also want to highlight that this view of consciousness as being kind of defined by having a narrative or an internal model that's about self or that at least is about self.
1587042	1599520	209	F	1	And that leads, as Karl said, to planning this inference that's actually, like, super deflationary in a way that people are not used to thinking about exciting.
1599860	1610932	210	F	0.89959	It's opening the doors to all sorts of exciting interdisciplinary conversations to be had on the basis of at least, I feel like, better, less talking past each other than we've ever had.
1610986	1612470	211	F	0.99685	So I'm excited about that.
1613640	1617316	212	A	0.84	And how is it that you're using the word deflationary there, Karl?
1617348	1620104	213	A	0.97	I remember I asked you about that when we had our podcast together.
1620222	1622152	214	A	0.98	But Rafael, similar question.
1622206	1623912	215	A	0.99366	So you said deflationary view.
1623966	1630812	216	A	0.99954	When we have narratives of self, do you mean us to something that consciousness is much more than sorry.
1630866	1632700	217	F	0.99884	Much, yeah.
1632850	1643520	218	F	0.65887	It's not necessarily much less than in the subjective sense, but it's perhaps much less than in the scientific sense.
1643590	1665896	219	F	0.9694	So one example of not saying exactly that, but maybe something close to what Daniel Dennett calls hetero phenomenology, which is basically the statement that the sum of what one can say scientifically about consciousness is is equal to what?
1665918	1680648	220	F	0.99999	Can be studied and modeled and theorized and communicated and learned and agreed upon on the basis of objective data about what people, including you, but also other people say about their experience and, of course, what can be measured.
1680664	1682108	221	F	0.44893	Up neuro, correlates and whatever.
1682194	1691052	222	F	0.99994	Which is not the same as not necessarily the same as our experience of what we think is our direct experience of being conscious.
1691116	1691344	223	A	1	Right.
1691382	1702164	224	F	0.99961	So one way to look at it is that the science of consciousness doesn't necessarily have to put the primacy on people.
1702282	1708432	225	F	0.96	For instance, people saying they have qualia, that we thought in that sense it's deflationary.
1708496	1709110	226	F	0.88	Right.
1711500	1719770	227	F	0.97	You have to explain why people believe they have qualia, not why people have qualia because it's not necessarily a scientific truth that people have.
1720220	1723880	228	A	0.55	Right, Professor Dumas.
1724720	1725468	229	G	0.99361	Yes.
1725634	1736636	230	G	0.96975	Well, on the limits of brain as predictive machine, well, we should be always careful to not move from one map territory fallacy to another one for sure.
1736818	1742700	231	G	0.99971	So we need to be skeptics and avoid to refine the methods.
1742860	1759296	232	G	0.91	And well, this World symposium show how this metaphor is super useful and fruitful, but I can see like two main limits or at least things where we should be careful.
1759408	1775272	233	G	0.96382	So following what Professor Lembke said in psychiatry, I think the looping effects and the way people picture themselves can be very unpredictable.
1775336	1793968	234	G	1	And so the way we think about the brain as a predictive machine think prediction for patients would have different signification of what we mean by predictive machines in the context of active inference and in general.
1794054	1817496	235	G	0.99818	Also, I can see that certain psychologists or anthropologists would have a big appeal all of a sudden for active inference and free energy principles, but taking the words as directly what they think the word mean, where we need to be careful in the way to communicate it.
1817598	1849372	236	G	0.98	And typically following also what Professor Debris said about prediction as being super important for decision making, I think we should be careful about the weirdness of cognitive science and how it doesn't necessarily expand to non Western educated industrialized country, where maybe the cultural value is not about optimization of your decision making or your profit.
1849516	1852704	237	G	0.85	And so that's the first thing where I think we should be careful.
1852752	1869224	238	G	0.70918	It's more like a matter of how to communicate the theory in that case, not necessarily a limit of the theory itself, but the second one is about the equivalents or not with other.
1869422	1879420	239	G	0.66	Like, I can see we had Mahault Albarracin talking about category theory.
1879760	1894480	240	G	0.99	And I'm very curious about right now among the different frameworks that are out there, how can we define what is equivalent or not with active inference to be able to see those limits?
1895460	1911596	241	G	0.99999	Maybe we are leaving what happened with quantum mechanics in the early 20th century with different interpretation, with different tools to model quantum mechanics, and here with artificial intelligence and cognitive neuroscience, we have also all those frameworks.
1911728	1926430	242	G	1	And I think the limitation would be then to not take this interpretation as the only one, but try to have a cross talk and a differential diagnosis of which one is the best for explaining what.
1928800	1934092	243	A	0.96524	Okay, now my role is the moderator, but I would like you all to speak to one another.
1934146	1937132	244	A	0.99999	So I'm going to ask a question that will serve as well.
1937186	1946032	245	A	1	You each will speak on it, but as the other person is speaking sorry, as the other people are speaking, just think, okay, is there a question that I have or is there a comment that I have?
1946166	1964596	246	A	0.99999	So the question is what are some of the recent advancements or breakthroughs in your respective fields that you find particularly promising and well recent, let's say 2020 till now so we'll start off with Rafael you're smiling and you look like.
1964618	1968040	247	F	0.7287	You'Re champion I was thinking what is my field?
1968110	1968296	248	C	0.97	Right?
1968318	1968890	249	E	0.79866	Because.
1970620	1989452	250	F	0.72762	We'Re very much in the last mile of applying the wonderful stuff that y'all come up with and making it useful on the so I'm extraordinarily excited about research like what Bird is doing.
1989586	2005970	251	F	0.92	And I feel like, as Gion was saying, we're also starting to see some convergence on different ways to get.
2007780	2008096	252	A	0.99	At.
2008118	2015480	253	F	1	Least the same shape of answers and in some cases, even to the same result.
2015630	2036952	254	F	0.97866	So one example of this is work that Chris Fields, Karl and others have been doing on the quantum basically explaining quantum information theory and how it relates to the free energy principle.
2037016	2111476	255	F	0.99877	Looking at the free energy principle as the classical limit of quantum information theory and I don't pretend to understand all of it, but as somebody who is coming from a quantum physics background just being alive to see this kind of conversions happening which as I mean, as Guillaume said, we've been at this business of post classical what the hell is going on for over a century now and it's nice to be at a time where again we're starting to talk less past each other and that's from a theoretical perspective, from a practical perspective, I think just finding that we have all the building blocks to create fast, interpretable, reliable and aligned decision making systems which includes AI systems, autonomous systems that have all those characteristics and that it turns out that all the things that the reinforcement learning and deep net neural networks people talk were very hard or impossible are sort of in the realm of what we can do looking at things from an active inference lens and vice versa.
2111508	2130184	256	F	1	A lot of things that active inference models have incorporated so far, it turns out if you toss in a neural network approximator here and borrow some other massively parallel computation techniques, it also becomes feasible.
2130232	2132460	257	F	0.99982	So it's converging.
2133760	2134220	258	E	1	Yeah.
2134290	2153590	259	A	1	For me, what's remarkable is that there's so many domains of what we thought was exclusively human or would be exclusively human for decades that in just the past couple years robots or computers seem to be just as good, if not exceeding us.
2153960	2160404	260	A	0.99	And I don't know if that's promising or worrisome, but anyhow Karl, please, if you don't mind answering the question.
2160442	2161124	261	A	1	And then we'll go.
2161162	2163380	262	A	0.99249	Anna then Bert and then Dumas.
2165500	2174110	263	E	0.99577	Actually, just reflecting upon one of your observations I think it's very difficult to identify one thing.
2175680	2183576	264	E	0.99993	In a sense, what is impressive is the diversity of advances and applications.
2183768	2217060	265	E	0.96	And I just say that because that's what I was thinking over the past 6 hours, just listening to your amazing presentation after presentation and just noting how diverse and yet there's this common thread, this common commitment, basically stating our curiosity and using the tools that naturalize, that kind of sense making, curious behavior and communication that inherit from sort of either maths or category theory or as Ralph notes now, quantum information theory.
2217140	2220164	266	E	1	But just to pick up on a couple of things which are relevant to this conversation.
2220292	2234984	267	E	0.98956	So the work with Chris Fields, it sounds lovely and exciting to bring quantum mechanics into active inference, but that's not the move that I think Chris is really wanting to champion.
2235112	2253780	268	E	1	The move, I think, is something that we've all been addressing in one way or another, which is leveraging the scale free aspects of this principled approach to self organization and hopefully self organization to some kind of generalized synchrony.
2254200	2258132	269	E	0.99957	So that's where the quantum information theory gets into the game.
2258186	2259332	270	E	1	It is scale free.
2259386	2264520	271	E	1	And indeed, he will go further and say it's completely background free and everything is constructed.
2265260	2274792	272	E	0.5259	So I think that's a lovely move, because once you've gone scale free, you then start to ask deep questions about how you couple one scale to another scale.
2274856	2278316	273	E	0.95	And in a sense, ecosystems is just that.
2278418	2283736	274	E	0.99971	How do the denizens of an ecosystem, how is it constituted?
2283768	2284936	275	E	0.99999	How is it co constructed?
2284968	2286092	276	E	1	What is the structure of it?
2286146	2289500	277	E	0.99999	These are all questions about how one scale links to another scale.
2289580	2294560	278	E	0.99995	So I think there have been lots of advances in that direction in many, many different fronts.
2295060	2305856	279	E	1	And you can read that either in terms of coupling, difference of spatial or spatial scales, but probably more importantly, sort of temporal scales.
2305968	2313720	280	E	1	And you see that wherever you look, you'll just come back to what do you mean by a narrative?
2314140	2318920	281	E	0.75	It is exactly I think, as I said, it's just a plan.
2318990	2320248	282	E	0.95494	It's just a story.
2320414	2323624	283	E	1	But notice the story has a temporal aspect to it.
2323742	2328808	284	E	1	I have narratives about being a good person, being a good father, being a good scientist.
2328904	2337330	285	E	1	I also have narratives about I want my cup of coffee, or I have to go look after the I don't, but Ralph has to go look after the child.
2337940	2342556	286	E	0.93884	So we've all got narratives at very, very different timescales.
2342588	2353040	287	E	1	And of course, if you're I just came back to Bert's example of I'm an autonomous vehicle and I'm sentient and we're five years into the future, and I have to drive around the roundabout.
2353200	2370520	288	E	1	What temporal scale and what kind of temporal course grading to define the narratives necessary with narratives would be appropriate for that kind of situation and the ensuing planning.
2374000	2375532	289	E	0.99999	Short answer to your question.
2375666	2378140	290	E	1	I think there have been many, many advances.
2380800	2388610	291	E	0.98	I think what they've had in common is basically transcending either different domains, but in particular different scales of application.
2389060	2391772	292	E	1	I also agree with the notion.
2391836	2401844	293	E	0.84137	Well, another I think, important and pragmatic advance is something that Bert mentioned, which is democratization of this technology.
2402042	2408550	294	E	0.84	I think Ralph also hinted at this is the time you start using this for the common good.
2410520	2410884	295	E	0.99141	So.
2410922	2416020	296	E	0.98	I think things like RX infer and PMDP.
2416380	2422168	297	E	0.94	And I didn't know about the Gaia project, but it sounds as though there's been great advances there as well.
2422254	2432172	298	E	0.97603	So this kind of democratization, I think, is really important, this sort of socialization where everybody can play and start to sort of not talk past each other.
2432226	2436880	299	E	1	I think that's a very important advance.
2437540	2441436	300	A	0.98	And did you say the word scale invariance or scale independence?
2441628	2443484	301	E	0.99	I said scale invariant.
2443612	2446290	302	E	0.97	I actually said scale free, and I shouldn't have done that.
2449640	2451956	303	E	0.86	I said scale free.
2452058	2468568	304	E	0.99325	So the idea that you can apply exactly the same mechanics and literally, for example, say, from Bert's perspective, the same kind of message passing at different space time scales or at different levels in a hierarchical model.
2468654	2498690	305	E	0.99471	So I've actually got a question for Bert in terms of reactive message passing, because reactive means that you don't have to prescribe the scheduling, but in addressing the problems or the issues that entailed, by having to specify the scheduling of talking or of message passing, you're bound to deal with time.
2499060	2509888	306	E	1	And in a scale invariant context, or nested with nested scales, for example, you have to deal with the separation of temporal scales.
2509984	2518616	307	E	0.9385	So I think there's going to be a very important generic question, which technically Bert will have been thinking about furiously for the past few years,
2518718	2537580	308	E	0.78	but I think implicitly, we're all going to have to be addressing soon, which is, how do you put the timing of your messages when you make a move or when you listen to a patient, or when you actually pass a message on a Factograph?
2539620	2548656	309	E	0.99965	How are we going to be able to put the separation of timescales into the architecture in a way that speaks to this scale
2548688	2562040	310	E	0.86594	invariance. The Gear project, for example, how do you integrate live feed from traffic flow sensors with fluctuations in the climate?
2563340	2581180	311	E	0.96358	This kind of data comes at very, very different temporal scales and yet has to be assimilated and modeled in a way that also, I think, has to know due courtesy to that separation of temporal scales.
2582320	2587390	312	A	0.61047	Bert, could you please recapitulate the question for the audience and then begin to answer it?
2588480	2590812	313	C	0.49834	Okay, yeah.
2590866	2608500	314	C	1	The issue is active instance agents are nested agents, and the higher levels supposed to operate on a larger temporal scale, but they are also working at a lower resolution.
2609320	2614932	315	C	0.99997	If you look far ahead, you don't care as much about precision, not at a centimeter level.
2614986	2625310	316	C	0.75692	When I go around a roundabout, I don't care at the centimeter where I land, but for the next few milliseconds, I do care because it may mean the difference between getting in the ditch or not.
2628720	2639730	317	C	0.7999	So the higher level, I want to look very deep ahead, but I don't want to send every millisecond a message to go to look, let's say, a minute ahead.
2640740	2645010	318	C	0.87593	So I need to space it out a lot, but then I may miss things.
2646020	2650192	319	C	0.99988	So preferably you would just send inaccurate messages.
2650256	2660164	320	C	1	But that only works if you actually have a method to also, let's say, use less computational power to compute a less accurate message.
2660282	2663050	321	C	1	And we're not good at that yet.
2665340	2687410	322	C	1	What we are thinking about is there's a new field or a new field, but there's a field called probabilistic numerics where... We are used in math to just compute everything very precisely or as precise as possible and do not care about how much computation we spend on it.
2687860	2694960	323	C	0.99986	So in probabilistic numerics, I hope we can leverage this for message computations.
2696020	2704356	324	C	1	I would like to spend, let's say, proportionally less computational power on the accuracy of a message.
2704458	2712090	325	C	1	One way possibly would be to consider a message a latent variable that has uncertainty by itself.
2713260	2719610	326	C	0.84	But I don't have a totally clear answer for Karl because we haven't solved that either.
2720220	2746588	327	C	0.96	But there is a problem in, let's say, what we do on... Our computers were so completely different from computers, let's say, from the from the from the brain, that, yeah, we are spending we're spending just too many computations on messages that in the end are very inaccurate.
2746764	2751430	328	C	0.54	And that's a problem in what we do on our computers currently.
2754120	2754532	329	C	0.61	Yeah.
2754586	2759940	330	C	0.66139	So I don't know how we go what you want to do with this on the higher level.
2760010	2771000	331	C	0.85914	If you want to look maybe ten times farther ahead and spend about the same amount of computation on the lower level, that's sort of our goal.
2772460	2775370	332	C	0.93	But we don't have an answer for that either at the moment.
2778080	2782670	333	A	0.69963	And, Anna, so please feel free to comment on or ask a question to anyone.
2784080	2790272	334	D	0.96	I don't I don't have anything to contribute, unfortunately, to how computers work.
2790326	2797200	335	D	1	But I can tell you that this idea of temporal scales is something that we face often in our work with patients.
2797780	2811040	336	D	1	For example, addicted patients are very focused on short term rewards and, in fact, their ability to control how they feel in the moment, that is partially what drives the addiction.
2811120	2823876	337	D	0.99415	So when I try to adopt Ural's language of minimizing surprise or minimizing free entropy, that's one of the things that people are trying to do on a short term time scale when they become addicted.
2823988	2839344	338	D	0.99619	So I have a young woman who's addicted to nitrous oxide, which has a very fast onset of intoxication over the order of seconds and a very fast offset, and she says that that's exactly what she likes about it, because she's controlling it second by second.
2839542	2855284	339	D	0.99996	So when we work with patients to get them out of that short temporal horizon, we actually rely more and more on action and having them change something in their lives, namely abstain from their drug of choice for long 
2855322	2873160	340	D	0.99335	enough to kind of completely reset their brains and to allow them to see this longer temporal. Because when they're chasing this short control, they're actually not able to see themselves in the longer narrative arc of their lives.
2873310	2876344	341	D	0.99994	So that's what comes to mind for me.
2876382	2883420	342	D	1	I don't think it's going to be helpful to people who are trying to build computers, but that's the kinds of interventions that I make with humans.
2884080	2885820	343	A	1	I have a question about that.
2885970	2896940	344	A	0.99994	So you mentioned control in the short term, and you've also mentioned that you study the positive effects of having a higher power in your life or surrender.
2897020	2897312	345	A	0.56958	Okay.
2897366	2900900	346	A	1	I kind of gave the punchline away by saying surrendering to the higher power.
2901050	2902740	347	A	0.99991	Where I was going was, okay -
2902810	2908372	348	A	1	What's the association between seeing yourself in the largest time frame and a higher power?
2908506	2917320	349	A	1	And then also is there something that is akin to giving up control when you look farther and farther into the future?
2917390	2923464	350	D	0.71664	Yeah! Such a great - yeah, that's at the heart of what I'm very interested in, because it's a real paradox, right?
2923582	2930300	351	D	0.99988	It's this kind of locus of control within ourselves that really, in modern culture, we think is a great thing.
2930450	2935368	352	D	1	But when that's taken to an extreme and one example of that is addictive behaviors,
2935464	2938268	353	D	0.99979	it's very bad for people and for communities.
2938444	2960244	354	D	0.8	And so what can pull people out of that is this kind of surrender to a higher power, giving up that locus of control, locating that locus of control outside themselves, not necessarily like in a theistic sense. One of the things that they talk about in Alcoholics Anonymous, for example, is you don't have to believe in God.
2960442	2961910	355	D	0.91737	It's just not you.
2962440	2963760	356	D	0.99856	You're not driving it.
2963850	2987260	357	D	1	And so I would be very curious, from the perspective of your-all's [?] understanding of active inference and the free energy principle and how the brain works, why is it that sort of embracing our inability to control what happens in our lives can actually be the very source of healing, especially embedded in this really kind of over controlled,
2987700	2991276	358	D	1	I would even go so far as to say endemically narcissistic culture.
2991388	2992908	359	D	0.87014	I'm really curious.
2993084	2996928	360	D	1	I don't want to take the conversation in a direction...
2997014	2998412	361	A	0.9999	Please! That's a fantastic question.
2998486	3001590	362	A	0.92039	So if anyone has a comment on that, please.
3005860	3015956	363	F	1	I have some thoughts, and I think this applies both at the personal level and at the global level.
3016058	3030292	364	F	0.99	And I think it has to do with my quote from earlier by Edward Fulbrook that if you're falling from a plane, yes, maybe an altimeter and some instruments might be useful, but what you really need is a parachute.
3030356	3030584	365	F	1	Right?
3030622	3042540	366	F	0.99991	So we have this presupposition that whatever framing we have operating in our day to day is going to be, okay:
3042610	3043496	367	F	0.99999	This is the right framing.
3043528	3056908	368	F	1	And it tends to be this rational, scientific framing of very linear cause and consequence for most stuff.
3057074	3070144	369	F	1	And it turns out that even if you inspect our day to day behavior, bigger, more complicated models are not necessarily better, which is where we get the success of heuristics under bounded computation,
3070192	3071540	370	F	0.54927	bounded rationality.
3072360	3085300	371	F	1	And if you scale it up to 8 billion humans interacted in resource constrained planet, a world of possibilities, but also of challenges,
3085380	3089690	372	F	0.99941	then we have to drastically lower
3091660	3092024	373	G	0.70867	our
3092062	3095708	374	F	0.59	bar for, yes, how much macro we have.
3095794	3101256	375	F	1	But also even where does information gathering reach diminishing returns?
3101288	3104440	376	F	0.99998	Where does modeling reach diminishing returns?
3104600	3111904	377	F	0.69047	There's a whole literature in the business world about the expected value of information, how much you should actually invest.
3112102	3128520	378	F	0.99998	Also in science is also known as optimal experiment design, where basically acknowledging that you have limited budget in terms of how much you can act and how much you can probe and how much time you can spend thinking about stuff.
3128670	3149004	379	F	1	And I think what we're doing when we feel like, burned out or exhausted from overthinking, we're innately feeling that, okay, we've gone too high and we need to give ourselves a vacation, give ourselves some free time here.
3149122	3165536	380	F	1	I think that doing this principle in a principled way, we're just not just like, taking the heuristics and the signals that we inherit from evolution, but actually being able to figure out collaboratively and with some rigor.
3165648	3176548	381	F	0.9974	Okay, we don't need to know exactly how many degrees the world is going to warm by 2000 and 2100.
3176714	3183512	382	F	1	In order to know that maybe it's a good idea to start doing something about the amount of carbon in the atmosphere or whatever.
3183566	3184170	383	F	1	Right?
3184700	3193710	384	F	1	And so I think this leads to this idea of a real knowledge economy and of things like abstraction as a service.
3196000	3214230	385	F	0.99289	How can you actually build in these kind of sophisticated, sophisticated translation layers that take some of this burden from ourselves as individuals and even as organizations, right?
3214600	3219990	386	F	1	And just put it out in the world as value added services, which is what they are.
3221640	3227610	387	A	0.48	And Guillaume, if you have any statements or questions or retorts, then please feel free.
3228220	3229160	388	G	1	Yeah, thanks.
3229310	3236360	389	G	0.51	Now, I was still also thinking about the recent breakthrough post 2020 in Action France.
3237900	3243390	390	G	1	To me, there were theoretical progress that were very interesting.
3243760	3251820	391	G	0.99996	We heard already about the formalism maturity at the mathematical level between multiscale and scale free aspects.
3252980	3258288	392	G	1	I really liked also the development of a more multi agent perspective of active insurance.
3258374	3266432	393	G	0.99115	It's very interesting, especially like, for instance, seeing multi agent systems.
3266496	3281016	394	G	0.99978	We just heard about even society as a wall, like as many as one system or many as many subsystems, and how we can use maybe those formalisms to also deal with policy making.
3281198	3287480	395	G	0.95208	That's very interesting venue and the emergence of norms, culture and ideas also.
3287550	3297660	396	G	0.99996	Because one thing that I'm still struggling with in the case of active insurance models is like how to get outside the checkerboard.
3298800	3308192	397	G	1	You can put a lot in the model, a priory, and how you make the model, creating new stuff that is not becked inside.
3308326	3317120	398	G	1	At the first and on that one very interesting breakthrough was the application of active inference to morphogenesis.
3317200	3322720	399	G	0.94	I really like the work that has been done on that and on the technical aspects.
3322800	3346828	400	G	1	I think the two main focus that I love are all the deep active inference and how to scale up active inference because it's a strong limitation for the adoption of the formalism if it's not scaled enough compared to other framework like deep learning and then the link with empirical data.
3346914	3355090	401	G	1	I really like, for instance, the work of Ryan Smith and how to connect with electrophysiology and clinical data.
3355460	3368900	402	G	0.52	And I think it's also something very important to anchor the theory in the real world and have falsifiability and empirical validation of those models.
3369640	3372630	403	A	0.97	And what are some of the applications of active inference to.
3375640	3376196	404	G	0.7581	So?
3376298	3378424	405	G	0.51687	Well, I'm not the expert here.
3378462	3380664	406	G	0.76611	Karl would be the best to answer that.
3380702	3391020	407	G	0.99	But I was referring to the work with Michael Levin and how a model can help to create a sort of embryogenesis.
3392560	3397310	408	G	0.5071	So maybe, Karl, you can explain better than me, please.
3398720	3405984	409	E	1	I don't have a reputation for explaining things very clearly, but yeah, that's absolutely right.
3406182	3432276	410	E	1	It was just at work with Michael Evan and colleagues showing that you can get quite expressive and bimimetic pattern formation and movement of different cells into an organization often described in terms of morphogenesis simply by communicating your beliefs.
3432468	3436804	411	E	0.99956	So I'm coming back to this sort of cross cutting theme of communication.
3436932	3453568	412	E	0.99991	So if you just broadcast your beliefs and you're a little cell and there are a little ensemble of cells, and they all have the shared generative model that includes if I was in this position, I would sense that.
3453734	3465812	413	E	1	Now, they all have exactly the same generative model, the same predictions, the same expectations, and they're all broadcasting their beliefs about where they are.
3465946	3480360	414	E	0.96	And the free energy minimizing solution is just when they're all in a place such that they receive signals that they would expect to receive when they're in this place.
3480510	3486424	415	E	1	And of course, if that is the same for everybody, there's only one arrangement where each cell finds its place.
3486462	3500940	416	E	0.99995	So basically, knowing your place is an emergent property of making the world mutually predictable through, yeah, a deflationary account of morphogenesis.
3502080	3507212	417	E	0.65	But Gim, I thought one of your units is precision psychiatry.
3507276	3510684	418	E	0.98203	So I thought you're going to talk about precision, so I'm going to do a Guillem.
3510732	3515344	419	E	1	Now, he talked about morphogenesis, I'm going to talk about precision.
3515392	3515990	420	E	0.95	Now.
3516760	3527500	421	E	1	I think that's a really nice way just to pick up on themes which everybody's just mentioned, in particular the pathology of precision.
3527680	3537796	422	E	0.84	And by precision you can read precision in the sense that Bert was talking about in terms of do you use an unsigned integer or a double?
3537988	3541624	423	E	0.99994	How much can I coarse grain to my numeric representation?
3541752	3551472	424	E	0.99999	Or you can use it in terms of coarse grading in the sense of the renormalization group chunking things in hours or years as opposed to milliseconds and minutes.
3551606	3561260	425	E	0.9997	Or you can look at it in terms of a statistician describing the reliability or the inverse variance of a signal.
3561340	3570848	426	E	0.83	And of course we have to estimate that when I say we I mean your agents and statisticians and act accordingly.
3570944	3590750	427	E	0.9	And certainly in the work of Ryan Smith on addiction, much of the sort of mathematical explanation for these addictive locked in OCD like phenomena rests upon a failure to get that course grading that precision estimation right.
3592480	3613830	428	E	1	The reason I wonder whether it be just worthwhile revisiting addiction and psychopathology or certainly pathology of behavior from the point of view of getting precision wrong and certainly assigning too much precision to low level processing, which is what Bert wants to avoid doing.
3615080	3628564	429	E	1	It just strikes me that that kind of story also has mileage in terms of why we are in a state of paralysis when it comes to climate change because I also noticed, Guillermo, that you talked about climate action.
3628612	3632984	430	E	0.43894	I've never heard that before, but that seems to me to be the important thing.
3633102	3636340	431	E	0.99995	Why isn't there any climate, Anna?
3636420	3640952	432	E	0.75	You know, it'll be like you going to the clinic and finding someone with Parkinson's disease.
3641016	3642910	433	E	0.99998	Why isn't this person moving?
3644960	3656576	434	E	0.94	And interestingly, the computational explanation for Parkinson's disease is assigning too much precision to the evidence that you're not moving before you move.
3656758	3674096	435	E	0.99918	So if you can't ignore the fact that nothing is changing, all your prior beliefs, your predictions that I am going to stand up or going to initiate walking, don't get a looking because they are immediately cancelled because you've assigned too much precision to the lower level processing.
3674208	3693310	436	E	0.98	And I'm just wondering whether that kind of pathology is exactly what Ralph is trying to reverse by having models at hand, recommendations at hand that provide a more coarse grained view of things, a deeper view.
3696160	3698030	437	A	0.98751	Anna, would you like to comment on?
3699680	3717170	438	D	0.73	I love this idea of the pathology of precision because I think it manifests in so many different ways not just among my patient population but I think it's almost like a cultural sickness, in a way.
3718280	3726240	439	D	0.71	The ways in which we seem, like obsessed with certain types of data and we're missing the big picture.
3726320	3728596	440	D	0.89808	So I'm going to think more about that.
3728618	3730200	441	D	0.96549	I'm going to read more about it.
3730350	3732004	442	D	0.92	I really appreciate the discussion.
3732052	3734568	443	D	0.77312	It's interesting for me and Adam when.
3734574	3744476	444	A	0.70485	You'Re referring to the pathology of precision, do you mean so in a more conscious sense that we're over evaluating something that we don't need to?
3744658	3757890	445	A	0.99201	Whereas, Karl, you're referring to it in an unconscious sense like the brain is putting too much precision on something because in Parkinson's it's not like you consciously are putting precision in a place.
3759220	3763212	446	D	0.99984	Well, I think you could look at it sort of like in both cases.
3763276	3767728	447	D	0.99999	When I think about addiction, people aren't doing it consciously.
3767824	3775460	448	D	0.99896	It's that they really do see this as adaptive and healthy and also even on some level that they can't do otherwise.
3775880	3780392	449	D	1	And they're not able to see the true impact of their drug use on their lives.
3780446	3784036	450	D	0.99997	They're genuinely not able to see the negative consequences.
3784228	3789100	451	D	0.64	And that's what contributes to getting caught in that vortex.
3789440	3794712	452	D	1	But I mean, you could also see it as part of what's happened culturally.
3794776	3802572	453	D	1	Like, for example, the whole wellness industrial complex, the way that we now count ourselves through all these different devices.
3802636	3813192	454	D	1	And if we could just count our breathing and count our heart rate and take supplements, then we would somehow reach some levitating state of precise wellness.
3813356	3818550	455	D	1	I don't know, this is all kind of new ideas for me.
3819160	3819940	456	A	0.72899	That's interesting.
3820010	3825892	457	A	0.5987	So you believe that we can be inundated with health data and that's detrimental to us?
3826026	3826904	458	D	0.61	Oh, absolutely.
3827022	3828650	459	D	1	I see that all the time.
3829260	3835290	460	A	0.99994	So for me, I used to have maybe I'll take this out of the well, this is going out live.
3835740	3840436	461	A	0.9993	Okay, let me figure out how to say this diplomatically.
3840468	3845480	462	A	1	I used to have a device that would measure my heart rate, let's say that and my sleep.
3845560	3851996	463	A	0.61	And instead of improving my sleep, it led to me becoming obsessed with it and then noticing, oh, I didn't sleep well.
3852098	3857888	464	A	1	I must not be feeling good today as well because apparently there's a high connection between how your sleep quality and.
3857894	3864096	465	D	0.92176	How well you plus added to that the other layer that I should be able to control it.
3864198	3864656	466	D	1	Right.
3864758	3873750	467	D	0.98052	So with all of this data and information, I should be able to, I don't know, reduce free entropy or whatever, reduce surprise, as you guys talk about.
3874920	3891470	468	D	0.98	And I think that's obviously that only goes so far and then can actually contribute to our misery because why aren't we all levitating like the Buddha or whatever when we have all these tools and we can pay attention to all this data?
3893040	3896940	469	A	1	I see this also with people who have productivity tools.
3897600	3900392	470	A	1	Not only that, but mechanical keyboards.
3900456	3910060	471	A	0.97164	Let's say the reason why I don't have a mechanical keyboard, even though I think I'd love it, is because I know that why the heck do I care about the clicking sound of a keyboard?
3910140	3915700	472	A	1	But if I got one, then I'd be like, well, what's the difference between clicking sound A versus clicking sound B versus clicking sound C?
3915770	3923792	473	A	1	And I'd become obsessed with the trappings of productivity that is sharpening, so called sharpening the axe rather than cutting down the tree.
3923936	3926336	474	A	0.99993	There's this phrase that is apocryphal.
3926368	3937320	475	A	1	And it said it's attributed to, I think, Lincoln, which is that he'd spend 80% of his time or half the time sharpening the knife than cutting the tree.
3938780	3943032	476	A	1	And then this is just echoed in productivity circles, but it can't be the case.
3943166	3945288	477	A	0.99768	Why would you spend so much time sharpening your axe?
3945304	3947352	478	A	0.99	Like, look at anyone who cuts down a tree with an axe.
3947416	3950700	479	A	1	Most of the time they're not doing that anyhow.
3951140	3957810	480	A	0.99817	So if anyone has any comments on what was just said, please can I.
3958260	3961808	481	C	0.99992	Just talk what I find exciting in my field about access?
3961894	3975220	482	C	0.98382	Sure, yes, I read it's a long time ago, but there was a paper and it's about that it says, well, active inference is not really a scientific loop because it's biased.
3976520	3983290	483	C	1	And I read that, and the sound of the paper was kind of so it's not good.
3983660	3987796	484	C	1	But I think active inference is maybe not a science loop.
3987828	3991976	485	C	0.99997	It's an engineering loop because there's bias, and we need bias in engineering.
3992008	3992764	486	C	0.99999	We need to make stuff.
3992802	3993644	487	C	0.99948	We need to build stuff.
3993682	3995128	488	C	0.85558	We need to have a bias.
3995304	3997832	489	C	0.52665	So it's an engineering design cycle.
3997976	4000670	490	C	1	I see that everywhere around me.
4002100	4009084	491	C	0.99	And active inference could be a complete breakthrough in in engineering.
4009132	4009730	492	C	0.92	Right.
4010260	4014316	493	C	1	The fields around me are signal processing.
4014348	4022180	494	C	1	I am myself in a signal processing department or group, and everybody builds algorithms.
4022680	4023764	495	C	1	For us.
4023962	4027048	496	C	0.74337	In active inference agents, it's inference over states.
4027214	4030740	497	C	0.53071	Then the floor below me, they build control systems.
4030820	4032680	498	C	0.74063	Well, it's inference over actions.
4033100	4036040	499	C	0.97741	Then other people are working on machine learning.
4036110	4037880	500	C	0.81345	It's inference over parameters.
4038940	4042024	501	C	0.99781	Active inference could be and you like this, Curt.
4042072	4049368	502	C	0.9882	It's a very deflationary view on engineering, because everything is just inference.
4049544	4073396	503	C	0.99	And so rather than building algorithms everywhere, if we become really good at implementing minimization, we will be able to build a great engineering design cycles, and we'll be engineering better machines for medical procedures or for other things that are important.
4073578	4078500	504	C	0.99998	So it has a tremendous application potential in engineering.
4079480	4086980	505	C	0.99992	In engineering, and I think in many fields, people have sort of drifted in different directions.
4087140	4088924	506	C	0.99988	Control theorists have.
4089042	4093784	507	C	0.89	I mean, they do almost the same thing as signal processing people, but they speak a different language.
4093832	4094430	508	E	1	Now.
4098480	4109250	509	C	0.97546	Signal processing people, it's a completely different group for the machine learning people, but it's all information processing, and this field can bring it together.
4112980	4124672	510	C	1	But the thing is that in order to make it successful in engineering, we need to build an application that impresses.
4124736	4125444	511	C	0.98	Right?
4125642	4127984	512	C	0.79174	It's not like a TicTacToe thing.
4128122	4134840	513	C	1	It really needs to impress people, needs to be better than some other control systems.
4135180	4144652	514	C	1	But once we do that, I think there is tremendous application potential because there haven't been enormous breakthroughs in signal processing and control.
4144706	4150510	515	C	1	The last big breakthrough, I think, was Kalmont filtering, and this was 1960s.
4152580	4157600	516	C	0.86718	It's kind of funny that the essence of what we do in active influence is also carbon filtering.
4160180	4166560	517	C	1	I think there's tremendous opportunities for what we do here for engineering.
4168520	4170390	518	C	0.98776	That's why it's exciting to me.
4171880	4174672	519	A	0.61496	Anna, do you mind expanding on what you said about acting?
4174736	4177736	520	A	1	And therapists should be helping their patients with that.
4177918	4179272	521	D	0.89	Oh, sure.
4179406	4179896	522	D	0.90213	Just so.
4179918	4194940	523	D	0.99	I mean, one of my critiques of mental health treatment today is that there's not enough encouragement of patients to actually go and act differently in the world as a way of gathering data.
4195010	4204864	524	D	0.98616	Instead, it often ends up being kind of this world building between therapists and patients, not necessarily ultimately adaptive in the world.
4204902	4208816	525	D	0.9954	So I was really just kind of responding to what Raft was saying, that we need to act in the world.
4208838	4218896	526	D	0.98	I think that's more true now in modern rich nations than ever before because we are so incredibly sedentary and interacting.
4218928	4224212	527	D	0.81	Of course we're interacting with a virtual world, and that's good and bad.
4224266	4228250	528	D	1	But I think we need to be actually acting in the world.
4231100	4234228	529	A	1	And so there's different forms of therapy.
4234324	4240776	530	A	0.99999	As you know, there's talk therapy, and then there's also cognitive behavioral therapy or psychotherapy and sort of talk therapy.
4240968	4245592	531	A	1	But cognitive behavioral therapy, as far as I understand, focuses on the actions.
4245656	4246780	532	A	0.99976	Is that incorrect?
4248400	4250632	533	A	0.86	It also focuses on model buildings.
4250696	4255628	534	D	0.98293	On the cognition, again, treating addiction.
4255804	4262172	535	D	0.98394	You're not going to really get that far with cognitive behavioral therapy or anything that's focused on just emotions and cognitions.
4262236	4273430	536	D	0.99999	People have to go out and actually try stop using their stopping their substance or their addictive behaviors and gather data from that experience and then come back and process it.
4275960	4284680	537	A	0.99403	So, Anna, in your field and this question will go to everyone, but in your field and what you study, where is the largest gap that you would like to see closed?
4285660	4289372	538	D	0.99786	Well, I mean, we're facing a huge mental health crisis now.
4289426	4296344	539	D	0.99999	We have more and more young people coming in with depression, anxiety, suicidality, addictions of all sorts.
4296392	4304124	540	D	1	And these are not necessarily people who are struggling by virtue of trauma or socioeconomic disparity.
4304172	4307372	541	D	0.99997	These are people who have really privileged lives in many instances.
4307436	4312624	542	D	0.99967	So it's really a puzzle what is going on for people.
4312662	4318912	543	D	1	And I think a big part of it is the fact that people are not having embodied experiences.
4318976	4322070	544	D	0.8746	They're not having experiences in the world.
4323320	4331880	545	D	0.71	And also the experiences that they are having are these kinds of very quick fixes and fast pleasures.
4334300	4335316	546	A	0.62819	Are you noticing?
4335428	4347432	547	D	1	I think the co created sort of models through healthier communication that allow people to feel part of a community and also to have truthful co created narratives.
4347576	4352030	548	D	0.99922	Trying to use the language here, I think that's really important.
4352480	4355424	549	D	0.99125	So, for example, one of the things Bert mentioned, what he's excited about?
4355462	4367204	550	D	1	One of the things I'm excited about in the field of addiction medicine is mutual support and the proliferation of things like Alcoholics Anonymous, but also other mutual help groups, a lot of them existing now online.
4367402	4380650	551	D	1	And the way that people are together creating healthier narratives and acted together to counteract a lot of the unhealthy narratives that I think are driving a lot of decision making today.
4382860	4395470	552	A	0.59	I wanted to know, is there a correlation between the rise in mental health or, sorry, mental illness or mental health issues, whatever we want to call it, and a certain trait of people?
4396720	4400188	553	A	0.99798	Is it affecting the population the same?
4400274	4405616	554	A	0.99999	So the whole population is raised 20% in terms of how many mental health issues they have per year?
4405718	4408752	555	A	0.99986	Or is it affecting people who deal with abstractions more and more?
4408806	4414704	556	A	0.99999	So, for instance, we're talking over zoom and some people study abstractions just like us.
4414822	4422912	557	A	1	And then there are some people whose work it is to do something physical like running or swim?
4423056	4427140	558	A	0.99971	Is it affecting everyone equally or are you noticing that there's some broad trend?
4427640	4438330	559	D	0.99999	Well, the broad trends that are out there are just correlational, but the more time that people spend in the virtual world, the more likely they are to suffer from depression, anxiety and other mental health problems.
4439820	4452560	560	D	0.99999	People haven't really been able to narrow that down to specific content, but they have been able to save just the sheer amount of time that spending that you're spending online increases your risk for certain poor mental health outcomes.
4455060	4455712	561	A	0.67826	Okay.
4455846	4462144	562	A	0.93	Now, Karl well, again, if anyone has any comments or questions, please just raise your physical hand.
4462182	4466390	563	A	1	I can see raph ralph Rafael sorry.
4466840	4486410	564	F	0.67	I was just going to say that I think another notable trend is, and I just saw somebody say this on YouTube just yesterday, that young people are disproportionately affected by things like climate grief because they're the ones that are going to be alive to deal with it.
4488160	4503344	565	F	0.48	And I think that applies more generally that Peter Sanghi already like 30 years or something ago, wrote about the Inescapable Network of neutrality, the reality that what we do affects each other.
4503462	4503888	566	F	0.81	Right?
4503974	4509680	567	F	0.99	And we took advantage of this huge resource buffer that's called the biosphere.
4512340	4512752	568	A	0.73	And.
4512806	4520244	569	F	0.99928	Earth to pretend that it didn't for quite a long time and got a lot of mileage out of it.
4520282	4541950	570	F	0.98	But now we're at a point where there's a whole generation of people that are coming to grips with the fact that I'm going to stop myself from saying a square word, but oh my God, we actually need to change everything about everything that we do and we need to do it fast.
4543200	4544350	571	F	0.78	By the way.
4548400	4555004	572	F	0.99399	It's not just what we do out there, it's also what we do inside, how we get ready for how to show up for life internally.
4555052	4555216	573	E	1	Right?
4555238	4558204	574	F	0.99989	So no wonder that it has that impact.
4558252	4565280	575	F	0.62	Like myself, I've dealt with anxiety and a lot of other things.
4565430	4570676	576	F	0.97621	We've had conversations about what are we doing bringing a daughter into this world and all these kinds of things.
4570698	4576810	577	F	0.66	And I think it's only natural that it's coming to a head in this way right now.
4578860	4582970	578	A	0.1736	Naom you have your hand up and I can't see yes.
4584060	4599550	579	G	0.65	Yeah, it's connect with what has just been so and your initial question about the gaps that needs to be closed, I think like a scale free model of health and mental health particularly would be great.
4600820	4618468	580	G	0.99803	We are in silos, in biomedical research and the fact that someone is having depression can come from interacting genes as much as interacting people and also is related to climate change and so on.
4618554	4637572	581	G	0.95651	So how we can have a new health systems that doesn't deal with those silos and integrate those different scales, to me it's like really a big challenge, but a challenge that current models and work that we can see going that direction.
4637636	4638936	582	G	1	And I'm very enthusiastic.
4638968	4639790	583	C	1	About that?
4642240	4643180	584	A	0.9656	Bert.
4648030	4648780	585	C	0.91	Yeah.
4651550	4662830	586	C	0.99993	In my field in engineering, active inference is not understood because almost all papers are written by neuroscientists and they're hard to read.
4662980	4666862	587	C	0.99726	So I was really happy to hear today that.
4666916	4673022	588	C	0.64	And I think it's Sanjeev Namjoshi who is writing an engineering book on active inference.
4673166	4675460	589	C	0.95571	So I think that will really help.
4676550	4696758	590	C	1	That, together with the availability of good toolboxes for implementing active inference, should make a lot of engineers much more enthusiastic about active inference because it's not something that is not understood at the moment in engineering circles.
4696854	4700060	591	C	0.99706	So I hope that the book will be good.
4700590	4702640	592	C	0.61592	I'm enthusiastic about that.
4704530	4712400	593	A	0.86	And Karl, where are some gaps in your research that you'd like to see?
4716630	4717566	594	E	0.76	More than gaps?
4717598	4722690	595	E	0.94988	There's a whole empty space out there yet to be explored.
4723110	4762990	596	E	1	But in terms of what seems to be emerging from the session and specifically the past few answers, it does seem to be important to have this very generic just to take Bert's sort of line that this is just one deflationary simple and probably the right way to understand stuff and to make recommendations or to describe people's actions, possibly to themselves in a therapeutic context.
4763570	4769630	597	E	1	And as such, it should be push button technology and it should be democratized and socialized.
4769710	4773730	598	E	1	And I think that's the challenge, practically.
4774070	4777300	599	E	1	And 1 may ask, why would you want to do that?
4777610	4782710	600	E	1	For me, there are two clear imperatives.
4783290	4791846	601	E	1	One is very abstract, and it's not really within my comfort zone, and the other one is in my comfort zone.
4791878	4806240	602	E	0.58	But the one that's outside my comfort zone is this notion of interactivity and hyperconnectivity and the metacrisis that we heard about.
4807490	4819860	603	E	0.71	And Aguim also referred to this in terms of what he was trying to distinguish between a Californian notion of optimality and another kind, another way forward.
4820390	4828130	604	E	0.99	And to me, it's a stark contrast with growth is good versus sustainability.
4828710	4833138	605	E	0.99	And of course, the math of the free energy principle is just about sustainability.
4833234	4842618	606	E	0.95982	It's just a description of the physics of systems, random, dynamical systems that self organize to some non equilibrium steady state.
4842784	4844300	607	E	0.94	That is what we are.
4844750	4859150	608	E	0.83242	So for me, there's something deeply, if you like, apt about the free energy principle and its chronologies, such as active inference in application to ecosystems and lived ecosystems and realized ecosystems.
4859650	4877746	609	E	0.99734	So if those basic principles can be brought back into globalization, into the market, into fintech, into social media, into politics, into climate action, I think that would be a good thing.
4877928	4882520	610	E	0.61091	I'm just mindful this struck me in a number of the presentations today.
4882970	4894102	611	E	0.27	You remember before, Bert was saying, if you look at the brain, which is a really lovely example of a self organizing system to a non equilibrium steady state, then it's empty.
4894166	4895226	612	E	1	And what did he mean by that?
4895248	4897062	613	E	0.86	What he didn't mean you were empty headed.
4897206	4901290	614	E	1	What he meant was it's incredibly sparsely connected.
4901810	4917278	615	E	0.99	Now, that tells you immediately that a pathology of connectivity is hyperconnectivity overconnectivity, which immediately, well, it made me very alert to the presentation of the metacrisis.
4917374	4936738	616	E	0.98	That one of the first three things that was underwrote the metacrisis or the current crisis we're tending with is a destruction of that sparse, delicate connectivity that defines thingness and defines ensembles of things technically in terms of Markov blankets.
4936834	4946758	617	E	0.99784	So if we want a world in which lots of different things can coexist in some kind of generalized synchrony in a sustainable way, you need fast connectivity.
4946934	4951210	618	E	1	And the pathology, the thing that will destroy that, is overconnectivity.
4951810	4964318	619	E	0.99846	So it seems to be very important that we get that into play in terms of machine learning, artificial intelligence, politics, fintech, climate change.
4964404	4972498	620	E	0.85	And the only way it's going to get there is epistemically by equipping people to actually build their own little models and ask their own questions.
4972584	4976100	621	E	1	You can't tell people this they've got to learn they've got to learn it for themselves.
4976730	4980680	622	E	0.64035	Just very quickly, I'm sure we've only got a couple of minutes left.
4983690	4997210	623	E	1	The other agenda, which I'm more familiar with is exactly Anna's and Guillaume's agenda, which is making this work in the context of neurology and psychiatry.
4997630	5014000	624	E	0.99561	So if you can democratize and socialize this way of describing things so that people can now build models of their particular patient in the other use of precision psychiatry, I suspect that Guillum's unit was called after.
5014550	5023150	625	E	0.90359	So it's a personalized medicine that is really personalized in the sense that you actually have your digital twin of your behavior.
5023310	5025060	626	E	0.99	And then you've got that.
5025510	5042374	627	E	1	You optimize your digital twin to become a model of your patient, and then you can start to do experiments on that model, behavioral interventions, or even share that model very much in the spirit of CBT with the patient and say, look, this is you.
5042412	5044186	628	E	0.99992	This is what would happen if you went out and did this.
5044208	5046860	629	E	0.57	And this is what would happen if you went out and did that.
5048910	5049866	630	E	1	To my mind.
5049968	5070402	631	E	0.99	And indeed, that was the initial motivation for much of this work, was actually to build observation models of psychiatric conditions, to work out both the pharmacological and physiological basis and the disruption of the pathology of precision and message.
5070456	5086366	632	E	0.99963	Passing on the factographs that are our brain even though they are very empty on the one hand, but also get that behavior, that key thing that Anna was talking about the active engagement with the lived world into that model and hence active inference.
5086478	5109630	633	E	0.99	And just to conclude that that activity, that sort of physical engagement, that embodiment, that sort of for ease and everything else, I think it's really coming to a head now in terms of people after, the large language model, after the Chat GPT moment, the bounce back has been what's missing?
5110530	5111582	634	E	0.99967	What's not there?
5111636	5116180	635	E	0.99	And of course, what is not there is agency and embodied engagement with the world.
5116790	5139080	636	E	1	And that's why I think there's still a lot of work to be done in bringing artificial intelligence read as active inference in a way that matters to people who people who can make a difference, which is basically everybody, but specifically politicians and doctors and engineers and the like.
5140810	5146502	637	A	0.99999	So you all now have 30 seconds to 60 seconds to speak directly to the audience.
5146646	5150762	638	A	0.52	What is the message that you what closing message do you have?
5150816	5153210	639	A	0.8736	You're speaking directly to someone who's listening.
5153290	5154750	640	A	0.98005	They're a curious person.
5154900	5156650	641	A	0.94734	They're interested in active inference.
5156730	5162602	642	A	0.99978	They also want to lead better lives, hopefully, and do something propitious.
5162746	5165300	643	A	0.97788	So what message do you have for them?
5166790	5168820	644	A	0.44322	Anna, we'll start with you.
5171720	5172580	645	D	0.59415	Gosh.
5173080	5200392	646	D	0.99436	I'm just going to say what pops into my mind right now is that one of the things I have learned from my patients who are trying to get into recovery from severe addictions is something that they call the set aside prayer where they set aside all of the notions that they have about how the world works and try to be completely open and receptive to information coming into their minds.
5200536	5221172	647	D	1	And I think that's just a wonderful frame or concept for all of us living in the world to periodically just take a moment and take these models and just say everything I think I know about the world, I'm going to temporarily suspend it, and I'm just going to be open.
5221306	5228420	648	D	0.99	And when that happens, we can be present and learn in a way that it's not possible when we're just trying to reinforce our models.
5229480	5229988	649	A	0.9949	Great.
5230074	5230800	650	A	0.79127	Fantastic.
5230880	5231632	651	A	0.61	And Bert.
5231696	5232296	652	A	0.6	And then we'll go.
5232318	5232724	653	A	0.91624	Karl.
5232772	5235720	654	A	1	And then Raph and then Guillaume.
5237260	5239912	655	C	0.99024	Well, I just enjoyed today very much.
5239966	5249368	656	C	0.99	I thought there was a lot of material, both for people from, let's say, psychology, neuroscience, but also for engineers.
5249464	5256384	657	C	0.99992	So if you haven't watched some of the talks, go look through the schedule, because some of the talks were really good, I think.
5256422	5257970	658	C	0.99965	So I really enjoyed that.
5258500	5261008	659	C	1	And then, yeah, what should I tell people?
5261174	5262368	660	C	1	Go work out.
5262534	5263484	661	C	0.99995	Do a lot of sports.
5263532	5264690	662	C	0.99951	It's good for you.
5269560	5270404	663	E	0.95	Yeah.
5270602	5273910	664	E	0.94908	Sorry, I was going to make a joke, but I can't because it wouldn't be.
5275240	5283290	665	E	0.99917	So I'm going to use my 30 seconds just to thank Daniel and his team for this.
5284140	5294488	666	E	0.71427	If you want something to do, you should go and watch the live streams and get involved with this ecosystem.
5294584	5308240	667	E	1	I hadn't seen that paper being presented before, but I was really impressed with the Active Institute and its openness and its welcoming attitude and vision, like the Smithsonian.
5309140	5312988	668	E	0.96548	So if you want to pursue these ideas, get involved.
5313084	5320272	669	E	1	And if you haven't got time, just make sure you attend next year's Active Inference Institute celebration.
5320416	5321780	670	E	0.77	But thank you, Daniel.
5322920	5325012	671	A	0.41492	Rafael yeah.
5325066	5330468	672	F	0.99819	So I'll second what Karl said and follow on with it's.
5330484	5353180	673	F	1	An invitation not just to participate in the Active Defense Institute, but also the invitation to participate in building this Gaia tractor, this new way of doing things that acknowledges the value of growth, and also the value of sustainability, joins it all together in this thing called regeneration.
5353520	5358184	674	F	0.99	And it really is a collective effort.
5358232	5359900	675	F	0.47563	It's a collective learning effort.
5362020	5366276	676	F	0.99	And this also, by the way, also applies to the panelists as well.
5366378	5367188	677	F	0.95	I think.
5367354	5376372	678	F	0.99989	Obviously, what Bert and Karl are doing, it has immediate things that have to do with what we're after.
5376426	5388260	679	F	1	But one of the main things that we keep discussing is also like this the inter subjectivity and the importance of being able to operate well as humans together.
5388330	5391752	680	F	0.99	And that connects directly to cognitive science in psychiatry.
5391896	5415436	681	F	0.55	And so everybody that wants to be engaged and be a part of building a better world should be thinking about what am I doing as an individual or as employee of organization or as a researcher or as a leader or as a family member, what am I doing?
5415558	5422436	682	F	0.99021	How does it contribute to this new non equilibrium set of state?
5422538	5424516	683	F	0.99966	So, yeah, that's kind of it.
5424538	5427270	684	F	1	I probably blew through the 60 seconds, but here it is.
5427270	5428060		A		And Guillaume,
5428060	5436904	685	G	0.78	Well, I would thanks also, all of you for the discussion and the organizer for what they are doing.
5436942	5445416	686	G	0.97	Indeed, the work of the Active Inference Institute is very laudable and interesting from an open science perspective.
5445448	5446936	687	G	0.99747	They are really embodying
5446968	5450012	688	G	0.83	that. So big kudos to them.
5450146	5455088	689	G	0.9	And well, the Frieze was saying to do sport is good for you.
5455174	5459932	690	G	0.80831	I'm not very good at sports, but some say that science is a team sport.
5459996	5466224	691	G	0.97245	So at least have a good team perspective when doing science.
5466272	5470470	692	G	1	And being kind to each other would be the best advice to everyone.
5472520	5474230	693	A	0.98489	Well, thank you.
5475720	5476820	694	B	0.89	You get yours too.
5476890	5480250	695	B	0.9999	Somebody else has to come in from outside the Markov blanket, though.
5481660	5484036	696	A	0.97768	Well, I wanted to just thank you, Daniel.
5484148	5485540	697	A	0.99972	Thank you, Daniel.
5485700	5490500	698	A	0.95	And Rafael and also Karl and Anna and Bert and Guillaume.
5490580	5492716	699	A	0.99971	This was tremendous amount of fun.
5492898	5496744	700	A	0.99	And well, I hope I get to speak to you all individually.
5496872	5502190	701	A	0.67	And as usual, I have way more questions than we were able to get to.
5502800	5504044	702	A	0.99989	Thank you all.
5504242	5504990	703	F	0.78417	Thanks.
5505840	5506684	704	F	0.85853	Thank you.
5506802	5507790	705	B	0.99958	Thanks everyone.
5508400	5510104	706	B	0.9601	Farewell to the panelists.
5510232	5510812	707	E	0.99666	You're all.
5510866	5512220	708	B	0.99997	Welcome back anytime.
5513440	5515380	709	B	0.99991	Thanks everybody, for watching.
5515490	5516390	710	B	0.33902	Be watching.
5516760	5525664	711	B	1	Right now we're about to head over to the discord and hang out and talk a little more if you want to, and then stay involved, get involved.
5525792	5527748	712	B	0.99845	So till next time.
5527914	5528480	713	A	0.99814	Bye.
