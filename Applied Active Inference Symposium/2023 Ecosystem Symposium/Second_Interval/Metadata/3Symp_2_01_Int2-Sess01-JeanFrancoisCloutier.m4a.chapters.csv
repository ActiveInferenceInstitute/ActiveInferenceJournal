Third applied active inference symposium at the active inference institute on August 22, 2023. If anybody has questions for this presentation, please just put it in the live chat.	This is the second interval of the third applied active inference symposium	A Collective of Inference theorizers

I subscribe to the notion that all intelligence is collective intelligence.	Since 2017, I've been experimenting with Lego robots and models of cognition	Lego Robots and the Society of Mind
994200	1303630	16:34	Project is located at the intersection of Active Inference as a domain, the Wet and Society of Mind as an architecture, and symbolic AI as a form of computing. We'll start with a single cognition actor to learn how to make sense of its local environment. Making sense implies being able to predict incoming sensations.

App Session Engine operates on very small data sets and generates human readable generative models.	Emmanuel Kant asked what is the minimal cognitive apparatus needed to have experiences	In the Search for the Synthetic Unity of Apperception
2094230	2351410	34:54	Not every causal theory will do, though it may predict correctly, it may not be meaningful unless it is unified. Is it spatially unified? Do we have conceptual unification? Are the static rules obeyed? And of course, that we get a thumbs up from Dr. Kant.	So is this causal theory unified? Do we have conceptual unification	So is this causal theory unified?
2352580	3021184	39:12	App Perception Engine uses all forms of logical inference. The product of the learning is actually a human readable artifact, in this case, a logic program. What is learned, the output is a causal theory.	App Perception Engine uses logic inference to learn causal theories	App Perception Engine
3021232	3426400	50:21	My implementation of the app Perception Engine gives pretty good results. What makes it hard for the app perception engine to find a good causal theory is formally equivalent to what makes cognitive science as a whole hard. I'm hoping to do further optimizations and bring it down to something even smaller.	App Perception Engine looks for causal theories based on training set	App Perception Engine: Finding a causal theory in 60 seconds
3427300	3627756	57:07	Next steps. I want to move to beliefs from sensations and to policies to validate or eliminate beliefs. As cognition actors connect to one another, a conjunction actor will be able to predict the beliefs of others. Eventually, we'll have a society of mind, which is a bunch of intersecting boom belts.

3627948	3680090	1:00:27	Join the Discord and participate in the Robotics and Embodied Chat. How important is conducting this work in real world versus simulation? What tools or components are missing in the robotics toolkit to make this research easier and better?	Just to conclude the session, I'll read two questions and let's address them in an upcoming robotics meeting	Robotics and the Embodied
