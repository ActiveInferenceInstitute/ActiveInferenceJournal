[[start:17890][end:18742]] Next up -
[[start:18876][end:20070]] Welcome Avel.
[[start:20410][end:24466]] We have Avel Guénin-Carlut with “Embedded normativity.”
[[start:24578][end:26600]] So thanks Avel to you.

00:31 _Avel:_
[[start:31370][end:31782]] Hello.
[[start:31836][end:32774]] Can you hear me?

00:32 _Daniel:_
[[start:32892][end:33670]] Yep.

00:38 _Avel:_
[[start:38810][end:41150]] And can you see the slides?

00:41 _Daniel:_
[[start:41730][end:44350]] I only see the top left of the slide.

00:45 _Avel:_
[[start:45490][end:49870]] You only see the top just yeah.

00:49 _Daniel:_
[[start:49940][end:50462]] Try again.
[[start:50516][end:51280]] Thank you.

00:52 _Avel:_
[[start:52710][end:54834]] Okay, about now?

00:54 _Daniel:_
[[start:54872][end:55310]] Yep.
[[start:55390][end:55922]] Looks great.
[[start:55976][end:56820]] Thank you.

00:57 _Avel:_
[[start:57670][end:58740]] Okay, good.

00:59 [[start:59270][end:61630]] So I am Avelina Carlo.
[[start:61790][end:65102]] I'm interested in multiscale collective organization.
[[start:65246][end:68360]] This is why I came to active in France to begin with.
[[start:68810][end:80878]] And the core question I've been asking is basically when we look at human organization, there is creative evolution, there is a change through time of the specific patterns that are enacted.
[[start:80914][end:83530]] And this is very hard to account for.

01:23 [[start:83680][end:89770]] And I have been trying to pin down more and more specifically what exactly is going on and how to model it.
[[start:89920][end:94554]] So this specific work is a work I wrote in the context of my PhD.
[[start:94602][end:108478]] Of course, which is funded by the Escape Project, a project in cognitive archaeology that's interested in how the archaeological landscape shape cognition and vice versa.
[[start:108654][end:111086]] The title of it is automated.
[[start:111118][end:111742]] No activity.

01:51 [[start:111806][end:114050]] An active inference of agency.
[[start:114630][end:120760]] An active inference account of agency being flesh because you will see very quickly why.

02:01 [[start:121130][end:127266]] So first we will go through the existing work on anchor cognition in the context of active inference.
[[start:127378][end:133850]] Then we'll try to expose the concept of embedded Motivity, which we introduce here and what it means.
[[start:133920][end:143130]] And then we'll look at the more semiotic question around the externalization and utilization of normativity in cultural landscapes.

02:23 [[start:143470][end:146890]] So first encouraged cognition in active in France.
[[start:147490][end:149482]] So we know active inference.
[[start:149546][end:151070]] I will go quickly over it.
[[start:151140][end:155410]] I still need to do it because there are lookers that are not familiar.
[[start:155750][end:169446]] So active inference say that agents continuously predict the specific queues sensory cues they will see, and they predict the action or policy they will not take.

02:49 [[start:169548][end:178150]] And they basically enact an ongoing stream of expectation that they reconstruct given upcoming signal.
[[start:178570][end:190714]] So this is best Akotin four in this schema which shows the agent as the nickel system, which engage through environment, through action and cessations.

03:10 [[start:190842][end:207780]] And all of these specific domains, they minimize a specific function that is called free energy and whose minimization basically means there is a prerogative process going on.
[[start:208550][end:215250]] And a core property of active inference is that it dissolves agency as we typically understand it.
[[start:215320][end:221218]] We don't have agents that have like an internal monologue that drives them to take decision.

03:41 [[start:221394][end:224182]] We have a conscious anticipation of what's going on.
[[start:224236][end:228460]] And whatever an agent anticipates itself to do, it will do.
[[start:228830][end:237450]] And so this goes for computationally satisfying but very deflationary notion of what is going on with agency.
[[start:238510][end:247230]] So the question then comes what is the relation between an agent and the cognitive landscape in which it evolves?
[[start:247970][end:297850]] I will present very rapidly again the framework of Skill and a pioneered by Brunborg, Kierstein and Reidfield, and which says that Skill agents, which we understand as agents that understand what is going on around them, they will basically experience the world as a landscape of affordances, which is opportunities for actions and their cognition pretty much reduces to the experience of this landscape and adaptive engagement with it, which basically maximize the grip the agent has on the system and essentially for reasons we will not go over because it's math the very existence experience of this landscape.

04:58 [[start:298010][end:301594]] It is equivalent to the existence of constraints over attention.
[[start:301722][end:314290]] The attention that the agent gives to thing which translates the embodied expectation that are two times embodied bad the embodied expectation that the agent enacts.
[[start:314950][end:335642]] And so this becomes very interesting when we cross it with the existence of enculturation in humans because the basic experience we have of affordances, of what we can do it is shaped culturally, it is shaped by interaction wherein we learn with other humans about what we do, what we can do and what we can do.
[[start:335776][end:341382]] And this means that the basic human experience, it's thoroughly encultured.
[[start:341446][end:357780]] It's embedded in what Ramshed called landscape of cultural fondencies and it is embedded in cultural and material regimes of attention so ways to pay attention to things.

05:58 [[start:358390][end:369298]] And this is a figure that comes, I believe, from this year on thinking throughout the minds where it shows basically how the action installation cycle.
[[start:369394][end:383370]] When we have several agents, they build a common environment that has epistemic cues on how the world is like and we are enculturated to pay attention to things in a certain manner that makes it so.
[[start:383440][end:397322]] We perceive and enact this landscape and so the uncultured constraint over the flow of attention because of what we saw just before the deflationary account of agency.
[[start:397466][end:415560]] It means that the very expensive landscape, cultural landscape that is collectively enacted, it effectively integrates intentionality, it effectively integrates normativity in a way that clashes strongly with classical account of both.
[[start:416810][end:425298]] So, given this state of the art, let us look at what I mean specifically by embedded normativity.

07:05 [[start:425474][end:432040]] So embedded Motivity is a kind of normativity, I think you have got it.
[[start:432490][end:454606]] So normativity it means basically the criterions by which we judge things to be good and bad in the context of biological system they will look for specific, I don't know, chemical concentration and they will avoid other this is the phenomenon of chemotaxis, this is pretty basic and this is a form of normativity.
[[start:454798][end:475046]] But for humans we will typically think of laws, cultural norms, culturally shared way to judge behavior and again, at least in the context of law and choice theory we typically think there is an agent, he has access to information and will think what should I do?
[[start:475148][end:484010]] And he will judge rationally about what is good and what is bad based on a collection of values which are internal to the agent.
[[start:484160][end:485820]] This is not how it works.

08:08 [[start:488030][end:499002]] What I call embodied Motivity is by contrast regimes of normal activity where it is the norms and value that guide the agent's behavior.
[[start:499146][end:501850]] It is embedded in the material and cultural environment.
[[start:501930][end:519190]] So basically the agent projects a specific set of norms and value in the very experienced fitness environment and it will perceive the locus of normativity as the environment and not as a form of internal judgment.

08:41 [[start:521850][end:526502]] Let us look at what can exactly how embedded Motivity work.
[[start:526556][end:528310]] It will be more concrete.
[[start:528650][end:533194]] So first we can materially constrain people to do things.
[[start:533312][end:539862]] So for example, there are roads, you can go off roads but it's harder and you can't really do that if you are a chariot.
[[start:540006][end:565050]] So when you have a specific pattern of roads which is constructed by cities you are pretty much constrained to follow the roads materially and for this we will talk of structural embedding and there is another regimes of mezzanomativity where we build on environments that will basically cue you suggest you into adopting specific norms and specific values.

09:25 [[start:565230][end:575666]] For example, Escape thinks that vertical patterns in archaeological culture they are somehow embedded within what we'd call vertical norms.
[[start:575698][end:584090]] So hierarchy and certification in social relationship and for this specific form of embedding we can talk of semantic embedding.
[[start:585230][end:599130]] What must be very clear is that we don't have structural embedding on one side and semantic embedding there are basically two mechanism, complementary mechanism in which embedded normativity occurs.
[[start:599290][end:611678]] If we look at city so this is impression of sumerian culture city states we have matter organization that prompts specific kind of behavior.
[[start:611774][end:619800]] So for example, we have a bridge and this bridge allow you constrain you to go through the river in a specific way if you are on foot.

10:20 [[start:620250][end:623922]] But these material constraints it is perceivable.
[[start:623986][end:629318]] So by seeing the bridge you will also see that you can navigate the world in this specific way.

10:29 [[start:629484][end:632934]] So you don't have a sparration between semantic and structural embedding.
[[start:632982][end:651482]] We just have two ways in which constraints of our behavior that are embedded in the environment work, and something that is core to the account of embedded non activity is, again, that it is not internal.
[[start:651546][end:661426]] But we need to go into more detail about what we mean by not being internal, because, of course, we're talking about agency agents constrain what agents do.

11:01 [[start:661448][end:668046]] It's not outside what it is is embedded.
[[start:668078][end:674946]] In Motivity is a regime of the multivity where the norms and value, they stem from the experience of Fordance.
[[start:675058][end:684650]] For example, if I see fire I will not think about hey, could I put my hand in it and get my hand burn?
[[start:685550][end:686822]] I think it would be painful.
[[start:686886][end:688074]] I won't do that.

11:28 [[start:688272][end:693040]] If I even think about putting my hand in the fire I will immediately feel bad.

11:33 [[start:693410][end:697200]] The normativity it's embedded in my experience of the world.
[[start:697650][end:706130]] I feel like the fire or more specifically the possibility of putting my hand in the fire is intrinsically bad.
[[start:706200][end:711860]] I do not feel there is a possibility that is neutral and then I judge to be bad.
[[start:712310][end:721794]] But of course this judgment does not occur outside even if I feel like it's about my affordances.

12:01 [[start:721922][end:728040]] It emerges from the engagement I have with the material and cultural niche in which I find myself.
[[start:728970][end:742030]] And if we want to untangle what this means precisely we will have to go into more detail into what I call the externalization internalization of many normativity.
[[start:742370][end:748400]] So let us look at something very simple how normativity work for embodied agents.
[[start:749010][end:761570]] So embodied agents, they do things hopefully in a niche that is material and this niche will be marked by the activity of my agent.

12:41 [[start:761640][end:773814]] And these marks, they can then act as constraints either through structural or cementing embedding in the agent's firmament because they basically signify that in the past I wanted to do that.

12:53 [[start:773852][end:775800]] Maybe doing that is good.
[[start:776330][end:795178]] For example, we have centuries with I don't know if centuries English word but web path if animals that have legs this is actually important walk on a specific path, they will compact the earth and it will become improper to grow anything, even grass.
[[start:795354][end:819430]] And you will have paths that will emerge that are pretty neat, it's pretty visible and that tell you hey, not only this earth is compact and allow you to walk on it without effort but also this has been widely judged to be a good outline for navigation in this specific environment.
[[start:819850][end:835850]] So the very experience of a path basically invites you you perceive the affordance of walking through the path and this is something that again can result from your own activity that can be written into development by your own activity.

13:57 [[start:837070][end:844790]] And so this begs the question of how okay, there exists embedded nomativity but how do we embed nomativity?

14:04 [[start:844870][end:847520]] What is the activity of embedding mativity like?
[[start:848210][end:852118]] And the word I will use for that is externalization.
[[start:852314][end:860994]] We perceive the world because we externalize specific causes of sensation into an imagined objective external world.
[[start:861192][end:865358]] So when we see the path, we see a path.
[[start:865454][end:872726]] We do not see compact earth that we then compute to mean that other things have worked on it.

14:32 [[start:872748][end:874786]] We just see hey, there is a path.
[[start:874978][end:880650]] And this is because we have externalized a specific cognitive kind which is the path.
[[start:881710][end:903578]] And this is argument that several people made here lene Steiner, which if I remember well, worked on the production of devices that help blind people see things through, I believe an array of repetitive device on their shoulder.

15:03 [[start:903754][end:918710]] So the core argument they make is that if you give people that they will start seeing things, they will start perceiving things as being before them rather than having vibration on the shoulder and then thinking about what does it mean.
[[start:918860][end:937050]] And so the basic argument is that perception is just picture of what cause we infer, what is the structure we infer of our environment given the existence of a specific coupling device that relates action to sensation and vice versa.

15:37 [[start:937870][end:943566]] And this critically relies on the internalization of specific.
[[start:943748][end:948186]] We could say a lot of things that I will say priors specific, priors knowledge and perception.
[[start:948378][end:958820]] So me seeing the path as a path relies on me having the prior knowledge that there is such a thing as paths and I should be expecting to see them around.
[[start:959830][end:967658]] And so you have duality of externalization and internalization in the production of embedded mativity.

16:07 [[start:967774][end:982250]] I can only see norms out there if I've internalized integrated a specific apparatus of perception that entails that there are indeed those specific norms that are embedded in those specific affordances.

16:23 [[start:983230][end:989770]] And so this produce a more general question of semantics, particularly of information theory.
[[start:990130][end:994000]] How do reading and writing and reading maturity works?
[[start:995330][end:1010450]] So when I extend lies I treat the world as having specific natural categories that I pretty much imagine and I can use them because I imagine them as an extended memory that allow me to read and write normative cues.
[[start:1010870][end:1014826]] This can be letters, pure signs.
[[start:1014878][end:1019234]] But as far as I'm concerned here, all signs are at least implicitly normative.

16:59 [[start:1019282][end:1021960]] There about how you should interpret the sign.
[[start:1022730][end:1034234]] And this means that we can experience specific landscape of forensics and we can write things out there.

17:14 [[start:1034272][end:1038966]] We can write normative cues, bio behavior that will then constrain further behavior.
[[start:1039078][end:1046670]] But nothing tells us that we can communicate through this.
[[start:1046740][end:1050810]] The communication, it works because of the internalization of prayers.

17:30 [[start:1050890][end:1067122]] If a given community of agents have internalized a specific set of prayers that is, a set of prayers that enable externalization of numerative cues, then only it can use the environment as a way to write and read.
[[start:1067176][end:1072040]] Normative queues as embedded normativity thing.
[[start:1072730][end:1077106]] And this communication, it can be read in terms of information theory.
[[start:1077138][end:1079110]] Of course it can be read in terms of semantics.
[[start:1079190][end:1101166]] But what is critical to analyze that the process of internalization there is no trust system there is no private key that allow you to be sure that the way you internalize norms is very specifically the way in which the Emily Mativity was encouraged to begin with.

18:21 [[start:1101268][end:1112180]] There is a loss, or there is ambiguity, or there is I'd rather say it like this an active demarch of reconstruction, of given prayers by the agent.
[[start:1112710][end:1131318]] And so this gap between the intent of other communicants and my intent, my understanding of what they meant by their active engagement with the world, it builds a tiny gap in information that is somehow enough to drive the open ended evolution of cultural landscape.
[[start:1131494][end:1144350]] And this is something that I do not think is embedded in active in France and I think is of major interest to research, to the research at least in the evolution of open end evolution of cultural landscape.
[[start:1144770][end:1156130]] So to sum up things, I just presented a paper that is called anomaly Motivity and that speaks unsurprisingly of embedded normativity.
[[start:1157350][end:1170786]] First major point is that if active inference is correct, then our notion of agency is dissolved essentially in the notion that we can perceive and enact cognitive landscape.

19:30 [[start:1170898][end:1172600]] Umvelt, if you want.
[[start:1173690][end:1184918]] And given that this is the case, we will experience the norms and value that guide our behavior as a property of the cognitive landscape.
[[start:1184934][end:1194830]] We experience the affordance that we can perceive and this specific regime of normativity I call embedded normativity.
[[start:1195970][end:1200702]] And the third thing is that you have a critical thing going on.
[[start:1200756][end:1231110]] You have a semiotically constraining thing going on in the externalization and internalization of regimes of embedded mativity because those two things they respectively enable embedded Motivity to exist, to have a causal power and they enable also the open ended evolution of the norms that are embedded in a given landscape in a given material landscape and therefore the open end evolution of the asseted, cultural or committee landscape.

20:31 [[start:1231690][end:1233046]] So thank you.
[[start:1233228][end:1243520]] I will enroll my references slides in case someone really needs to know what the reference is and is ready to move around the video for this.
[[start:1244210][end:1245920]] And do you have questions?

20:47 _Daniel:_
[[start:1247570][end:1248174]] Awesome.
[[start:1248292][end:1248686]] Thank you.

20:48 [[start:1248708][end:1257730]] Avel, while people are typing any questions, could you maybe just give a little introduction to the active inference for the Social Sciences course?
[[start:1257800][end:1265334]] Like, what brought you to want to facilitate this effort and where are we at and where do you want it to go?
[[start:1265372][end:1266840]] What do you want it to be for?

21:10 [[start:1270840][end:1272630]] Oh, mute and then continue.

21:16 _Avel:_
[[start:1276280][end:1277076]] Good point.
[[start:1277178][end:1277990]] Thank you.
[[start:1278520][end:1301020]] The Active Inference Institute organizes and kerose Research organize a course on active inference in the social science that is based essentially in explaining the basic demarch, the basic hypothesis and the consequences of the cultural landscape formalism that I hinted at slightly in this presentation.
[[start:1302000][end:1321300]] The goal of the course is to give basic ontology that is an interface between complexity science, let us say physics, written large cognitive science and social science to afford interdisciplinary collaboration in the social science and in the study of the evolution of human societies.
[[start:1321720][end:1325956]] And I think it is cool, but I'm biased because I've missed it.

22:05 [[start:1325978][end:1332150]] So maybe you should ask Daniel, which is absolutely unbiased, whether the course is cool.

22:13 _Daniel:_
[[start:1333340][end:1335176]] I've been enjoying it a lot.
[[start:1335358][end:1339320]] We just finished last week with my section on collective behavior.
[[start:1339900][end:1345100]] First we had the introduction lecture from you, then Ben White on the basics of being an active agent.
[[start:1345250][end:1350776]] And we have Lorena and Mao's sections upcoming, as well as your more dedicated session.

22:30 [[start:1350888][end:1362304]] Yeah, it's been a really fun experience and it's going to provide a really useful missing piece in the ecosystem, I guess.
[[start:1362342][end:1363890]] Just one question.
[[start:1364900][end:1373984]] How do we take some of these topics you're bringing in about the embedded normativities and think about them digitally?
[[start:1374112][end:1387540]] Like, are we talking about conceptual embeddedness in information environments and or are we talking about the ergonomics of sitting at our desk?
[[start:1387620][end:1405920]] Or how do we bring that kind of pleasure path stigma g on the ground into the digital are we talking about something that's embodied and embedded in the information space or are we still talking about bodies?

23:29 _Avel:_
[[start:1409440][end:1415720]] So if we talk about humans, we talk about bodies with the brain that do things in a mature environment.
[[start:1415880][end:1423740]] But your question is I'm not sure understood is how can we bring this specific concept in the study of digital phenomena?
[[start:1423820][end:1424476]] I cannot.
[[start:1424588][end:1426160]] Twitter internet.

23:46 _Daniel:_
[[start:1426660][end:1427696]] Is that it?

23:47 [[start:1427798][end:1428160]] Yeah.

23:48 _Avel:_
[[start:1428230][end:1440848]] Okay, so you have basically the whole study on the affordances, the discipline of design has incorporated a while ago the national affordance in its structure.
[[start:1441024][end:1448340]] And most of the study in the digital design centers are on what platforms afford or do not afford.
[[start:1449000][end:1459452]] And you have richer stance when you take into account not what you can do with a specific interface, but what the specific interface invites you to do.
[[start:1459586][end:1484884]] Given a set of cultural written large, it can be self learning, but given a set of power that you share with the platform in a way that is formal but indirect yes.

24:44 [[start:1484922][end:1490004]] I would look at it in terms of user interface design.

24:50 [[start:1490202][end:1496810]] I think this concept specifically is useful for interface design.
[[start:1498380][end:1505572]] Then you have implicitly the question of the flow that platforms such as, I don't know, twitter.
[[start:1505636][end:1515736]] Facebook how specific structure environments bring specific collective dynamics that may be a bit richer.
[[start:1515928][end:1518108]] Not richer specifically, but that may go in.

25:18 [[start:1518114][end:1530028]] A direction that the user face question do not go into and that can still be modeled in terms of constraints and therefore in terms of embedded normativity.
[[start:1530204][end:1531952]] Is that on point?
[[start:1532006][end:1533270]] We'll go to your question.

25:36 _Daniel:_
[[start:1536280][end:1542992]] Yeah, that's interesting about what the interface does and then what it invites.
[[start:1543056][end:1544730]] It might invite things.
[[start:1546060][end:1551880]] In order for that invitation to be fulfilled, it has to actually provide that possibility.
[[start:1552380][end:1556924]] But it might invite things that aren't relationally possible.
[[start:1557042][end:1564476]] Like there might be a wall which invites climbing to a given observer, yet they cannot climb it.

26:04 [[start:1564658][end:1584244]] And then on the other side is a capacity that isn't invited and that is the adjacent possible of tool use where something that was being used for this purpose, it's like all of a sudden it just fell out of someone's hand.
[[start:1584282][end:1588016]] They grasped it a different way, it invited a different engagement.
[[start:1588048][end:1597450]] And then that can become re entrenched and that points to that sequential making and breaking of new spaces that your work has featured over the last few years.

26:38 _Avel:_
[[start:1598300][end:1599240]] Yes, exactly.
[[start:1599310][end:1612620]] This work has been developed while thinking about tool use, while thinking about cognitive archaeology, while thinking about the experience of cities, the way urbanism prompts specific behavior.

26:53 [[start:1613600][end:1618590]] But if I can get back on the Internet thing, I'd like to make it more specific.
[[start:1619060][end:1623760]] So the interface design, as far as I know is focused on interface.
[[start:1624420][end:1632068]] That is not surprising, but in doing so it is focused on specific fordance and what you can do.
[[start:1632234][end:1637952]] You have another layer in ecological psychology, which is the layer of solicitation.
[[start:1638016][end:1653156]] So, for example, Twitter does something very specific, which is when you log in, it shows you the number of notifications you have, then it removes it and you have to wait to know which were those notification.

27:33 [[start:1653268][end:1658652]] And you have to wait not 1 second, not 1 minute, but a random amount of time.

27:38 [[start:1658786][end:1661704]] So this is what they call dark patterns.
[[start:1661752][end:1667816]] They are patterns in design that are explicitly designed to create addiction.
[[start:1667928][end:1682804]] So this is a layer you can't afford in affordance, because from an affordance perspective there is just a moment you can access the information and then a moment you can't, and then the moment you can again, there is nothing going on.
[[start:1682922][end:1695768]] If you don't look at intrinsic motivation and the way specific structure, environment is perceived, the semantics, maybe the meaning that given landscape has for an agent.

28:15 [[start:1695934][end:1708764]] And even if you look at this, you are still looking at the platform in a way that is embedded from the specific patterns, that specific patterns of things that people do on the platform.
[[start:1708962][end:1726640]] If you have Twitter without the aggressive QRTs and the way to aggressively signal that you are in whatever it is, is going on, you don't have Twitter much, you have Mastodon maybe that has very similar affordances and very dissimilar solicitation.

28:47 [[start:1727460][end:1732356]] So this is why you have to take multiscale account of things.
[[start:1732378][end:1745640]] And when you take multiscale account of things you have to look at the semiotics basically behavior, how specific coordination occur at specific scales around specific communication, specific message passing.
[[start:1746220][end:1767290]] And once you look at how specific message become meaningful to specific agent, you have a problem basically because this is subjective, this is constructed through the activity of the agent and whatever is the range of time you are looking at, you will have the construction of new possibilities of adjustment possibles as you put it.

29:27 [[start:1767900][end:1776720]] And and yeah, this is the big question that I think we are missing at the moment in active inference.

29:38 _Daniel:_
[[start:1778260][end:1778864]] Awesome.
[[start:1778982][end:1780620]] Well, thank you for this presentation.
[[start:1780700][end:1787810]] Thanks for the social sciences work and we're all looking forward to seeing how the projects play out.

29:48 _Avel:_
[[start:1788980][end:1789536]] Thank you.

29:49 [[start:1789558][end:1790428]] Goodbye.

29:50 _Daniel:_
[[start:1790604][end:1791420]] Farewell AVO.
