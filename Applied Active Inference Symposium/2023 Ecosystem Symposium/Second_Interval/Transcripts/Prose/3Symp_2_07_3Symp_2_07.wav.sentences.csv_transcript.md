
00:24 _Daniel:_
[[start:24970][end:25880]] All right.
[[start:27850][end:38082]] The next presentation is with Pablo Fernandez-Maquieira.
[[start:38226][end:40150]] So welcome back, Pablo.

00:41 _Pablo:_
[[start:41050][end:44618]] Hello here.

00:44 _Daniel:_
[[start:44784][end:48730]] Okay, I did take us on an adventure of curiosity.

00:49 _Pablo:_
[[start:49470][end:50182]] Yes.
[[start:50336][end:52766]] I'm going to start sharing my screen.
[[start:52868][end:55440]] Let me know if everything is all right.

00:58 _Daniel:_
[[start:58770][end:61440]] Should be perfect.

01:02 _Pablo:_
[[start:62210][end:62922]] Yes.
[[start:63076][end:63780]] Cool.

01:06 [[start:66150][end:75220]] So this is one of my favorite memes and probably most of you know it.
[[start:76250][end:99286]] This reference is the cave of Platon and to me it was kind of fine treated truth that now with active inference seems like we are closer to demonstrate.
[[start:99318][end:101200]] That how it is.
[[start:101970][end:129814]] So the first time that I start act and surf at the Institute, this was kind of my feeling or my face was looking into something that it was complex, scary and look interesting.

02:10 [[start:130012][end:137880]] So I went why I decided to go through it.

02:21 [[start:141150][end:152160]] I envision a world where people is driving by stronger incentives that motivate them to reduce uncertainty in the systems they are part of.
[[start:153410][end:157710]] My approach is through games which are going to go later.
[[start:157860][end:167358]] But I really on this talk, want to encourage all kinds of persons or people that are curious.
[[start:167454][end:173780]] And I want them to act and get involved in the community.
[[start:174150][end:186694]] Because you may find that for now most of the actors are scientists and very well on reputed people.

03:06 [[start:186892][end:195722]] And you might think that you are not a part of it, but very far away from that.

03:15 [[start:195856][end:196934]] The Institute.
[[start:197062][end:199270]] Encourage the opposite.
[[start:199350][end:209520]] So I'm super glad to have been through this journey and I wanted to share a little bit of my background and then we go to the game.

03:32 [[start:212390][end:214430]] Here is the second and last meme.
[[start:214510][end:218702]] The world you were raised to survive is no longer exist.
[[start:218846][end:233960]] We are on digital revolution and with this digital revolution it comes a bunch of different things that are evolving and hopefully bring us to a better world.
[[start:235610][end:236934]] Okay, who I am?
[[start:237052][end:237894]] I'm Pablo.

03:57 [[start:237942][end:238854]] My name is Pablo.
[[start:238902][end:246890]] But more defined or what best define me is my action and my experiences.

04:13 [[start:253010][end:269090]] I think role gameplays and sports movies are super important and as a kid I was dyslexic and the system didn't fill my necessities.

04:29 [[start:269430][end:272274]] So I really hated school.
[[start:272472][end:278118]] But I love learning and it's something that I've been doing all my life.
[[start:278204][end:292860]] And it's curious how a system that is designed to give you knowledge and to help you with the learning, in my case it didn't work at all.

04:55 [[start:295390][end:299020]] That's a little starting point.
[[start:299630][end:320770]] I believe in the copy transformation and combine of things and on my adulthood everything shifted and I became successful, professional and I love it.
[[start:320840][end:321650]] Teams.
[[start:323590][end:344010]] What I do for a living is product manager and what I do on my pet projects site projects, call it as you want is related to gaming and gamifying organizations and experiences.

05:46 [[start:346510][end:358750]] Nowadays I trust more my intuition which is something that it really was broken during my childhood and you will see a little bit more about that.
[[start:358900][end:361200]] Here are some things of my interest.
[[start:361570][end:383720]] Licenses like open science which is the case of the Institute philosophy that's the first meme education, governance, family, art, love, communication, technology and nature and a bunch of other things that I will be happy to share any other time.
[[start:385210][end:395850]] One of the questions that Daniel asked me for this talk is what was exciting for me about all this, what right?
[[start:395920][end:414594]] And for me, when I give talks, I like to share a view of the last hundred years and the Industrial revolution and how the ones that were on this world before us did something right.

06:54 [[start:414792][end:427270]] I'm sure that we all know big mistakes or big things that have failed or that could be better through iterations.
[[start:427610][end:435160]] But on data it's very promising and very good.
[[start:435770][end:463540]] I think it's inspiring to have the basic education, how it grows, the vaccination, what it did for us, democracy and how poverty dropped draxily, how literacy it grew and because all these things, child mortality just went very low.

07:45 [[start:465670][end:472610]] So basically the future of education is what makes me be excited.

07:55 [[start:475430][end:477858]] How I ended up on this ecosystem.
[[start:478034][end:485654]] It's super random and I'm going to explain it in hopefully two to five minutes.
[[start:485852][end:491500]] I as a product manager and very interested on technology.
[[start:491950][end:499850]] I heard about Blockchains back in 2015 and I didn't understood anything at all.
[[start:500000][end:509934]] And then back in 2017 I heard about a I didn't start them, did not play that game.

08:30 [[start:510052][end:521410]] But it was raising a fun thing to consider, which is digital assets and ownership of those digital assets.
[[start:522790][end:542410]] For now, we didn't have a technology that could scale and that was good enough to ensure that the digital assets that you own were you yours and you had the freedom of transaction on them.

09:02 [[start:542560][end:554910]] I did understand that very fast and because I'm a game player and as a game player you always have your different assets and do things with them.
[[start:554980][end:566206]] And as well, I have been collecting music and all kind of digital assets.
[[start:566398][end:576710]] I bought this very famous collection of punks and sold them very fast before I could be a millionaire.

09:37 [[start:577610][end:582038]] But due to in 2021 I decided that I wanted to build something.
[[start:582204][end:596342]] And then back then I went through this beautiful project that was the first art saw on Ethereum, which one of the artists it was Daniel Friedman.
[[start:596486][end:631638]] So I, as a curious person and person that has been working with artists, I always like to know what is the driver of those artists, what they do, and try to get in their walls, to understand better and to get as much information as I can before I decide to encourage or collect or just always deeper on music or art.

10:31 [[start:631724][end:636150]] For me, is very nice thing to do.
[[start:636300][end:643818]] So I discovered these cards and education was one of them.

10:43 [[start:643904][end:653790]] And I went through Flickr which is where it was the first at least that I found place where it was.
[[start:653860][end:654874]] And the license.
[[start:654922][end:678150]] It was Creative Commons license of not commercial use but it was an open license which I been part of Creative Commons community for a very long time since I was working with musicians and I think it's one of the best things that happened to the internet.
[[start:680010][end:686742]] These are some of the pragmatic things that the audience cares about.
[[start:686876][end:692010]] Hopefully we will have some of these on our games.

11:33 [[start:693870][end:696460]] AI for sure is going to be there.

11:38 [[start:698510][end:709690]] Free energy principle is going to be one of the things that hopefully we help to minimize and to make it funnier.
[[start:709770][end:716100]] Games or happier games and games that help organizations to be better.
[[start:717350][end:721122]] The human factor, it's super important for me.
[[start:721176][end:729494]] And implementation and action I learned by doing and it's one of the values that the Institute encouraged more.
[[start:729612][end:738140]] So I just jump on things and try to understand them through doing and sharing as I'm doing now.

12:19 [[start:739470][end:748154]] Here are the epistemics and collective is one of them that I'm as well.
[[start:748352][end:778978]] Super interest agents, of course, practical and curiosity which is the adventure that I have the feeling that I'm being involved all my life and that I encourage always my two girls to be curious and to open things and look behind the doors and just be an active.

12:59 [[start:779154][end:787000]] Here are some values that I like to point which are exploration, the culture of curiosity that I did mention a lot.
[[start:788830][end:794538]] Continuous learning because that experience on the school.
[[start:794624][end:805150]] I think I just keep going and keep going and it's something that sometimes bad experiences could turn out in good habits.

13:26 [[start:806290][end:809360]] Learning by doing, as I already told.
[[start:811010][end:813246]] Integrity and inclusivity.
[[start:813358][end:818194]] Honesty, accountability, a big one.
[[start:818392][end:821540]] Trying to be professional on everything that you do.
[[start:822790][end:826022]] For me, I started as human being.

13:46 [[start:826076][end:835590]] Curious people of all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome to the Institute.
[[start:837530][end:847770]] I would be very happy to be the link and to speak with someone that has doubts or if I couldn't help.

14:07 [[start:847840][end:850650]] I think I could help on the very early stage.
[[start:851490][end:855230]] If you're not very technical person, I think I could help.
[[start:855300][end:861214]] There we are learning by doing.

14:21 [[start:861332][end:879560]] I would love to everyone that's on the stream, I'm going to share this link which is a new game that we are testing and I'm excited to share it with you.
[[start:881210][end:885714]] It's the adventure of Curiosity and here Daniel.
[[start:885762][end:891180]] I'm going to copy and paste the link.
[[start:893070][end:894154]] It would be awesome.

14:54 _Daniel:_
[[start:894272][end:894602]] Okay.

14:54 [[start:894656][end:896582]] There's a tiny typo on your slides.
[[start:896646][end:898730]] It just ends with a curiosity.

15:00 _Pablo:_
[[start:900370][end:901070]] Thank you.

15:01 _Daniel:_
[[start:901140][end:905230]] But I'm going to paste it into the YouTube live chat.

15:06 _Pablo:_
[[start:906450][end:908062]] Okay, thank you.

15:08 [[start:908196][end:910714]] Yeah, I told you I'm a Dyslexic.
[[start:910762][end:914834]] I have all kind of titles throughout my life.
[[start:915032][end:916226]] Sorry for that.
[[start:916248][end:923650]] I always try to improve share the.

15:23 _Daniel:_
[[start:923800][end:926774]] Yeah, I put it in the YouTube chat so people can head over there.

15:26 [[start:926812][end:927382]] All right, yeah.
[[start:927436][end:928854]] Could you tell us about this platform?
[[start:928972][end:931240]] And this is the first active game?

15:32 _Pablo:_
[[start:932650][end:953566]] Yes, we started thinking on how to do game a while ago and we decided to go with this picture that explains how it works.
[[start:953668][end:968340]] Actually it's simple and you have four pieces, the internal state, external state, and in the middle you have the sensory state and the active state.

16:08 [[start:968710][end:972334]] So here is the mission.
[[start:972382][end:984040]] You have some instructions that you can read and would be fun if you go through them and you can go either way.
[[start:984490][end:1009600]] And here we are going to go through the sensory state where you're going to listen to a music where some notes you can censor that are not in the famous song for Elise.

16:51 [[start:1011700][end:1032730]] So you have to take notes and you can go and you can see that we are on the Markov blanket which saw everything very delineate as Dali would paint it.
[[start:1033420][end:1067110]] And here is your active part of the game where you have to do something which is add the different notes that your professor, music professor is telling you don't miss because you probably on the external state are trying to play the music.
[[start:1067480][end:1088360]] So you have to infer that you are missing some notes and go to the active state and start walking through the right node.

18:09 [[start:1089020][end:1098350]] If I miss the node, I just follow into the nothing and come back into my internal state.
[[start:1098880][end:1104930]] So probably would have to go back and sensor again.

18:27 [[start:1107380][end:1118576]] And once I take the right actions and the right nodes, I can go and solve the puzzle.
[[start:1118768][end:1139996]] And the idea here is to have a tool, gaming tool to explain so you can experience how this active inference on free energy works.
[[start:1140178][end:1166752]] And once you go to the end of that adventure, which I'm not going to finish because it's something that players should do, you're going to have a door where you have to put the sequence in low case of what were the missing notes.

19:26 [[start:1166896][end:1185832]] And it's going to allow you to come inside the treasure room where you will have feedback, feedback that you can send us and we will be very happy to have it.
[[start:1185966][end:1193832]] And then if you have a wallet, you will be able to have digital asset.

19:53 [[start:1193976][end:1206080]] If not, we will add information to help people to go from web two to web three and to get those digital assets.
[[start:1206820][end:1217190]] And here to be developed would be future adventures that I would be very happy to do.
[[start:1218680][end:1229370]] So this was pretty much the presentation and hopefully we have new players in the coming days.

20:30 [[start:1230460][end:1232072]] Hope you have fun.
[[start:1232206][end:1265460]] And I really encourage anyone to discover and play with all these ideas and thoughts and experiments and feelings that I have the gut feeling that are going to revolutionize how we understand the world and how we can improve in it by reducing uncertainty.

21:06 [[start:1266040][end:1275476]] So thank you and I don't know, Daniel, if you have any comments or something in this last ten minutes.

21:15 _Daniel:_
[[start:1275658][end:1278424]] Oh, yeah, we can definitely talk for a few minutes.
[[start:1278542][end:1283656]] I'm seeing many fun comments and questions in the chat so people can post it.
[[start:1283678][end:1288330]] Yeah, the gameplay is smoother on even a normal computer.
[[start:1288940][end:1294510]] It may look choppy on the live stream, but it's quite a nice playing experience.

21:35 [[start:1295040][end:1302848]] Maybe just a little context like how did you get into building these worlds or what kind of tools are these?
[[start:1303014][end:1309932]] And we obviously don't see them in today's mainstream educational and research offerings.
[[start:1309996][end:1320950]] But what could that even be to bring together this kind of immersion and role playing with education research?

22:03 _Pablo:_
[[start:1323400][end:1338440]] Yes, I we playing role games and role games you have very diverse kind of players.
[[start:1338880][end:1360640]] So I was playing with guys like me, had a struggle through the school and guys that end up being researchers like yourself because they were very good in those environments.

22:42 [[start:1362980][end:1376240]] For me, it was like we are sharing a lot of cognitive values and information and they are really having fun with me.
[[start:1376410][end:1388440]] So what the academia is telling me is not what I'm feeling outside academia.

23:08 [[start:1388880][end:1411776]] So that through the years it became more and more clear that was one of the drivers to have a very diverse kind of friends and that one of the most important things for me to learn.
[[start:1411878][end:1426550]] It was having fun and to be a good professional, I have to be enjoying what I'm doing and to enjoy what I do, it has to have that gamify feeling of it.
[[start:1428060][end:1453952]] In 2021, I just went straight to explore that road because Blockchains, what can do is have a persistent sea of objects and attributions to those objects and to those wallets that you can add and build on top of them.

24:14 [[start:1454086][end:1465220]] It's like having a huge database for a game purpose and then you figure out that a game is kind of our organization.
[[start:1465560][end:1482650]] So you need rules, you need to share values, you need to have what we are building now, which is the cecian cedo which you agree with the players, what's going to be about and how it's going to work.
[[start:1483100][end:1512848]] And we are building this fantastic storytelling of how kind of world where it was in the early 20s compared to what's happening now in this imaginary world that's complementary to what's happening in real life.
[[start:1513014][end:1518164]] And we are just exploring those areas for three years.

25:18 [[start:1518362][end:1527380]] And once I got into the Institute, we started serving these ideas.

25:27 [[start:1527460][end:1535530]] You send us to do a system thinking course that it was super cool.
[[start:1536860][end:1553820]] We explore and learn and this document that I can share, it was very important for us to understand and we find out the necessity to be able to compute what we are doing.
[[start:1553890][end:1576356]] So we start focusing more on ontology on all the bricks that you need to understand to build the skeleton of something that could last for decades, which is the idea.
[[start:1576458][end:1590590]] And we are trying to build it so everyone can copy, paste, fork it and do whatever they want with the game, adapt it to their own organizations and use it on their favor.

26:31 [[start:1591200][end:1594670]] And we are just exploring and having fun.

26:37 _Daniel:_
[[start:1597840][end:1598572]] That's awesome.
[[start:1598626][end:1602832]] And there's so many pieces there.
[[start:1602886][end:1620000]] It's true about the fun and the curiosity, those intrinsic motivations like being 6 hours deep into counting ants in the desert or 5000 pipette pushes deep or whatever it is in the trenches and in the last mile.
[[start:1620080][end:1626580]] And it can be easy to lose sight.
[[start:1627260][end:1659036]] But when we lose sight and when we put out the fire and the spark, it's a cold, dark night, and no career or status or extrinsic valuation is going to provide simply the joy and the deeper meaning of to two people going on a little adventure running around this space, being inside active inference rather than active inference.

27:39 [[start:1659068][end:1666996]] Being like this high speed train that's leaving anyone behind or you're on the outside and it's taking these twists and turns and you're getting thrown off.
[[start:1667098][end:1686024]] It's like it is cool and air conditioned in this space and people play and watch a lot of games where they wield violent arms and not even like saying whether that's good or bad.
[[start:1686062][end:1700456]] It's just it is a genre to want to have a camera either in a character's head first person perspective or a camera in a second or a third person perspective, which you can switch between here and those kinds.
[[start:1700488][end:1724432]] Of topics about egocentric versus allocentric navigation and our ability to have a perspective swap on ourself and be able to take that kind of like out of body situational awareness in real spatial settings and just to be able to cruise through this space and it's like, yeah, there's no right way to boomerang.

28:44 [[start:1724576][end:1726524]] You could go from external to sensory.

28:46 [[start:1726592][end:1728010]] You could go here or there.

28:51 [[start:1731180][end:1738330]] It's an appetizer and a fertilization that we've really just never seen.

29:01 _Pablo:_
[[start:1741920][end:1743180]] Okay, yeah.
[[start:1743250][end:1746110]] Thank you very much, Daniel, for this.

29:08 _Daniel:_
[[start:1748240][end:1750460]] Any last thoughts or comments?

29:11 _Pablo:_
[[start:1751520][end:1758400]] No, just enjoy while we are here, which is, I think, our mission.
[[start:1760260][end:1761024]] All right.

29:21 _Daniel:_
[[start:1761142][end:1762332]] Thank you, Pablo.
[[start:1762476][end:1775890]] I'm sure everyone's going to really enjoy this and let's also, of course, continue to develop these games and continue to offer these on ramps and have times where we're meeting up in these spaces and playing around.

29:37 _Pablo:_
[[start:1777740][end:1778392]] Thank you.
[[start:1778446][end:1779636]] All right, bye.

29:39 _Daniel:_
[[start:1779748][end:1780600]] Farewell.

29:46 _Pablo:_
[[start:1786320][end:1787230]] All right.

29:52 _Daniel:_
[[start:1792800][end:1793992]] Welcome, Mahault.
[[start:1794136][end:1795050]] This will be the.
