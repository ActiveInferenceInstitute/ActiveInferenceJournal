5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,279
welcome Raf

6
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:21,439
also co-author on the paper

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,480
so how are you

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,560
doing uh I'm good what about

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,439
you pretty good other than this brief

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,560
interval of white light I'm just hanging

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,280
out fantastic so I'm trying to figure

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,320
out here how I can uh I'm using a

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,399
different uh slide sofware so I need to

14
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:45,600
uh make sure that I can pull this up in

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,320
the right way so give me just a quick

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,399
second yeah

17
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,160
great cool so just just to um read off

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,440
what's coming while you figure that um

19
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,480
out so right now we have RF calman

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,399
and this presentation is going to be

21
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,640
Gaia an ACM powered Network for

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,680
planetary scale sense making following

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,840
this 30-minute presentation we'll have a

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,920
GW and Caro on embedded normativity that

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,400
looks perfect that's

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,360
perfect awesome all right thanks Ral to

27
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,360
you thank you all right I I was gonna

28
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,200
try to see if I could upload this up to

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,840
full screen but I I I got it I I got it

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,840
on the

31
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,560
Stream

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,680
looks good on the stream go for it cool

33
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,439
so I'm just pulling up my notes here all

34
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,280
right so uh let me just test that this

35
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,000
moves did I just move the

36
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,759
slide great cool all right so uh as I

37
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,280
said hi everyone it's a huge pleasure to

38
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,399
be here and thank you so much to Daniel

39
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,880
and everybody else at The Institute for

40
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,280
organizing this I'm going to talk about

41
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,880
what I think is the single most

42
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,880
important application of active inance

43
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,399
not as a detriment to the others but

44
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,920
it's sort of Upstream of everything else

45
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,598
and that is how do the eight billion of

46
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,520
us humans make sense of what's going on

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,239
in our planet and all scales and how do

48
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,879
we use that understanding to survive as

49
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,959
a

50
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:21,720
species so this presentation here is a a

51
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,319
bit of a technical presentation and uh

52
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,400
it has a lot of content it's going to

53
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,959
move pretty fast and assume that you're

54
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,360
familiar with some Concepts but but I'm

55
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,560
going to try to leave time for Q&A at

56
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,680
the end so first of all I'm going to

57
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,319
talk about the motivation behind what

58
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,000
we're doing uh in particular the

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,640
concepts of the meta crisis and the

60
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,879
third attractor then I'll give an

61
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,959
overview of our Network architecture and

62
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,720
the application so far and cover the

63
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,920
many remaining challenges and last but

64
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,879
not least I plan to convince you that

65
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,319
this is the single most important thing

66
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,040
you could ever be working on and I'm

67
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,200
doing this because we need your help so

68
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,760
that's a taser of what we have and uh so

69
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,120
as I said let's jump right into it with

70
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,920
the motivation and what greater

71
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,239
motivation could there be um if you

72
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,239
haven't heard of the metac crisis uh

73
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,360
it's a term that it's originally from

74
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,799
Doctor Who but it was Borrowed by uh

75
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:18,200
thinker called Daniel schenberg to talk

76
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,519
about the total risk for Humanity and

77
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,640
the biosphere that is posed by the

78
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,400
combination of three factors the first

79
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,319
being the increasing interconnectedness

80
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,040
of everything from climate to food

81
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
security to National Security to

82
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,360
biodiversity and everything in between

83
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,360
the second being the the risk associated

84
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,560
with self-evolving technology including

85
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,799
runaway artificial intelligence and the

86
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,280
third being the increasing uh Omni

87
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,959
presence of coordination failures

88
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:50,599
personified as the the god of

89
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:53,400
coordination failures molok and so the

90
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,439
combination of these three factors as

91
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,720
hypothesized by schenberg will lead to

92
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,519
either one of of two attractors one of

93
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,480
them being chaotic breakdown of uh all

94
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,439
structure and the second being a

95
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:09,040
reversal to oppressive authoritarian

96
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,000
control and obviously both of those

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,360
qualify as bad in my book I assume in

98
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,560
yours as well so the question of course

99
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,358
is can we actually find a third

100
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,320
attractor that is positive sum as

101
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,639
opposed to negative sum and rather the

102
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:28,800
question is can we design it so what I

103
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,240
claim and what we as the the guy

104
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,400
Consortium claim is that yes we can uh

105
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,199
and we can design this attractor and

106
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,600
it's the design goal is basically to

107
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,759
build resilience and uh uh stabilization

108
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,880
into our biooo economic system and to do

109
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,000
this subject to multi-level system

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,520
constraints like the planetary

111
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,160
boundaries uh desirability meaning it

112
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,639
has to be something that people actually

113
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,240
want so they will help it happen uh so

114
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,720
it needs to preserve standards of living

115
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,400
and so on and it needs to be feasible it

116
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,360
needs to be achievable from our current

117
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,919
initial conditions and of course there's

118
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,600
a lot of design complicators in the mix

119
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,360
uh some of which uh partial observation

120
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,080
there's lots of information symmetry

121
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,960
going on uh there's a lot of uncertainty

122
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,360
about how the pieces of the world system

123
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,400
work from a scientific perspective

124
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,039
there's obvious computability

125
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,120
constraints Associated to this and last

126
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,280
but not least uh you can't really

127
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,319
control what happens in most cases we

128
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:32,000
can only create incentives

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,560
recommendations and

130
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,440
nudges

131
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,479
so uh easy right of course it's not easy

132
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,759
but we think we can do it if we apply

133
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,759
the the sum of the principles from

134
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,400
cybernetics that you already know and

135
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,560
apply them in a

136
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,039
decentralized uh positive sum composable

137
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,080
way so uh what we're talking about here

138
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,080
is uh decentralized Network a

139
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,720
decentralized hybrid AI human Network

140
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,240
for plantary scale decision support and

141
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,000
automation uh it features uh it

142
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,880
recognizes that we will have human and

143
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,960
artificial agents interacting by the

144
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,360
billions in an open network it uh its

145
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,120
goal is to facilitate both consilience

146
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,120
or model alignment and coherence or goal

147
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,840
alignment at multiple level or scales up

148
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,919
to the global scale meaning the survival

149
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,039
of the system as a whole uh it will need

150
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,440
to feature builtin incentives and

151
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,240
governance and it will need to be priv

152
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,840
privacy preserving intrinsically so uh

153
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,039
the below listed participants are

154
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,000
participants founders of the of the

155
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,840
Consortium I'm going to talk about it

156
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,080
later but so this is the framing this is

157
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,840
the motivation for what we're doing and

158
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,240
uh and now I'm going to give a whirlwind

159
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,560
tour of the architecture so far and I'm

160
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,919
going to cover mostly what uh we've

161
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:56,960
built uh the the version of this

162
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,120
architecture that we've built so far uh

163
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,479
think about this explicitly and then I'm

164
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:03,000
going to talk about how this connects to

165
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,560
other architectures that already exist

166
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,560
in the world just very briefly so we've

167
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,120
been uh framing this as uh an

168
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,360
architecture for building decentralized

169
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,720
digital twins uh which are local models

170
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,240
of real world systems that run in

171
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,639
network uh and the the role that such

172
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,680
digital Twins play is that they help us

173
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,080
understand the cost and benefits of

174
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,560
strategies and projects that happen in

175
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,960
the real world and we in in our

176
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,319
organization digital Gaia we started out

177
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,199
caring primarily about agroecology so

178
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,840
how do you actually make better

179
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,720
decisions uh meaning better

180
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,280
recommendations negotiations valuations

181
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,599
investments into a farm into a forest

182
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:51,360
into uh uh bio landscape to make it uh

183
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,720
better to make it more likely to to

184
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,879
survive and

185
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,800
thrive so uh as uh practical

186
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,919
implementation

187
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,360
uh it needs to tackle several real world

188
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,400
challenges first of all uh it needs to

189
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,319
handle distributed non-iid data uh data

190
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:12,000
is sparse it's heterogeneous it's

191
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,919
private it's potentially

192
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,080
unreliable uh it needs to enable

193
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,960
localized collaborative forecasting and

194
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,280
planning personalized planning and

195
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,240
privacy preserving it needs to uh accept

196
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,599
the fact that it won't be able to

197
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,919
directly control but only recommended

198
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,000
nudge as we disced

199
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,080
test uh and uh the outline of what we

200
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,039
came up with is this concept of the guy

201
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,880
Network which is a mesh of AI agents

202
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,000
called natural entities or ends for

203
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,919
short that act as proxies for Real World

204
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,080
Systems um each end runs on an engine

205
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,279
called fangorn which it uses to inquire

206
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,600
learn plan and allocate resources and

207
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,240
ANS communicate in a language called the

208
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,279
guy

209
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,880
protocol they they use this language to

210
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,040
independ ly interact with their

211
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,839
environments and each other and if we do

212
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:04,680
this right I I'll show a bit more on

213
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,360
this later but if we do this right the

214
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,320
guy networks Behavior approximates a

215
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,079
single composite agent that handles uh

216
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:14,839
that interacts with and couples with its

217
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:16,720
Global in

218
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,480
F cool so um just to give you an

219
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,000
overview of how this works behind under

220
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,880
the hood the fangor engine is really the

221
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,040
heart of our AR architecture and the

222
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,640
core Loop uh that is mentioned here is a

223
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,880
typical active Insurance Loop but uh to

224
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,600
make this work in very heterogeneous and

225
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,680
distributed context there's lots of work

226
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,040
involved so some just some highlights

227
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,959
that I think are going to be

228
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,320
particularly interesting for this crowd

229
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,760
uh first of all so as I said this first

230
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,680
the same core engine needs to be able to

231
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,360
work for very heterogeneous context so

232
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,399
each agent has access to a library of

233
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:53,959
generative models and these models are

234
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,320
specified using a python based uh prog

235
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,160
probabilistic programming DSL and they

236
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,680
declare what contexts they appropriate

237
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,120
for using a shared ontology uh using

238
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,000
that ontology fangor can then select the

239
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,720
most appropriate model to use online

240
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,560
given the configurations like project

241
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,200
configurations and the kinds of

242
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,720
observational data available so using

243
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,959
the model using model that's appropriate

244
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:19,360
for uh for a farm or for a forest what

245
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,680
kind of farm what kind of forest what

246
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,560
kind of ecosystem what kind of of um you

247
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,279
know context energy project um and I'm

248
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:30,160
going to get into the examples right now

249
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,399
because there's more more on the

250
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:35,040
applications later on so uh we end up

251
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,000
with a network of heterogeneous agents

252
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,560
but that's okay they actually form a a

253
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,200
single model in a formal sense because

254
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,120
they're all connected

255
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,000
hierarchically uh by a system of of

256
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,360
hyperpriors and uh this means that

257
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,120
fangor needs to support inference of

258
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,800
generic hierarchal generative models and

259
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,720
we actually do this automatically using

260
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,519
approximate posteriors with structural

261
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:03,399
constraints um and so we have this

262
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:05,360
Global model that connects all the nodes

263
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,839
and describes General facts that apply

264
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,839
over multiple contexts and this means

265
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,440
the whole network needs to jointly

266
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,480
perform inference over this Global model

267
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,519
using a peer-to-peer or Federated

268
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,880
algorithm so initially the way this

269
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,600
works initially uh the network sets the

270
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,519
global posterior to be the same as the

271
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,600
global prior each node then

272
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,959
independently performs local

273
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,600
optimization of the variation of free

274
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,200
energy and then passes the parameters of

275
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,920
the new Global solution to the peers in

276
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,920
the network where they use it as a hyper

277
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,120
prior and this works uh over a broad

278
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,959
range of topologies and under pretty

279
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,200
General constraints and by the way I'd

280
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,320
love to I'd like to mention that uh

281
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
there's a lot of overlap and interaction

282
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,360
between the stuff that I'm talking about

283
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,880
here and some of the other presentations

284
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,680
that you're seeing today and I I wasn't

285
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,320
able to reference them explicitly in

286
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,480
this talk but I I'm sure you guys are

287
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,959
going to see the

288
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:02,120
connections cool so um what it turns out

289
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,200
is that the shared parameters that

290
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,920
represent our Global model are

291
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,000
effectively stored by the network stored

292
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,920
in a Federated parameter store meaning

293
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,399
that each node stores their own local

294
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,079
parameters their private stuff about

295
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:17,320
their own local context and multiple

296
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,519
nodes store copies of the global

297
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:23,480
parameters and uh this architecture

298
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,920
because it supports heterogeneous uh

299
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,959
local models it actually allows us to

300
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,560
introduce another kind nodes which we

301
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,240
call ant mot nodes these are nodes that

302
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,720
aggregate scientific and empirical

303
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,880
information using a matter analysis

304
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,760
model and uh we actually uh are able to

305
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,000
use that M analysis model to constraint

306
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,920
our constraint our project level models

307
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,360
or end using quote unquote imported

308
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,120
knowledge that wasn't directly observed

309
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,880
by them which is left to right in this

310
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,000
picture but this actually also goes to

311
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,199
ways so empirical findings from the

312
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:57,160
projects what actually works on the

313
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,279
ground for this particular project also

314
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,240
informs the end moves posteriors which

315
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,680
is the right to left and so we actually

316
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,920
have a complete uh cycle of of Science

317
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,880
and empirics all implemented using

318
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,720
hierarchical active

319
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,040
entrance so finally uh just uh among the

320
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,120
global parameters that Network learns by

321
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,160
Federated inference are the precisions

322
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
associated with data coming from the

323
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,120
different data providers and this gives

324
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,360
each node a way to consume data without

325
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,279
trusted ground truth and basically to

326
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,639
learn together which sources they can

327
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,320
rely on for what uh this is just uh some

328
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,880
of more core features we're working on

329
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,440
integrating many other capabilities into

330
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,120
this architecture not going to go

331
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,000
through all of this uh but basically

332
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,600
what what we're finding is that we have

333
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,160
all the building blocks to turn this

334
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,079
into a full feature decision Network

335
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,120
complete with its own internal knowledge

336
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,480
economy meaning that contributors uh

337
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,639
contributions get attributed and

338
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:58,399
rewarded in proportion to the to the

339
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,000
free free energy reduction that they

340
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,800
afford cool so uh jumping into

341
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,240
applications uh as I mentioned our main

342
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,079
focus as as an or organization has been

343
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:13,199
on modeling agroecological projects like

344
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,800
regenerative agriculture and Agro

345
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,920
forestry and this exercise is all the

346
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,440
constraints that we talked about so far

347
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,000
so uh again I'm not going to go into

348
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,440
full detail but to give an overview of

349
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,279
what is the anatomy of a gentic model

350
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,920
for a farm or Forest so started the

351
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,680
right with observables that are things

352
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,000
that we can measure about that ecosystem

353
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,880
about that that local context like the

354
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,320
plant counts and size vegetation indices

355
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,959
from satellite data and so on these are

356
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:44,199
are linked to latent states which form a

357
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:45,720
nonlinear dynamical system that's

358
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,639
parameterized by uh the policy the the

359
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,360
the things that modulate the the latent

360
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,800
States um like agricultural

361
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,199
interventions and practices you can

362
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,720
think of the timing of planting at home

363
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,040
harvesting what kinds of crops or trees

364
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,639
get planted what products like

365
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,720
pesticides get applied or not and more

366
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,079
uh as well as covariates so external

367
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,800
events like weather physical risks

368
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,680
Wildfire drought and so on um and so

369
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,639
there's uh some scientific and

370
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,000
measurement parameters uh that that go

371
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,519
into this as well things like uh the

372
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,959
effect sizes of the various actions and

373
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,519
covariants and these local parameters

374
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,160
are conditionally dependent on a set of

375
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,000
global global parameters which as we

376
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,079
discussed they they link information

377
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:34,880
between different ends and different

378
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,440
sources of

379
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,839
knowledge um uh and uh so these same

380
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,880
Global parameters are used in the M

381
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,000
analysis model and they actually

382
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,399
establish the link between what happened

383
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:47,560
what is found to happen on the ground

384
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,040
and what is reported in the

385
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,880
literature um and so I'm not going to go

386
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,199
into this because I I think I'm going to

387
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,360
uh run a bit long but basically the

388
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,040
concept is is that we have these project

389
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,639
nodes that correspond to to many farms

390
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:05,560
and they're each on Independent nodes in

391
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,079
the network they're also connected to

392
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:10,639
this common meta analysis model and uh

393
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,279
together all of these uh together these

394
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,600
nodes they incorporate uh academic

395
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,720
studies expert knowledge and uh locally

396
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,920
relevant context they do so privately so

397
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,680
only processing the local data locally

398
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,440
and uh through this parameter sharing

399
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,360
they actually jointly uh and iteratively

400
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,040
estimate the the global posterior uh in

401
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,079
a cycle forever for as long as there is

402
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,720
new data uh about the project as long as

403
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,319
there's new studies and new expert

404
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:41,720
knowledges so so all of this is

405
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,440
happening basically in in an online way

406
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,000
and again the topology can vary but the

407
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,440
principles uh remain the same so just to

408
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,759
to see you show a little bit of how how

409
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,920
uh this works this is just two EPO of

410
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,720
the the the posterior the global

411
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,120
posteriors and this is just location and

412
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,000
scale for for two uh parameters uh the

413
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,599
slope and The Intercept of the

414
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,799
relationship between uh a vegetation

415
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,160
index and the tree biomass in one given

416
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,599
Hector of forest and as you can see this

417
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,199
this converges pretty pretty quickly

418
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,599
it's comparable to to local local only

419
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,559
methods um and just to highlight how

420
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:26,119
this can be used to to or also the

421
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,640
limits of how this can be used to

422
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,440
estimate uh Source reliability uh here's

423
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,200
a really successful example at the left

424
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,720
it's pretty pretty straightforward to

425
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,600
use this to estimate reliability of of

426
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,600
uh satellite data and for other cases

427
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,000
like very local very uh context specific

428
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,559
data you actually need more data or more

429
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:49,160
data from more independent sources that

430
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,280
we had in this demo

431
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,600
here um uh

432
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,320
another very useful use case of this is

433
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,720
as we discussed we don't have Direct

434
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,480
Control over what happens at a form we

435
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,600
can only recommend and nudge often we

436
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,320
also like we we get there a node gets

437
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,880
sued up a net gets stood up for an

438
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,200
existing project that has already

439
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,320
happened and we want to find out uh what

440
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,640
actions were taken in the past and the

441
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,480
same uh the same generative model can be

442
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,280
used to

443
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,720
estimate uh what happened in the past

444
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,640
and the example it infers uh when

445
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,200
planting started and when harvests

446
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,039
started for for different

447
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,080
fields um so uh bringing it all together

448
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,360
one of the applications that we've been

449
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,360
using we' working on uh it actually uses

450
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,360
all this Machinery together to validate

451
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,480
claims about projects performance and to

452
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,159
estimate future performance we've

453
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:43,480
deployed this uh in real world projects

454
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,360
uh this one this the examples here you

455
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,080
see in this photo are by are relevant to

456
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,600
Agro forestry fors in Colombia and uh we

457
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,440
found that this actually helps the

458
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,960
project developers and their funders to

459
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,840
come to a shared understanding of how

460
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,200
successful the project is how much it's

461
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,240
worth in terms of its impact and its

462
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,720
fundability whether it should be scaled

463
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,400
up or or uh needs to change course uh

464
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,280
what is the quality of the strategy

465
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,919
versus other potential strategies for

466
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,159
natural regeneration and so on so uh

467
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:17,240
it's actually useful on the ground for

468
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,120
decision- making in this context cool so

469
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,320
finally uh I want to talk about the end

470
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,159
State and uh uh going back to our

471
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:28,360
original motivation of solving

472
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,600
everything I forgive you for thinking

473
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,919
this is nice but hey we're we've been

474
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:35,440
kind of in this uh down downward spiral

475
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,679
towards the meta crisis for a long time

476
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,400
and what you're telling me doesn't even

477
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,080
come close to solving everything and

478
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,960
you're right uh there's a lot of of

479
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,679
moving pieces that need to be built and

480
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,799
connected but here's the good news um we

481
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,039
can do this uh there's no Mi mystery

482
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,200
here and we don't need per Perfection I

483
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,400
love this quote from Edward F Brook that

484
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,760
says that to define a policy we don't

485
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,320
need it exact empirical measures or

486
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,760
optimality if one jumps from an airplane

487
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,520
it may be nice to have an altimeter but

488
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,360
what one really needs is a parachute so

489
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,000
there is uh only so much that we can get

490
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,760
in terms of dimensioning returns what we

491
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,320
should be really focusing on is uh

492
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,880
creating and refining Solutions

493
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,080
everywhere and connecting them

494
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,520
everywhere um and you might be thinking

495
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,039
about how does this actually scale to

496
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,760
Global goals and how does this actually

497
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,039
get used uh for uh scalably uh building

498
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:32,679
into the the fabric of decisions in our

499
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:35,679
in our society uh so about scaling to

500
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,120
Global goals uh I again won't be able to

501
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,159
get into the details but maybe Connor

502
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,679
mentioned this in his presentation

503
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,080
earlier uh we have actually some proof

504
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,919
of Concepts that we can actually build

505
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:49,919
active agents that that are made of

506
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,679
active active agents so we've shown in

507
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:55,039
this paper here that a collective of

508
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,159
interacting AC agents uh is able to

509
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,320
perform approximate inference at The

510
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,400
Ensemble level and that this further

511
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,559
that this happens through specific

512
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:10,080
mechanisms that are mediated by uh by

513
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,000
cognitive cap capabilities like theory

514
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,240
of mind and goal alignment they they

515
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,480
work together to improve Collective

516
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,480
performance by eliminating ambiguity and

517
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,039
through act actively exploiting

518
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,279
diversity um so that's one and the other

519
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,240
question is how do we actually uh build

520
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,279
this kind of stuff into not just these

521
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:34,799
uh ad hoc decisions but into really the

522
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,159
fabric of decision- making and that that

523
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:41,000
is our global economic system so uh

524
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,679
talking about here uh work that I did

525
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,720
with Casper HP this is a game that

526
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,120
highlights the ability of ants just like

527
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,919
the ones that we just described to infer

528
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,919
true System state and use it to credibly

529
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,279
incentivize long-term positive outcomes

530
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:00,600
in an externality heavy scenario uh this

531
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,760
team uh we were able to show that it

532
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,600
works even with adversarial bot

533
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,000
strategies uh and even with high

534
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,159
uncertainty and intentional

535
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,640
misinformation so you can actually get

536
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,080
these ends to to work with uh budgets

537
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,120
and incentives to drive decision- making

538
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,240
that internalized externalities and uh

539
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,440
and compensates for collusion and uh uh

540
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,080
generates long-term positive

541
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,400
outcomes uh that's not all there are

542
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,679
other Solutions uh uh that have been

543
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,400
around for longer than hours uh that

544
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,360
apply similar principles to Global

545
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,760
decision- making problems in the real

546
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,080
world at scale this is one case study

547
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,080
from our partners at cognizant that they

548
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,640
developed for the co co pandemic and

549
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,919
this is not using active inance

550
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,360
formalism this is uh combination of

551
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,200
traditional recurrent neuron networks

552
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,559
for prediction and evolutionary

553
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:00,200
optimization for prescription and it's

554
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,480
actually able to achieve some pretty

555
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,720
amazing uh stuff it discovers a Paro

556
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,400
front between uh prevention of cases and

557
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,760
uh uh economic cost it's uh it's also a

558
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,440
showcase for hybrid human AI

559
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,320
intelligence they did an initial version

560
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,919
of this model then they launched an X

561
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:18,440
prise they got a bunch of contributions

562
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,840
for other models and then they did a

563
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,120
meta model uh that discovered a better

564
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,559
burito front and uh even better even

565
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:29,440
better this tool has actually been used

566
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,159
to advise policy in the real world so

567
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,760
it's actually very exciting that uh

568
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,320
we're working with them and connecting

569
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,840
the dots because we need to connect the

570
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,760
dots we need to bring it all together

571
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,159
this uh this illustration here is just

572
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,320
uh I think a subset of the uh effects of

573
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,320
the of the climate change crisis which

574
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,679
is just one aspect of the meta crisis on

575
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:57,760
on humans on our society and the economy

576
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,200
and and uh so we actually need to be

577
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,360
able to deploy solutions that work

578
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,120
across many different domains and to

579
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,240
connect these dots uh this means two

580
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,240
things uh the first is interoperability

581
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,039
aligning decisions across context so

582
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:11,400
that we don't get unintended

583
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,600
consequences and second is reusability

584
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,000
so being able to to transport and

585
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,960
transfer uh learning and structure

586
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,240
across context so for instance using

587
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,440
that evolutionary approach from the from

588
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,320
the co example in in our agricultural

589
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,559
context or in many other possible

590
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:28,320
context

591
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,279
and this takes a form of libraries of

592
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:32,799
components apis and so

593
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,320
forth so uh that's what we're working on

594
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,000
so we're launching this Consortium we

595
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,440
just put up the website a few minutes

596
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,279
ago and uh we have the goal of having a

597
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,600
minimal but functionally complete

598
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,159
implementation by the end of next

599
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:47,960
year uh and this is an open project we

600
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,919
are working on this at our organization

601
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:52,320
called digital guy but we're also

602
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,520
launching this open Consortium that

603
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,039
welcomes uh contributors from anywhere

604
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,399
both active entrance experts and

605
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:02,799
non-experts and uh we need a lot of

606
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,240
contributors we need all of you because

607
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,600
this is uh the most important thing that

608
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,880
we could ever be working on together and

609
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,640
we need your help to tackle the many

610
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,200
remaining challenges so if you want to

611
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,640
help us build the planetary grain please

612
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,440
go to guia consortium. org and or reach

613
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,840
out to me you know where to find me uh

614
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,120
and together we can design build and

615
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,000
learn what it takes to achieve planetary

616
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,440
E Generation thank you

617
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,919
W ra thanks for the great

618
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:35,480
presentation I'll uh post the link to

619
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,919
guy Consortium into the YouTube live

620
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,520
chat but let me get a few quick

621
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,360
questions in so um here we go first uh

622
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,720
question this is

623
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,600
from uh Marco

624
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,679
Lynn

625
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,159
um I agree with the critical importance

626
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:01,320
of such a project how will you deal with

627
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,919
the challenges of scaling given the

628
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:05,559
dependence on real world entities like

629
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:09,039
humans um for dependence on real world

630
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,559
entities like humans for major metac

631
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,240
crisis domains such as geopolitics

632
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,360
social cultural fragmentation and other

633
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,320
particularly hard sense making

634
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,360
domains uh first of all hi Marco yeah

635
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,760
thanks for the question and uh I 100%

636
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,600
agree that uh I'm not claiming that this

637
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,960
is sufficient I'm just claiming that

638
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,480
it's necessary

639
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,520
uh we do have uh a lot of energy that

640
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,600
that a lot of ideas and a lot of energy

641
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,520
that we want to put into exactly what

642
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,880
you described how to uh change the uh

643
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,159
how to weave what we're doing into the

644
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:45,240
existing incentive Landscapes whether

645
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,440
they're Market incentives or policy

646
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,000
incentives But ultimately this needs to

647
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,880
be uh an enabler just needs to meet

648
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,480
people where they are and we need to be

649
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,880
cognizant that change is not going to

650
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,360
happen overnight at least not right now

651
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,520
right typically these things take a take

652
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,399
a while to mature and then they they

653
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:07,159
snap into place and we're already

654
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:09,000
finding some of this happening in some

655
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,440
of the domains that we're working on

656
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,760
where uh nothing happened for a very

657
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,279
long time and then bam hockey stick and

658
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,399
we believe that the same uh can happen

659
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:20,799
in uh in pretty much anywhere so we're

660
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:21,799
very

661
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:24,240
optimistic great what are currently the

662
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,520
greatest challenges for Gaia as an

663
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,720
organization I love that kind of

664
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,520
ambiguous question like is that the guy

665
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,919
Consortium as an organization or is it

666
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:35,360
guy but let's let's hear both what are

667
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,840
the greatest challenges or frictions for

668
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,799
the Consortium and for the bigger

669
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:40,799
picture

670
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,279
too Al so uh I I'm gonna I'm not going

671
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,039
to talk about the the technical stuff

672
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,840
for change I'm going to talk about uh

673
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,760
the the more Mana stuff and it's

674
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,640
actually very related to what uh your uh

675
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,320
previous presentation Daniel about that

676
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,919
paper uh about the Institute talked

677
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:02,720
about and it's really related to to uh

678
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,960
building out this common what we were

679
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,399
calling the common cognitive kernel for

680
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:10,279
for sense making and decision- making

681
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:13,480
and uh relatedly uh breaking through

682
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,399
this uh uh this uh culture of sort of

683
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,159
Suspicion and uh surf Wars and

684
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,919
getting uh you know St people St trying

685
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:27,120
to stake their their claim to something

686
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,200
so we are and always have been uh

687
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,399
extremely open but it's it's kind of

688
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,440
hard anyway to build trust so we

689
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,000
are were aware that it's going to take a

690
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,760
while to build to build this trust with

691
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,760
everybody and uh and I think the only

692
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,799
answer to that is really to be as

693
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,519
participatory and uh and transparent as

694
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:53,519
possible also uh being humble and uh

695
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:56,399
knowing where where where we haven't

696
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,960
where we don't have the answer and uh

697
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,919
asking people to to help

698
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:08,039
us awesome any closing words or

699
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,840

going to hear a lot more about this

704
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,559
Consortium as I said it was just formed

705
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,640

706
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,080
this presentation by the way uh thanks

Steve and everybody else who's been a

709
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,559
part of forming and uh and getting this

710
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:42,919
to getting this ball to start rolling um

711
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:46,720
we are um you know very early stage very

712
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,159
formative and still uh very pliant so uh

we definitely are we would love I I just

714
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,679
gave you like my perspective on on a

715
00:29:56,679 --> 00:29:58,559
bunch of these things the the the shape

716
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,880
of it that that that has come from from

717
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,559
our work on this so far and even not all

718
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,120
of it just piece that we could cover in

719
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,200
20 minutes or so uh but we are we're

720
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,640
very plural we we want to uh engage with

721
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,760
you

722
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,880
on uh on different paths forward

723
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,320
different opportunities to to to build

724
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,679
things to experiment to connect the dots

725
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,080
to learn together and uh ultimately like

726
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,120
we

727
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,760
we really just want to uh provide a

728
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,880
platform a convening space a protocol uh

729
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,000
uh in the classic sense of the world

730
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,120
word of a you know a shared language a

731
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,519
shared means of communication a shared

732
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:43,000
means of understanding to find together

733
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,200
what we need to do to to actually build

734
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,480
this third

735
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,039
